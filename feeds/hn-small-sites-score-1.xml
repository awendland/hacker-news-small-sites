                    <p>Game design is such a wide and varied discipline that job titles in the field have become increasingly granular over the years – and ever since we started working on our debut title Lacuna, I've become more and more convinced that "detective game designer" merits its own denomination as well. Detective gameplay (or "investigation gameplay") poses a number of unique challenges centered around two main problems: the <strong>struggle between story and puzzles</strong> (or "cases") as well as <strong>communication between the player and the game</strong>.</p>
<p>Since some of the explanations will be using our own game as an example, let me give you a quick rundown: Lacuna is a story-driven adventure with platformer controls and investigation elements. Its four fundamental gameplay types are dialogs (with choices), moving around, examining objects, and solving puzzles. All of them are staples of the point &amp; click genre, but their execution is quite unique; I don't want to go into more detail here because it's not pertinent to the topic, but you can <a href="http://lacuna.game/">check out the game on Steam</a> if you want to know more.</p>
<p><img alt="Gameplay" src="https://digitales.games/user/pages/03.blog/detective-game-design-problems/gameplay-movement.gif"><br>
<em>This is what the game looks like</em></p>
<h2>Story vs. puzzles</h2>
<p>A handful of abstract game design principles lie at Lacuna's core. For instance, "no takebacks" dictates that the player only get one shot at every decision, dialog, and puzzle. The game auto-saves and doesn't allow you to go back if you performed poorly or regret an earlier decision. There's also "limited feedback", which means that the player often isn't told immediately whether a solution was correct and what the consequences of their actions and decisions will be.</p>
<p>However, there's one in particular I want to highlight here because it concerns the above mentioned divide between story and puzzling in detective games: <strong>No getting stuck.</strong></p>
<p>The thought process behind it was simple: In games with both a story and puzzles (e.g. most P&amp;C games), story progress is almost always tied directly to puzzle progress. Until you solve the puzzle at hand, you don't get to see the next part of the story. For some players, especially those most interested in the story, this can become a problem. If they're stuck for too long, there's a chance they'll just drop out and never pick the game up again. Even if that doesn't happen, hard puzzles always run the risk of messing up the story's pacing and interrupting your immersion in the game – because you're becoming frustrated or, even worse, because you decide to tab out and Google the solution. To avoid people getting stuck, we considered a number of solutions:</p>
<p><strong>Solution 1: Make the puzzles very easy?</strong><br>
This isn't our favorite since it somewhat defeats the purpose of puzzles. They'd still play a role as a change of pace now and then, but if puzzles aren't a little hard, nobody will feel like a detective solving them. Some early puzzles in Lacuna are easy, but most aren't.</p>
<p><strong>Solution 2: Provide hints?</strong><br>
Hint systems can be found in many adventures featuring puzzles. Unfortunately, they often take the player out of the experience in one of three ways: In some cases, the hint is provided by extradiegetic UI (e.g. in the pause menu) and therefore seems to come out of nowhere in the game world. In other cases, the player character is the one giving the hint, disconnecting the player from their avatar’s perspective. The third option of NPCs providing hints is a little better; however, it is often hard to justify <em>why</em> an NPC would be able to point the player in the right direction without possessing the rest of the solution to the ongoing puzzle (and why they didn't volunteer it in the first place). The two types of (sort-of) hint systems we went with in Lacuna are <em>Highlight Mode</em>, which displays optional outlines around objects and NPCs that hold new information, and <em>redundant information</em>, meaning that sometimes the player is given two ways of obtaining an important clue.</p>
<p><img alt="Hints" src="https://digitales.games/user/pages/03.blog/detective-game-design-problems/solutions-hints.png"><br>
<em>"YOU ARE PLAYING A GAME RIGHT NOW"</em></p>
<p><strong>Solution 3: Decouple story progress from puzzle progress?</strong><br>
Why not simply make a story-driven game throughout which the player can solve the occasional puzzle if they feel like it? Well, because it would require that puzzles be somewhat detached from the story. As a result, they run the risk of feeling meaningless since solving them is not rewarding and failing is not punishing. However, this <em>can</em> work quite well when combined with...</p>
<p><strong>Solution 4: Make branching content for different solutions?</strong><br>
Instead of impeding the player’s progress, wrong or missing puzzle solutions could lead to a less desirable continuation and/or outcome of the story. Unfortunately, creating a new story branch for each and every wrong solution to a puzzle is hardly feasible. However, there are less extreme ways of realizing this. For instance, the game could account for the player’s <em>overall</em> puzzling performance at certain points in the game, e.g. trigger the “good” finale to an act if they got more than x% of the puzzles right, and the “bad” one if not. There could also be cascading consequences of sorts, e.g. solving one case correctly may give the player an edge in a later one. These approaches have similar downsides as optional puzzles do, but to a lesser degree; puzzle success no longer being required for progress makes them feel more detached from the story and removes immediate feedback. Regardless, we have found this to be the best solution, which is why we employ it quite a bit in Lacuna (while trying to avoid all the pitfalls). By the way, if all of this is becoming too abstract for you, bear with us! The second half of this post is all about a real example from the game.</p>
<p><img alt="Detroit: Become Human" src="https://digitales.games/user/pages/03.blog/detective-game-design-problems/solutions-branching-content.jpg"><br>
<em>Detroit: Become Human offers an astonishing number of different outcomes depending on player action, but not everybody has that kind of money to burn</em></p>
<p>Despite all of these measures being taken to make sure that the player won't get stuck, Lacuna can still be called a hard game. While it's not difficult to get <em>to</em> the end, it's pretty difficult to get a <em>good</em> ending and not mess things up on your way there. In other words, rushing through the whole story is possible if you don't mind bringing it to a terrible conclusion.</p>
<h2>Communicating with the game</h2>
<p>While the previous chapter only concerns detective games that also prominently feature a story, this next one is relevant to pretty much every detective game every made. It addresses the topic of communication between the player and the game, and especially how the player can express their thoughts to it. Several principles have proven to make for a good experience across countless approaches to this problem over the years:</p>
<p><strong>Principle 1: Many channels out, few channels back in.</strong><br>
If the game conveys information to the player on many different channels and in many different ways, the process of piecing the solution together tends to feel more interesting and rewarding. In Lacuna, the player picks up clues from dialogs, objects, environments, the news, and e-mails (with all sorts of attachments). At the same time, the channels via which the player communicates that solution back to the game are kept to a minimum, namely cloze texts we like to call "Case Sheets" and (to a lesser degree) dialog choices. Having one or two central mechanics for player input makes the experience more coherent and transparent and facilitates designing the mysteries around it.</p>
<p><img alt="Obra Dinn" src="https://digitales.games/user/pages/03.blog/detective-game-design-problems/solutions-obra-dinn.jpg"><br>
<em>Return of the Obra Dinn by Lucas Pope provides a bunch of different sources of information, but just one central mechanic for the player to communicate back to the game</em></p>
<p><strong>Principle 2: Have the player communicate only the solution.</strong><br>
It is near impossible to create a system through which the player communicates to the game <em>how</em> they arrived at a solution. Luckily, this is not necessary. A well-designed puzzle provides all the information, then moves the entire solution process solely <em>into the player’s head</em>, and finally prompts the player to input only their answer. The player’s objective should be stated clearly, but in a very general way at the start of a case (e.g. “find the culprit”).</p>
<p><strong>Principle 3: Give the player maximum freedom in communicating the solution.</strong><br>
The way in which the player communicates the answer to the game is the most crucial part to get right. One aspect is to give the player many choices (or a large combination of choices) to pick from. Two things should be avoided: 1. Giving the player a high probability to succeed by picking a random answer. 2. Making it easy for the player to guess correctly because only one or a few of the available answers appear plausible. An example for a bad solution like this would be to give the player three dialog choices to solve the puzzle; even worse would be if one of them obviously made the most sense. A better approach would be to give the player a cloze text with a bunch of plausible options for each gap. Another possibility is to have the solution be an unguessable string of characters that the player needs to enter manually. Both ideas utilize combinatorial explosion to make guessing and brute-forcing nearly impossible.</p>
<p><img alt="Detective Grimoire" src="https://digitales.games/user/pages/03.blog/detective-game-design-problems/solutions-case-sheets.jpg"><br>
<em>Good luck brute-forcing your way through Detective Grimoire's cloze texts</em></p>
<h2>Puzzle example</h2>
<p>Hopefullly all this will become crystal clear when put to concrete use! The following is an early level in Lacuna. It doesn't contain some of the difficulties added later (like a large number of channels communicating potential evidence). In harder cases, the player will need to have paid attention to testimonies, news articles etc. from earlier levels to arrive at the correct conclusion, and some cases span multiple levels. Not this one, though; all the information required to solve it is directly contained in the clues and dialogs of the one level where it starts and ends.</p>
<p>This chapter won't reveal much of importance about the story, but it will spoil the solution to this one puzzle, so consider yourself warned.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A primitive data type is a data type for which the programming language provides built-in support. When it comes to framework design, primitive types often refer to the basic building blocks, allowing more complicated composite types to be recursively constructed. Examples such as <code>ndarray</code> in Numpy, <code>tensor</code> in Tensorflow: when writing a Numpy or Tensorflow program, the main object manipulated and passed around is those primitive data types.<a id="more"></a></p><p>What is the primitive data type in Jina then? To many readers and users of Jina, <a href="https://101.jina.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the concept of</a> <code>Executor</code>, <code>Driver</code>, <code>Pea</code>, <code>Pod</code>, <code>Flow</code> should be very familiar. They <a href="https://hanxiao.io/2020/08/02/Layer-of-Abstraction-when-Building-Tensorflow-for-Search/" title="define different abstraction layers">define different abstraction layers</a>, and together they compose the neural search design patterns. Thanks to these Jina idioms, one can quickly bootstrap a cross/multi-modality search system in no time. But are they primitive data types? No. Before <code>v0.8</code>, Jina has <em>no</em> primitive data type: drivers directly work with Protobuf messages for generating or parsing a stream of bytes in the network layer. The figure below illustrates this idea.</p><p><img src="https://hanxiao.io/2020/11/22/Primitive-Data-Types-in-Neural-Search-System/blog-types-01.png"></p><p>I will explain the new <strong>primitive data types</strong> <code>Document</code>, <code>QueryLang</code>, <code>NdArray</code>; and the <strong>composite types</strong> <code>DocumentSet</code>, <code>QueryLangSet</code>, <code>Request</code>, and <code>Message</code> in this blog post. These data types are available since <code>v0.8</code> in the <a href="https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/tree/master/jina/types" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new <code>jina.types</code> module</a>. Primitive data types complete Jinaâ€™s design by clarifying the low-level data representation in Jina, yielding a much simpler, safer, and faster interface on the high-level. Most importantly, they ensure the universality and extensibility for Jina in the long-term.</p><div><p><strong>Jina</strong> is an easier way for enterprises and developers to build cross- &amp; multi-modal neural search systems on the cloud.

User creates it when preparing the input; and its lifetime spans over the entire indexing and searching processes in Jina.</li><li><strong><code>QueryLang</code></strong> is a basic data type for representing the <a href="https://hanxiao.io/2020/08/28/What-s-New-in-Jina-v0-5/" title="query language structure">query language structure</a>. <code>Client</code> can use <code>QueryLang</code> to build filter/sort/select queries and convert <a href="https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/tree/master/jina/drivers/querylang" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from/to <code>QLDriver</code></a>.</li><li><strong><code>NdArray</code></strong> is a basic data type for representing fixed-size multidimensional items of the same type. As the fundamental numeric type in Jina, <code>NdArray</code> is often used to represent <code>embedding</code>, <code>blob</code>, images, audios, texts; and joins the computation of other frameworks such as <code>numpy</code>, <code>tensorflow</code>, <code>pytorch</code>.<ul><li><strong><code>DenseNdArray</code></strong> is a specific data type for the dense representation of a <code>NdArray</code>. Same as <code>numpy.ndarray</code>, it contains values of all elements, the shape and the data type of each element. One can consider it as a <code>numpy.ndarray</code> <em>â€œviewâ€�</em> of the Protobuf data. <code>DenseNdArray</code> also provides a quantization interface to allow lossy compression.</li><li><strong><code>SparseNdArray</code></strong> is a specific data type for sparse representation of a <code>NdArray</code>, where substantial memory requirement reductions can be realized by storing only the non-zero entries. Jina <code>v0.8</code> provides the <code>scipy</code>, <code>tensorflow</code>, <code>pytorch</code> â€œviewsâ€� of the Protobuf data, which can directly join the corresponding frameworkâ€™s computation.</li></ul></li></ul><h4><span id="composite-types">Composite Types</span></h4><p>Besides primitive data types, three new composite types provide boxing on primitive types. This enables a more Pythonic interface and keeps the data safe from outside interference and misuse.</p><ul><li><strong><code>DocumentSet</code></strong> is a mutable sequence of <code>Document</code>. It allows one to slice/modify/add/delete the sequence and iterate over its element via a generator.</li><li><strong><code>QueryLangSet</code></strong> is a mutable sequence of <code>QueryLang</code>. Like <code>DocumentSet</code>, it allows one to slice/modify/add/delete the sequence and iterate over its element via a generator.</li><li><strong><code>Request</code></strong> is a data type for representing the message passing between Pods, <code>Client</code> and <code>Gateway</code>. It contains all data all Pods require, including <code>DocumentSet</code>, <code>QueryLangSet</code> and meta information. <code>Request</code> also provides a lazy interface to the underlying Protobuf data, avoiding unnecessary (de)serialization and (de)compression. The lifetime of <code>Request</code> spans over the entire indexing and searching processes in Jina: it is the first object users send to Jina and the final object retrieved from Jina.</li><li><strong><code>Message</code></strong> is a container of a Protobuf <code>Envelope</code> and the primitive type <code>Request</code>. It is the actual data type passing internally between Jina Pods.</li></ul><p>The next figure illustrates the connections between those data types:</p><p><img src="https://hanxiao.io/2020/11/22/Primitive-Data-Types-in-Neural-Search-System/blog-type-03.png"></p><h2><span id="jina-data-types-in-action">Jina Data Types In Action</span></h2><p>Now letâ€™s look at some examples.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
                
                  <p><img src="https://www.unibo.it/en/images/in-evidenza-piccole/universe/@@images/74a68e4e-af13-4c68-874d-1244b70e7fd2.jpeg" alt="Universe" title="Universe" height="152" width="200"></p><p>In their paper published in <i>Frontiers of Physics</i>, Franco Vazza (astrophysicist at the University of Bologna) and Alberto Feletti (neurosurgeon at the University of Verona) investigated the similarities between two of the most challenging and complex systems in nature: the cosmic network of galaxies and the network of neuronal cells in the human brain.</p>

<p>Despite the substantial difference in scale between the two networks (more than 27 orders of magnitude), their quantitative analysis, which sits at the crossroads of cosmology and neurosurgery, suggests that diverse physical processes can build structures characterized by similar levels of complexity and self-organization.</p>

<p>The human brain functions thanks to its wide neuronal network that is deemed to contain approximately 69 billion neurons. On the other hand, the observable universe can count upon a <i>cosmic web</i> of at least 100 billion galaxies. Within both systems, only 30% of their masses are composed of galaxies and neurons. Within both systems, galaxies and neurons arrange themselves in long filaments or nodes between the filaments. Finally, within both system, 70% of the distribution of mass or energy is composed of components playing an apparently passive role: water in the brain and dark energy in the observable Universe.</p>

<p>Starting from the shared features of the two systems, researchers compared a simulation of the network of galaxies to sections of the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum. The goal was to observe how matter fluctuations scatter over such diverse scales.</p>

<p>"We calculated the spectral density of both systems. This is a technique often employed in cosmology for studying the spatial distribution of galaxies", explains Franco Vazza. "Our analysis showed that the distribution of the fluctuation within the cerebellum neuronal network on a scale from 1 micrometre to 0.1 millimetres follows the same progression of the distribution of matter in the <i>cosmic web</i> but, of course, on a larger scale that goes from 5 million to 500 million light-years".</p>

<p>The two researchers also calculated some parameters characterising both the neuronal network and the cosmic web: the average number of connections in each node and the tendency of clustering several connections in relevant central nodes within the network.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Once again, structural parameters have identified unexpected agreement levels. Probably, the connectivity within the two networks evolves following similar physical principles, despite the striking and obvious difference between the physical powers regulating galaxies and neurons", adds Alberto Feletti. "These two complex networks show more similarities than those shared between the cosmic web and a galaxy or a neuronal network and the inside of a neuronal body".&nbsp;</p>

<p>The encouraging results of this pilot study are prompting the researchers to think that new and effective analysis techniques in both fields, cosmology and neurosurgery, will allow for a better understanding of the routed dynamics underlying the temporal evolution of these two systems.</p>

<p>This study was published in <i>Frontiers of Physics</i> with the title "The quantitative comparison between the neuronal network and the cosmic web”. Its authors are Franco Vazza from the Department of Physics and Astronomy of the University of Bologna, and Alberto Feletti from the Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement of the University of Verona.</p>

In this blog post, we will look at what exactly-once means in the context of distributed pub/sub systems, and the exactly-once guarantees that the <a href="https://www.ably.io/">Ably</a> realtime pub/sub messaging platform provides. Ably often acts as the broker in data streaming pipelines: publishers send messages to our platform, and we deliver these messages to subscribers. As a broker, Ably provides regional &amp; global fault tolerance, which ensures message availability and survivability. We also offer a set of capabilities via SDKs that enable clients to use idempotent publishing, and recover in the event of a failure while resuming precisely where they left off, with no lost or duplicate messages.</p>

</h2>
<p>In the context of distributed <a href="https://www.ably.io/topic/pub-sub">pub/sub</a> systems, exactly-once is a popular concept and a desirable, if not critical, system property. It also leads to confusion and diverging opinions within the development community. On the one hand, some argue that <a href="https://bravenewgeek.com/you-cannot-have-exactly-once-delivery/">exactly-once is simply unachievable.</a> On the other hand, there are systems such as <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#semantics">Kafka that claim to support exactly-once semantics</a>. </p>
<p>We believe that a lot of the confusion around the concept has to do with the fact that there's no clear definition of what exactly-once actually means. It's arguably impossible to come up with a definition to satisfy everyone and every use case. That's because exactly-once can mean different things for different systems and different use cases. Regardless of how you look at it, though, exactly-once is, without a doubt, a distinctively complex engineering challenge. </p>
<p>Let’s now define what exactly-once means for Ably in particular. In our case, exactly-once is a guarantee that once acknowledged, a message published to Ably is <strong>delivered</strong> to a consumer precisely once, even in the context of individual system components failing. Note that most often, Ably is used to deliver messages in real time directly to end-user devices.</p>
<p>It’s crucial to mention that exactly-once is a system-wide property, and you only achieve it if all the constituent components play their part. This doesn’t mean that all the components must display exactly-once characteristics. For example, in our case, you can have a publisher that displays at-least-once behaviour. However, Ably provides an idempotent interface, which cancels out the fact that the producer may occasionally publish messages more than once. As long as at the other end of the pub/sub pipeline each message is delivered to subscribers precisely once, exactly-once behaviour is achieved as a whole.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-messaging-semantics">Types of messaging semantics<br>
</h3>
<p>Before we dive deeper into exactly-once delivery, let’s review the main types of messaging semantics. When a system is fully operational and working as intended, exactly-once delivery is the behaviour you generally expect. However, we must also consider how faults in the pub/sub system or, indeed, clients affect this behaviour. While most components fail independently in a distributed pub/sub system, without directly impacting other components, the overall quality of service can be affected. Depending on how the system behaves when failures do occur, you get several different types of messaging semantics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>At-most-once semantics</strong>. The easiest type of semantics to achieve, from an engineering complexity perspective, since it can be done in a fire-and-forget way. There's rarely any need for the components of the system to be stateful. While it's the easiest to achieve, at-most-once is also the least desirable type of messaging semantics. It provides no absolute message delivery guarantees since each message is delivered once (best case scenario) or not at all.</li>
<li>
<strong>At-least-once semantics. </strong>This is an improvement on at-most-once semantics. There might be multiple attempts at delivering a message, so at least one attempt is successful. In other words, there's a chance messages may be duplicated, but they can't be lost. While not ideal as a system-wide characteristic, at-least-once semantics are good enough for use cases where duplication of data is of little concern, or scenarios where deduplication is possible on the consumer side.</li>
<li>
<strong>Exactly-once semantics</strong>. The ultimate message delivery guarantee and the optimal choice in terms of data integrity. As its name suggests, exactly-once semantics means that each message is delivered precisely once. The message can neither be lost nor delivered twice (or more times). Exactly-once is by far the most dependable message delivery guarantee. It’s also the hardest to achieve.</li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="https://files.ably.io/ghost/prod/2020/11/exactly-once-semantics-messaging-semantics-overview.gif" alt="Overview of message delivery semantics: at-most-once delivery, at-least-once delivery, exactly-once delivery."><figcaption>High-level overview of message delivery semantics</figcaption></figure><p>What most distributed pub/sub systems can genuinely guarantee is <strong>mostly-once </strong>delivery. This means that when the system is functioning as intended, messages are delivered exactly once. However, when failures are involved, there’s always a chance some messages will be delivered either at-most-once or at-least-once.</p>
<h3 id="failures-that-prevent-exactly-once-delivery">Failures that prevent exactly-once delivery<br>
</h3>
<p>To demonstrate just how hard it is for distributed <a href="https://www.ably.io/topic/pub-sub">pub/sub</a> systems to achieve exactly-once semantics, we must talk about failures—specifically, components that can fail and how these failures can be mitigated.<br></p>
<p><strong>Publisher failure</strong></p>
<p>When a publisher fails, some sort of recovery process takes place. Depending on its design, after recovery, the publisher may reattempt to publish a message that has already been sent to and acknowledged by the broker. In such an event, the publisher failure causes at-least-once behaviour. Another scenario is that the publisher’s recovery procedure fails to realise that the publish attempt failed, which leads to at-most-once behaviour. </p>
<p>A strategy often used after a publish failure is to retry publishing the same message a fixed number of times. This is a pragmatic approach, but unsatisfactory in the context of exactly-once. Imagine that the publisher recovers and unsuccessfully tries to republish the same message five times, and then gives up. Practically none of the three semantics is achieved. To mitigate publisher failures Ably supports <a href="https://www.ably.io/topic/idempotency">idempotent publishing</a>, which ensures that regardless of how many times the same message is published to Ably, it will be delivered to subscribers exactly-once. <br></p>
<p><strong>Broker failure</strong></p>
<p>A broker failure has the potential to lead to all sorts of issues, including data loss. That’s why it’s recommended to design your system around the idea of mitigating or preventing loss of data. From a producer perspective, this could mean having the ability to publish messages at-least-once, so they can be resent to the broker if needed. </p>
<p>From a broker perspective (Ably included), let’s start by reviewing what a message ACK means. Obviously, it’s an acknowledgment that a published message has been received. Additionally, it should also imply that no subsequent failure will result in that message not being delivered to subscribers. In other words, it should be an acknowledgment that the broker provides sufficient redundancy to ensure continuity of service and onwards processing, even in the context of multiple infrastructure failures. Of course, nothing can be done to prevent or mitigate certain types of critical failures. When that happens, the sensible thing for the broker to do is to respond with a failure response (with HTTP, this is typically a 5xx status code), indicating clearly to the producer that the publish attempt was unsuccessful. </p>
<p><strong>Subscriber failure</strong></p>
<p>The most common subscriber failure that prevents exactly-once delivery involves short disconnections. For example, a client app on a mobile device will disconnect and quickly reconnect when the user switches from a mobile data network to a Wi-Fi network or goes through a tunnel. To counter this scenario and ensure exactly-once behaviour, the stream of messages must resume precisely where it left off when the subscriber recovers. For this to be possible, the connection state must be persisted and resynced when the subscriber reconnects.</p>
<p>If the broker is the one keeping track of the last message sent, you are unlikely to provide exactly-once semantics. That’s because a broker might send a message, and the subscriber might successfully receive it and then disconnect before sending an ACK to the broker. In such a case, once the subscriber reconnects, the broker will resend the respective message (at-least-once semantics) since it has no way of knowing that the subscriber had received it before disconnecting.</p>
<p>To ensure exactly-once behaviour, the responsibility of keeping track of the last message received should sit with the subscriber - something we also do at Ably, via serial numbers. This way, when the subscriber reconnects, it notifies the broker of the last message it has received so that the stream can be accurately resumed from a point in time.</p>
<h3 id="exactly-once-semantics-use-cases">Exactly-once semantics use cases</h3>
<p>In the world of distributed pub/sub systems, exactly-once semantics has been and continues to be extremely hard to achieve. Equally, almost everywhere you look in software development, exactly-once is a highly desirable system-wide property, if not an essential one. For example, exactly-once is crucial for most transactional messaging use cases. At its core, a transactional message is triggered by a consumer action, and it usually includes necessary or high-priority info, e.g., a bank balance inquiry or an order confirmation. </p>
<p>Ordered operations represent another use case where exactly-once is fundamental. Let’s say you want to use <a href="https://www.ably.io/blog/message-delta-compression/">delta compression</a> to only stream changes from the previous message to subscribers each time there’s an update. To achieve this, you need to use a transport that ensures data integrity through guaranteed message ordering and exactly-once semantics.</p>
<p>If not crucial, exactly-once is at least highly desirable, because it improves overall system predictability and provides better experiences to users in general. For example, …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

So, founder of </span><a href="https://castos.com/"><span>Castos</span></a><span>, you guys are doing about $500,000 in revenue. I know you’ve got some more revenue on top of that, but you know, you sell professional services.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>You only launched in 2017 and you’ve got over 2000 customers. So very great. so let’s start with actually who you are and why did you build a product and how did you grow it?</span></p><p><b>Craig:</b></p><p><span>Yeah. So my name is Craig Hewitt. I’m the founder of </span><a href="https://castos.com/"><span>Castos</span></a><span>. We’re a podcast hosting and analytics platform that also does a podcast editing and production. So that’s kind of our professional services arm.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I got into </span><a href="https://castos.com/"><span>Castos</span></a><span>, kind of via the professional services. I owned and still do a product.service business called </span><a href="https://www.podcastmotor.com/plugin/"><span>PodcastMotor</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>That was kind of my first foray into online business and being a digital nomad, built that up into, you know, a really solid business that sustained kind of my family and I then had the opportunity to acquire a WordPress podcast plugin, which is really kind of how Castos started. So we also own and manage the </span><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/seriously-simple-podcasting/"><span>seriously simple podcasting</span></a><span> WordPress plugin that are our podcasts hosting platform interfaces with.</span></p><p><span>So a lot of people with a podcast have a website, a lot of them run on WordPress. We make it really easy for you to manage all of your podcast content, right from the WordPress site and then upload your files directly to the Castos platform.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>Hammad:</b></p><p><span>All right. So quite a plugin, I’m not going to ask you how much you paid for it, but do they have a lot of users?</span></p><p><b>Craig:</b></p><p><span>Yeah. I mean, WordPress gives you kind of fuzzy statistics, but it had more than 10,000 active installs and like everything and wordpress.org, it was entirely free and still is entirely free.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>You can use a seriously simple podcasting plugin entirely for free. And then we have the </span><a href="https://castos.com/"><span>Castos </span></a><span>platform as an optional add on. So it’s kind of our version of freemium.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>Hammad:</b></p><p><span>Oh, great. That’s a great strategy. So you actually got something which had lots of very targeted customers, users and you only had to build customers behind it. So talk to me about </span><a href="https://castos.com/"><span>Castos</span></a><span>. How did you start building it?&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>Craig:</b></p><p><span>Yeah, I’m laughing because you say you only had to build it.</span></p><p><span>I mean we did get lucky. I mean, it was lucky and strategic to say, yeah, Hey, we can acquire this plugin as a, you know, marketing and customer acquisition channels, was lucky and strategic but, I think building a really great product, especially in our market, which I think is both kind of B2C.</span></p><p><span>So like beat a pro-sumer maybe you would say but also is really, kind of sensitive in that, like it’s the way that people express themselves. So, you know, it’s like maybe a website hosting provider or something like that. You want the experience people to have there to be really easy and simple and beautiful.</span></p><p><span>And so I think building a tool like that is hard and our spaces, probably just as competitive as anyone else’s, but to build a really great product is super hard. Even if you have a marketing channel kind of already figured out, yeah, building a great product is super tough.</span></p><p><b>Hammad:</b></p><p><span>So I actually said it because a lot of people I’ve spoken to, they really struggled with finding their target audience. So they go on LinkedIn on all sorts of different customer acquisition channels. Really sending out cold emails, trying to get them on the phone, talking to them.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So I said it, from that perspective that you had the audience ready and you were able to talk to them probably very quickly, you didn’t have to go and try different things to get them on the call.</span></p><p><span>So of course, building a great product takes a long time. Even with the best customer feedback, you’ll probably end up doing something which is not needed in the marketplace.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So I agree with you, it’s not easy. I’ll probably make it sound very easy, but it’s actually very difficult. Being a software entrepreneur myself. I know it’s very difficult.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>Craig:</b></p><p><span>Yeah for sure. Yeah. I mean, we did have a lot of access to the folks that ended up becoming our first customers and I also came from the space, you know, so running a product as service in the podcasting space is how we got introduced to the guy that we bought the plugin from.</span></p><p><span>We had a bunch of customers that had a presence we’re able to leverage a lot of that audience. You know, we talked about the audience before we started recording.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So I think a lot of that made the marketing and the distribution easier for us. At the beginning, we just focused on the product, which made it a lot easier.</span></p><p><b>Hammad:</b></p><p><span>Let’s talk about product development. What does that look like from day one, till the point where you probably launched your first beta version?&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>Craig:</b></p><p><span>Bad. I mean, I’m not a developer, right? I’m a non-technical founder and I’m a single founder. So, it was me figuring out how to work with a developer and pay them and build a nice product that people care about and have it be easy to use without any experience doing any of that.</span></p><p><span>And, I mean, I laugh looking back at our initial product. It was really terrible compared to what we have now, which I think is really great but that’s how it should be.</span></p><p><span>You know, they say like, if you’re not embarrassed of your first version, you launched too late. we didn’t launch too late in that respect. I mean, the way we did it is I think a nice model for folks if they’re starting out like as a consultant or they own an agency or something like that is use that revenue to pay rent and support your family and stuff like that, but also to fund the development of your software product.</span></p><p><span>And that’s what we did. So we were able to hire a developer part-time. And it took about five months to build a product and to update the WordPress plugin to kind of support that and then we launched, kind of that to existing audiences of WordPress users and very fortunately kind of had customers on the first day which I think is something that not a lot of people do.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We had a kind of major hiccup on the WordPress side with our launch day that kind of broke some people’s sites and stuff. But aside from that, the SAAS side of things, the product launch actually went pretty smoothly.</span></p><p><b>Hammad:</b></p><p><span>Yeah. So when you say launch, did you follow any email sequence? Did you create some hype or you just sent them an email and said, look, okay, we’ve launched this product.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>Craig:</b></p><p><span>Yeah. I think we might have sent an email a couple of days before launch and then sent an email on launch day but we put some things into the WordPress kind of user experience to prompt people and say, Hey, you know, here’s this hosting platform you can opt in here and have your files hosted and manage all of your stuff from WordPress.</span></p><p><span>So a lot of the opt-in of that conversion and like awareness for the customers was kind of natively in WordPress. You have to be careful about that. I think to respect the real estate there and respect the way people use that tool since it is, you know, open-source and free and people don’t want to be bugged there.</span></p><p><span>And I think we do and did a good job of respecting that. But at the same time, putting the value proposition in front of customers in an authentic and genuine way.</span></p><p><b>Hammad:</b></p><p><span>How did the product go from there? So you got like a bunch of customers in the beginning. Straight away. And you got a bunch of users.</span></p><p><span>How did you work with them after that? And how did you get into a point where it’s a great product now?</span></p><p><b>Craig:</b></p><p><span>Yeah. I think that the easy answer is we just listened to everything everybody said and try to distill it down because I think that’s really hard if you’re hearing a bunch of different things and I’ve had failed attempts at other products where everybody is saying something different and you, at the end of the day, you just say like, what is going on here?</span></p><p><span>Like, how are we so far off that. This guy says they need an API. This guy says they need OAuth. This guy says they need a better UI and it’s all over the place.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>You can’t say, this is the thing we need to do. I think maybe we have the volume of feedback, from a bunch of free users of the plugin and very fortunately a decent number of paying users of the hosting platform to say, okay, a bunch of people are asking for this thing, let’s go tackle this.</span></p><p><span>And it was like whack-a-mole right. So like you go to the arcade and you get this game where like the little mole pops up and you whack him on the head and then he comes over here and you whack him on the head over there.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>And that’s, I mean, that’s what we did for an embarrassingly long amount of time, like a year and a half of just like, well, what’s the fire this week.</span></p><p><span>Let’s go put it out. Let’s go fix this thing or create this feature or whatever. But I think we’re pretty agile in that way. Even today, our product development cycles are not super long, but we stay really attuned to what our customers are asking for.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Our support team gives us a lot of really actionable feedback that informs the product decisions and product cycle.</span></p><p><span>And, we’re not an old enough company. You know, we’re not base camp to say like, Hey, we’re going to …</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div>

	<h3>Facebook is facing a new wave of criticism for providing a platform for a white supremacist network with over 80,000 online followers.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Facebook only removed these pages after being contacted by large media organisation the <em>Observer</em>. The Center for Countering Digital Hate claim they were made aware of this two years ago.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Guardian reports this Neo-Nazi network also has ties to the UK far right, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/nov/22/facebook-condemned-for-hosting-neo-nazi-network-with-uk-links" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">including a student facing terrorism charges</a>. Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;“Facebook’s leadership endangered public safety by letting Neo-Nazis finance their activities through Facebook and Instagram. Facebook was first told about this problem two years ago and failed to act.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After the <em>Observer</em> contacted Facebook, they began taking down the material with a Facebook spokesperson stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We have removed the content which violates our policies prohibiting dangerous organisations.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1558555673829_15502"><div><h2>The Ventanas Mexico website runs on a Squarespace platform. Squarespace recently added a feature that enables me to see what queries lead people to my site by keywords.&nbsp; Given I write about dozens of topics related to Mexico, imagine my surprise to see the keywords leading people to my site were Zytiga, Embril, and Humira. The names of expensive drugs.</h2><p>I felt terrible that I had not delivered on those queries, as I had only posted the U.S. prices of drugs in the context of demonstrating the excesses of the American healthcare system.&nbsp;</p><p>Now that I know people are seeking this information out and running into my site, I’ve taken some time to research what the most expensive drugs in the U.S. cost in Mexico, starting with those most commonly used by people over 50 years old.&nbsp; &nbsp;Even if you're not yet in the market for these drugs, I'm sure you'll find the list enlightening.</p><p>This information is not available to you in the U.S. without a Virtual Private Network (VPN). The reasons are probably no more nefarious than the Google algorithms behind them.&nbsp;</p><p>Google searches (and I would assume other search engines) are location-based. While that’s great when you are looking for a dry cleaner, it’s not so good when you are doing research for information like drug prices in another country.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1558556648706_18811"><div><p>The best way to access this information is by using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to hide your location from search engines.&nbsp; With a VPN you choose what server you want to use. When I had a VPN in Mexico last year, I chose a Denver server to prevent my searches from coming up local and in Spanish.</p><p>In this case, to access the information about drug prices in Mexico or another country, you would need to choose a server in the country of choice and do the query in that language. Being in Mexico already, I didn’t need a V.P.N. All I needed to do was ask, “Cuanto cuesta Zytiga en Mexico.”&nbsp; If I were in the States seeking the information, I'd choose a server in Mexico, and do my searches in Spanish just to be sure.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1533001011992_99855"><div><p>The prices you see in the list below are what the drugs cost from major drug wholesalers in Mexico. The packaging and trademark information is identical (other than being in Spanish).</p><p>If the price isn’t listed beside a drug name, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s not available. It may be distributed only by hospitals or doctors.</p><p>I was surprised how much the U.S. prices have fluctuated since I originally looked them up a year or so ago. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/are-you-kidding-me-check-out-price-tags-combination-drugs-n1049276">Here</a> is a 2019 article on the cost of combination drugs.</p><p>If I've written only "Mexico" beside the drug, it means the price wasn't available in a simple search.</p><p>If there is a particular drug you want me to check that is not on this list, email me at kerryinmexico@gmail.com.&nbsp; I'll do my best.</p><p><strong>Drug &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-6318552918068859153" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>I read this tweet yesterday and it struck a chord.</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Heard this today from a coach, and resonated: stop chasing being liked by everyone, start chasing being respected by everyone.</p>— Akshay Kothari (@akothari) <a href="https://twitter.com/akothari/status/1329652910204981250?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2020</a></blockquote> <p>I'm somewhat soft at work and avoid ruffling feathers, so this resonated with me. Being liked feels good and has definitely helped me build trust and support. But I find that when I'm mainly driven by wanting to please or not offend people, I end up making suboptimal or unprincipled decisions that make me unhappy and unsuccessful in the long run.&nbsp;</p><p>People have various reasons to like or dislike you. Many of these reasons are selfish, irrational, short-term and finicky. Putting your self-worth, purpose and actions at the whims and fancies of the black box of being liked is an unclear and volatile approach. The reasons to like or dislike are often at odds with other people's and even your welfare, principles and goals. So aiming to be liked doesn't lead to the best outcomes.&nbsp;</p><p>I'll go a step further from this tweet and say that <i>don't even aim to be respected</i>. Even though chasing respect may be in some ways better because respect can be slightly more rational, principled, long-term or outcome based, it has the same core problems as chasing being liked.&nbsp;</p><p><b>So what is the alternative? Chase your principles and goals.&nbsp;<span></span></b></p><p>The core idea behind Stephen Covey's 7 Habits of Success People is to be "Principle centered" rather than centering around People, Self, Family, Money, Health etc.&nbsp;</p><p>That means you define (and periodically revise) your principles and goals. Then you aim to live with <i>integrity</i> - your thoughts, words, actions match your values, principles and goals. You can and may likely have to still be humble, empathetic, respectful and supportive of others while pursuing those, but you may not make all people happy and that's okay.&nbsp;</p><p>Being principle-centered will mean being opinionated, saying no and disagreeing with people, that may make people dislike you. There's a chance that some of them may respect you in long-run because they see that you are independent, principled and successful. But most importantly, you live with the happiness of working on what you control, chasing self-created and steady goals, and the satisfaction and certainty of being true to your core principles and living the life you want.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We get upset and unhappy about many things.&nbsp;</p><p>Your manager or customer criticized your work. Your colleagues aren't being thoughtful or cooperating. You didn't get the promotion, award, or raise you wanted or think you deserved.&nbsp;</p><p>Your parents, wife, friends or kids are asking you to do things you don't want to or misunderstand you. They don't act in a way that you feel is right or helpful.&nbsp;</p><p>You are running low on savings and income, and worried that you can't support yourself and your family. You are in physical pain or your health is declining and you have unusual body aches and insomnias.&nbsp;</p><p>Your country or community is divided. The system seems broken, leaders are corrupt, people are selfish and ignorant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>All of these worries and unhappiness are rooted in these four root causes.&nbsp;</p><p>1. <b>Judgement instead of Acceptance</b>. You don't accept reality as it is. You lament it, you disagree with it, you think it's unfair or it sucks. You expect and wish it to be different or better.&nbsp;</p><p>Why did you have those expectations in the first place? Why did you think people, your environment, your mind and body are going to be just the way you want them to? Who told you that life is all rainbows and butterflies.</p><p>You can hope, plan and work towards an ideal reality in the future. But your current reality is what is is. Don't judge it, regret it, or deny it. Love it, embrace it, understand it, then play and work with it. <a href="http://www.aswathkrishnan.com/2020/08/life-is-improv-create-great-scenes.html" target="_blank">Life is an improv</a>&nbsp;show - you don't control the scenes, you accept and act in them.&nbsp;</p><p>2. <b>Attachment instead of Openness</b>. You want something or don't want to lose something you have. You decide to be unhappy until you get that and worried whenever they are uncertain or even slightly threatened.&nbsp;</p><p>You have no idea about why you were born, what life is about and you know you will eventually die and be absolutely forgotten. So what are these wants and where do these come from? Are they worth the constant unhappiness and anxiety?</p><p>We can't all live like monks with no wants or attachments. But pick your attachments consciously and limit it to a few meaningful one - don't just pick them up unconsciously.&nbsp; When you have a negative emotion, think about it, uncover the underlying attachment and eliminate it. Be flexible with your wants and <a href="http://www.aswathkrishnan.com/2019/10/peace-and-joy.html" target="_blank">go with the flow</a>. Everything is impermanent.&nbsp;<span></span></p><p><b>3. Negativity and Hate instead of Optimism and Love. </b>You assume things and people are worse than they are. You cave in to comparison, greed, envy or jealousy. You think, say and act on these negativities. They make you more upset and act more negatively, which makes the situation even worse.&nbsp;</p><p>Accept the nature of people and the world as they are. Everyone's Be a well wisher and give everyone a benefit of the doubt.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2213281878057251230/6895673630879853860" target="_blank">Don't assume malice, when it could be misunderstanding</a>, ignorance or incompetence. This doesn't mean that you have to be naive and be taken advantage of. Hold your principles, work with situation as they are, choose to be around people and situations that align with your values.&nbsp;</p><p><b>4. Nature instead of Practice. </b>You expect to be happy and balanced by default, without consistent effort. You get out of the rut once or twice, experience clarity, and expect that to last forever.&nbsp;</p><p>We are survival machines. Our biological programming, innate nature and societal influence will always bias us towards worry, insecurity, and wanting. Our equilibrium is to be unhappy.&nbsp;</p><p>Just like you don't expect to be muscular if you don't work out regularly, don't expect to be calm and happy if you don't work on your mind. Move your body often to move your mind. Take time to relax and to do things you enjoy. Share your situation and get help from a therapists, coaches or friends. Be intentional about your life philosophy, goals, people and environment. Practice regular meditation, gratitude, and reflection.&nbsp;</p><p>You got one life - cherish it and live it well!&nbsp;</p>

November 22, 2020 | https://thegreencodes.com/data-structures-the-linear-non-primitives | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://thegreencodes.com/data-structures-the-linear-non-primitives">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>On our first set of data structures, we get into the definition and scope of non-primitive structures. Have a look at the previous read on  <a target="_blank" href="https://thegreencodes.com/the-power-of-data-structures">The Power of Data structures</a> in case you feel a little lost. Right off the batt, we define what it means to be a non-primitive set, and how this can be further broken down.</p>
<p>Let's get right into it. A non-primitive structure is what happens when you combine two or more primitives. What we mean is simple. A <code>char</code> and  <code>int</code> , for instance,  are primitives. The simplest representations of data. </p>
<p>Broadly speaking, linear non-primitives can be grouped further as below:</p>
<h2 id="linear-non-primitives">Linear non-primitives</h2>
<ul>
<li>Stacks</li>
<li>Queues</li>
<li>LInked lists</li>
<li>Arrays</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, as stated before, data is sequential - one after another. Some of these structures might <a target="_blank" href="https://thegreencodes.com/memory-management-deep-and-shallow-copying">ring a bell</a>, stackify, is that you?. </p>
<h3 id="arrays">Arrays</h3>
<p>These are what we call stores of homogenous (meaning similar) data. So one might have an array like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>my_array</span> = [<span>1</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>3</span>,<span>4</span>,<span>5</span>,<span>6</span>,<span>7</span>,<span>8</span>,<span>9</span>] 

<span>vowels</span> = [<span>' a'</span>, <span>'e'</span>, <span>'i'</span> , <span>'o'</span>, <span>'u'</span> ] 
</code></pre><p>Note how <code>my_array</code> has only integers while <em>vowels</em> has <em>char</em>. In both instances, our array has a collection of primitives - <strong>one type of primitive per array</strong>. </p>
<p>Arrays are of a fixed size. Once declared, the computer knows the amount of memory reserved for items to be stored there.  You might ask:</p>
<p><em>"But what if the type of data I have changes in size greater than the array?" </em></p>
<p>Well, you might need to consider a different type of structure to store this data. 
Use arrays, for instance, to store months of the year. We will not be changing this count anytime.</p>
<p>Above declared, the sizes of the arrays are inferred. Meaning the types, since not defined per se, are  'figured out' based on the values and how we use them.</p>
<p>We might as well have this:</p>
<p>For python.</p>
<pre><code>
<span>import</span> array

count_down = array.array(<span>'i'</span>, [<span>5</span>,<span>4</span>,<span>3</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>1</span>])


</code></pre>
<p>Types may go on as:</p>
<p><code>c</code> for <em>char</em>
<code>f</code> for <em>float</em>
<code>d</code> for <em>double</em>
<code>u</code> for <em>unicode</em> and so forth.</p>
<p>Have a look at the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html?highlight=arrays">documentation</a> for more insight into this. AS well, take note that the <code>array module</code> has different functions to enable array manipulation.</p>
<p>Rust:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>let</span> count_down: [<span>i32</span>; <span>5</span>] = [<span>5</span>,<span>4</span>,<span>3</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>1</span>];


</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Important pointer:
    Python lists and arrays are not the same!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Operations on an array will be based on the <code>index</code> of the array element, with indexing starting from <em>0</em>. Hence, the first item, in either case, would be:</p>
<pre><code><span>count_down</span><span>[0]</span>
</code></pre><p>The result from the above is 5 (the semi-colon has been left out for brevity but should be used based on the language you are using).</p>
<p>Let's take a look at another structure that looks similar, but is not the same - <strong>Linked lists</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="linked-lists">Linked lists</h3>
<p>Unlike arrays, linked lists store data in a non-contiguous form. This implies one piece of data is not placed side by side to the other as: <code>[1,2,3,4,5]</code>, rather it is stored in form of nodes with pointers to the next as so:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>[data1, pointer_to_data2]</span> ...  <span>[data1, pointer_to_data3]</span> ... <span>and</span> <span>so</span> <span>on</span>
</code></pre><p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605257211148/M0hJg9a9v.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="linked_list.png"></p>
<p>The last item in our linked list, since there is no pointer to the next, would have <code>null</code>. </p>
<p>As well, linked lists are dynamic-  their size is not fixed at initialization. </p>
<p>Linked lists will be further broken to:</p>
<p>a) Singular linked lists (used in the elaboration of linked lists above)</p>
<p>b) Circular linked lists</p>
<p>c) Doubly linked lists</p>
<h4 id="circular-linked-lists">Circular linked lists</h4>
<p>These have three items in a node: the previous data, the data, and finally, the next data in the sequence.</p>
<pre><code><span>[null, data1, pointer_to_data2]</span> ...  <span>[pointer_to_data_1 ,data1, pointer_to_data3]</span>
</code></pre><p>The first item (the head), has a <code>null</code> as the previous pointer while the last node has <code>null</code> on the next pointer.</p>
<h4 id="doubly-linked-lists">Doubly linked lists</h4>
<p>Similar to circular linked lists, these have two pointers as well. The only difference would be the last node, instead of a <code>null</code>, has a pointer back to the first item in the list. 1 + 1 = circular.</p>
<p>In most of what we implement through code, we have implementations of linked lists. You will hardly get yourself doing this manually, but understanding that some of the things we call 'mutable arrays ' are actually implementations or wrappers around more complex structures.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>
If navigating through my directory, my computer needs to know where I am, where I'm from, and possibly have the correct link/structure to the nested directory I'm navigating to. So to the top-level directory, I cannot go any higher, no previous node. Likewise to the last directory or file, there is no 'next' option.</p>
<p>Till now, we have come to understand the importance of data structures, the groups they have been placed into, and we have an idea of what some of the linear data structures involved. We could go on and on on the details of each, but that is a tale for another day. A breather for us both at this point.  Go read something non-algorithm-like for a moment. We'll still meet here, same time,  same drive. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>TLDR: Inline abstractions and simplify logic to write better code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Programmer’s work today is based on different levels of abstractions in the form of APIs and modules, they hide large amounts of implementation details so we can build features and products without understanding every detail. However, abstractions also increase the complexity of our code. Lots of time I struggle with overly complex code and try to fix those pieces by removing unnecessary abstractions. But how can we tell the abstraction is good or bad? How much abstraction in the code is too much? This article will be focusing on some of my views about abstraction and complexity in programming.</p>
<h2 id="Power-of-abstraction"><a href="#Power-of-abstraction" title="Power of abstraction"></a>Power of abstraction</h2><p>Abstraction is the building block of programmer today, it free programmer from massive details of complexity, without it we will still be writing machine code, for examples: </p>
<ul>
<li>Python and Ruby is an abstraction layer running on C interpreter</li>
<li>C is a layer on instruction set.</li>
<li>Rails provide multiple abstraction layers like MVC (model-view-controller), ORM (ActiveRecord, object-relation mapping)</li>
<li>React hide DOM updates into declarative components and state.</li>
</ul>
<p>In those examples, the abstractions provide a huge benefit by encapsulating details and provide a high level syntax or API to let people understand and use it.</p>
<h2 id="Essential-and-accidental-complexity"><a href="#Essential-and-accidental-complexity" title="Essential and accidental complexity"></a>Essential and accidental complexity</h2><p>Although abstraction is a really powerful tool, it also has its limitation.</p>
<p>In the paper “<a href="http://worrydream.com/refs/Brooks-NoSilverBullet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No Silver Bullet</a>“, it defines the software complexity into 2 parts. Essential complexity and accidental complexity.</p>
<p>Essential complexity is the complexity inherent from the problem domain. Including the mutation of state, condition, the order of procedure, and messaging. All other complexities from the language, framework, or stack are accidental. The line between those 2 complexities might vary, but basically, you can solve the problem with different languages, different software, but the essential - the algorithm and logic to solve the problem - can not be reduced. For example, you can write the quicksort in C, python, Haskell, or even pseudo-code. The essential complexity of quicksort still stays the same. Therefore no matter how much the technology of tooling improves, there is still no silver bullet to solve the essential complexity issue to increase the productivity of programmers.</p>
<h2 id="Problem-of-abstraction"><a href="#Problem-of-abstraction" title="Problem of abstraction"></a>Problem of abstraction</h2><p>Abstraction is a useful tool to reduce accidental complexity, but it also has several drawbacks:</p>
<ol>
<li>It can not reduce essential complexity. </li>
</ol>
<p>Although abstraction can largely reduce accidental complexity, make the code closer to the problem domain by providing higher-level syntax and API. However, the problem domain still inherits the complexity from the real world. Abstraction can not make it simpler. </p>
<ol start="2">
<li>It increases accidental complexity.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a tricky part because abstraction is not essential for solving the problem. Any extra abstractions are increasing accidental complexity. But then how the abstraction decrease complexity? By enough usage of it. A higher-level abstraction can represent multiple lower-level concept together. So with more usage, it can encapsulate more details and make the code focus on essential complexity but not accidental. So with the growth of the problem domain, the complexity with abstraction will grow like this: <img src="http://neethack.com/2020/10/Abstraction-and-essential-complexity/pic1.png" alt="pic1">. </p>
<p>At the beginning of the graph, it will increase more complexity. For example, we can create the acronym “ECAC” to represent those 2 types of complexity. If I only use this acronym once in this post, it only makes this more complicated because the acronym is not essential. However, if this article got widely accepted, we might be able to call our colleague “you should look at the ECAC for your code” Then it make the conversation simpler.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>It might be wrong or misleading.</li>
</ol>
<p>Abstractions are not essential, so in the worst case, it might not be correct and misleading. This graph shows how complexity grows with wrong abstractions. <img src="http://neethack.com/2020/10/Abstraction-and-essential-complexity/pic2.png" alt="pic2"></p>
<p>If an abstraction does not have enough usage to cover the extra complexity introduced. It only makes to code more complicated. Or the abstraction might not be able to successfully hide lower-level details, and users even have to bypass the abstraction. Both of those cases make the abstraction increasing accidental complexity rather than decrease it.</p>
<h2 id="Reduce-complexity"><a href="#Reduce-complexity" title="Reduce complexity"></a>Reduce complexity</h2><p>Then how can we properly reduce the complexity of our code? Here’s are a couple of suggestions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make reducing essential complexity the priority</li>
</ol>
<p>Because unlike abstractions, a better algorithm is basically, better.</p>
<p>The way I use to estimate is by inline most of the abstractions in our problem domain to see procedures, conditions, messaging, and state mutations. And try to make those steps simpler, like removing redundant steps, changing the order to remove conditions, and remove unnecessary states. </p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Always evaluate multiple solutions</li>
</ol>
<p>Sometimes it is really hard to evaluate the changes are worth it or not, Therefore evaluate multiple solutions is a good guideline. We can find what is essential in different solutions, And follow Occam’s Razor principle: the simplest solution usually is the best solution.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Reorganize, inline, and rename code</li>
</ol>
<p>With those methods we can reduce extra abstractions and reduce accidental complexity, Also help you understand the logic and find a better algorithm.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Rule of three</li>
</ol>
<p>A basic rule to introduce abstraction is to wait until you have 3 usages. It might vary but that is the least case for the abstraction to be useful.</p>
<h2 id="Example"><a href="#Example" title="Example"></a>Example</h2><p>Here I am going to reuse the example in Sandi Matz’s talk: <a href="https://youtu.be/XXi_FBrZQiU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polly want a message</a>, In this talk, Sandi explains how object-oriented and abstraction can simplify a project that read a file and print line numbers, here is the source:</p>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-83d26a75802dd2ca90d0"><div><p><span><strong><em>Chapter One: The Past </em></strong></span></p><p>Disney is the envy of every media company, regardless of whether it focuses on film, TV, gaming, music or publishing. In plain terms, there has never been a more dominant entertainment company, globally or in the US. It has a brand that actually matters to consumers, owns franchises that consumers essentially treat like subscription content services, and operates the biggest star-making platforms in the world. And as strong as this platform was at the start of 2019, it exited the year even stronger. In a matter of weeks, Disney’s brand new direct-to-consumer platform acquired 30MM subscribers.</p><p>The deeper we get into the digital era, the more dominant Disney seems to become. After all, it was long expected that the Internet would disrupt dominant media companies and IP via rights infringement and the emergence of myriad user-generated “franchises”. However, one of the biggest storytelling “lessons” in the 20th and early 21th century was that audiences have an unending desire for “more” of the stories they <em>already </em>love. And the Internet has enabled this to an unprecedented degree. You can constantly track production (cast Instagrams, behind-the-scenes featurettes, and leaks on social media), engage in fan communities (message boards and YouTube theory/Easter egg videos), consume endless amounts of fan content (e.g. fanfic and watch-along podcasts), play this content back on demand (e.g. Netflix), and engage in never-ending and constantly updated online multiplayer games (e.g. Star Wars: Battlefront 2). This is a powerful, self-sustaining financial and cultural flywheel. And Disney has many of the franchises that best lend themselves to this model. Many of those they don’t own, such as <em>Harry Potter</em>, have their rights fragmented.</p><p>But what is the strongest, most profitable, most defensible part of Disney’s business in the digital era? Its capex-heavy, physical theme parks.</p><p>There is no simple way to quantify how important this business unit is to Disney. The financial role is obvious. Disney’s Parks &amp; Attractions segment generates nearly 100% more revenue and 60% more profit than Disney’s studio division (which already generates nearly three times the revenue AND three times the gross <em>margins </em>as its primary competitors). By turning hit films into theme park attractions, not only does Disney generate more “upside” from a hit than its competitors do, Disney’s breakeven point for these films is also much lower. But the parks are much more than this direct financial benefit. There is nothing that can compare to the impact of a child being hugged by her heroes. The ability to enjoy your favorite IP as “you” is unique and lasts a lifetime. Consider, for example, how many families have Disneyland photos of their kids with Mickey or Woody on the fridge. Or how many of these kids have kept those photos decades later (and compared them to their eventual spouse’s version of that same photo).</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1583704876360_17902"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1583704876360_24796"><div><p>And because of real estate scarcity, lengthy build times, enormous capital requirements (exacerbated by<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol's_cost_disease"> Baumol’s Cost Disease</a>), Disney’s theme parks, resorts, and cruises are incredibly difficult to replicate by another Western media company. It would take twenty years and tens of billions of dollars for AT&amp;T/WarnerMedia to receive permits, design attractions, and build a fully operational theme park, for example (and it’d probably be in the middle of nowhere). It’s especially hard to imagine all of this occurring while the company is investing tens of billions per year into HBO Max, new 5G network infrastructure, and maintenance capex (while also sustaining tens of billions in dividends and debt service, and fending off agitated investors). Comcast/Universal has an ambitious plan to grow its parks footprint, including new resorts in Russia, South Korea, and Singapore. However, these will take years and tens of billions of dollars. Purely comping the number of parks also overlooks the scale differential. Disney’s Orlando resort, for example, is over 25,000 acres (half used). Universal Studios Orlando is barely 500. In addition, Disney operates four cruise ships (another three are due by 2023), while no competitor does. Overall, Disney’s theme parks business generates more than $26B per year with 175MM+ visitors, compared to 6B for Universal Studios, with 50MM.</p><p>However, the defensibility and value of these businesses goes beyond physical and financial barriers to entry; running a successful theme park means far more than designing a fun ride. Giving real hugs to kids is incredibly dangerous — doing this reliably, safely, and positively millions of times per year requires enormous training (the parks also operate hospitals, pet day care and police services, too!). In addition, these parks must cater to a wide variety of different customers with different needs, physical capabilities, and developmental maturity. In contrast, a film or TV show has only one version that lasts forever and is infinitely repeatable with 100% consistency. There is no other “medium” in the entertainment industry that requires melding more art forms (e.g. live performance, set design, music, engineering) with a smaller margin for error, and at such a great scale. The benefit, though, is a rich, hard to replicate and intimate understanding of the consumer.</p><p>The competitive consequences are profound and only growing. Fans simply cannot enjoy DC or Lord of the Rings or Dragon Ball the way they do Disney’s Princesses, Pixar, most recently, Star Wars, and soon, the Avengers franchises. This fundamentally limits a franchise’s ability to grow love — the lifeblood (and profit driver) of all IP-based companies.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1583703445914_105588"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1583703445914_134473"><div><p>This is why brands like 20th Century Fox and WarnerMedia license their theme park IP from super-popular brands like <em>Avatar</em>, <em>The Simpsons</em>, and <em>Harry Potter</em> to their competitors, Disney and Universal. Nintendo also partnered with Universal for its theme park rights. This extension is strategically important and financially valuable, but it’s also quite costly. The rights owner, for example, neither owns the customer relationship nor do they deliver the end-customer experience (in a weird way, Universal has a closer relationship with <em>Harry Potter</em> fans than WarnerMedia does). In addition, the majority of associated profits go to the park operator — who also gets to intermingle their IP and draft off the popularity of their competitors’ franchises, too. That’s risky in an age where franchises and <a href="https://www.matthewball.vc/all/disneylessons">clarity of franchise ownership is key</a>.</p><p>So, as we embrace the digital era, it’s funny to consider the enduring and durable significance of the analogue theme parks business. It is incredibly profitable and will continue to grow as new mobile technology/personalization enhance the park-going experience. The barriers to replication are incredibly high and span both fixed investment (land and infrastructure) and skillset (e.g. design and boots-on-the-ground operations). It also offers an intimate understanding of the consumer, is particularly potent when connected to an IP flywheel, and is able to constantly renew its appeal through new attractions and updates.</p><p><span><strong><em>Chapter Two: The (Start of the) New Theme Parks</em></strong></span></p><p>These parks exist and thrive because of our desire to be “inside a living story”. This was Walt’s primary goal with Disneyland: to go beyond passive consumption and into active immersion. Consider the following quote from one of Disney’s chief Imagineers: </p><blockquote><p><em>“Disneyland is an experience involving many moving parts in harmony, like an orchestra. Everything has to be tuned, what you hear, what you smell, what you see, how you see it, the speed at which you assimilate all of that, just like a film, is choreographed. But how do you choreograph that if you don't control the camera, because the camera is you — it's you when you come to Disneyland".</em></p></blockquote><p>This idea of agency is key. There’s only so much time one can spend in a physical or virtual world as a pre-defined character. That doesn’t mean we want to remain an exact replica of our “IRL” selves — we might want to be taller, or blue, or metal, and so on. But when you’re <em>specifically </em>Iron Man, there are limits to what you can look like, how you can behave, what you can do or be, where you can go, and how long it makes sense to be there. After all, you can’t actually be Iron Man, just pretend to be. And certainly, it doesn’t make sense if all of your friends are all Iron Man, too.</p></div></div><div data-block-json="{&quot;cache_age&quot;:&quot;3153600000&quot;,&quot;authorUrl&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/DonaldMustard&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:550,&quot;resolveObject&quot;:&quot;Tweet&quot;,&quot;html&quot;:&quot;<blockquote class=\&quot;twitter-tweet\&quot;><p lang=\&quot;en\&quot; dir=\&quot;ltr\&quot;>In Fortnite you will always be you.

		<p>This is a piece about the loss of skills — even ones that are marks of great beauty and mastery — due to a change in environment.</p>
<p>It’s an extreme example but a fun one to think through: who would play a Stradivarius violin in interstellar space?</p>
<p>As a way to think through an extreme environmental (not meaning climate here) change, I make the assumption that in coming centuries, whether one, five, or 10, humans will become an interstellar or extrasolar species. That is, some part of humanity will cease living in this solar system, and will instead live on other planets, space ships, or other artificial homes. <strong>I count that assumption as the less interesting part of this post and instead focus on the unintended consequences caused by a dramatic change in environment.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s think through what happens to a specific type of human mastery (and by extension, a framework to apply to many others) as humans make extreme choices (like leaving earth).</p>
<p><em>Q: Who will play the Stradivarius in interstellar space or on extrasolar planets? A: No one. Longer answer below.</em> <span id="more-947"></span></p>
<p>Today, on earth, many people achieve mastery in some skill.</p>
<p>We can include “common” skills such as learning your native language to fluency and skills that are innate, like learning to walk. The rarer skills I consider here require more concerted effort to acquire.</p>
<p>Types of skills in demand are plentiful but change over time. Some skills used to be mainstream but are now niche or largely lost except in small isolated groups, such as navigation by stars, foraging, or making clothing from scratch. Bringing those skills back to an <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/acquiring-ignorance/">ignorant</a> larger population would not make sense today. Some skills are preserved by small niches of people within families or initiates (such as Chinese <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwfGdJIzYZs">“face changing” or bian lian</a>). Some are preserved widely by those who opt in by putting in the work, such as chess, forms of painting and ceramics, and musical performance.</p>
<p><strong>For some of the skills with modern masters, leaving earth will mean that future humans will neither preserve those skills, nor be able to acquire them even if they wanted to.</strong></p>
<p>I chose music because it is an enduring human behavior, unlikely to disappear. I chose Stradivarius violins because they represent mastery in physical instrument construction and rarity.</p>
<p>With only 650 instruments remaining (around 500 violins) and <a href="http://www.stradivarius.org/price/">often sold</a> for prices in the millions, I make the assumption that people who typically play a Stradivarius violin are violin masters whether or not they own the instrument themselves.</p>
<p>Here are examples related to the acquisition and maintenance of skill mastery, as demonstrated on a Stradivarius. In interstellar space.</p>

<p>Acquiring mastery in an uncommon skill takes uncommon effort.</p>
<p>It takes so much effort that acquiring an uncommon skill often also requires family and economic support. A small percentage of those who play the violin will pursue the instrument for over a decade of focused study and practice to have a chance to attain a level of mastery.</p>
<p>Those future interstellar humans’ new environment may not allow for them to put in that uncommon effort. Or, just as dangerous, where today there is a community of masters to practice and play with, in the future interstellar state, there may be so few masters that a string quartet is never possible. Less humans to practice and play with is probably assured.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://infogalactic.com/info/The_Dark_Forest">ravine-like</a> global crash that eliminates all violin players, teachers, and even knowledge of classical music is a possibility. What happens when there is no place to which the players can escape, survive, and continue until the situation improves? The ravine impacts violinists regardless of location.</p>
<p>Without a continual string of teachers and students, mastery becomes mystery and impossible to acquire. With effort put on making humans interstellar, will there be energy left for mastery of the violin?</p>

<p>Life in interstellar environments may not allow people to maintain an extreme practice regimen or to build excellent finger dexterity. There’s just no excess capacity to do so. They could in theory acquire the skills but never have time or physical capability.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol%27s_cost_disease">Baumol’s Cost Disease</a> explains why certain types of work become more expensive over time. “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110724151936/http://publishing.eur.nl/ir/repub/asset/782/TOWSE%20EBOOK_pages0103-0113.pdf">It takes four musicians as much playing time to perform a Beethoven string quartet today as it did in 1800</a>.” That’s without considering the amount of time to acquire mastery in playing the instruments.</p>
<p>In an interstellar society, while people may have excess free time, learning to play with mastery excludes people from other, more productive activities. Spending years to become a violinist has an opportunity cost that could be more extreme than today. Longer lifespans might shift that somewhat.</p>

<p>It’s possible that skill acquisition advances beyond current imagination make it possible for novices to become masters overnight. If that happens and future humans value violin mastery, then perhaps it is more likely to see violin masters in the future, whether in interstellar environments or earth.</p>

<p>It will certainly be possible to build a robot with equal or better manual dexterity to a human. So in the future, even if there is a ravine, perhaps the robots will be preferred as violinists and will play every Strad. Why risk the instruments in human hands?</p>

<p>Why listen to live performances if, at least for classical music, there are no masters around to play live or they are worse than high-quality immersive recordings (or robots)?</p>
<p>It’s possible that future violinists play mostly for themselves.</p>

<p>Music has a shelf life. It’s long for some genres and pieces and short for others. The status quo of the classical repertoire can only be preserved for so long.</p>

<p>Consider what happened to music in the 20th century. The development of good quality microphones and electronic effects led to many new forms of music including the broad types of rock, disco, and rap. Those musical genres were created in part when musicians learned how to apply new technology. The same thing will happen again, as musicians (human or otherwise) apply music technology in new ways.</p>
<p>It’s possible that classical music will no longer be all that good in comparison to future music. Classical music’s popularity has been falling for the past 100 years since the genre stopped being pop music.</p>

<p>It’s worth considering that the original Stradivarius violins will eventually be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/arts/music/stradivarius-sound-bank-recording-cremona.html">too fragile to play</a>. Cremona, Italy (where Stradivari worked) has been recording at high-quality the sound of each potential note of its Stradivarius violins in order to preserve that sound for posterity. Can anyone really expect to play a 1,000 year old violin?</p>

<p>Future humans may prevent Stradivarius violins and many other other examples of earth’s artistic mastery from leaving earth. Then again, future humans may want a certain number of Strads to leave as a hedge against future destruction.</p>

<p>Humans are not objective in their appraisal of violins. A double-blind <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/21/5395">study of violinists</a> (they wore goggles) playing modern and Stradivarius violins challenges the belief that Stradivarius is the best. The Strads are often valued in the millions because of their history, and most would claim, their sound. But the overwhelming majority of the violinists in the experiment preferred the modern violins. This is not to say that humans should just accept a forced preference in violin. An argument for why Strads sound (or seem to sound) better has been made from a <a href="http://www.brandstoryonline.com/stradivarius-violins-better/">brand perspective</a>, of all things. It’s the same argument made for fine (expensive) art: that part of the value, maybe most of the value, comes from things that are not objective. Story and history have a big impact on value.</p>

<ul>
<li>Some skills will become impossible to acquire when humans make a large environmental change. These skills are not transferable across vastly different environments and are lost.</li>
<li>Skill loss happens all the time in human history, though certain events speed it up.</li>
<li>Some events make skill loss impossible to undo.</li>
<li>Future humans will deal with different unintended consequences if they build an interstellar society.</li>
<li>Can we build a set of rules to help us assess unintended consequences from dramatic environmental changes?</li>
</ul>

</section>
<p>I’m currently writing a series of articles about test frameworks, and it got me thinking about the importance of software testing. Ever since I started writing automated tests almost a decade ago, I’ve found them to be <strong>one of the most useful tools for building maintainable software</strong>, but I still meet developers who don’t write tests.</p>
<p>Sometimes it’s because their boss (or the business team) won’t give them time, sometimes it’s because they’ve never been told about the benefits of testing, and sometimes they just don’t care.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kR3EGD6.jpg" alt="Can't stop fixing bugs long enough to write tests"></p>
<p>Fortunately, if the reason you’re not writing tests is one of the first two, there’s hope. You <em>can</em> point to real business value generated by testing, and it doesn’t take a huge software system or a long period of time to do so.</p>
<p>Just remember that <strong>your time as a developer is incredibly valuable</strong>, so when you say that you can save yourself (and future software developers) time, your manager can attach real dollars to the problem. In this post, I’ll introduce you to automated software testing and give you the reasons you can take to your boss to make the case for writing tests.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-automated-testing">What is Automated Testing?</h2>
<p>Before I jump into the benefits, I want to make sure you understand what I mean when I say “automated tests.”</p>
<p>Software can be tested manually (traditionally, this means passing your work to a quality assurance team), and it can be tested automatically. In the latter case, developers write code that ensures their code is working. These automated tests are often run using a command-line interface, and almost every programming language <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unit_testing_frameworks">has a testing framework available</a>.</p>
<p>Unit tests are probably the most widely talked about form of automated test, but there are others. I’ll briefly cover them here, but it will require a dedicated article to do this topic justice.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unit tests</strong> focus on the smallest possible unit of code - typically a function or class. They are fast to run, and you will usually have a lot of them.</li>
<li><strong>Integration tests</strong> ensure that interlocking pieces of your application work together as designed. Sometimes this means testing the layers between classes, and sometimes this means testing the layer between your database and application.</li>
<li><strong>Acceptance tests</strong> are a slightly broader form of integration test. In practice, I use this term to refer to service-level tests.</li>
<li><strong>End-to-end tests</strong> ensure that the entire system works as designed. This means that the frontend and backends are working and talking to one another to accomplish a series of user stories. These are the most time-consuming tests to run, and typically you won’t write as many of them.</li>
<li><strong>“Smoke” tests</strong> are final checks that ensure your recently deployed code is working as intended. They could be as simple as a ping to your API after a deployment to make sure it responds with a <code>200 OK</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Performance tests</strong> ensure your application meets its SLAs by testing how long it takes to handle requests under load. These may be run on every production deployment or - because they’re so complicated and expensive - just when major new features are released.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re interested in specific examples of testing patterns, I’ve written about <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/api-strat-2017-presentation">API testing</a> and <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/testing-layers">microservice testing</a> in the past. Those posts should be an excellent place to turn next if you want examples you can apply to your application.</p>
<h2 id="why-software-testing-is-important">Why Software Testing is Important</h2>
<p>The business problem with testing is that it’s not immediately apparent that you need them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You write a piece of code, and you know it works. You just wrote it. You just ran it…Six months pass. It is time to refactor your code. You would kill for some tests. - <a href="https://swizec.com/blog/you-dont-need-tests">Swizec Teller, You don’t need tests</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The diagram below illustrates this point. Initially, the cost of writing no tests or manually testing your code is much lower than writing automated tests. This is because setting up an automated test suite, and getting developers familiar with a test-driven workflow will take some time.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.karllhughes.com/assets/img/cost-of-tests-over-time.png" alt="The cost of automated software tests over time"></p>
<p>Eventually though, maintaining code without tests will lead to costly production bugs, and a manual testing strategy scales linearly (as you add more code, testers must spend more time doing tests). So in the long-run, automated tests make maintaining your code cheaper.</p>
<p>But why is this the case?</p>
<h2 id="the-benefits-of-testing">The Benefits of Testing</h2>
<p>Let’s look at testing from the standpoint of a developer. Once you spend six months on a team that’s consistently writing automated tests, you’ll see the benefits. Here are the things that stand out to me:</p>
<h3 id="1-testing-minimizes-bugs">1. Testing Minimizes Bugs</h3>
<p>Bugs are expensive, and production bugs are the worst offenders. According to <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255965523_Integrating_Software_Assurance_into_the_Software_Development_Life_Cycle_SDLC">the IBM System Sciences Institute</a>, fixing a production bug costs 100x more than fixing one at design and over 15x more than fixing a bug at implementation. Automated tests can help developers catch edge-case bugs before they make it into production and force other developers to drop everything and fight fires.</p>
<h3 id="2-automated-tests-prevent-regressions">2. Automated Tests Prevent Regressions</h3>
<p>In addition to catching new bugs, a strong automated test suite can help prevent regression. As <a href="https://medium.com/javascript-scene/what-every-unit-test-needs-f6cd34d9836d">Eric Elliot</a> says, “Manual QA is error-prone…It’s impossible for a developer to remember all features that need testing after making a change to refactor, add new features, or remove features.”</p>
<p>Testing becomes even more important when multiple developers are working on the project over many years. Newcomers can’t safely work on code that doesn’t have tests. While you can rely solely on manual tests, this cost grows linearly as the number of features increases, while automated tests can be written once and run very frequently for little to no cost.</p>
<h3 id="3-writing-testable-code-improves-overall-quality">3. Writing Testable Code Improves Overall Quality</h3>
<p>Code quality is another long-term investment that <a href="https://writing.pupius.co.uk/velocity-vs-quality-3d0417fba991">pays off for large software systems</a>. Unit testing can dramatically improve quality when working with developers who are still learning about encapsulation, dependency injection, and scoping, and it is even more advantageous in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing">weakly typed languages</a>.</p>
<p><strong>When every new class must have unit tests, it forces developers to stop and think about their architectural choices.</strong></p>
<h3 id="4-tests-enhance-documentation">4. Tests Enhance Documentation</h3>
<p>Good code should be easy to read and at least partially <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?SelfDocumentingCode">self-documenting</a>, but there’s almost always room for use-case based documentation. That’s where testing comes in. Good test suites give other developers (or maybe just future you) a better idea of what the code was intended to do.</p>
<h3 id="5-tests-help-guide-code-reviewers">5. Tests Help Guide Code Reviewers</h3>
<p>As an important part of the development process, reviewing code can be tedious. Having tests gives the reviewer a place to look for potential errors or missed edge cases. During code reviews, I often start with the tests, ensuring that they are well-written and don’t miss any important cases <em>before</em> I look at the actual code.</p>
<h3 id="6-tests-make-it-easier-to-add-new-features">6. Tests Make It Easier to Add New Features</h3>
<p>Code gets naturally harder to change the more interconnected and older it is. Tests counter this tendency towards calcification by helping developers add new features more confidently. As a new developer, changing older parts of your codebase can be really scary, but with tests, at least you’ll know if you broke something important.</p>
<h3 id="7-tests-can-help-you-debug-edge-cases">7. Tests Can Help You Debug Edge Cases</h3>
<p>Finally, I use tests to help debug edge cases that show up in production. For example, if we start to see a problem in the logs that wasn’t showing up in testing, I’ll try to write a test case that causes the same error. Once reproduced in a test, I use this as a blueprint to fix the issue and ensure it doesn’t show up again.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-started-testing">How to Get Started Testing</h2>
<p>If you’re brand new to testing, this all probably sounds a little intimidating. How do you set up a test suite? Should you do purely test driven development? What if your team isn’t supportive? What about adding tests to a legacy application?</p>
<p>These questions can be overwhelming, even for an experienced software developer.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I started contributing to an open-source project that had almost zero test coverage. Worse, there were a few tests that the original maintainer had written, but he hadn’t bothered to fix as the library evolved. The tests were now failing, but the application was working.</p>
<p>I started to consider my options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should I try to put a stop to new feature development until we got the tests fixed?</li>
<li>Should I stop using the library until it meets the quality standards I wanted?</li>
<li>Do I try to rewrite the whole thing?</li>
</ul>
<p>Extreme solutions like this can be tempting, but they rarely make good business sense. Implementing tests on an untested app is a process. Much like the <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/technical-maturity">technical maturity level of a startup</a>, you can’t expect every application to be perfect, but you can make gradual improvements to the test coverage and testability of an application as you work on it.</p>
<p>Here’s how I approached the problem:</p>
<h3 id="1-start-with-end-to-end-tests">1. Start With End-to-End Tests</h3>
<p>Unit tests usually require refactoring, so while they’re great when you’re building an application from scratch, it’s easier to start by writing higher-level acceptance or end-to-end tests for a working application. An automated test that makes sure all the critical features work the whole way through is a great place to start.</p>
<h3 id="2-test-return-types">2. Test Return Types</h3>
<p>The next thing to test is the most mission-critical methods in the most important classes. Even if the code is a spaghetti string mess, you can start by testing the return type from the method. If mocking dependencies isn’t possible, then it’s okay to write some impure tests to get started. Refactoring isn’t safe until you’ve got at least some tests in place.</p>
<h3 id="3-add-tests-one-piece-at-a-time">3. Add Tests One Piece at a Time</h3>
<p>Unit testing a large application takes time and patience. Install a code coverage tool, and start with one small piece at a time. If it’s a big project and it’s going to take a few weeks, so try doing a few classes per week rather than taking the whole thing on at once. This is a good thing for developers who are new to a project to do as it helps them get familiar with the application without being required to change core functionality.</p>
<h3 id="4-start-refactoring">4. Start Refactoring</h3></div></article></section></div>

Yes, that's a risk I have assumed with this project. I can export any Notion document as HTML or Markdown, so once this setup stops working I'll just move on, just like I did twice before. This time it'll cost $4/mo for the time being, but honestly that's motivation to get me to write more.

3. Don't stop writing</span></span></blockquote><p><span><span><em>If you enjoyed this, you can use my referral link to sign up for Super and that'd just lovely:</em></span></span></p></article></div></div></div>]]>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/joshbressers">Josh</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kurtseifried">Kurt</a> talk about the safety and liability of new devices. What happens when your doorbell can burn down your house? What if it’s your fault the doorbell burned down your house? There isn’t really any prior art for where our devices are taking us, who knows what the future will look like.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main"><p>22 Nov 2020<br>22 Nov 2020</p><p><em>TL;DR. We focused on a holistic view of our candidates (technical and interpersonal skills) while trying to be fair with everyone’s time and life experiences. We could identify the outstanding people and those that weren’t a good fit and have had a great experience working with our hires!</em></p><p>After reading <a href="https://www.neilwithdata.com/developer-hiring">The software industry’s greatest sin: hiring</a> by Neil Sainsbury and <a href="https://andrewrondeau.com/blog/2020/04/take-home-vs-whiteboard-coding-the-problem-is-bad-interviews">Take-home vs. whiteboard coding: The problem is bad interviews</a> by Andrew Rondeau, several critical points about interviewing software developers stood out to me:</p><ul><li>Software developers are usually assessed based on technical aspects ignoring their personal and organizational qualities. This might produce technically correct software with good performance, but that might be far from fulfilling users’ needs.</li><li>Someone can be technically excellent but lack the skills to understand and interact with your users and the rest of the team.</li><li>Someone can be technically excellent but keep using technologies they find interesting but are not aligned with the company’s goals.</li><li>There are tradeoffs between whiteboard and take-home questions: time invested by both parties, different development environment/conditions, visibility of the candidate’s technical and personal qualities, and the feedback loop between the examiner and the applicant.</li><li>A key aspect is to plan a good interview with coding assignments that consider the company’s needs and are fair for everyone involved.</li><li>Presenting existing code is briefly discussed by Andrew Rondeau as an alternative to whiteboard and take-home questions.</li></ul><p>I am a postdoctoral researcher at a group that explores mobile data’s role in monitoring or supporting people with different health conditions. Broadly speaking, we collect smartphone and wearable sensor data, process it, and use it to create statistical and machine learning models that provide relevant behavioral or clinical insights. This is possible thanks to our team’s multi-disciplinary nature with expertise in psychology, statistics, computer science, software engineering, and data science.</p><p>Recently, we needed to hire a couple of data science interns from the local master’s program, and I was in charge of leading the technical part of the interviews. This was an excellent opportunity for me to pilot the type of technical interview that I’d like to experience based on the points I summarized above and the lab’s needs.</p><p>I divided our interviews into two 30-minute stages, one to talk about one of the candidate’s past projects and the other to find out how they would approach a data science problem that represents the kind of work we do.</p><p>For the first stage, we asked applicants to submit in advance a past data science project that they would like to discuss with us. I want to clarify that we accepted any industry, school, or hobby code repository and did not judge its purpose or complexity. We don’t expect that everyone will have the time to work on side-projects in their free time or disclose code from a previous employer. However, their sample project allowed us to understand some of the person’s experience with data science and software engineering practices like data cleaning, modeling, documentation, version control, variable and function naming, code comments, code formatting, and code refactoring. If any of these aspects were missing or seemed unsatisfactory, we made a note and ask about them during the interview.</p><p>When the time came for the first part of our face-to-face chat (where we talked about their chosen project), we focused on their hard skills (technical expertise, domain knowledge, and problem-solving abilities), soft skills (communication, multi-disciplinary collaboration, feedback reception), and traits like proactiveness, enthusiasm, motivation, clarity of thought, independence and attention to detail. This is our take on what Neil refers to as a candidate’s “holistic” view. Crucially, having technical and non-technical members from our team present made it easier to discuss and evaluate our candidates. More specifically, we inquired people about their role in previous teams (if any), their approach to learning, and their thought process to choose the best tool for the job. We also prompted them to explain complex non-technical concepts to everyone in the interview panel and to talk more about their experience interacting with past “clients” (teachers, fellow students, or any other stakeholders for those with experience in Industry). One of the advantages of this setup was that it allowed everyone to interact in a work environment very similar to what we experience every day while planning, implementing, executing, analyzing, and publishing a health intervention or monitoring study.</p><p>In the second part of the interview, we asked participants the following question: how would you implement a sleep classifier based on smartphone and Fitbit data? Even if this problem appears simple at first sight, numerous decisions and considerations can be taken into account along the way. For example, we can talk about missing data, feature engineering, data resampling, data imputation, class imbalance, type of model (population or individual), hyper-parameter tuning, model choice, baselines, cross-validation, evaluation metrics, etc. Consequently and to foster the discussion, we always dropped clues, clarifications, and follow up questions.</p><p>We did not expect our interviewees to reach a comprehensive solution or write any code (it took us weeks to finish a publishable solution, and the first part of the interview already would have given us an idea of their programming skills). Instead, we wanted to know more about their thinking process. We paid particular attention to the candidate’s understanding of the problem (do they ask relevant questions?), creativity (how do they suggest tackling this problem?), experience (are they levering solutions to past problems?), technical expertise (what programming language, libraries, or methods would they like to use?), and communication skills (can they engage the whole team in the discussion?).</p><p>This process fits well within our workflow and our team’s characteristics, and we hope that by sharing it, you can adapt it to your needs and provide a better experience for your candidates.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>When a company with millions of consumers such as DoorDash builds machine learning (ML) models, the amount of feature data can grow to billions of records with millions actively retrieved during model inference under low latency constraints. These challenges warrant a deeper look into selection and design of a feature store — the system responsible for storing and serving feature data. The decisions made here can prevent overrunning cost budgets, compromising runtime performance during model inference, and curbing model deployment velocity.</p>



<p>Features are the input variables fed to an ML model for inference. A feature store, simply put, is a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/nosql/key-value/">key-value store</a> that makes this feature data available to models in production. At DoorDash, our existing feature store was built on top of <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a>, but had a lot of inefficiencies and came close to running out of capacity. We ran a full-fledged benchmark evaluation on five different key-value stores to compare their cost and performance metrics. Our benchmarking results indicated that Redis was the best option, so we decided to optimize our feature storage mechanism, tripling our cost reduction. Additionally, we also saw a 38% decrease in Redis latencies, helping to improve the runtime performance of serving models.</p>



<p>Below, we will explain the challenges posed in the task of operating a large scale feature store. Then, we will review how we were able to quickly identify Redis as the right key-value store for this task. We will then dive into the optimizations we did on Redis to triple its capacity, while also uplifting read performance by choosing a custom serialization scheme around strings, <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">protocol buffers</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/google/snappy">Snappy</a> compression algorithm.</p>



<h2>Requirements of a gigascale feature store</h2>



<p>The challenges of supporting a feature store that needs a large storage capacity and high read/write throughput are similar to the challenges of supporting any high-volume key-value store. Let’s elaborate upon the requirements before we discuss the challenges faced when meeting these requirements specifically with respect to a feature store.</p>



<h3>Persistent scalable storage: support billions of records</h3>



<p>The number of records in a feature store depends upon the number of entities involved and the number of ML use cases employed on these entities. At DoorDash, our ML practitioners work with millions of entities such as consumers, merchants, and food items. These entities are associated with features and used in many dozens of ML use cases such as <a href="https://doordash.engineering/2020/10/01/integrating-a-scoring-framework-into-a-prediction-service/">store ranking</a> and cart item recommendations. Even though there is an overlap in features used across these use cases, the total number of <em>feature-value</em> pairs exceeds billions.</p>



<p>Additionally, since feature data is used in model serving, it needs to be backed up to disk to enable recovery in the event of a storage system failure.</p>



<h3>High read throughput: serve millions of feature lookups per second</h3>



<p>A hit rate of millions of requests per second is a staggering requirement for any data storage system. The request rates on a feature store are directly driven by the number of predictions served by the corresponding system. At DoorDash, one of our high volume use cases, <a href="https://doordash.engineering/2020/10/01/integrating-a-scoring-framework-into-a-prediction-service/">store ranking</a>, makes more than one million predictions per second and uses dozens of features per prediction. Thus, our feature store needs to support tens of millions of reads per second.</p>



<h3>Fast batch writes: enable full data refresh in a nightly run</h3>



<p>Features need to be periodically refreshed to make use of the latest real world data. These writes can typically be done in batches to exploit batch write optimizations of a key-value store. At DoorDash, almost all of the features get updated every day, while real time features, such as “average delivery time for orders from a store in the past 20 minutes”, get updated uniformly throughout the day.</p>



<h2>Specific design challenges in building a feature store</h2>



<p>When designing a feature store to meet the scale expectations described above, we have to deal with complexities that are specific to a feature store. These complexities involve issues such as supporting batch random reads, storing multiple kinds of data types, and enabling low-latency serving.</p>



<h3>Batch random reads per request add to read complexity</h3>



<p>Feature stores need to offer batch lookup operations because a single prediction needs multiple features. All key-value stores support unit lookup operations such as Redis’s <a href="https://redis.io/commands/get">GET command</a>. However, batch lookups are not a standard especially when keys are in no particular sequence. For example, <a href="https://cassandra.apache.org/">Apache Cassandra</a> doesn’t support batch random lookups.</p>



<h3>Heterogeneous data types require non-standardized optimizations</h3>



<p>Features can either be simple data types such as integers, floats, and strings, or compound types such as <a href="https://doordash.engineering/2018/04/02/personalized-store-feed-with-vector-embeddings/">vector embeddings</a> or lists. We use integers or strings for categorical features such as <em>order protocol,</em> for whether an order was received by merchants via email, text, or iPad. We use lists for features such as a <em>list of cuisines chosen by a customer in the past 4 weeks.</em> Each one of these data types needs to be individually treated for optimizing storage and performance efficiency.</p>



<h3>Low read latency but loose expectations on write latency</h3>



<p>A feature store needs to guarantee low-latency reads. Latency on feature stores is a part of model serving, and model serving latencies tend to be in the low milliseconds range. Thus, read latency has to be proportionately lower. Also, typically, writes and updates happen in the background and are much less frequent than reads. For DoorDash, when not doing the batch refresh, writes are only 0.1% of reads. Low-latency requirements on reads and loose expectations with writes gives a direction for building towards a read-heavy key-value store but one that is fast enough for large batch writes.</p>



<h2>Identifying the right key-value store by benchmarking key performance metrics&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The choice for an appropriate storage technology helps greatly in increasing the performance and reducing the costs of a feature store. Using Yahoo’s cloud serving benchmark tool, <a href="https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB">YCSB</a>, we were able to identify Redis as a key-value store option that best fit our needs.</p>



<h3>What we need from a benchmarking platform</h3>



<p>Before we lay out our benchmarking setup, it is worthwhile to emphasize key requirements of a benchmarking platform. The four major required capabilities of a benchmarking setup are:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Data generation using preset distributions</li></ul>



<p>Using data generation is a faster and more robust approach to benchmarking than ingesting real data because it accounts for possible values that a system’s random variables can take and doesn’t require moving data around to seed a target database.</p>



<ul><li>Ability to simulate characteristic workloads</li></ul>



<p>The workload on a database can be defined by the rate of requests, nature of operations, and proportions of these operations. As long as we can guarantee the same fixed request rate across tests, we can enable a fair comparison between the different databases.</p>



<ul><li>Fine-grained performance reporting</li></ul>



<p>The suite should be able to capture performance with appropriate statistical measures such as averages, 95th percentile, and 99th percentiles.</p>



<ul><li>Reproduction of results on demand</li></ul>



<p>Without reproducibility, there is no benchmark, it’s merely a random simulated event. For this reason, any benchmark platform needs to be able to provide a consistent environment where the results can be reproduced when running the same test over and over.</p>



<h3>Using YCSB to do a rapid comparison of key-value stores</h3>



<p>YCSB is one of the best benchmarking tools out there for analysing key-value stores. So much so that it not only meets all of the needs we described above but also provides sample code to benchmark a vast number of key-value stores. This setup ensures we have a flexible playground for rapid comparisons. Below, we describe our approach of using YCSB to validate our selection of Redis as the best choice for a feature store. We will first describe our experiment setup and then report the results with our analysis.</p>



<h2>Experiment setup</h2>



<p>When setting up the benchmarking experiment, we need to start with the set of key-value stores that we believe can meet the large scale expectations reliably and have a good industry presence. Also, our experiment design is centered around Docker and aims to optimize the speed of iterations when benchmarking by removing infrastructure setup overheads.</p>



<h3>Candidate set of key-value stores</h3>



<p>The key-value stores that we experimented on in this article are listed in Table 1, below. <a href="https://cassandra.apache.org/">Cassandra</a>, <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/">CockroachDB</a>, and <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> have a presence in the DoorDash infrastructure, while we selected <a href="https://www.scylladb.com/">ScyllaDB</a> and <a href="https://www.yugabyte.com/">YugabyteDB</a> based on market reports and our team’s prior experience with these databases. The intention was to compare Redis as an in-memory store with other disk-based key-value stores for our requirements.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Database name</strong></td><td><strong>Version</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Cassandra</td><td>3.11.4</td></tr><tr><td>CockroachDB</td><td>20.1.5</td></tr><tr><td>Redis</td><td>3.2.10</td></tr><tr><td>ScyllaDB</td><td>4.1.7</td></tr><tr><td>YugabyteDB</td><td>2.3.1.0-b15</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption><em>Table 1.</em> We considered five<em> data stores for benchmarking, three that were in current use at DoorDash and two others that showed promise in external market reports.</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3>Data schema</h3>



<p>For data storage, we chose following patterns:</p>



<ul><li>SQL/Cassandra</li></ul>



<pre><code lang="sql">CREATE TABLE table (key varchar primary key, value varchar)</code></pre>



<ul><li>Redis</li></ul>



<pre><code lang="bash">SET key-value
GET key</code></pre>



<h3>Input data …</h3></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" role="main"> <article role="article">  <p>I like to think I’m a pretty rational investor. Not too emotional, not too prone to FOMO, willing to wait for good deals. So, let me tell you about a bad and embarrassing decision I made. This story may seem pretty dumb to you, as it does to me today. I often read about great financial disasters and think “that’s so stupid! I would never screw up this badly.” It turns out that’s easier said than done; some theoretical lessons are very hard to internalize in practice.</p> <p>In late 2014, I was cautiously bullish on Bitcoin. I saw the appeal of finite-supply assets in other markets, leaned cypherpunk-libertarian, and had run into many issues with fiat payment processors in my poker days. However, I had also seen Liberty Reserve shut down by the FBI, watched quaint early scams like Auroracoin, and thought it seemed clear that the government would eventually need to shut down this state-threatening Wild West.</p> <p>So I was bullish, but hesitant to put real skin in the game. Along came an opportunity to bet on Bitcoin with no personal downside: I met a young founder who had just raised $2M from a few investors for the purpose of getting them Bitcoin exposure. Let’s call him Mephisto. He had negotiated 25% carry on the profits of his small fund, which was an excellent deal. His track record made sense: he’d been in the industry since 2012, and had made some good money on Bitcoin and trading FPGAs. He had brought on a young woman – let’s call her Bellatrix – to help manage operations. As we talked, we realized I could help them generate alpha beyond pure Bitcoin exposure. I knew financial derivatives very well, so my task was broadly to profit off inefficiencies in these nascent markets.</p> <p>I was 23. Working with Mephisto and Bellatrix was like sitting on the Hindenburg. While I was combing the market for inefficiencies, they were struggling to get the operations fully set up. A few weeks in, it turned out that Mephisto and Bellatrix had been fucking in secret. They had an equity dispute. He went off his medication, and suffered a psychotic breakdown. She accused him of rape. They called the cops on each other. He disappeared and re-encountered the substance abuse problem that had put him on anti-psychotic medication in the first place. To top it all off, they lost the cold storage credentials for a few weeks.</p> <p>I pulled the escape cord and resigned cleanly. Ironically, I took a financial loss here, since I had to have my lawyers review everything and ensure I wasn’t liable for any fiduciary mismanagement these two chaos clowns might undertake.</p> <p>At this point it was early 2015. Bitcoin hovered between $200 and $250 per coin. I was totally over it. The cautiously bullish view I had gotten around to was eviscerated by my distaste for the Mephisto episode. I was exasperated, liquidated nearly my entire position and sat, for a long time, more in the bear camp than not. Thinking about Mephisto and Bellatrix, I said to myself, if <em>this</em> is who is managing money in Bitcoin, there’s no hope for the sector. Bearish on Bitcoin at a $3B market cap.</p> <p>Part of my attitude was a spiteful emotional hedge. I think my reasoning went like this: investing in Bitcoin could go two ways. I could lose money, and I would be disappointed. I could also make money, but in that case, Mephisto and his ilk would make wildly <em>more</em> money, and I would be upset. If I were to invest and succeed holding the same position as Mephisto, I’d be envious of someone I despised. I wanted Mephisto to fail, so I wanted Bitcoin to fail. It’s a twisted rationalization – silly in retrospect, of course.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p> <p>It’s easy to be a rational investor when the seas are calm. It’s hard when it gets emotional. Importantly, everyone has a threshold – if the personal relationships are close enough, or if the stress is great enough, suddenly even the most rational actors crack. I saw it all the time playing poker: your opponents are stone-faced rational actors until something gets to them. They’re tired or distracted, and suddenly they get pissed off when they normally wouldn’t, and make bets they shouldn’t. Very few people manage to stay rational in charged moments. The better-disciplined folks will summon all their willpower just to walk away.</p> <p>In this episode, I let emotional stress override my assessment of the market. Stupidly, I let my subjective, one-off personal experience bias me against an entire industry. Stress had me do a 180 on a carefully considered position of conviction. Refusing to take a position out of spite, or in order to pre-empt envy in the case of success, is even more embarrassing.</p> <p>Finally, there was one other important thing I hadn’t considered or realized at the time: the cutting edge is always full of idiots. It’s a common trope that people who are all-in on frontier tech are usually somewhat crazy. We have a romantic view of folks on the frontier – eccentric geniuses – but much of the time it’s gullible bozos and scammers feeding off them. In a historical analogy, the Wild West does not just create outlaws, it necessarily attracts them. My mistake here was to let the worst people color my representation of the market. It doesn’t matter how many scammers and con-men there are, it matters how many people are building stable infrastructure. It doesn’t matter how many ways there are for it to fail, it only matters that there’s one plausible way to succeed.</p>  <hr>  <br> </article> </div></div>]]>

<p>A Passport is a document that almost everyone has at some point in their lives. It is issued by the country’s government to its citizens and mainly being used for traveling purposes. It also serves as proof of nationality, name, and more importantly an <strong>Universally Unique ID</strong> for its owner.</p>
<p>Modern Passport Structure</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/pics.pixlab.xyz/oJY2K.png" alt="Passport Specimen"></p>
<p>Many services have been long-time accepting passports as identification documents from their customers to <strong>complete their KYC (<em>Know Your Customer</em>) form</strong> as required by the legislation in force. This is especially true and enforced for the <em>Finance</em>, <em>HR</em> or <em>Travel</em> sectors. In most cases, a human operator will verify the authenticity of the submitted document and grant validation or reject it.</p>
<p>Things can get really complicated if you have hundreds of KYC forms to checks, but also if your clients differ in nationality. Quickly, you will find yourself drowning in physical copies of passports in different languages that you can not even understand. Let alone the potential legal problems you can face with passport copies laying around the office. This is why, an automated &amp; safe solution for Passports processing is required!</p>
<h2>Modern Passport Structure</h2>
<p>From the 1980s on wards, most countries started issuing passports containing an <strong>MRZ</strong>. MRZ stands for the <strong>Machine Readable Zone</strong> and is usually located at the bottom of the Passport as shown below:</p>
<p>Modern Passport Specimen</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mwJTo.jpg" alt="Passports MRZ Sample"></p>
<p>Passports that contain an MRZ are referred to as <strong>MRPs, machine-readable passports</strong> (Almost all modern issued Passports have one). The structure of the MRZ is standardized by the <a href="https://www.icao.int/publications/pages/publication.aspx?docnum=9303">ICAO Document 9303</a> and the International Electro-technical Commission as <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/45562.html">ISO/IEC 7501-1</a>.</p>
<p>The MRZ is an area on the document that can easily be read by a machine using an OCR Reader Application or API. It’s not important for you to understand how it works, but if you look at it carefully, you will see that it contains most of the relevant information on the document, combined with additional characters and a checksum that can be extracted programmatically and automatically via API as we will see in the next section.</p>
<p>Once parsed, the following information are automatically extracted from the target <strong>MRZ</strong> and made immediately available to your app, thanks to the /<a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=docscan">docscan</a> API endpoint:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>issuingCountry</strong>: The issuing country or organization, encoded in three characters.</li>
<li><strong>fullName</strong>: Passport holder full name. The name is entirely upper case.</li>
<li><strong>documentNumber</strong>: This is the passport number, as assigned by the issuing country. Each country is free to assign numbers using any system it likes.</li>
<li><strong>checkDigit</strong>: Check digits are calculated based on the previous field. Thus, the first check digit is based on the passport number, the next is based on the date of birth, the next on the expiration date, and the next on the personal number. The check digit is calculated using this <a href="http://www.highprogrammer.com/alan/numbers/mrp.html#checkdigit">algorithm</a>.</li>
<li><strong>nationality</strong>: The issuing country or organization, encoded in three characters.</li>
<li><strong>dateOfBirth</strong>: The date of the passport holder's birth in YYMMDD form. Year is truncated to the least significant two digits. Single digit months or days are perpended with 0.</li>
<li><strong>sex</strong>: Sex of the passport holder, <strong>M</strong> for males, <strong>F</strong> for females, and <strong>&lt;</strong> for non-specified.</li>
<li><strong>dateOfExpiry</strong>: The date the passport expires in <strong>YYMMDD</strong> form. Year is truncated to the least significant two digits. Single digit months or days are perpended with 0.</li>
<li><strong>personalNumber</strong>: This field is optional and can be used for any purpose that the issuing country desires.</li>
<li><strong>finalcheckDigit</strong>: This is a check digit for positions 1 to 10, 14 to 20, and 22 to 43 on the second line of the MRZ. Thus, the nationality and sex are not included in the check. The check digit is calculated using this <a href="http://www.highprogrammer.com/alan/numbers/mrp.html#checkdigit">algorithm</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Automatic Passport Processing</h2>
<p><img src="https://blog.pixlab.io/content/images/20201106031815-pix.png" alt="PixLab Logo"></p>
<p>Fortunately for the developer wishing to automate Passports scanning, <a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=docscan">PixLab</a> can automatically scan &amp; extract passport MRZ but also help to detect possible fraudulent documents. This is made possible thanks to the /<a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=docscan">docscan</a> API endpoint which let you in a single call scan government issued documents such as <strong>Passports</strong>, <strong>Visas</strong> or <strong>ID Cards</strong> from various countries.</p>
<p>Besides extracting MRZ, the /<a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=docscan">docscan</a> API endpoint <a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=crop">shall automatically crop</a> any <strong>detected face</strong> and transform binary <strong>Machine Readable Zone</strong> into stream of text content (i.e. <em>full name</em>, <em>issuing country</em>, <em>document number</em>, <em>date of expiry</em>, etc.) ready to be consumed by your app in the JSON format.</p>
<p>Below, a typical output result of the /<a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/45562.html">docscan</a> endpoint for a passport input image:</p>
<p>Input Passport Specimen (JPEG/PNG/BMP Image)</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/pics.pixlab.xyz/oJY2K.png" alt="Input Image URL"></p>
<p>Extracted MRZ Fields</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/pics.pixlab.xyz/docscan_output.png" alt="MRZ Fields"></p>
<p>What follow is the gist used to achieve such result:</p>

<p>Other document scanning code samples are available to consult via the following Github links:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Python code for scanning Passports</strong>: <strong><a href="https://github.com/symisc/pixlab/blob/master/python/passport_scan.py">passport_scan.py</a></strong>.</li>
<li><strong>PHP code for scanning Passports</strong>: <strong><a href="https://github.com/symisc/pixlab/blob/master/PHP/passport_scan.php">passport_scan.php</a></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Face extraction is automatically performed using the /<a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=facedetect">facedetect</a> API endpoint. For a general purpose Optical Character Recognition engine, you should rely on the /<a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=cor">OCR</a> API endpoint instead. If you are dealing with PDF documents, you can convert them at first to raw images via the /<a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=pdftoimg">pdftoimg</a> endpoint.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The era we are in is more digitized than ever. Tasks that are repetitive are slowly being replaced by computers and robots. In many cases, they can perform these tasks faster, with a smaller amount of mistakes and in a more cost-effective manner. At <a href="https://pixlab.io/">PixLab</a> we focus on building software to replace manual repetitive labor in administrative business processes. The processing and checking of passports can be very time-consuming. Using /<a href="https://pixlab.io/cmd?id=docscan">docscan</a> to automate your passport processing will enable you to save cost, on-board customers faster and reduce errors in administrative processes.</p>

<p>Today I’m going to see if I can use a PC water cooling kit to make a water cooled Raspberry Pi 4. I’ve seen a couple of people try this on older model Pi’s, using reducers and adapters to get to a small cooling block onto the CPU, but I’m going to try and make an adapter to fit a larger 30mm cooling block onto a Pi 4.</p>



<p><span data-ez-name="the_diy_life_com-box-3"></span>Just to be clear, this is totally unnecessary and is more of a let’s do it because we can, not because we should type of project.  But we’ll have fun building it anyway, and hopefully it works well in the end!</p>



<p>Here’s a video of the build and the test, read on for the write-up:</p>

<p>I bought a kit that included a 120mm fan and a radiator, a 12V pump, a reservoir and some tubing. These kits are commonly available online for significantly less than the name brand components sold for high-end PCs, but it’s still quite expensive just to mess around with.</p>

<p>The kit also included a full size CPU cooling block. It looks quite cool (excuse the pun) but is way too big to try and fit onto the Pi, so I’m going to be using one of these smaller 30 x 30mm blocks which can accommodate a half-inch or 12mm tubing.</p>

<h2>Building The Water Cooled Raspberry Pi 4</h2>



<h3>Mounting The Cooling Block To The Pi</h3>



<p>I’m going to start out by making a bracket to hold the cooling block in place on the Pi over the CPU. </p>

<p>We’ll need a square section to locate the block and hold it down onto the CPU and then some legs off to the four mounting holes to hold it in place. I’ve tried to avoid covering the GPIO pins and the major components, the bracket will be quite high up, so won’t interfere with any of the surface mount components.</p>

<p>I cut the two parts for the bracket out on my laser cutter from 3mm fluorescent green acrylic.</p>

<p>The cooling block can’t be mounted straight onto the CPU as the display connector is too high. We’ll need to put a spacer in between the CPU and cooling block to lift it above the display connector, with enough room for the tubes. </p>

<h2>Making The Cooling Circuit Stand</h2>



<p>Now that we’ve got our cooling block mounted onto our Pi, we can start working on mounting the rest of the cooling circuit. </p>

<p>Rather than just connecting all of the components together on a desk, I decided to design a stand to mount the water cooling components and Raspberry Pi, so that it looks more complete.</p>



<p>I’m going to use clear acrylic for the stand with some fluorescent green legs to match the cooling block bracket. The water cooling components should just bolt straight onto this sheet once it’s been cut out.</p>

<p>Again, I cut this stand out on my laser cutter from 3mm acrylic, this time clear.</p>



<p>Now that we’ve got our stand components made, lets start putting them together. </p>

<p>I’ll start by mounting the reservoir, pump and radiator onto the stand.</p>

<p>Next, I need to glue the Raspberry Pi stand components onto the main cooling water stand. I clamped the components in place and allowed the cement to cure for a couple of hours before trying to mount the Pi.</p>

<p>Once the glued had properly cured, I put two lengths of tubing onto the heat sink so that I didn’t have to try push them on in the tight space between the Pi and the pump, and then mounted the Pi onto the stand using four nylon M3 nuts on the bottom of the standoffs.</p>

<p>I then added the fittings and finished off the tubing.</p>



<p>One side of the cooling block goes to the pump and the other to the radiator. We also need a section of tube from the radiator to the top of the reservoir.</p>



<p>The last thing to do is to add a small acrylic block to the base of the pump to hold the weight of the pump and reservoir. The legs on the stand are not strong enough to support all of the cooling components and I didn’t want to make them bigger as I like the look of the thinner sections. You’ll also hardly notice the block under the pump if it’s clear.</p>

<p>Our water cooled Pi is now complete, we just need to fill it up with water or cooling liquid and try it out. The system took around 300ml of cooling liquid to fill.</p>



<h2>Testing The Water Cooled Raspberry Pi 4</h2>



<p>The fan and pump are actually quite quiet when running, the system is a lot quieter than some of the small case fans I’ve used on a Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>Now let’s try and do a stress test on the water cooled Raspberry Pi to see how well this cooling system works.</p>



<h3>CPU Test At 1.5GHz</h3>



<p>With the CPU clock frequency set to the default 1.5Ghz, we start out with a temperature of around 28°C. This was in a room of around 25°C, so it was done with quite a warm ambient temperature. </p>

<p>Here’s a graph of the CPU temperature for the duration of the test.</p>



<h3>CPU Test At 2.0GHz</h3>



<p>Now I’m going to try overclocking the Pi to test it at a higher CPU frequency. </p>

<p>I set the CPU frequency to 2.0Ghz for this test.</p>



<p>Let’s try doing a stress test and see what we get.</p>

<p>For this test we started out with a temperature of around 29°C, which then quickly spiked to 39°C when the test was started.</p>

<p>Here’s a graph of the CPU temperature for the duration of the 2Ghz test.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>The water cooling system on this Pi works really well at keeping the CPU cool. Even when overclocked to 2.0Ghz, the  Raspberry Pi 4’s CPU temperature never went above 40°C. I wasn’t able to test the Pi at the maximum 2.147Ghz as my Pi wouldn’t boot up at this frequency, probably due to under-voltage. I’ll try and get this fixed and do a test at the maximum frequency as well at some stage.</p>



<p>To get an idea of whether this is worthwhile, I’m going to be comparing this water cooling system to an <a href="https://www.the-diy-life.com/diy-raspberry-pi-4-desktop-case-with-oled-stats-display/">Ice Tower</a>, a standard acrylic case and fan and then just a Pi with a static heat sink on it in the next week or two. So make sure that you check back here, or subscribe to my Youtube channel and turn on notifications so that you don’t miss out on that.</p>

              <strong>The Complete Turing Machine</strong></p></span></p>
            <p><span>The <em>Universal Turing Machine</em> (or 
              UTM) is well known. It is a Turing machine that takes as input a 
              binary representation of a Turing machine and a binary representation 
              of some arbitrary input and simulates the workings of the specified 
              Turing machine on the specified input. </span></p>
            <p><span><em>In what follows we'll assume three 
              tape Turing machines (input, work, output), with a binary alphabet, 
              where 0 corresponds to an unmarked square and 1 is marked. Input 
              to the Turing machine is assumed to be finite (i.e. there are only 
              finitely many 1s on the tape). While I speak of a single input, 
              it could easily encode finitely many individual binary strings into 
              the single binary string.</em></span></p>
            <p><span>Less well known is what I call the <em>Complete 
              Turing Machine</em>. It simulates in parallel all Turing machines 
              on all input. There is a small trick to this, but it is not difficult. 
              Since Turing machines can go on forever, we can't wait for one to 
              finish before simulating the next, but have to simulate them in 
              parallel. It is easy enough to simulate two Turing machines in parallel, 
              performing a step from the first then a step from the second and 
              so forth:</span></p>
            <p><span>step 1 of machine 1, step 1 of machine 
              2, <br>
              step 2 of machine 1, step 2 of machine 2, <br>
              ...</span></p>
            <p><span>This approach can only interleave finitely 
              many infinite sequences, but we require infinitely many Turing machines. 
              Thankfully, there is a well known trick to interleave infinitely 
              many infinite sequences into a single infinite sequence. For example:</span></p>
            <p><span>step 1 of machine 1, <br>
              step 2 of machine 1, step 1 of machine 2,<br>
              step 3 of machine 1, step 2 of machine 2, step 1 of machine 3<br>
              step 4 of machine 1, step 3 of machine 2, step 2 of machine 3, step 
              1 of machine 4<br>
              ...</span></p>
            <p><span>In this way, every Turing machine gets 
              to execute every step (if a Turing machine halts we just skip over 
              each remaining step allocated to it).</span></p>
            <p><span>We could specify a first draft of the Complete 
              Turing Machine in C-like pseudocode:</span></p>
            <div><p>for (i = 0; ; i++)<br>
              {<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;initialise_tm(tm[i], 
              i);</p><p>
              
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for (j = 0; j &lt;= 
              i; j++)<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;compute_next_step(tm[j]);<br>
              }</p></div>
            <p>tm[] is an (extendable) array of representations 
              of configurations of Turing machines including information about 
              their transition tables, their current tape, their current state, 
              and the location of the tape head. It starts uninitialised.</p>
            <p>initialise_tm(tm, i) is a function that 
              initialises a Turing machine representation to start in the starting 
              state, with a blank tape, the tape head at the start position, and 
              using the ith transition table (on some recursive coding of all 
              legal transition tables).</p>
            <p>compute_next_step(tm) is a function that 
              takes such a representation and simulates a single computational 
              step on it. It is a standard core part of a Universal Turing machine.</p>
            <p><span>This will simulate all Turing machines 
              (including non-terminating ones) running on a blank input tape.</span></p>
            <p><span>We actually want all Turing machines on 
              all inputs, but we can achieve this by a small modification to the 
              initialisation function. Instead of using i as a code for a transition 
              table, it now treats i as coding a pair of natural numbers (<em>x</em>, 
              <em>y</em>) (on some recursive coding of all pairs of naturals) 
              then initialises the Turing machine to use the <em>x</em>th 
              transition table and sets the input tape to the <em>y</em>th 
              input tape (on some recursive coding of all finitely marked input 
              tapes). Since the coding guarantees that all (<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>) 
              pairs will be in this list (possibly using an ordering like the 
              triangular one above), each transition table, input pair will be 
              initialised at some point and every step of their computations will 
              be run.</span></p>
            <p><span>So far so good. We now have a machine that 
              will simulate all Turing machines on all finite inputs. The existence 
              of such a Turing machine is known, but not all that well known. 
              This is a shame, because it is a pretty amazing thing: in some ways 
              much more amazing than the Universal Turing machine. Firstly, it 
              computes all Turing computable functions (and evaluates them on 
              all inputs). Obviously it also semi-computes all Turing semi-computable 
              partial functions (it evaluates them on all inputs where there is 
              a defined answer). </span></p>
            <p><span>However, thinking of what it does in terms 
              of functions misses most of the glory of this machine. Consider 
              sorting a finite list of natural numbers. This is a Turing computable 
              function, but can be done in many ways. There is quick sort, merge 
              sort, insertion sort, selection sort, bubble sort, and all their 
              friends. The CTM doesn't just sort lists, it sorts them using each 
              and every one of these distinct algorithms. It even sorts them with 
              every subtle variation on each of these algorithms.</span></p>
            <p><span>At the first level of simulation, the CTM 
              simulates all and only Turing machines. What about programs in C? 
              Or functional and logical languages such as Haskell and Prolog? 
              Or unusual models of computation like neural nets. We might think 
              that there are algorithms that can be expressed in these types of 
              languages which can't be expressed on a Turing machine and we'd 
              like to simulate these too. Well, for each of these there is a Turing 
              machine that acts as an interpreter for that language, and there 
              is also a Turing machine that uses such an interpreter to run all 
              programs in that language on all inputs (analogous to the CTM itself). 
              So the CTM simulates a Turing machine which simulates all Haskell 
              programs and another which simulates all Prolog programs and another 
              which simulates all neural networks etc. The CTM's calculation thus 
              includes simulations of all programs in all Turing complete languages 
              and sub-Turing languages (most of which are yet to be invented) 
              which are run on all inputs, but they are nested one level down 
              — simulations inside simulations.</span></p>
            <p><span>The CTM also simulates physical phenomena. 
              If our universe is Turing computable, then it will be simulated 
              by this CTM. Indeed since there are infinitely many Turing machines 
              that express the same algorithm, it will be simulated infinitely 
              many times in parallel. The CTM will also simulate it with every 
              possible recursive set of initial conditions. In between these threads 
              will be simulations of the hailstone numbers, chess, tropical cyclones, 
              the game of life, lolcats, and this entire simulation itself. </span></p>
            <p><span><strong>Adding oracular computation</strong></span></p>
            <p><span>What can't a CTM simulate?</span></p>
            <p><span>I'm sure many readers will immediately 
              think of their favourite uncomputable function or process. Others 
              will think of counting arguments: there are only a countable infinity 
              of Turing machines and there are an uncountable infinity of processes, 
              so almost all of them must be impossible to simulate. For example, 
              consider an endless simulation of an empty room with a light bulb 
              that flashes on and off: for each one minute block of time, the 
              light stays on or stays off, but at the end of each minute it may 
              or may not change to the other state. There are uncountably many 
              such sequences of flashes, as they correspond directly to the infinite 
              bitstrings (e.g. a string where the <em>n</em>th bit is 1 if and 
              only if the light is on during the <em>n</em>th minute). There are 
              thus uncountably many lightbulb simulations, and so not enough Turing 
              machines to be able to simulate all of them. Similarly, there is 
              a lightbulb simulation whose pattern of flashes spells out a lookup 
              table for the halting problem and we're going to have a lot of trouble 
              simulating that one.</span></p>
            <p><span>This is a compelling argument. Surprisingly 
              it is wrong.</span></p>
            <p><span>It turns out that we can simulate all such 
              sequences of flashing lights so long as we do them simultaneously. 
              </span></p>
            <p><span>Let's start with two parallel simulations: 
              one with the light off for the first minute and one with it on. 
              We then fork each of these simulations, simulating both ways the 
              next minute could go. We continue in this way, forking all the existing 
              simulations at each stage and having an exponentially …</span></p></div></div>

            <p>If you’re a founder, you know that fundraising isn’t easy for pre-product or pre-revenue startups. Most venture funds don’t want to invest in companies that have no product or no traction. After all, startups at this stage have done very little to de-risk their businesses.</p><p>But, some VC’s look to invest in startups at this stage. These pre-seed investors want to write the first check to companies and founders they believe in. Often, they invest alongside angel investors and other pre-seed venture capital firms via convertible notes or SAFEs. Sometimes, they invest in companies on their own.</p><p>Several VC funds only back pre-seed startups. Others invest in a mix of pre-seed, seed, and Series A companies. <strong>To make it easier for you to raise a pre-seed round for your startup, we've compiled a list of investors who participate at this stage and you can view it below. </strong>If you'd like to download the full database of investors and their notable portfolio companies, you can purchase it below.</p><p>We'll continue to update this database as we find more VC’s who make pre-seed investments.

    <h2 id="the-boinc-project">The BOINC Project</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://boinc.berkeley.edu/">BOINC Project</a> (Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing) is a distributed-computing project created by the Berkeley University in 2002.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://dbeley.ovh/images/boinc_logo.png"> 
</figure>

<p>It allows volunteers to help scientific research by running scientific computing jobs on their computers in the background. The volunteers only need to download the BOINC client and to create an account for one or several BOINC projects.</p>
<p>Each BOINC project offers more or less resource-intensive computing units, which when completed by users, will reward them with a certain number of points. The BOINC credit system has an entire community around it, with teams, rankings and badges to earn.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://boinc.berkeley.edu/download.php">BOINC client</a> is compatible with Windows, Linux, MacOS and Android. Depending on the project, the computing units can be computed on CPU or GPU.</p>
<h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>
<p>BOINC projects come from diverse fields of research, such as mathematics, astrophysics and biology.
Some of the main BOINC projects are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/">Seti@Home</a> (Astrophysics): Project created by the Berkeley University to detect potential extraterrestrial signals. This was the first project to make use of the BOINC grid computing framework. It was closed on March 31, 2020.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://einsteinathome.org/">Einstein@Home</a> (Astrophysics): Project to detect gravitational waves. Einstein@home and its volunteers discovered dozens of new pulsars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/">World Community Grid</a> (Medicine, Ecology): Project created by IBM offering several sub-projects in the fields of Medicine and Ecology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/">Rosetta@Home</a> (Biology): Project by the Washington University seeking to create new proteins potentially useful in research against diseases. This project has recently received strong interest from the general public and the press during the Covid-19 pandemic by proposing units looking for potential antiviral proteins against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://quchempedia.univ-angers.fr/athome/">QuChemPedIa@Home</a> (Molecular Chemistry): Project by the Angers UniversitÃ© to create a new collaborative platform of quantum chemistry results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://boinc.thesonntags.com/collatz/">Collatz Conjecture</a> (Mathematics): Project created by Jon Sonntag trying to refute the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz%5Fconjecture">Collatz Conjecture</a>. This project uses AMD or Nvidia GPUs. It is also known as the project giving the most credits in relation to its calculation time.</p>
<p>A list of all available BOINC projects is available <a href="https://boinc.berkeley.edu/projects.php">here</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="settings">Settings</h3>
<p>On a computer, it is recommended to switch the interface to advance mode (<strong><em>View &gt; Advanced View</em></strong>).</p>
<p>It will then be possible to add a project in the menu <strong><em>Options &gt; Add project</em></strong>. The project tab will display the list of projects added to the BOINC client. Each BOINC project requires a different account (<strong><em>Project web pages &gt; Your account</em></strong>), you will have to go to each project website if you want to change your nickname or join a team.</p>
<p>BOINC also gives you the possibility to control very finely the use of your machine’s resources, in order not to overheat it or to leave computing power for other tasks.</p>
<p>You can totally stop calculations with <strong><em>Activity &gt; Suspend</em></strong> (and resume them with <strong><em>Activity &gt; Run based on preference</em></strong>). You can also control the use of the graphics processor with <strong><em>Activity &gt; Suspend GPU</em></strong> or <strong><em>Use GPU based on preferences</em></strong>).</p>
<p>More advanced options are available in <strong><em>Options &gt; Computing Preferences</em></strong>. The option “Use at most X% of processors” allows you to allocate a certain number of threads to BOINC. Thus, setting this option to 50% on a computer with 12 threads will allow BOINC to run 6 compute units simultaneously.</p>

<h2 id="teams-and-statistics">Teams and statistics</h2>
<p>One of the reasons for BOINC’s success is its community aspect. In addition to giving volunteers the opportunity to join a team (joining a team is done from the project websites), BOINC gives access to a large number of statistics.</p>
<h3 id="l-alliance-francophone">L’Alliance Francophone</h3>
<figure>
    <img src="https://dbeley.ovh/images/afbanner.png"> 
</figure>

<p><a href="https://www.boinc-af.org/">L’Alliance Francophone</a> (or AF) is one of BOINC’s oldest and largest teams. It is also the largest French-speaking team.
It is recommended that team members add the [AF] tag to their nickname to better recognize them. One of the particularities of this team is the great involvement of its members in the creation of various statistical tools. Thus, the <a href="https://statseb.boinc-af.org/">StatSeb</a> website offers tools and statistics specific to the Alliance Francophone.</p>
<h4 id="mini-teams">Mini-teams</h4>
<p>Mini-teams are a way to create sub-teams within the Alliance Francophone. Rankings and contests are available to allow members of the different mini-teams to compare themselves. This feature is not taken into account natively by BOINC and is only available on the statistics website <a href="https://statseb.boinc-af.org/classement%5Fmt.py">StatSeb</a>. It is also necessary to add to your nickname the team tag followed by the name of the mini-team in the form <strong><em>"[AF&gt;team] nickname”</em></strong> so the site can identify your mini-team. For example, my nickname is <strong><em>[AF&gt;Libristes] dbeley</em></strong>, indicating that I am a member of the AF and the Libristes mini-team.</p>
<h4 id="equirac">Equirac</h4>
<p>The RAC (or Recently Acquired Credit) is an index that calculates the weighted average over 30 days of credits obtained by a BOINC user. The total number of points as well as the RAC is highly dependent on how projects choose to credit users. Nothing will prevent a project from giving 10,000 points or 10 points for a calculation unit of one hour for example.</p>
<p>Thus, a user occasionally participating in Collatz Conjecture (the project that credits the most points, about 30,000 per compute unit ending in ~10 minutes on a mid-range GPU) will have many more points than a user focusing on more varied but less crediting projects.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://statseb.boinc-af.org/equirac.py">Equirac</a> is an index proposed to AF members trying to compensate for these differences in points crediting in order to reward users participating in projects with low credit and/or low popularity.
According to the description presenting Equirac on the <a href="https://statseb.boinc-af.org/">StatSeb</a> website:</p>
<p><em>“The principle is to reward members who crunch on projects that are not very popular in the AF, and which thus allow the diversification of the AF’s efforts on behalf of the FB (Formulab Boinc).</em>”.
<em>The AF’s RAC (weighted average of the last 30 days) is calibrated according to the most popular project from the point of view of the credits distributed</em>
<em>Standard will be the project with the highest RAC.</em>
<em>Currently the standard is Collatz Conjecture, but the name of the standard project may change over time, since the ACR is constantly fluctuating.
/A project with a RAC 10 times lower than that of the standard project will be assigned a coefficient of 10.</em>
/This coefficient will be applied to the actual CAR of each cruncher working on this project.
<em>Each Cruncher of this project will therefore have the 10 multiplier on his RAC.
/This multiplier, multiplied to the real RAC will give a new indicator of measurement: an EquiRAC."</em></p>
<p>It is thus possible to reach the top of the Equirac ranking relatively easily by working on unpopular projects with a strong gratifier.</p>
<h3 id="statistical-tools">Statistical tools</h3>
<p>BOINC offers a number of statistical tools available on the following websites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.boincstats.com/">BoincStats</a>: It also allows to remotely control a fleet of computers connected to BOINC thanks to the BAM account manager (not covered in this article).</li>
<li><a href="https://statseb.boinc-af.org/">StatSeb</a> : Developed by a member of the Alliance Francophone, this is the website where the Equirac index is located.</li>
<li><a href="https://statsbzh.boinc-af.org/listteams.php">SetiBZH</a> : Another website developed by a member of the Alliance Francophone, it unfortunately requires Flash for some graphic elements.</li>
<li><a href="https://stats.free-dc.org/stats.php?page=index">Free-DC</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="formula-boinc">Formula Boinc</h4>
<p>The <a href="http://formula-boinc.org/">Formula Boinc</a> is a competition between teams on the model of a Formula 1 championship. Every year, teams compete in sprints (like a Formula 1 weekend) and marathons (year-round competitions). The accreditation of points follows the model of Formula 1 (1st place: 25 points, 2nd: 18 points, 3rd: 15 points, etc.). The competition has expanded over the years and now counts 3 leagues of different levels.</p>

<h2 id="boinc-for-heating-your-home">BOINC for heating your home</h2>
<p>If you heat yourself with electricity using electric radiators, using the BOINC project on your computer to heat yourself can be interesting.
Obviously, if you have central heating or use more environmentally friendly processes (heat pump, geothermal, etc.) or if your electricity comes from carbon sources (coal, fuel oil, etc.), using BOINC for heating may not be a good idea.</p>
<p>In fact, an electric radiator being a simple resistance, the electricity will only be used to create heat. In the case of a computer, the electricity used to make calculations (scientific calculations for example) will be used to make the same amount of heat. We can consider as negligible the creation of light energy (leds) and mechanical energy (movement of fans to better diffuse the heat).</p>
<p>A little reminder about the power consumption of a computer: this varies according to the load of the computer and is not dependent on the power supply (or PSU). Too often we hear “my computer has a 600W power supply, hence it consumes 600W”. In this case the power supply will be able to provide a maximum of 600W to the computer, but it can consume less (computers that actually consume 600W under load are extremely rare).</p>
<p>The advantage of a radiator is that it is silent, never wears out and costs much less than a computer (with the same heat output). The computer will have for him the utility of its energy consumption, as well as a better diffusion of heat in the air and a more direct heat creation.</p>
<p>Indeed, most electric radiators are placed under windows to optimize the use of space. This may not be an optimal location if the windows are poorly insulated. A computer is much better located, as it is usually placed next to the user.</p>
<p>You should also be careful that the temperatures of your computer are not too high so it won’t cause premature wear of components.</p>
<h3 id="the-boinc-project-compared-to-electric-heating">The BOINC project compared to electric heating</h3>
<h4 id="pros">Pros:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Same energy efficiency (1W of electricity consumed = 1W of heat)</li>

  <section>
    <p>This paper published originally in <em>IEEE Transactions on Communications</em> in 1974 setup the stage for internet. The protocol described here, TCP/IP, is basically how internet works to the day. Work around this paper earned the authors a Turing award. The papers remains highly relevant and readable to the day. Yellow highlights/annotations are my own. You can <a onclick="disableHighlight()" href="#">disable them.</a></p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>A protocol that supports the sharing of resources that exist in different
packet switching networks is presented. The protocol provides for variation
in individual network packet sizes, transmission failures, sequencing, flow
control, end-to-end error checking, and the creation and destruction of
logical process-to-process connections. Some implementation issues are
considered, and problems such as internetwork routing, accounting, and
timeouts are exposed.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>In the last few years considerable effort has been expended on the design
and implementation of packet switching networks [l]-[7],[14],[17]. A
principle reason for developing such networks has been to facilitate the
sharing of computer resources. A packet communication network includes a
transportation mechanism for delivering data between computers or between
computers and terminals. To make the data meaningful, computers and
terminals share a common protocol (i.e., a set of agreed upon conventions).
Several protocols have already been developed for this purpose
[8]-[12],[16]. However, these protocols have addressed only the problem of
communication on the same network. <span>In this paper we
present a protocol design and philosophy that supports the sharing of
resources that exist in different packet switching networks.</span></p>

<p>After a brief introduction to internetwork protocol issues, we describe the
function of a <em>gateway</em> as an interface between networks and discuss its
role in the protocol. We then consider the various details of the protocol,
including addressing, formatting, buffering, sequencing, flow control, error
control, and so forth. We close with a description of an interprocess
communication mechanism and show how it can be supported by the internetwork
protocol.</p>

<p>Even though many different and complex problems must be solved in the design
of an individual packet switching network, these problems are manifestly
compounded when dissimilar networks are interconnected. Issues arise which
may have no direct counterpart in an individual network and which strongly
influence the way in which internetwork communication can take place.</p>

<p><span>A typical packet switching network is composed of a set
of computer resources called  <em>hosts</em>, a set of one or more <em>packet
switches</em>, and a collection of communication media that interconnect the
packet switches. Within each host, we assume that there exist <em>processes</em>
which must communicate with processes in their own or other hosts.</span>
Any current definition of a process will be adequate for our purposes [13].
These processes are generally the ultimate source and destination of data in
the network. Typically, within an individual network, there exists a
protocol for communication between any source and destination process. Only
the source and destination processes require knowledge of this convention
for communication to take place. Processes in two distinct networks would
ordinarily use different protocols for this purpose. The ensemble of packet
switches and communication media is called the <em>packet switching subnet</em>.
Fig. 1 illustrates these ideas.</p>

</figure>

<p>In a typical packet switching subnet, data of a fixed maximum size are
accepted from a source host, together with a formatted destination address
which is used to route the data in a store and forward fashion. The transmit
time for this data is usually dependent upon internal network parameters
such as communication media data rates, buffering and signaling strategies,
routing, propagation delays, etc. In addition, some mechanism is generally
present for error handling and determination of status of the networks
components.</p>

<p>Individual packet switching networks may differ in their implementations as follows.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Each network may have distinct ways of addressing the receiver, thus
requiring that a uniform addressing scheme be created which can be
understood by each individual network.</li>
  <li>Each network may accept data of different maximum size, thus requiring
networks to deal in units of the smallest maximum size (which may he
impractically small) or requiring procedures which allow data crossing a
network boundary to be reformatted into smaller pieces.</li>
  <li>The success or failure of a transmission and its performance in each
network is governed by different time delays in accepting, delivering,
and transporting the data. This requires careful development of
internetwork timing procedures to insure that data can be successfully
delivered through the various networks.</li>
  <li>Within each network, communication may be disrupted due to unrecoverable
mutation of the data or missing data. End-to-end restoration procedures
are desirable to allow complete recovery from these conditions.</li>
  <li>Status information, routing, fault detection, and isolation are typically
different in each network. Thus, to obtain verification of certain
conditions, such as an inaccessible or dead destination, various kinds of
coordination must be invoked between the communicating networks.</li>
</ol>

<p><mark>It would be extremely convenient if all the differences between networks
could be economically  resolved by suitable interfacing at the network
boundaries.</mark> For many of the differences, this objective can be achieved.
However, both economic and technical considerations lead us to prefer that
the interface be as simple and reliable as possible and deal primarily with
passing data between networks that use different packet switching
strategies.</p>

<p>The question now arises as to whether the interface ought to account for
differences in host or process level protocols by transforming the source
conventions into the corresponding destination conventions. We obviously
want to allow  conversion between packet switching strategies at  the
interface, to permit interconnection of existing and planned networks.
However, <span>the complexity and dissimilarity of the host or process level
protocols makes it desirable to avoid having to transform between them at
the interface, even if this transformation were always possible.</span> Rather,
compatible host and process level protocols must be developed to achieve
effective internetwork resource sharing. The unacceptable alternative is for
every host or process to implement every protocol (a potentially unbounded
number) that may be needed to communicate with other networks. We therefore
assume that a common protocol is to be used between hosts or processes in
different networks and that the interface between networks should take as
small a role as possible in this protocol.</p>

<p>To allow networks under different ownership to interconnect, some accounting
will undoubtedly be needed for traffic that passes across the interface. In
its simplest terms, this involves an accounting of packets handled by each
net for which charges are passed from net to net until the buck finally
stops at the user or his representative. Furthermore, the interconnection
must preserve intact the internal operation of each individual network. This
is easily achieved if two networks interconnect as if each were a host to
the other network, but without utilizing or indeed incorporating any
elaborate host protocol transformations.</p>

<p>It is thus apparent that the <span>interface between networks must play a central
role in the development of any network interconnection strategy. We give a
special name to this interface that performs these functions and call it a
<em>Gateway</em>.</span></p>

<h2 id="the-gateway-notion">The Gateway Notion</h2>

<p>In Fig. 2 we illustrate three individual networks labeled A, B, and C which
are joined by gateways M and N gateway interfaces network A with network B,
and gateway N interfaces network B to network C. We assume that an
individual network may have more than one gateway (e.g., network B) and that
there may be more than one gateway path to use in going between a pair of
networks. The responsibility for properly routing data resides in the
gateway.</p>

</span>

</figure>

<p>In practice, a gateway between two networks may be composed of two halves,
each associated with its own network. It is possible to implement each half
of a gateway so it need only embed internetwork packets in local packet
format or extract them. We propose that the gateways handle internetwork
packets in a standard format, but we are not proposing any particular transmission procedure between gateway halves.</p>

<p>Let us now trace the flow of data through the inter connected networks. We
assume a packet of data from process X enters network A destined for process
Y in network C. The address of Y is initially specified by process X and the
address of gateway M is derived from the address of process Y. We make no
attempt to specify whether the choice of gateway is made by process X, its
host, or one of the packet switches in network A. The packet traverses
network A until it reaches gateway M. At the gateway, the packet is reformatted
to meet the requirements of network B, account is taken of this unit of flow
between A and B, and the gateway delivers the packet to network B. Again the
derivation of the next gateway address is accomplished based on the address of
the destination Y. In this case, gateway N is the next one. The packet
traverses network B until it finally reached gateway N where it is formatted
to meet the requirement of network C. Account is again taken of this unit
of flow between networks B and C. Upon entering network C the packet is
routed to the host in …</p></section></article></div>

November 22, 2020 | https://www.gtf.io/musings/content-creativity-monetisation/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.gtf.io/musings/content-creativity-monetisation/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>I miss the Old Internet. I miss the terrible flash games, raw vlogs,
websites with bad styling and unpolished content. This is despite the
fact that they were overloaded with visual noise — full of pictures,
marquee text, and design decisions that should never have seen the
light of day — and were much more limited in functionality. When
comparing to what we have now, where I can access a smorgasbord of
media, journalism, and services, the early web was ugly, difficult to
use, and lacked much of the utility that today we take for granted.</p>
<p>In reality, this nostalgia for the internet of my teenagedom is not
really about a direct comparison of the quality of the content<sup id="fnref-1" title="By &quot;content&quot;, I mean everything that people produce
online, so that could be articles on newspaper websites, blog posts in
individual or syndicated blogs, videos on YouTube and Vimeo, imagery
from DeviantArt or Instagram, or even Tumblr, and online games."><a href="#fn-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. It is really about what we have steadily lost in the
modern era of highly monetised, polished, and carefully tuned content
creation.</p>
<p>When the web started to be more widely adopted, and blogs started to
be published (normally the work of just a single author) in the 1990s,
it was an amazingly egalitarian platform. It was not democratic in all
dimensions as it required some technical knowledge to successfully
run a website, not to mention the hardware and infrastructure that
was unavailable outside wealthier areas in wealthy countries. The
lack of any dominant content platforms like YouTube and Medium<sup id="fnref-2" title="And, arguably, Google which, while not a platform, has such
control over people's access to content that it could be counted in
the same category."><a href="#fn-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, however, meant that there were no
gatekeepers, and no platform owners who could change the rules. No-one
was there to make rulings on what could and could not be published, what
would and would not be seen.</p>
<p>Hyperlinks between documents stored on servers allowed users to discover
a wide range of content produced by a diversity of people who had no
particular affiliation to one another. Those hyperlinks were not created
by consensus, or by a publisher, but by the individual content creators
themselves. As such it was possible to discover a whole realm of content
without any directing force. This is what made the web what it was,
and such ideas are under threat both from <a href="#citation-6" title="Oettinger's copyright reform proposal is unfit for the digital age">the stupidity of legislators  [6]</a> and our own forgetting,
thanks to the ubiquity of publishing platforms which seek to keep users
within their walls.</p>
<p>These platforms have had some positive social impacts, for example
circumventing authoritarian governments as with Twitter in Iran. In
the context of a mostly free society, however, their (increasing)
editorial control and ubiquity threatens the creativity and freedom
of the web. There is also an increasing trend of these platforms <a href="#citation-8" title="Google China Prototype Links Searches to Phone Numbers">capitulating to the demands of authoritarian
governments [8]</a> around the world, making them complicit in
locking subjugated populations out of the world of free (as in speech)
information.</p>
<p>While the printing press allowed the wide dissemination of material to
consumers outside of elite control, the early web completed the other
side of this process, opening up content creation to anyone with a
terminal (or a nearby internet café). Internet cafés in particular were
like the libraries of the early web — not everyone could afford their
own, but many people could afford to <a href="#citation-7" title="The Weird, Sketchy History of Internet Cafes">gain some access through a communal service [7]</a> (although
this was not globally true).</p>
<p>The audiences of the printing press and early web were, on the face
of it, quite dissimilar. The printing press allowed the dissemination
of material embargoed by those in power (mostly the Church), for
example English-language bibles. By contrast, the early internet was
not primarily used as a method of circumventing content bans amongst
dissenters (although there was a certain degree of this, for example
with the sharing of hard-to-access or copyrighted material). What these
did have in common, however, was that they were being used to distribute
content amongst consumers in a non-commercial sense — this was
information production and consumption for the sake of the information,
rather than for a financial model.</p>
<p>The result was a wild and anarchic jumble of content, often heavily
experimental spawning a wide variety of subcultures and niche interest
groups. Much of the content from this period was relatively unfiltered
and very unpolished. The fact that the web was less centralised and that
social media had not yet birthed the VirtuMob(TM) meant that people
could express themselves more freely and could experiment with ideas
and content (which is not to say that there were not a number of <a href="#citation-9" title="Brass Eye: &quot;Paedogeddon!&quot; Special (2001)">moral panics [9]</a> and the like).</p>
<p>The web of today is quite a different story. Of course there are still
individual blogs (like this one), and it is far from impossible to
launch your own content on your own platform as the architecture of
the internet has not fundamentally changed from that perspective,
but we have seen two worrying trends (one caused by the other). The
first is the increasing monetisation of content via advertising on the
internet. Some content creators make <a href="#citation-1" title="This Guy Makes Millions Playing Video Games on YouTube">huge
amounts of money [1]</a> in advertising revenue. The second trend,
related to the first given the advertising model of the internet, is the
centralisation of content in a limited number of platforms like YouTube,
Facebook, Medium, and even Wikipedia<sup id="fnref-3" title="Wikipedia is a very
different type of platform, given that it is inherently informational, and there
is normally a 1:1 relationship between that for which a user is searching and
the articles themselves. It is also not supported by advertising, and is
volunteer run. Nevertheless it is worth mentioning as it has become the
predominant knowledge repository online."><a href="#fn-3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>There is a tension here, in that access to publishing (and even the
web itself) was much more restricted to the well-off and those with
specialist knowledge (like how to host a blog), and access to hardware
and infrastructure. In that sense the earlier web was less democratic,
but for those who were able to publish and consume content (arguably,
therefore, an elite), the web was far more egalitarian. Content was
weighted more equally in the absence of data-driven search engines
and publishing and dissemination platforms (like Google, Facebook,
and Twitter) which control “feeds” of information. This tension
is inevitable, as the democratisation or opening-up of the web to
increasing numbers of publishers and consumers drove the potential
for monetisation, which then decreased the openness and balance of
the entire ecosystem. Thus as this open and egalitarian space was
“democratised” by being opened up to the wider population, the same
features that made is open and egalitarian also created the space and
incentives for the platforms that would eventually cause a reversal in
this openness and freedom.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is the case that it is only really possible to have freedom
of creativity amongst some form of elite or restricted group. This is
rather an uncomfortable conclusion but there are some obvious reasons
for it. Wider accessibility means that the majority consumer is not in
the early-adopter category, and therefore has a different tolerance to
new ideas and imperfect content. There is often a sense of snobbery
accompanying talk of “mass” or “common” markets, but it seems to be
inherently true that anything made for a wider market will both be
influenced by primarily economic forces (rather than producers operating
according to some other motivator), as well as consumed primarily by
those with little patience for the experimental.</p>

</figure>


<p>Since 2000, the monetisation of content on the internet has <a href="#citation-2" title="IAB Internet Advertising Revenue Report">increased massively [2]</a>, from $8.23B in 2000
to $88B in 2017. The huge increase in advertising revenue over this
period could be down to some combination of three factors: increased
internet adoption resulting in more views and therefore clicks on
adverts; improved advertising technology, providing a higher conversion
rate as well as more placement opportunities; and finally, increased
awareness and adoption from advertisers resulting in a higher overall
budget allocation.</p>
<p>As advertising revenue has increased, there is a resulting increase
in the incentive to create content with which to draw users in. This
has two results: platform centralisation, and content optimisation and
convergence.</p>
<p>Platform centralisation is a fairly obvious effect of this, since
dominating the space provides a multiplier effect on the increasing
revenue to be gained. This drive towards a monopoly happens in
many markets, but the difference in this one is that the market is
advertising, whereas the effect is on the content platforms. We expect
advertising revenue to support content platforms, but in reality content
is merely a hook to provide consumers for advertising.</p>
<p>While the centralisation of these platforms has made it easier for a
wider array of people to publish content online (thus increasing the
democratisation of the web), it also means that there are a smaller
number of gatekeepers of content, and whether a piece of content gets
seen by a given user is now dictated by a dwindling number of these
gatekeepers. Platforms are heavily incentivised to funnel content
that they believe is most likely to keep a user on the platform,
thereby generating more advertising revenue, as well as to use <a href="#citation-4" title="'Our minds can be hijacked': the tech insiders who fear a smartphone dystopia">psychological tricks [4]</a> to <a href="#citation-5" title="Ex-Facebook president Sean Parker: site made to exploit human 'vulnerability'">keep users engaged [5]</a>. This is
well illustrated by <a href="#citation-3" title="Micro-targeted digital porn is changing human sexuality">an article in aeon about
online pornography [3]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Powered by ad revenue, the tube sites felt an economic tug to draw
more people to their sites for longer chunks of time. Since they had –
at least initially – no control over content creation, the name of the
game on tube sites for the past few years was content funnelling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, as the platforms centralise and increase the efficacy of
their content funnelling, driving increased advertising revenues,
content creators are incentivised to produce content that the big
data machine suggests will maximise viewership and engagement. The
result is that content experimentation and diversity now carries a high
cost in terms of lost revenues. Whilst previously there was a cost
associated with a “flop”, for example a movie taking in low earnings
at the box office, it was much harder to know what would flop and what
would succeed. The introduction of large datasets (“big data”) on user
behaviour and tastes (although it is difficult to say how accurate the
analyses resulting from these datasets really are) has meant that it is
now much easier for content …</p></div></div>

<img src="https://blog.zdsmith.com/images/offenbacher.jpg" alt="The Offenbacher Schrift Alphabet">
<figcaption>The Offenbacher Schrift Alphabet</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Above is a sample of <em>Offenbacher Schrift</em>, a style of handwriting
designed by the type designer (and, regrettably, enthusiastic German
nationalist), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Koch">Rudolf
Koch</a>. Offenbacher Schrift
was arguably the final incarnation of the venerable German handwriting
style known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurrent">Kurrent</a>, a
tradition particular to German-speaking areas for hundreds of years,
up until the Nazis fucked it up in some historically interesting
ways. It’s closely related also to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%BCtterlin">Sütterlin</a>, which was
the dominant form of Kurrent in its final flowering.</p>

<p>One of the attractive and interesting qualities of the Kurrent
scripts, especially in comparison to English cursive, is their
abhorrence of re-crossing and overlapping lines. For instance, the
lower-case <em>c</em>: <a href="https://loopsandtails.com/cursive/cc/">in English cursive</a>, the pen, starting
from the lower-left, slopes up to the top part of the c, and then
doubles back along the same line to make the bottom part. This is
studiously avoided in the Sütterlinschrift, which opts for the single
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minim_(palaeography)">minim</a>. </p>

<p>It’s also this quality that is responsible for Offenbacher’s most
extravagant peculiarities. There’s a lot that’s attractive about it
(I’m someone who also has a lot of difficulty with those parts of the
letter that have to cross over each other; when writing in cursive, I
usually pick up the pen and start again when I have to write an <em>a</em>,
<em>c</em>, <em>d</em>, <em>g</em>—in other words, when I have to cross from the bottom
left to the upper right in order to start a letter), but unmodified,
Kurrent is a little too eccentric to the Anglophone eye. </p>

<p>Let’s take a look at the eccentrics, <em>a</em> <em>g</em> <em>q</em>:</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://blog.zdsmith.com/images/offenbacher-agq.png" alt="Offenbacher: a, g, q">
<figcaption>Offenbacher: a, g, q</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And <em>r</em> <em>v</em> <em>w</em> <em>y</em>: </p>

<figure>
<img src="https://blog.zdsmith.com/images/offenbacher-rvwy.png" alt="Offenbacher: r, v, w, y">
<figcaption>Offenbacher: r, v, w, y</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We can see what’s happening here. In each case, the letter has
acquired a little gap in it: in the top row, it bows downwards, and in
the bottom row, it bows upwards, but in each case, the hand needs to
establish a bit of distance between a straight stroke and a curve in
order to ensure they don’t abut each other. </p>

<p><img src="https://blog.zdsmith.com/images/offenbacher-agq-arrows.png" alt="Offenbacher: a, g, q">
<img src="https://blog.zdsmith.com/images/offenbacher-rvwy-arrows.png" alt="Offenbacher: r, v, w, y"> </p>

<p>For my needs, this is the mania against the intermingling of lines
taken to an unhealthy extreme. I want to avoid having to pass over a
letter’s body in order to start it; on other hand, I’m perfectly
comfortable with the round bit and the straight bit of my <em>y</em> rubbing
up against each other. It’s the year 2020, after all.</p>

<p>Luckily for us, the regular construction of the script means we can
apply an equally regular simplification. We can simply eliminate the
gap in each of the above cases, and the regularity of it guarantees
that we won’t end up with a mangled or inconsistent script.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://blog.zdsmith.com/images/offenbacher-all-letters.png" alt="Offenbacher, before and after">
<figcaption>Offenbacher, before and after</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This strikes me as a very fine compromise, having kept a lot of the
regularity and cleanliness that I like out of Kurrent while making the
letters generally a little simpler and more recognizable.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of the whole thing put together:</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://blog.zdsmith.com/images/offenbacher-pangram.png" alt="An Offenbacher pangram">
<figcaption>An Offenbacher pangram</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="postscriptum">POSTSCRIPTUM</h3>

<p>I’d like to offer one alternate rendering: </p>

<p>Arguably, the one outlier in the above is the treatment of <em>r</em>. It’s
not necessarily that I don’t think the principle applies—I think
that the short, bowed stroke on the bottom is a gap inserted to avoid
the downstroke and the upstroke intermingling, and I think it can be
eliminated in exactly the same way as the others are—it’s just that
the <em>r</em> character is so minimal that, by accident or not, the
gap-stroke is much more prominent in that letter than in the
others. Especially when you consider that the last stroke, the curving
one after the upstroke, will be the connector to the next letter (if
the <em>r</em> isn’t last), one could make the argument that, visually
speaking, the gap-stroke of the <em>r</em> becomes the dominant graphical
feature of the letter and to eliminate it is to fundamentally alter
its character. </p>

<p>In the spirit of that possible objection, I want to offer an
alternative in the form of the <em><a href="https://www.vhmmlschool.org/latin-insular">insular r</a></em>, ꞃ, which I have
plucked out of its Irish origin and found to be a good match:</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://blog.zdsmith.com/images/offenbacher-insular-r.png" alt="Offenbacher with the insular r">
<figcaption>Offenbacher with the insular r</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It works very well because its construction is almost identical to
that of the Kurrent <em>e</em>, with its two upright strokes and its
connecting stroke beginning midway-or-greater up the first one<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote">[1]</a>. In
the case of the insular r, we simply give the first stroke a
descender. The degree to which the two share a character—while being
very clearly distinguishable—tells me that the substitution is quite
a natural one.</p>

<p>The Casio F-91W is one of the most iconic watches of the past few decades. It’s notoriously cheap, reliable, and retro; in fact, it’s probably the only watch that was worn by both <a href="https://static.highsnobiety.com/thumbor/hC8faiWSsiFpNpszRf0lb7yAkIA=/fit-in/960x550/smart/static.highsnobiety.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Casio_F-91W_terrorist-002.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Obama</a> <em>and</em> <a href="http://ethiopiaforums.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/osama-bin-laden-seated.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Osama</a>. At just under $10, it’s the perfect daily beater watch. And in the age where you need to charge your Apple Watch every day, the Casio’s battery can last up to a decade. Still, though, it has a few downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>The resin strap is liable to break</li>
<li>The watch is barely water resistant</li>
</ul>
<p>The former is easily rectified by switching to a vinyl or leather NATO strap; but what about the latter? Is there any way to turn the F-91W into a deep sea diver?</p>
<h2>The Magic of Fluid Incompressibility</h2>
<p>Fluids are said to be “virtually incompressible.” Generally speaking, a gas (like air) is compressible: when pressure increases, volume decreases. The compressibility factor \(\beta\) may be expressed as</p>
<p>$$\beta = -\frac{1}{V}\frac{\partial V}{\partial p}$$</p>
<p>where \(V\) is volume and \(p\) is pressure. A trick to achieve incredible depth ratings has been to submerge the internals of a watch in inert, non-reactive, non-corrosive, non-polar liquids. Mineral oil (a byproduct of petroleum refinement) is a fantastic choice — and this is exactly what I’ll be doing to my Casio F-91W. Theoretically, as water pressure increases around the watch, due to the fact that it’s filled with an incompressible liquid (as opposed to a compressible gas), it can successfully “push back” against the water and it will not succumb to implosion due to increasing pressures.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Preparing the watch</h3>
<p>First, we take off the stock resin straps and wipe off the watch of excess oils and debris.</p>
<p><img src="http://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0004.jpg" alt="" width="3888" height="2592" srcset="https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0004.jpg 3888w, https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0004-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0004-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0004-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 3888px) 100vw, 3888px"></p><h3>Step 2: Unscrew the back plate</h3>
<p>We next unscrew the back plate and remove the watch internals, also removing the white tape on the back of the battery compartment. All parts are wiped carefully with with rubbing alcohol.</p>
<p><img src="http://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0011.jpg" alt="" width="3888" height="2592" srcset="https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0011.jpg 3888w, https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0011-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0011-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0011-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 3888px) 100vw, 3888px"></p><h3>Step 3: Fill bowl with mineral oil</h3>
<p>Some sources suggest heating the mineral oil to ~50° Centigrade, but I’m not exactly sure what the reasoning for that might be, so I stuck with room temperature. For some extra flair, I added a fat-soluble colorant which will give the viewport a nice bluish tint and set it apart from a stock F-91W.</p>
<p><img src="http://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0022.jpg" alt="" width="3888" height="2592" srcset="https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0022.jpg 3888w, https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0022-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0022-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0022-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 3888px) 100vw, 3888px"></p><h3>Step 4: Submerge</h3>
<p>Slowly submerge all watch parts in the mineral oil. Ensure that there are no air bubbles in either the watch chassis or electronic internals. Leave watch submerged while mixing slowly for a few minutes to make sure there are no air bubbles.</p>
<p><img src="http://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0025.jpg" alt="" width="3888" height="2592" srcset="https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0025.jpg 3888w, https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0025-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0025-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0025-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 3888px) 100vw, 3888px"></p><h3>Step 5: Re-assemble the watch</h3>
<p>Re-assemble the watch by securing the back-plate via the Phillips screws while submerged in the oil. Make sure no air bubbles accidentally form while screwing in the screws.</p>
<p><img src="http://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0027.jpg" alt="" width="3888" height="2592" srcset="https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0027.jpg 3888w, https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0027-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0027-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0027-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 3888px) 100vw, 3888px"></p><p>Here, you’ll notice I decided to switch to a reddish tint after my first failed attempt.</p>
<h3>Step 6: Extract watch and clean</h3>
<p>Remove the assembled watch from the oil mixture and wipe it down, cleaning any excess oil. Add a fancy strap, and <em>et voila</em>!<br>
<img src="http://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0039.jpg" alt="" width="3888" height="2592" srcset="https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0039.jpg 3888w, https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0039-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0039-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_0039-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 3888px) 100vw, 3888px"></p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>If you decide to use colorant, as I did, keep in mind this will effectively reduce visibility to zero and it will be very difficult (but not impossible) navigating the murky oil solution by touch alone. Also, keep in mind that after this procedure the F-91W’s nigh-useless LED light will be even more useless due to the oil’s refractive index. Finally, even though mineral oil is “virtually incompressible,” it’s still <em>technically</em> compressible. Professional dive watches filled with oil will often have a flexible chassis that will allow for around a \(\pm0.5\%/1000\text{psi}\) wiggle room in volume to account for this compression at high ambient pressures.</p>
<p>So what kind of pressure can my little Casio handle? I don’t have any way of testing, but <a href="http://mygshock.com/2008/10/13/g-shock-hydro-conversion-pressure-test-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a similar experiment (on a Casio G-Shock)</a> allowed for pressures of up to 1200PSI, so I would expect similar numbers out of my watch. Another enthusiast did this experiment on an <a href="https://www.thewatchsite.com/34-watchmaking-tinkering/8273-superlative-oil-filled-f-91wthe-making-superlative-oil-filled-casio-f-91-a.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">F-91W with olive oil</a>. However, olive oil will oxidize, so if you’ll give this a try, I would suggest a synthetic compound.</p>
<p>Overall, this was a fun little project and not a bad way to spend a lazy Sunday.</p>

                        <p>Symmetric encryption with a default key on Ubiquiti’s UniFi network devices combined with remotely-hosted UniFi Controllers leads to risk of undetectable observation of network configuration and usage data.</p>
<h2 id="overview-of-unifis-inform-protocol">Overview of UniFi’s “inform” protocol</h2>
<p>Ubiquiti’s UniFi product line consists of routers, switches, and WiFi access points.</p>
<p>These devices do not have any local management, instead relying on controller software<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> running locally or hosted remotely.</p>
<p>Devices discover their controller<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> through a combination of broadcast traffic on the local network, DHCP option 43, and trying to resolve the hostname <code>unifi</code>.
In the case of option 43 or resolution of the <code>unifi</code> hostname, the device will attempt to communicate with the controller by sending a HTTP POST request to <code>[ADDR]:8080/inform</code>.</p>
<p>This POST request contains a JSON payload<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> and is repeated every 30 seconds. Controllers respond with a JSON payload containing configuration data, commands, or instructions to check in at a later time.</p>

<p>When sending JSON-encoded data to an API endpoint, one might expect to see a MIME type of <code>application/json</code> combined with HTTP over TLS. This is not the case.</p>
<p>Instead, the JSON payload is encrypted with AES in GCM or CBC mode depending on the combination of device and firmware version, wrapped with a bespoke binary protocol<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> and transferred without benefit of TLS<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The encryption key used prior to adoption by a controller is the md5sum of <code>ubnt</code><sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.</p>
<p>During the adoption process, the controller generates a new key and sends it to the device as a inform response along with any other initial configuration data. Consequently, anyone observing network traffic during the adoption process can observe any future traffic between the device and controller.</p>
<p>Operators have been questioning<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> Ubiquiti’s decision to not utilize TLS by default for several years. Eventually Ubiquiti removed<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> the ability for operators to force usage of TLS for inform traffic.</p>

<p>Network configuration data by itself can be considered sensitive but does not directly impact user privacy.
Unfortunately, inform traffic also contains data that can identify specific devices in place and time. With a UniFi router, it can associate browsing activity with a device’s mac and IP addresses.</p>
<h2 id="switches">Switches</h2>
<p>Switch tables contain MAC addresses of user devices and can be used to associate a user with a location.</p>
<p>See: <a href="https://jade.wtf/words/unifi-l3inform-crypto/inform-switch.json">example inform</a> from a USW-PRO-24 running firmware 4.0.64.10823.</p>
<h2 id="wifi-access-points">WiFi Access Points</h2>
<p>MAC addresses of users, data on neighboring WiFi AP signal strength provides sufficient information to geolocate the AP<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> using commonly available services.</p>
<p>See: <a href="https://jade.wtf/words/unifi-l3inform-crypto/inform-ap.json">example inform</a> from a UAP Flex HD running firmware 4.0.42.10433.</p>
<h2 id="routers-unifi-security-gateway">Routers (UniFi Security Gateway)</h2>
<p>Router inform contains DPI, DHCP, and ARP tables that can be used to associate a device with usage of specific applications such as Facebook and Spotify.</p>
<p>Exerpt showing DPI update for a host (<code>app</code> and <code>cat</code> correspond to application and category identifiers used in the controller dashboard):</p>

     <span>]</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Reliance on symmetric encryption means that anyone that possesses the key can observe inform traffic. This traffic contains information that, if disclosed, could have an adverse effect on users of the network.</p>
<h2 id="surveillance-and-targeting">Surveillance and targeting</h2>
<p>An aid worker installs a UniFi switch in a refugee camp. They use a UniFi controller hosted in a cloud VM for remote monitoring and management.
It’s easy for an adversary to monitor<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> these internet connection. The adversary gathers end-user device MAC addresses<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> from the switch table data contained in the inform message. How parties to a conflict could use such data is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>
<h2 id="location-discovery-via-passive-observation-or-dns-hijacking">Location discovery via passive observation or DNS hijacking</h2>
<p>Someone acquires a UniFi WiFi access point (AP) and installs it on their home network. They didn’t realize that a controller was required and order a UniFi cloud key controller, but did not unplug the AP while waiting for the controller to arrive.</p>
<p>Their internet provider uses wildcard DNS monetization<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> to show ads on domain names that do not exist. This leads to the <code>unifi</code> hostname resolving to the monetization provider’s server. Because of privacy regulations the ISP is prohibited from giving detailed information (such as physical location) to the ad provider, so the ad provider is incentivized to find ways to geolocate clients to deliver more targeted ads.</p>
<p>The neighboring networks / interference avoidance data included in the AP’s inform message contains sufficient information to utilize WiFi-based geolocation to associate the IP address with a physical address.</p>

<p>To demonstrate the feasibility of information extraction, I built a tool to automate information extraction from Unifi inform packets: <a href="https://github.com/jda/pixiedust">pixiedust</a>.</p>
<p>In key extraction mode, pixiedust follows inform traffic and learns keys as devices are provisioned or reconfigured.</p>

<h2 id="short-term">Short-term</h2>
<p>Operators should ensure that traffic between UniFi devices and controllers is protected by a site-to-site VPN when traversing untrusted networks.</p>
<h2 id="long-term">Long-term</h2>
<p>Use TLS. Even self-signed certificates are better than the current state because you can log certificate IDs to detect MITM.</p>
<p>Inform messages should contain the minimum information necessary for adoption until after the device has been paired with a controller to prevent inadvertent disclosure of network configuration and personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>All UniFi devices to date are affected, except for the UniFi Dream Machine (UDM) product line (including UDM Pro).
The UDM series are not affected because they run a local instance of the controller software and cannot use a remotely hosted controller,
so there is no opportunity for an attacker to eavesdrop on UDM🡘controller communication.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2><p>Traditionally services were deployed on bare metal and in the last decades we have seen the rise of virtualisation (running additional operating systems in a operating system process) and lately containerisation (running an operating system process in a separate security context from the rest of processes on the same host). Virtualisation and containerisation offers different levels of isolation by moving some operating system functionality to the guest systems.</p><p>The following chart illustrates that pretty well:</p><p><img src="https://dev.l1x.be/img/isolation.png" alt="OS functionality location"></p><p>Source: <a href="https://research.cs.wisc.edu/multifacet/papers/vee20_blending.pdf">https://research.cs.wisc.edu/multifacet/papers/vee20_blending.pdf</a></p><p>In this article, I perform a deep dive into Firecracker and how it can be used for deploying services on Raspberry Pi (4B).</p><h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2><p>There are few paths to take here. First I am going to try the easy one, using Ubuntu. Later on we can investigate the use of Alpine Linux which is much more lightweight than Ubuntu, ideal for devices like RPI.</p><h3 id="installing-the-image-on-a-microsd-card">Installing the image on a microSD card</h3><p>We need a 64 bit Ubuntu image and a microsd card. For the imaging I use <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/">Balena Etcher</a> that makes the imaging process super easy.</p><p>Getting the pre-installed image:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">wget https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/20.04/release/<span>\
</span><span></span>ubuntu-20.04.1-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi.img.xz
</code></pre></div><p>Preinstalled means that we get a fully working operating system and there is no need for additional installation steps after booting up. With Balena Etcher it is super easy to write the compressed image file to the sd card and boot the system up once ready. SSHD starts up after the installation and we can log in via ssh if we know the IP address that the DHCP server issues to our device (assuming DHCP server is present in our LAN).</p><p>There are few mildly annoying things with Ubuntu (snaps, unattended-upgrades) that I usually remove. I also prefer to use Chrony over the systemd equivalent. Ansible repo for these is available here: <a href="https://github.com/l1x/rpi/blob/main/ubuntu.20/ansible/roles/os/tasks/main.yml">https://github.com/l1x/rpi/blob/main/ubuntu.20/ansible/roles/os/tasks/main.yml</a></p><h3 id="installing-firecracker-jailer-and-firectl">Installing Firecracker, Jailer and Firectl</h3><ul><li>Firecracker: The main component, it is a virtual machine monitor (VMM) that uses the Linux Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) to create and run microVMs.</li><li>Jailer: For starting Firecracker in production mode, applies a cgroup/namespace isolation barrier and then drops privileges. There</li><li>Firectl: A command line utility for convenience</li></ul><h4 id="getting-firecracker-and-jailer">Getting Firecracker and Jailer</h4><p>For the first two it is possible to download the release binaries from Github.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>version</span><span>=</span><span>'v0.23.0'</span>

wget https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/<span>\
</span><span></span>releases/download/<span>${</span><span>version</span><span>}</span>/firecracker-<span>${</span><span>version</span><span>}</span>-aarch64

mv jailer-<span>${</span><span>version</span><span>}</span>-aarch64 jailer

chmod +x firecracker jailer

./firecracker --help
./jailer --help
</code></pre></div><h4 id="firectl">Firectl</h4><p>Firectl is a bit trickier to install because there is no release binary and it requires Golang 1.14 to compile. We can do these in two steps.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">wget https://golang.org/dl/go1.14.12.linux-arm64.tar.gz
tar xzvf go1.14.12.linux-arm64.tar.gz
</code></pre></div><p>After getting go we can get the source of firectl and compile it:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">git clone https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firectl.git
<span>cd</span> firectl/
 ~/go/bin/go build -x
</code></pre></div><p>Testing Firectl:</p><p>We have all the tools we need for running our first microVM the only thing is missing: something to run.</p><h3 id="downloading-our-first-image">Downloading our first image</h3><p>For a microVM there are two things necessary to have:</p><ul><li>an uncompressed linux kernel (vmlinux)</li><li>a filesystem</li></ul><p>Later on we are going to investigate how we could create our own version of these, but for now we are going to use images from</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/spec.ccfc.min/<span>\
</span><span></span>img/aarch64/ubuntu_with_ssh/kernel/vmlinux.bin
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/spec.ccfc.min/<span>\
</span><span></span>img/aarch64/ubuntu_with_ssh/fsfiles/xenial.rootfs.ext4
</code></pre></div><h3 id="configuring-network">Configuring network</h3><p>For the microVM to function properly we need a networking device. For this scenario we are going to use tap and create a device:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">sudo ip tuntap add dev tap0 mode tap
sudo ip addr add 172.16.0.1/24 dev tap0
sudo ip link <span>set</span> tap0 up
ip addr show dev tap0
</code></pre></div><p>If we want to give access to our VM we have to enable IP forwarding:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>DEVICE_NAME</span><span>=</span>eth0
sudo sh -c <span>"echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward"</span>
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o <span>$DEVICE_NAME</span> -j MASQUERADE
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i tap0 -o <span>$DEVICE_NAME</span> -j ACCEPT
</code></pre></div><h3 id="running-our-first-microvm">Running our first microVM</h3><p>This is how we can start up our first microVM. I usually start it in screen so I can open a new session easily because it will use the standard input and output for the newly started of console (unless you redirect it).</p><p>This is for debug mode, starting with sudo:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">sudo ./firectl/firectl <span>\
</span><span></span>--firecracker-binary<span>=</span>./firecracker <span>\
</span><span></span>--kernel<span>=</span>vmlinux.bin <span>\
</span><span></span>--tap-device<span>=</span>tap0/aa:fc:00:00:00:01 <span>\

</span><span></span>--root-drive<span>=</span>./xenial.rootfs.ext4
</code></pre></div><p>If everything went well you can see something like this:</p><pre><code>Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS fadfdd4af58a ttyS0

fadfdd4af58a login:
</code></pre><p>User and password is root:root.</p><h3 id="testing-networking">Testing networking</h3><p>For this we need to have a bit bigger image.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">dd <span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero <span>bs</span><span>=</span>1M <span>count</span><span>=</span><span>800</span> &gt;&gt; xenial.rootfs.ext4
resize2fs -f xenial.rootfs.ext4
</code></pre></div><p>After starting up the usual way and logging in we need to fix few things:</p><p>Adding some working nameserver:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>echo</span> <span>'nameserver 1.1.1.1'</span> &gt;  /etc/resolv.conf

<p>I love Veem.</p>



<p>They enabled our international growth. Veem allows us to send payment requests to US-based clients while saving their money on needlessly expensive wire transfers. </p>



<p>I wish more people used Veem. But even though the product works like a charm, I believe they may have some difficulties to stand out in the world of sleek and shiny Fintech apps. </p>



<p>This is not another “How I would redesign X” kind of case study. These usually showcase the author’s UI design skills but lack the original context about branding decisions and constraints the product team had to face. </p>



<p>We’re taking a different approach. </p>



<p>Instead of revolutionary interface changes, we will start by solving UX low hanging fruits. </p>



<p>Let’s explore Veem’s website through the eyes of someone who sees the service for the first time. And do some optimization to help them choose Veem.</p>







<p>Here is what people see when they visit&nbsp;<a href="http://veem.com/">veem.com</a></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="596" src="https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Header-2-1024x596.png" alt="" srcset="https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Header-2-1024x596.png 1024w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Header-2-300x175.png 300w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Header-2-768x447.png 768w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Header-2-1536x894.png 1536w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Header-2-2048x1191.png 2048w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Header-2-1200x698.png 1200w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Header-2-1980x1152.png 1980w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>After a quick look, we learn that Veem is a payment system for business.</p>



<p>General value prop communication revolves around a low entry barrier (sign up free), simplicity, and transparency.</p>



<p>What’s problematic is that I’m still now sure why I should sign up.<br>There are precisely 18 items clickable items on the screen right now – that’s a bit overwhelming. </p>



<p>I don’t feel convinced to click any of those yet.<br>Let’s see what we can do about it.</p>



<h3>1.1 Headline and messaging</h3>



<p>The headline sounds a bit vague and too modest. To make it punchier, let’s be bold, show the real value prop and speak to the customer. How about:</p>



<p><strong><em>“Your simplest way of sending and receiving global payments”</em></strong></p>



<p>or</p>



<p><strong><em>“Focus on running your international business. Let Veem take care of payments”</em></strong></p>



<blockquote><p>“The starting point of all great copy is a solid understanding of your&nbsp;customers’ dreams, pains, and barriers. The truth is your customers don’t care what YOU think.&nbsp;They care about what you can do for them.” </p><cite>Source: Growth.Design</cite></blockquote>



<p>We learned from the video (I’ll revisit that later) that Veem offers lots more than just simplicity and free sign up.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="142" src="https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/hiddenfees-1024x142.png" alt="" srcset="https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/hiddenfees-1024x142.png 1024w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/hiddenfees-300x42.png 300w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/hiddenfees-768x106.png 768w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/hiddenfees-1536x213.png 1536w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/hiddenfees-2048x284.png 2048w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/hiddenfees-1200x166.png 1200w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/hiddenfees-1980x274.png 1980w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>The example of “Don’t think of a pink elephant”</figcaption></figure>



<p>Looking below the title, I’d love to see some of these key bulletpoints. </p>



<ul><li>invoicing and tracking features</li><li>extra small transfer fee ($1!)</li><li>securely encrypted payments</li><li>no subscription, set up, hidden fees</li></ul>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="535" src="https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/12x-1-1024x535.png" alt="" srcset="https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/12x-1-1024x535.png 1024w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/12x-1-300x157.png 300w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/12x-1-768x401.png 768w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/12x-1-1536x802.png 1536w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/12x-1-2048x1070.png 2048w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/12x-1-1200x627.png 1200w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/12x-1-1980x1034.png 1980w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<h3>1.2 Social proof</h3>



<p>Before we check the sign-up process, let’s think of the crucial factor that encourages us to do it in the first place.</p>



<p><em>Recognized and Regulated</em>&nbsp;label is spot on. It reassures before signing up that Veem is not another half-baked MVP, but a full-fledged fintech product.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="82" src="https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-20-at-19.48.12-1024x82.png" alt="" srcset="https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-20-at-19.48.12-1024x82.png 1024w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-20-at-19.48.12-300x24.png 300w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-20-at-19.48.12-768x61.png 768w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-20-at-19.48.12-1536x122.png 1536w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-20-at-19.48.12-2048x163.png 2048w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-20-at-19.48.12-1200x96.png 1200w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-20-at-19.48.12-1980x158.png 1980w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>But, do we really need to have this&nbsp;<em>learn more</em>&nbsp;button here? That’s another distracting call to action – let’s make the label itself a link.</p>



<p>On the right-hand-side, users can spot&nbsp;<em>Trusted around the world</em>&nbsp;label and yet another CTA to read reviews that sit on Trustpilot.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="441" src="https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sp-1024x441.png" alt="" srcset="https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sp-1024x441.png 1024w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sp-300x129.png 300w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sp-768x331.png 768w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sp-1536x662.png 1536w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sp-2048x882.png 2048w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sp-1200x517.png 1200w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sp-1980x853.png 1980w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Whoa, that’s a heck of an excellent score – 4.6 average based on almost 1000 reviews! </p>



<p>Sadly, the topmost review is 1 star that entirely overrides the high average’s first good impression.</p>



<p>Some moderation will come in handy. Let’s tweak the social proof section below the sign-up form.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="535" src="https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sp2-1024x535.png" alt="" srcset="https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sp2-1024x535.png 1024w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sp2-300x157.png 300w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sp2-768x401.png 768w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sp2-1536x802.png 1536w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sp2-2048x1070.png 2048w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sp2-1200x627.png 1200w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sp2-1980x1034.png 1980w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Looks much better now – I’m sold, let’s sign up!</p>



<h3>1.3 Sign-up</h3>



<p>I hit the sign up button and it takes me to a subpage<br></p>

<p>Let’s break down what we have here</p>



<ul><li>Three sign up options,</li><li><em>login</em>&nbsp;link</li><li><em>need help</em>&nbsp;link</li><li><em>terms of service</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>privacy policy</em>&nbsp;links.</li></ul>



<div><p>Lots of empty real estate makes me think that maybe we can cut this step and embedd the form in the hero section?</p><p>Let’s give it a shot</p></div>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="602" src="https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sunext-1-1024x602.png" alt="" srcset="https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sunext-1-1024x602.png 1024w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sunext-1-300x176.png 300w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sunext-1-768x451.png 768w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sunext-1-1536x902.png 1536w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sunext-1-2048x1203.png 2048w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sunext-1-1200x705.png 1200w, https://altalogy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/sunext-1-1980x1163.png 1980w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>This is a useful pattern that reduces the extra step and provides&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://marketingexamples.com/conversion/sign-up-form-converts">better conversion rates</a></p>



<p>You may notice the video is gone, though. We pushed to a section below for a good reason – why would someone even launch it and invest their time until it’s clear what Veem can do for them?</p>



<p>It makes more sense to show the video once people are already curious and want to learn more.</p>



<p>To recap the sign-up changes, here are the benefits of quick sign up forms in the hero section</p>



<ul><li>Most users will probably look for it right there</li><li>It’s super convenient for returning users to log in</li><li>It signals the ease of usage and low entry barrier (1 field/1 click)</li></ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>VS Code is designed to elegantly handle all kinds of repos: Mono. Many. Multi. Even hybrids. Settling a discussion to determine what repo-structure is best for a project is as futile as having a room full of people agree on the world's best ice cream flavor.</p><p><img alt="Marquee Blog" src="https://marquee.activecove.com/blog/7/headline.jpg"></p><p>While building Marquee we lean on VS Code's excellent support working inside both folders and workspaces. Being able to quickly pop open a folder to inspect a project proved to be as important as pulling up a familiar workspace with a set of interrelated projects. The only real downside is that it's easy to get lost and sharing information between VS Code windows is hard.</p><blockquote><p>Install <a href="https://marquee.activecove.com/">Marquee</a>, if you haven't already 🤩</p></blockquote><p>If you're like us and you are compulsively hoarding VS Code windows like browser tabs we suggest you keep reading to find out how we have enhanced Marquee to support you in your VS Code quests.</p><h2>🏄 Ubiquitous Notes, Snippets, &amp; Todos</h2><p>When working with multiple repos, no matter a project's structure, it is immensely helpful to focus information displayed in Marquee to the currently active VS Code window. A single click on the scope toggle allows lookups of information across workspaces without expensive context switching.</p><p>Since we have received feedback from users that workspace-specific todos are hugely popular we expanded the workspace vs global filter option to snippets and notes too.</p><p><img alt="Marquee Blog" src="https://marquee.activecove.com/blog/7/toggle.gif"></p><h2>💫 Ranked Recent Projects &amp; Workspaces</h2><p>Opening many different projects in VS Code over time will inevitably make you lose sight of the important ones. Marquee offers the Projects widget which out of the box will use a relevance sort order and optionally be toggled to use alphabetical order. Relevance will show projects ordered by the how many todos, notes, and snippets are associated with them.</p><p><img alt="Marquee Blog" src="https://marquee.activecove.com/blog/7/projects.gif"></p><h2>🥁 Only Auto-Launch in Workspaces</h2><p>Based on your feedback we have learned that you ❤️ love Marquee but it does sometimes get in your way. We agree that losing focus when you open folders in new windows can be annoying. Which is why we introduced the <code>Only auto-launch Marquee in Workspaces</code> toggle in the global settings (top-level ⚙️) which will only auto-launch Marquee in workspaces as opposed to the more ephemeral VS Code in folders.</p><p><img alt="Marquee Blog" src="https://marquee.activecove.com/blog/7/autolaunch.gif"></p><h2>🍧 What's your favorite flavor?</h2><p>Repos: Many. Ice cream: vanilla. That's our short answer. If there's anything we can do to make Marquee better for your day-to-day VS Code-ing, let us know! We're taking feature requests. Needless to say it's totally cool to just drop us a line with your favorite ice cream flavor. Make sure you <a href="https://marquee.activecove.com/">give Marquee a spin in VS Code</a> if you haven't already!</p><p><sub></sub>Title photo by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/47515486@N05/50097365703/in/photolist-97sG6K-dkSZ4h-bBWVJU-2enqKnG-7APByH-ggyZg-4e1HdM-dQc53Y-mi3g5-6HMWtQ-2V5AJ-c1yZvU-2jjW6sx-c1z173-5idxHJ-5i96Nz-7QN95t-6vB45u-YfNpRD-dQ6s9Z-dkSVt4-fW91Aa-8JCrhJ-3HuBoY-5i9dp2-c1z1AN-4gX9us-27wS4LL-7QRnEo-2ew82Yx-7Wa82u-23YdLUe-4haspb-dFpUW3-7pTdXP-byt4Js-6qztNq-ePq638-nhDanS-nsSMtz-8zSYmt-58DPS-nHCqpA-8sEorb-35wuFd-2fnFRAW-7Wa81C-KT37Nw-86fGoR-4Q8kkb">Hefin Owen</a><sub></sub></p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Are the pixie fairies sprinkling gold dust on bitcoin’s market again? By the looks of things, you might think so. </p>



<p>Like in the bubble days of 2017, the price of bitcoin is headed ever upward. On Wednesday morning, it surpassed $18,000 — a number not seen since December 2017 when bitcoin, at its all-time peak, scratched $20,000.</p>



<p>Of course, the market <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-12/crypto-s-crash-just-surpassed-dot-com-levels-as-losses-reach-80">crashed spectacularly</a> the following year, and retailers lost their shirts. But here we are once again, trying to unravel the mysteries of bitcoin’s latest price movements. </p>



<p>Several factors may explain it — Tether, PayPal, and China’s crackdown on over-the-counter desks — but before we get into that, let me reiterate how critical it is for bitcoin’s price to stay at or above a certain <em>magic number</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bitcoin miners — those responsible for securing the bitcoin network by “mining” the next block of transactions on the blockchain — need to sell their newly minted bitcoins for real money, so they can pay their <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/the-bitcoin-network-now-consumes-7-nuclear-plants-worth-of-power/#:~:text=Today%2C%20the%20CBECI%20says%20the,terawatt%2Dhours%20of%20energy%20consumption.">massive energy bills.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Roughly $8 million to $10 million in cash gets sucked out of the bitcoin ecosystem this way every day. So, in order for the miners — the majority of whom are in China — to turn a profit, bitcoin needs to be priced accordingly. Otherwise, if too many miners were to decide to call it quits and unplug from the network all at once, that would leave bitcoin vulnerable to attacks. The entire system, and its current $345 billion market cap, literally depends on keeping the miners happy.</p>



<p>Now let’s jump to May 11, an important day for bitcoin. That was the day of the “halvening,” an event hardwired into bitcoin’s code where the block reward gets slashed in half. A halvening occurs once every four years.</p>



<p>Before May 11, miners received 1,800 bitcoin a day in the form of block rewards, which meant they needed to cash in each bitcoin for $5,000. But <em>after</em> the halvening, the network would produce only 900 bitcoins per day, so miners knew they needed to sell each precious bitcoin for at least $10,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But trouble loomed. Just months before the halvening, the price of bitcoin went into free fall. Between February and March, when the world was first gripped by the COVID crisis, bitcoin lost half its value, sliding to $5,000 — barely enough to pay the system’s energy costs post-halvening. Miners were likely pacing, wringing their hands, wondering how they would stay in business. Who would guarantee their profits?</p>



<p>That is when Tether — a company that produces a dollar-pegged stablecoin of the same name — sprung into action and started issuing tethers in amounts far greater than it ever had before in its five years of existence.</p>



<p>Tethers, for the uninitiated, are the main source of liquidity for unbanked crypto exchanges, which account for most of bitcoin’s trading volume. Currently, there are $18 billion (notional value) worth of tethers sloshing around in the crypto markets. And nobody is quite sure what’s backing them.</p>



<p>Due to Tether’s lack of transparency, its failure to provide a long promised audit, and the fact that the New York Attorney General is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitfinex-used-tether-reserves-to-mask-missing-850-million-probe-finds-11556227031">currently probing</a> the firm along with Tether’s sister company, crypto exchange Bitfinex, for fraud, a good guess is nothing. Tethers, many suspect, are being minted out of thin air.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(Tethers were initially promised as an IOU where one tether was supposed to represent a redeemable dollar. But that was long before the British Virgin Island-registered firm began issuing tethers in massive quantities. And no tethers, to anyone’s knowledge, have ever been redeemed—except for when Tether <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tether-just-burned-500-million-usdt-stablecoin-tokens">burned 500 million tethers</a> in October 2018, following the <a href="https://amycastor.com/2019/04/26/new-york-attorney-general-bitfinex-is-hiding-850-million-in-losses/">seizure of $850 million</a> from its payment processor Crypto Capital.)</p>



<p>According to data from <a href="https://amycastor.com/2020/11/21/are-pixie-fairies-behind-bitcoins-latest-bubble/blank">Nomics</a>, at the beginning of 2020, there were only $4.3 billion worth of tethers in circulation. That number remained stable through January and February and into March. But starting on March 18, just five days after bitcoin dipped below $5,000, the tether printer kicked in.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/wquSWQQ2kEfLCnshYnCiE7RZY2tuh9JtkWwPvnSsImvegfwkMzdhboJKFhSdpxqc5CtbcOh-5xqaro5F5DQAupoThjDcw6DYUf9wQTPBgfSMOV2TObswcJbuZoiOi2z46e9AR4Wg" alt=""><figcaption><em>BTC price and USDT supply. </em><a href="https://nomics.com/"><em>Image: Nomics.com</em></a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Tether minted $1.9 billion worth of tethers in March, and another $1.5 billion worth in April — crypto’s own version of an economic stimulus package. The price of bitcoin rose in tandem back up to $10,000, just in time for the halvening. Yet the Tether printer kept printing, pushing the price of bitcoin ever skyward and giving bag holders an opportunity to cash out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In May, June and July, Tether issued a combined total of $6 billion in tethers. In August, when the price of bitcoin reached $12,000, it spun out $2.5 billion in tethers. And in September, when BTC slid to $10,000, Tether infused the markets with another $2 billion in tethers, although, even that couldn’t lift bitcoin up to $12,000 again. It just hovered in the $10,000 range.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then in October — just after US prosecutors <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/founders-and-executives-shore-cryptocurrency-derivatives-exchange-charged-violation">charged the founders of BitMEX,</a> a Seychelles-registered, Hong Kong-based bitcoin derivatives exchange, for failing to maintain an adequate anti-money laundering program — the price of BTC started to soar. What happened?</p>



<h2><strong>Tether’s frenzied pumping</strong></h2>



<p>One theory is that Tether just kept issuing tethers, billions and billions of them, and those tethers were used to buy up bitcoin. A high demand drives up the price — even if it’s fake money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Only unlike in 2017, the effort to drive up bitcoin’s price is requiring a lot more tethers than ever before. (At the end of 2017, before the last bitcoin bubble popped, there were only $1.3 billion worth of tethers in circulation, a fraction of what there are today.)</p>



<p>Nicholas Weaver, a bitcoin skeptic and a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, is convinced&nbsp;bitcoin’s latest price moves are 100% synthetic.</p>



<p>“The amount of tether flooding into the system is more than enough explanation for the price as it is well more than the amount needed to buy up all the newly minted bitcoin,” he told me. “If it was organic, there would at least be some significant increase in the outstanding amount of non-fraudulent stablecoins.”</p>



<p>What he means is, if real money was behind tether, we’d be seeing a similar demand for regulated stablecoins. But that is not the case. Only one regulated stablecoin has seen substantial growth — <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/81422/stablecoin-supply-has-surged-past-20-billion-driven-by-derivatives-market">Circle’s USDC</a> — but that growth is far overshadowed by Tether, and mainly a result of the growing decentralized finance (DeFi) market — a topic for another time.</p>



<p>Jorge Stolfi, a professor of computer science at the State University of Campinas in Brazil, who in 2016 wrote a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-batsbzx-2016-30/batsbzx201630-2.htm">letter to the SEC</a> advising about the risks of a bitcoin ETF, which the SEC published, agrees.</p>



<p>“As long as fake money can be used to buy BTC, the price can be pumped to whatever levels to keep the miners happy,” he told me. He went on to <a href="https://twitter.com/JorgeStolfi/status/1329952095286472711">explain</a> in a Twitter thread that the higher the bitcoin price, the faster real money flows out of the system — assuming miners sell <em>all</em> their bitcoin for cash. Multiply bitcoin’s current price of $18,600 times 900, and that’s nearly $17 million a day. Investors will never get that money back, he said.</p>



<p>Klyith (not his real name) from Something Awful, a predecessor site to 4Chan, <a href="https://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?noseen=0&amp;threadid=3838405&amp;perpage=40&amp;pagenumber=797#post505143737">explains Tether</a> this way:</p>



<p>“A bunch of pixies show up and start flooding the parchment market with fairy gold, driving prices to amazing new heights. But when any of the player characters try to spend the fairy gold in other towns or to pay tithes to the king, it turns into worthless rocks.</p>

<p>“If you denounce the pixies to the peasants or start using dispel magic to reveal that fairy gold is rocks, the price of parchments will collapse and the peasants may stop using them altogether. But if you ignore the pixies and keep the parchment economy going, you will end up with more and more worthless rocks instead of gold. The pixies can of course tell the difference between fairy gold and real gold at a glance. So they will quickly drain all the real gold from the whole township if you don’t act. What do you do?”</p>



<p>Still, it is hard to imagine that outside events don’t have some impact on bitcoin’s price. Two other events are being talked about right now as reasons behind bitcoin’s price gains—and they are getting a lot more media attention than Tether.</p>



<h2><strong>PayPal’s shilling</strong></h2>



<p>One of the biggest companies in the world is now <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/826eedac-b0cd-4591-897a-9e83cf697060">promoting crypto</a>, giving retail buyers the impression that bitcoin is a safe investment. After all, if bitcoin were a Ponzi or a scam, why would such a well-known, respectable company embrace it? I should add that <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/microstrategy-ceo-bitcoin-better-than-antiquated-gold">MicroStrategy</a>, <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/press/2020-bitcoin-investment">Square</a>, <a href="https://decrypt.co/48252/wall-streets-fidelity-mounts-defense-for-bitcoin">Fidelity Investment</a> and Mexico’s third-richest person, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-18/billionaire-salinas-has-10-of-liquid-portfolio-in-bitcoin">Ricardo Salinas Pliego</a>, are also currently shilling bitcoin on the internet. </p>



<p>On Oct. 21, PayPal <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2020-10-21-PayPal-Launches-New-Service-Enabling-Users-to-Buy-Hold-and-Sell-Cryptocurrency">announced a new service</a> for its users to buy and sell crypto for cash. And on Nov. 12, the service <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/paypal-says-all-users-in-u-s-can-now-buy-hold-and-sell-cryptocurrencies/">became available to U.S. customers</a>, who can now buy and sell bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether, and litecoin via their PayPal wallet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are a PayPal user, you have already gone through the process of proving you are who you say you are. And that removes the hassle of having to sign up with an crypto exchange, like Coinbase in the U.S., and take selfies of yourself holding up your driver’s license or passport.</p>



<p>Of course, there are limitations. You can’t transfer crypto into or out of your wallet, like you can on a centralized exchange. But you can pay PayPal’s 26 million merchants with crypto — although, not really, because what they receive on their end is cash. And the transaction is subject to high fees, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/paypal-to-let-you-buy-and-sell-cryptocurrencies-in-the-us/">2.3% for anything under $100</a>, so what is the point? All you are doing is taking out a bet against PayPal that the price of bitcoin is going to rise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stolfi describes PayPal <a href="https://twitter.com/JorgeStolfi/status/1330207860484153347">on Twitter</a> as “a meta-casino where you can choose to use special in-house chips with a randomly variable value.”</p>



<p>The broader point is that PayPal makes it easy to buy crypto for people who are less likely to understand how crypto really works or know about …</p></div></article></div>

<p>A few weeks ago, a friend came to me with a bad idea.</p>



<p>He wanted us to start a dietary supplement and nootropics company together. We would use <a href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/what-is-dropshipping">dropshipping</a> to offload most inventory and management costs, then go to a mutual friend for cheap web design, and then tap into our networks for some surprisingly good sales and endorsement opportunities.</p>



<p>He acknowledged that I have no formal biology background besides AP Bio and watching <strong>House</strong>. He also had no formal background. This might lead an objective observer to conclude that we were not the best qualified individuals for selling other people chemicals to put in their bodies.</p>



<p>But… we had both started and run businesses successfully. He had had been using supplements and nootropics on a daily basis for years, and had put an impressive amount of effort into understanding them as evidenced by his ability to rattle off chemical components and mechanisms with the slightest prompting. He also had unique access to people who could promote and sell our product.</p>



<p>Most importantly, the entire supplements/nootropics field was in the “Wild West” (his words). Entrepreneurs all over the world were putting out bundled nootropic supplements with names like <a href="https://www.onnit.com/alphabrain/">Alpha Brain</a> and <a href="https://www.infowarsstore.com/brain-force?imt=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAtK79BRAIEiwA4OskBh6ir5a4-EWFNkmevrRBa-d55F195X-XrtQD5WT8sJfI5BqNM7WKvhoC5eAQAvD_BwE&amp;utm_campaign=Infowars+Life+&amp;utm_source=Google+Shopping&amp;utm_medium=PPC&amp;utm_content=Google+Shopping">Brain Force Plus</a>, and so if we, in the spirit of scientific adventure, put our heads together and actually tried to run a legitimate company which used only the most scientifically verified substances, we could pass the low bar set by the current market, and then rely on marketing skills and connections to carve out our own little chunk of a <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/02/19/1987135/0/en/Nootropics-Market-To-Reach-USD-5-32-Billion-By-2026-Reports-And-Data.html#:~:text=19%2C%202020%20(GLOBE%20NEWSWIRE),cognitive%20performance%20of%20an%20individual.">two billion dollar industry</a>.</p>



<p>This was a really, really bad idea.</p>



<p>It wasn’t a bad idea in a cynical, amoral, profit-maximizing sense. I’m pretty sure we could have actually made money if we tried.</p>



<p>It was a bad idea because it was a path to becoming borderline-snake oil salesmen.</p>



<p>I wasn’t 100% sold on the concept of starting a dietary supplement and nootropics company at first, but I was excited by it. I wanted to start another company, to build it, to make money with someone I greatly respected and admired. I wanted it to happen.</p>



<p>So it became my really bad idea too.</p>



<hr>



<p>Like every IQ-obsessed rationalist-ish person on earth, I had on occasion wondered about the viability of nootropics. After a 40 minute phone call with my friend, I finally took the deep dive into the subject and read everything I could find on nootropics for seven days.</p>



<p>Among other things, I read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nootropic">nootropics Wikipedia page</a>, a dozen other Wikipedia pages on specific nootropics, <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/03/01/2016-nootropics-survey-results/">Slate Star Codex’s 2016 Nootropics Survey Results</a>, <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Nootropics">Gwern’s discussion of the 40 nootropics he tried</a>, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nootropics/wiki/beginners">r/nootropics beginner’s guide to nootropics</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/top/?t=all">a bunch of the top all time posts on r/nootropics</a>, some stuff on the <a href="https://humannootropicsindex.com/">Human Nootropics Index</a>, and a lot of basic neuroscience so I could get a handle on the biological mechanisms. I also talked to a few friends, including a professional psychiatrist.</p>



<p>At the end of the week, my evaluation of the viability of nootropics was updated to:</p>



<ul><li>A small percentage (5-10%) of nootropics definitely and obviously work (or at least have some sort of effect), but have major negative side effects, often including addiction potential. These include Adderall, modafinil, nicotine, and many pharmaceutical stimulants.</li><li>The vast majority of nootropics (80%+) either don’t work, or have subtle, highly individualized effects. Often, even if they do have positive effects, they are pretty much impossible to verify. These include piracetam, ALCAR, <s>kratom</s>, noopept, and any exotic root from Zimbabwe.</li><li>A small percentage (5-10%) of nootropics hit the sweet spot of being both effective and not having any serious drawbacks. You can take them every day and they provide a mild desired effect. These nootropics are (IMO) caffeine, melatonin, and maybe L-theanine.</li></ul>



<p>(As far as I could tell, most workout supplements work if you take them the right way, but everyone already knows that and the market is saturated.)</p>



<p>From the perspective of our potential business:</p>



<ul><li>We mostly couldn’t legally sell nootropics in the first category. What we could do if we wanted to live life on the edge is keep an eye out for emerging nootropics and sell them before the FDA inevitably scheduled them and made their sale illegal. But this was obviously risky and stupid, even by the standards of this entire enterprise.</li><li>We could sell the nootropics in the second category, but it was difficult to do so honestly. Most nootropics companies make outrageously exaggerated claims about the potency and efficacy of their ingredients, though some will at least try to back their claims with (out-of-context) clinical evidence. We could either follow their lead and be slimy, or try to honestly advertise that putting this ground up Zimbabwean root in your tea each morning may-or-may-not produce a very slight augmentation in your focus for the day, though its effects will probably be entirely swamped by the moderate amount of caffeine in your tea.</li><li>We could sell the nootropics in the third category, but everyone on earth knows what caffeine is and how to get it, and anyone who wants melatonin can get it at Walgreens (which includes me for the last five years). So there isn’t really any way to provide a novel or valuable product to customers.</li></ul>



<p>To clarify, I don’t think nootropics are a scam or not worth investigating. But I think they’re something fun for hobbyists to mess around with, and there’s no low-hanging fruit. It’s for people like me who like doing experiments on themselves to have interesting experiences and gain insights into how our bodies work. But, there that aren’t many of these type of people out there, or at least not enough to support the type of business we were looking to create. The standard purchaser of nootropics, or at least nootropics bundles like <a href="https://patientsvitamins.com/product/limitless-pills-20ct-bottle-atomixx-blend-mood-focus-anti-anxiety-stress-free-2/?dTribesID=44a551361661c3b547b69135771c0add%7Cadtribes%7C345129&amp;utm_source=Google%20Shopping&amp;utm_campaign=112&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_term=345129">Atomixx Blend Limitless Pills</a>, seems to be fitness enthusiasts looking for a consistent boost, not nerds who want to do double-blind experiments on themselves.</p>



<p>This evaluation shifted my sentiments toward the business considerably. I called my friend/potential business partner and expressed my reservations. He’s a persuasive guy, and I guess sometimes I’m a gullible one, because by the end of the call, I was a little more optimistic. The way I saw it, if we were going to try to do this thing, we had two potential paths:</p>



<p>We could buy dozens of raw nootropics, mix them together in a bunch of different ways, and experiment on ourselves to see what works to find the best novel bundled nootropic combination. We could take our time, test it over months, even do double-blind experiments on ourselves and others. We could keep it simple, only use a handful of ingredients in the final product, and use them in sufficient quantities since my friend kept insisting that ordinary nootropic bundles used excessively small doses. We are smart, we can do this better than the good folks who make <a href="https://justifiedlaboratories.com/products/mega-brain-boost-5000-nootropic-improve-focus-memory-stimulate-mind">Mega Brain Boost 5000</a>.</p>



<p>Or we could just say “fuck it,” and put together a bunch of the typical ingredients (mostly caffeine) into a single pill, give it a cool name (we were throwing around “X-alt”), use our endorsements and marketing channels, and then throw it out on to the market. It wouldn’t be bold or innovative, but it could work. We could muscle in on a small slice of the market share, keep costs low with the droppshipping model, and see where it goes. And at least our product would be no worse than any other bundled nootropics company’s.</p>



<p>While my friend and I discussed these two plans, we weren’t on nootropics, but we were huffing a lot of <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Hopium">hopium</a>.</p>



<p>On the first plan, another friend of mine finally knocked some common sense into me. If the thousands of obsessive nerds in r/nootropics, the rationalist community, and dozens of communities across the internet hadn’t discovered a truly viable bundled nootropic that outperformed straight caffeine, even after tinkering with these chemicals for decades, then how on earth were my friend and I going to do so in a few months? A little Efficient Market Hypothesis goes a long way to explaining how dumb many business plans are, and my case is no different, especially since Gwern had already elegantly applied the EMH to evolutionary biology and nootropics with the <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Drug-heuristics">Algernon Argument</a>.</p>



<p>The second plan was more viable, but only in that cynical, amoral, profit-maximizing sense. <em>If</em> we were producing a real product that had real benefits, then I would have no problem with strongarming our way into the market via marketing and endorsements and taking our cut. But…</p>



<p>Would we be selling a real, valuable product? Would our bundled nootropics pill stuffed with caffeine, creatine, L-theanine, and whatever else made us feel good after a few weekends of sloppy experimentation actually bring benefits to our customers?</p>



<p>The correct answer was… we didn’t know. Fortunately, my friend and I were honest enough to admit that to ourselves and each other. We took a few days to mull over the whole idea.</p>



<p>The final death blow to our glorious business plan was Slate Star Codex’s <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/10/brief-cautionary-notes-on-branded-combination-nootropics/">Brief Cautionary Notes on Branded Combination Nootropics</a> which devastatingly argues that throwing a bunch of nootropics into a pill is somewhere between highly inefficient and immoral.</p>



<p>To me, the experience of reading great writing often consists of an author reaching into my subconscious, grabbing something I know to be true but have never articulated, and dragging it to the surface of my mind into a state of explicit conceptualization.</p>



<p>Reading this article at this time was an extremely powerful form of that, almost to an eerie degree. It was like Scott Alexander had listened in on our phone calls and then traveled back in time to write an article about our stupidity.</p>



<p>I swear, my friend and I went through just about every argument in the essay. We reasoned that the nootropics market is mostly awful and it’s easy to clear the current quality …</p></div></article></div>

									<p>If 95 percent of people wore masks, lockdowns wouldn't be needed, according to Hans Kluge, the World Health Organization’s Europe regional director.</p>
<p>Speaking at a briefing Thursday, Kluge said that mask use is currently at around 60 percent or less in Europe and that lockdowns should be “last resort” measures. However, he also said that mask use isn't a panacea and needs to be done in combination with other measures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>His comments come in the wake of a <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817" target="_blank">Danish study</a> indicating that while there's a benefit to wearing a mask to protect oneself, it's not statistically significant. However, the study didn't look at the benefit of wearing a mask in preventing infection in others — something that many experts believe should be the main impetus in wearing a mask.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kluge also took issue with lockdowns being eased too quickly, saying that the “short political gains” were quickly offset by the “devastating impact” when measures were re-instituted shortly afterward. Instead, Kluge proposed a tiered system “based on levels of seriousness in community transmission.” This would “better situate government actions along a gradient of severity,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Mark Zuckerberg's Ponzi Scheme<br>
<span color="#A0A0A0">Congress and the FTC brought a knife to a gun fight.</span></p><div>

<p>It's already a campaign issue for the next presidential election: should we, or should we not, break up the big tech companies? Elizabeth Warren says yes. Beto O'Rourke wants "stronger regulations."  Kamala Harris would rather talk about privacy. Everyone elseâ€”even Donald Trumpâ€”generally agrees that something needs to be done. But what?</p><p>There are plenty of law professors, think tanks and political consultants eager to share their ideas, but none of them are asking the right questions. In the case of Facebook, distractions are understandable when the company arguably has the worst track record of any major technology company in history (and will soon pay a record, if toothless, $5 billion fine). Yet the unspoken issue at the center of it all remains: although Wall Street, Congress and the Federal Trade Commission haven't figured it out, Mark is running a Ponzi scheme.</p><p>At this point it should come as no surprise to anyone paying attention that Mark is a bad-faith actor. He has no appreciation for the rule of law, or the role of a free press, and he has a dangerous tendency to view himself as infallible. After discovering a gaping security flaw in his product that revealed bulk information about friends of friends, exactly like Cambridge Analytica, I warned Mark in writing about the way his sloppy code would inevitably lead him to cross paths with the FTC and cause massive privacy and security concernsâ€”in <a href="http://www.thinkpress.com/authoritas/timeline.pdf" target="_new">April 2005</a>. His response: problems with the "Mark Zuckerberg production" were actually someone else's responsibility and "not worth arguing about."</p><p>Clearly, Mark can no longer argue that his decisions as Facebook's CEO are immaterial (though he has <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/11/11/13596792/facebook-fake-news-mark-zuckerberg-donald-trump" target="_new">tried</a>). Many have already lost their lives, whether through avoidable suicides or avoidable genocidal acts in Myanmar, due to his string of increasingly tone-deaf and spectacularly dishonest decisions. Now, fifteen years and approximately as many false apologizes after my classmate started a grand social experiment that first captivated the media, then locked it in a profitless box, and then played a major supporting role in bringing fascism to America, the general consensus is that the best way to handle Mark and his tech brethren is through the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. But the consensus is wrong, based on a mountain of misapprehensions.</p><p>In a nutshell, the argument in favor of anti-trust action is that in the midst of the longest economic expansion in U.S. history, it's the Progressive Era all over again. A recent New York Times op-ed penned by Mark's former roommate and co-founder, Chris Hughes, made essentially this point, relying heavily on input from the Roosevelt Institute. The Open Markets Institute agrees. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM9GMGDsKUU&amp;t=24m40s" target="_new">talk at Harvard Law School</a>, Matt Stoller argued that Facebook, Google and Amazon were "born as monopolists."</p><p>It's a compelling story, so long as one is willing to ignore the reality on the ground. For one thing, software products are not railroads, which require significant physical capital and labor to establish. Were he determined to do so, it would take Mark a few weeks to re-build Instagram and WhatsApp, and there really isn't any way the government could stop him. For another, I know that on this particular issue, Stoller is incorrect, because I was there when The Facebook was born on my hard drive on September 19, 2003, in Lowell House. It hardly resembled a monopoly. Monopolies are what happen as the result of prolonged neglect by law enforcement. They're not born; they're nourished by years and years of perverse incentives.</p><p>The biggest problem with treating Facebook as a monopoly, as opposed to the byproduct of what Jesse Eisenger calls "The Chickenshit Club," is that it wrongly affirms Mark's infallibility and fails to see through him and his scheme, let alone the reality that he's not even in control anymore because no one is. On October 26, 2012, Mark's friend and lieutenant, Sam Lessin, wrote, "we are running out of humans (and have run-out of valuable humans from an advertiser perspective)."  At the time, it was far from clear that Facebook even had a viable business model, and according to Frontline, Sheryl Sandberg was panicking due to the company's poor revenue numbers.</p><p>How times have changed; now there's a different source of panic. Facebook now has a market capitalization approaching $600 billion, making it nominally one of the most valuable companies on earth. It's a true business miracle: a company that was out of users in 2012 managed to find a wellspring of nearly infinite and sustained growth that has lasted it, so far, half of the way through 2019. So what is that magical ingredient, that secret sauce, that "genius" trade secret, that turned an over-funded money-losing startup into one of America's greatest business success stories? It's one that Bernie Madoff would recognize instantly: fraud, in the form of fake accounts.</p><p>Old money goes out, and new money comes in to replace it. That's how a traditional Ponzi scheme works. Madoff kept his going for decades, managing to attain the rank of Chairman of the NASDAQ while he was at it. Zuckerberg's version is slightly different, but only slightly: old users leave after getting bored, disgusted and distrustful, and new users come in to replace them. Except that as Sam Lessin told us, the "new users" part of the equation was already getting to be a problem in 2012. To balance it out and keep "growth" on the rise, all Facebook had to do was turn a blind eye. And did it ever.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.plainsite.org/dockets/3bvv82ier/california-northern-district-court/singer-v-facebook-inc/" target="_new"><i>Singer v. Facebook, Inc.</i></a>â€”a lawsuit filed in the Northern District of California alleging that Facebook has been telling advertisers that it can "reach" more people than actually exist in basically every major metropolitan areaâ€”the plaintiffs quote former Facebook employees, understandably identified only as Confidential Witnesses, as stating that Facebook's "Potential Reach" statistic was a "made-up PR number" and "fluff."  Also, that "those who were responsible for ensuring the accuracy â€˜did not give a shit.'"  Another individual, "a former Operations Contractor with Facebook, stated that Facebook was not concerned with stopping duplicate or fake accounts."</p><p>That's probably because according to its <a href="https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2019/Q1/Q1-2019-Earnings-Presentation.pdf" target="_new">last investor slide deck</a> and basic subtraction, Facebook is not growing anymore in the United States, with zero million new accounts in Q1 2019, and only four million new accounts since Q1 2017. That leaves the rest of the world, where Facebook is growing fastest "in India, Indonesia, and the Philippines," according to Facebook CFO David Wehner. Wehner didn't mention the fine print on page 18 of the slide deck, which highlights the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam as countries where there are "meaningfully higher" percentages of, and "episodic spikes" in, fake accounts. In other words, Facebook is growing the fastest in the locations worldwide where one finds the most fraud. In other other words, Facebook isn't growing anymore at allâ€”it's shrinking. Even India, Indonesia and the Philippines don't register as many searches for Facebook as they used to. Many of the "new" users on Instagram are actually old users from the core platform looking to escape the deluge of fakery.</p><p>The last time Mark suggested that Facebook's growth heyday might be behind it, in July 2018, the stock took a nosedive that ended up being the single largest one-day fall of any company's stock in the history of the United States. In about an hour, it <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/facebook-stock-crushed-after-revenue-user-growth-miss-2018-07-25" target="_new">plunged 20%</a> from around $220 per share to about $165. Needless to day, the loss of about $120 billion in market capitalization in an hour provided a sufficient disincentive for Mark to avoid a repeat performance.</p><p>Having narrowly escaped the ire of Wall Street, Mark knows he cannot get off the growth treadmill he set in motion years ago. The only solution: lying to investors about growth in an attempt to convince them that everything is fine. Yet signs that Mark's fake account problem is no different than Madoff's fake account statement problem are everywhere. Google Trends shows worldwide "Facebook" queries down 80% from their November 2012 peak. (Instagram doesn't even come close to making up for the loss.)  Mobile metrics measuring use of the Facebook mobile app are down. And the company's own disclosures about fake accounts stand out mostly for their internal inconsistencyâ€”one set of numbers, measured in percentages, is disclosed to the SEC, while another, with absolute figures, appears on its "transparency portal."  While they reveal a problem escalating at an alarming rate and are constantly being revised upwardâ€”Facebook claims that false accounts are at 5% and duplicate accounts at 11%, up from 1% and 6% respectively in Q2 2017â€”they don't measure quite the same things, and are <a href="https://www.plainsite.org/realitycheck/facebook.html" target="_new">impossible to reconcile</a>. At the end of 2017, Facebook decided to stop releasing those percentages on a quarterly basis, opting for an annual basis instead. Out of sight, out of mind.</p><p>One could argue that SEC disclosures are subject to strict regulations under the Securities Exchange Act and that Facebook would never be so bold as to lie to investors in black and white. That's true: it qualifies its fake account disclosures with the quizzical legal phrase "significant judgment" and it chose the color orange instead of black (insert Netflix joke here) for its transparency portal graph disclaimers that read, "These metrics are in development."  And one could further argue that the transparency portal metrics are reviewed by a team of academics, known as the Data Transparency Advisory Group (DTAG), who are supposed to vouch for their validity. But the DTAG academicsâ€”not one of whom is a statistician, despite Facebook's direct claim to the contrary, now erasedâ€”fully admit that they are paid by Facebook, and even after months of hard work, their <a href="https://law.yale.edu/system/files/area/center/justice/document/dtag_report_5.22.2019.pdf" target="_new">final report</a> released in April mentioned fake accounts only three times, and all three …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I took Heroku for granted, and a month into setting up my own infra, I now know how much it bought me.</p>
<p>A lot of my past work has been infrastructure-adjacent.
I often find myself filling in the Build &amp; Integration role - the person that gets continuous integration off the ground and keeps it actually continuing rather than falling flat on its face.
But often I’ve just been building one of a constellation of services, so the core infrastructure was already there,
or I’ve been targeting something like Heroku, where you basically pick your poison, git push, and bob’s your uncle.</p>
<p>This time, I’m putting the pieces together using the AWS toolkit.
And to smoosh them all together, I’m using Terraform,
because heck if I’m going to be hand-writing YAML or JSON and praying it’s formatted right.
Plus there’s more I want to orchestrate than just AWS, like, say, GitLab.</p>
<p>I don’t wanna talk about AWS just now.
It reminds me of learning Foundation &amp; Cocoa - you look at one piece, and it can do so much, and then you gotta put all those individually deep &amp; complex pieces together to do more stuff.
I figure if I put in the hours reading docs, learning what’s all there, and getting stabbed by the pointy bits, it’ll probably all come out fine in the end.</p>
<p>So, Terraform.</p>
<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>
<ul>
<li>It mostly works!</li>
<li>When it doesn’t, it generally fails in a useful way, and then I can fix it and try again.</li>
<li>There are docs for most things.</li>
<li>Autoformatting works great.</li>
<li>Linting works pretty well.</li>
<li><em>Terraform: Up &amp; Running</em> is excellent, and Terragrunt makes it even easier. Huge thanks to their team for providing the <a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2018/03/23/ducttape/">duct tape</a> we need. 🙌</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-not-so-good">The Not So Good</h2>
<ul>
<li>terraform-lsp is supposed to provide autocomplete, but it mostly doesn’t, in my experience. First it flipped its lid that I dared to have a repo with multiple root modules in it, so I just aimed VS Code at the folder with a single root module. Then the language server says it’s all hunky dory AFAICT, and yet it autocompletes nothing beyond bare language syntax. As a result,  I’m manually referencing docs and writing stuff down and wasting tons of time that tools like autocomplete and integrated linting ought to be saving me from.</li>
<li>State files contain secrets in plaintext. (You might enjoy the <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/516">six-year-old GitHub issue about the plaintext secrets problem</a>.) You can mark outputs as secret, so they don’t get printed at the end of applying your infra spec, but run <code>terraform show</code> instead of <code>terraform apply</code>, and there they are, staring back at you. At least you can lock down and encrypt the S3 bucket holding the state.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/concepts/config/#secrets">Pulumi’s secrets management</a> is far more satisfying. But Pulumi is even more cutting-edge than v0.whatever Terraform, and I expect Hashicorp to keep TF running for a good while, while I’m not so confident in Pulumi, so I’m using TF. (Hashicorp of course would recommend <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault">Vault</a>.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Annoying asymmetries in the language about how you *<em>declare and reference</em> things in slightly variant ways - I trip over these over and over as a beginner:
<ul>
<li>You declare locals in a <code>locals</code> block, but you reference them as <code>local.thing</code>, not <code>locals.thing</code>.</li>
<li>You declare a variable in a <code>variable</code> block, but you reference it as <code>var.thing</code>.</li>
<li>You declare data sources as <code>data "provider_thingy" "my_name_for_this_data"</code>, and then you have to access it as <code>data.provider_thingy.my_name_for_this_data</code>. (This is actually pretty darn consistent, at least. Though, like, why the quotes around the provider thingy?)</li>
<li>You declare resources as <code>resource "provider_thingy" "my_name"</code>. But you do NOT reference them as <code>resource.provider_thingy.my_name</code>. Nope, you just reference them as bare <code>provider_thingy.my_name</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For that matter, there are other oddities as well. Pieces of syntax that seem like they should be orthogonal just aren’t. <code>for_each</code> stands out here:
<ul>
<li>You can generate multiple resources by just dropping a <code>for_each</code> in the block: <code>resource "provider_thing" "mine" {}</code> becomes <code>resource "provider_thing" "mine" { for_each = of_these }</code></li>
<li>But nested <em>argument</em> blocks require conversion from like <code>setting { namespace = "blah" }</code> to <code>dynamic "setting" { for_each = thingy; content { namespace = "blah" }}</code>. Have fun looking that up a few times.</li>
<li>And you can’t even use the <code>for_each</code> trick with module imports. It just isn’t supported. Sorry, sucks to be you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Annoying gaps in the docs:
<ul>
<li><strong>Required vs optional parameters</strong> are not very clearly called out and are not at all segregated. So you get to play the game of “what is the minimal skeleton to declare this resource”. Actually running it a few times to see what you screwed up takes longer than just looking at the docs and puzzling it out, due to the lengthy iteration times in infra-land (see below).</li>
<li><strong>Types are not shown in the docs!!!</strong> All the outputs and arguments are typed. You have to declare those types. It’s right there in the code. But the docs don’t say what any of the types are. You just hit a type error at runtime. Fun fun!</li>
<li><strong>The HCL language is doc’d under the CLI tool, not in and of itself.</strong> It was really hard to actually find the docs since my first thought when I have syntax questions isn’t “let’s look at the docs for the tool.” It’d be like pulling up the manpage for GCC (carefully draw your triangle of art first) when you have a question about C syntax.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Annoying asymmetries in the AWS provider:
<ul>
<li><strong>Missing links:</strong> Sometimes you get into a “can’t get there from here” situation. Like trying to find the zone ID for an Elastic Beanstalk environment’s CNAME so you can aim a Route 53 alias at it. (Hint, you need a completely different resource, the <code>aws_elastic_beanstalk_hosted_zone</code>.)</li>
<li><strong>Irregular naming:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes something is <code>zone_id</code>, but other times it’s maybe just <code>id</code>.</li>
<li>Sometimes you can fish stuff out by <code>arn</code>, or maybe by <code>id</code>, or maybe it’s by <code>name</code> - good luck. Keep the docs close to hand.</li>
<li>(It’s totally possible this is inherited from the AWS APIs themselves, but the whole point of an abstraction layer is to make things better and more usable, dangit.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-different">The Different</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Iteration times are way longer than with even mobile apps.</strong> Like, “you’re liable to task-switch while waiting to see plan output” longer.</li>
<li><strong>Testing is a pain.</strong> I haven’t pulled in <a href="https://terratest.gruntwork.io/">Terratest</a> yet, because anyone maintaining this after me is unlikely to have Go experience, and my focus here isn’t builing reusable infra anyway - it’s building <em>this</em> infra – so I’ve just been using <code>bats</code> and Bash shell scripts (with <a href="https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/blob/master/README.md">shellcheck</a>, which is amazing) for some after-the-fact sanity checking using the AWS CLI. (Pro tip: Use the community-maintained fork <a href="https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core"><code>bats-core</code></a> rather than the no-longer-maintained sstephenson original.)
<ul>
<li>Policy assertions feel like a different flavor of test, but the tooling here seems to be fairly immature, with perhaps the exception of if you’re targeting Kubernetes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>I expect I’ll get used to most of the rough edges of the syntax in another month. And Terraform is stil v0, so hey, maybe some breaking changes will clear all this mess away. 🤞</p>
<p>I’m intentionally not getting sucked into hacking around the docs frustrations just now. Or even the <a href="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/432#issuecomment-371467507">very tempting open issue about silencing all the Terragrunt logspew</a>.</p>
<p>I do plan to spend a bit of time trying to get autocomplete working for resource and data source types and their arguments/attributes from the language server, at least. That would be a huge help.</p>
<p>It still feels like magic to run a command and have infrastructure just…happen.
You hit return, wait a bit, and suddenly servers are serving and domains are aliasing and a whole constellation of systems are interoperating.
It kinda reminds me of the magic of home automation with blinkenlights, only without any of that messy “hardware” stuff to break on you.</p>

<p>There’s a famous thought experiment in economics known as the “prisoner’s dilemma.” In it, two men have been caught committing a crime. Each of them is placed in a separate interrogation room and effectively has two options: confess or lie. There are three possible outcomes (the payoffs of which are illustrated in the payoff matrix below):</p>



<p><strong>Outcome 1</strong>: Both confess, and both serve eight years in prison (illustrated by payoff “-8, -8” in Figure A).</p>

<p><strong>Outcome 2</strong>: Both men lie, and both serve one year in prison (illustrated by payoff “-1, -1” in Figure A).</p>



<p><strong>Outcome 3</strong>: One man confesses while the other lies. The liar serves the longest possible sentence, 10 years, while the confessor goes free (illustrated by payoff “-10, 0” in Figure A).</p>



<p>So, if both men lie, they both get off with a lighter sentence. That appears to be the full story — except it isn’t.</p>



<p>The importance of the prisoner’s dilemma is understanding that in selecting a strategy, each player should account for the effectiveness of that strategy given what the other player might do.</p>



<p>Knowing this, consider the game from the perspective of Prisoner 1. If he thinks Prisoner 2 will lie, he should confess, because serving zero years in prison is better than serving one. If he thinks Prisoner 2 will confess, he should also confess, because serving eight years in prison is better than serving 10. In this situation, confessing is both players’ dominant strategy, the strategy they should play regardless of what the other player does.</p>



<p>This thought experiment illustrates how two self-interested individuals with a clear way to maximize their collective utility fail to do so. It also happens to be a fantastic way to understand our current moment. Millennials — not all of us, but many of us — are burned out, and the prisoner’s dilemma can shed light on why.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it also sheds light on a distressing conclusion: Barring some miracle of human coordination, our quest to optimize our lives will never slow, let alone stop. If anything, it will accelerate.</p>



<hr>



<p>Imagine a two-player labor market represented by the prisoner’s dilemma matrix. Now imagine both players encountered a service that would help optimize their lives. For a real-world example (and one I use), let’s take the premade meal delivery service Freshly.</p>



<p>Freshly claims to save people approximately two hours a week in the time they don’t have to spend grocery shopping, meal prepping, or cooking. Now imagine that both players had two choices of how they could spend those hours: either on extra leisure (e.g., sleep, Netflix, a book, etc.,) or on productivity (e.g., optimization/work).</p>



<p>What would each player choose?</p>



<p>Well, if wealth is considered freedom from busyness, or freedom to spend your time as you wish, the hour would be best spent on leisure. When forming a strategy, however — like with the prisoner’s dilemma — players must consider those strategies in the context of what the other players in the game might do. Consider the adjusted payoff matrix below:</p>



<p><strong>Outcome 1</strong>: Both players use the time afforded by the service’s convenience to optimize/work harder and thus remain in a state of constant acceleration (illustrated by payoff “1, 1” in Figure B).</p>



<figure><img src="https://zandernethercutt.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/92958-1qccvg4lbzz4zmcjpbuhs6w.png" alt=""><figcaption>Figure B: The Millennial Dilemma (leisure vs. work). Credit:&nbsp;Author.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Outcome 2</strong>: Both players use the time afforded by the service’s convenience to relax (illustrated by payoff “8, 8” in Figure A).</p>



<p><strong>Outcome 3</strong>: Player 1 uses the time afforded by the service’s convenience to optimize/work harder, while Player 2 uses it to relax. Player 1 reaps the benefits of being the only provider of labor in a market and corners it. Player 2 languishes as the world accelerates endlessly and leaves him behind (illustrated by payoff “10, 0” in Figure A).</p>



<p>Borrowing earlier analysis, it’s clear that given the payoffs, both players have a dominant strategy: work. If Player 2 relaxes, Player 1 should work because a payoff of 10 is better than a payoff of 8. If the Player 2 works, Player 1 should also work because a payoff of 1 is better than a payoff of zero.</p>



<p>Now, remember, these payoffs — and their explanations — are completely made up. In the modern era, there is no reason to be convinced that torturing yourself with additional employment is associated with any improvement in your lifestyle. And yet this is exactly how most people behave.</p>



<p>Thus, we arrive at our new Nash equilibrium: Both players use a service — mind you, a service built to supposedly make their lives easier and more relaxing — that ends up making their lives more stressful and complex. Put another way, both players burn out.</p>

<p>In a recent viral BuzzFeed article, “<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/millennials-burnout-generation-debt-work" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">How Millennials Became The Burnout Generation</a>,” Anne Helen Petersen notes this seeming paradox of leisure, specifically as it pertains to freed up time. She writes:</p>



<blockquote><p>Attempts [by companies] to discourage working “off the clock” misfire, as millennials read them not as permission to stop working, but a means to further distinguish themselves by being available anyway.</p></blockquote>



<p>In other words: Attempts by companies like Google or Freshly to create services that save you time misfire, as millennials see them not as services that will give them more time to relax, but as services that will increase the amount of time they’re available to work.</p>



<p>As employees in a hyperproductive, work-obsessed world, we’ve become acutely aware of any opportunity for optimization. Our Instagram feeds are filled with every possible combination of meal delivery service and online shopper that exists. Startups emerge daily to automate every mundane activity ever scrawled on and scratched off a legal pad.</p>



<p>The escalators I take to work are filled with the same desperate faces and vacant eyes I feel staring through me on the subway, except instead of standing still, they’re bounding up it, subconsciously aware that below their feet is yet another opportunity to optimize on an existing convenience. This, if anything, is a symptom of our current moment: People ignoring the luxury of a moving staircase in favor of whatever sprinting up it can transport them to faster.</p>



<p>There’s a kind of sick satisfaction derived from optimizing one’s own life, and there’s a good reason: Being able to do so is a status symbol. Only the most successful are free enough to spend their time finding better ways to spend their time. For those at the very top, I imagine these methods of optimization can actually exist in a vacuum; billionaires can optimize for the sake of optimizing, rather than to keep their head above water. For the rest of the world, optimization is a survival mechanism. To them, the tools that are luxuries to those at the top are good for one thing and one thing only: freeing up time that is only ever used to get more done.</p>



<hr>



<p>The one bright side to all this productivity should be that everyone makes more money, but that’s all too often not the case. The popular narrative is that we’re all working harder, but “wages haven’t risen in 40 years,” and “purchasing power is lower now than any point in recent memory.” The economist in me has always struggled with this line of thinking. Wages are only truly relevant indicators of wealth in the sense that they allow you increased control over how you spend your time. If you’re earning a wage and a service comes along that saves you the time and effort you’d normally have to expend to access a certain good (read: Freshly for meals), that service effectively increases the value of your existing wage. Thus, even though you’re not earning any more money, you’re now wealthier.</p>



<p>For consumers, services like Google and Freshly do exactly this.</p>



<p>The media, though — and a select few politicians — prefer a different narrative. “There’s a finite amount of money in the world,” they effectively claim, “and since we’re making less, and tech companies are making more, it follows that tech companies are to blame for wage stagnation, which is a net bad, always.”</p>



<p>Reality, though, isn’t that simple.</p>



<p>Though companies like Google and Amazon do generate healthy — and yes, <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/corporate-profits" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">quite frankly absurd</a> — returns for their executive teams and shareholders, they’re valuable because people find whatever they offer to be worth more than whatever they’re being asked to pay for it. In the case of Google, that offering is time (via frictionless access to information), and its price is effectively zero. The partial rationalization I make for stagnant wages, then, is that Google and services like it allow people to get more out of the same wage.</p>



<p>In this world, Google and its contemporaries are to blame for wage stagnation, but only because they’re creating a world where wages are no longer necessarily synonymous with wealth. Ergo, wage stagnation at the hands of tech companies — everyone’s favorite narrative — is a feature, not a bug.</p>



<p>The problem with this line of thinking, though, gets at the root of both the millennial …</p></div></div>

<h2>Dungeon Grasp</h2>
<p>Synthetic intelligence instruments like GPT-3 can mimick human writing in a considerably convincing means. However essentially, they’re studying patterns after which emulating them — they don’t perceive what they’re truly doing.</p>
<p>As a way to prepare AI to make use of language with intent, scientists from Fb and the Georgia Institute of Know-how dropped an algorithm into the center of a roleplaying recreation<em>, </em><em><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/11/20/1012400/games-role-playing-teach-ai-nlp-language-tool-chatbots-facebook/">MIT Technology Review</a></em><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/11/20/1012400/games-role-playing-teach-ai-nlp-language-tool-chatbots-facebook/"> reports</a>. The thought was that by giving the AI a particular quest to finish, they may train it to pursue targets like a human gamer — and possibly even transfer towards a deeper understanding of language.</p>
<h2>Burninated</h2>
<p>Within the recreation, the AI agent performed as a dragon who was tasked with particular missions like hoarding gold. To succeed, it needed to communicate to different AI brokers or people enjoying the sport by inputting particular instructions, similar to in every other <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/roleplaying-ai-game-dungeon-master">text-based adventure</a>.</p>
<p>The outcomes had been a bit clunky — the dragon would make nonsensical threats to make characters do what it needed — however in the long run the AI agent succeeded, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.00685.pdf">according to the team’s research</a>.</p>
<h2>Tabletop</h2>
<p>The dragon did want some assist alongside the best way. The researchers preprogrammed it with an understanding of how completely different characters would possibly work together, which they known as giving it a kind of widespread sense understanding of the sport.</p>
<p>However even with that help, the outcomes are an thrilling&nbsp;glimpse of future AI that may be capable of course of what phrases truly imply — and what influence they might have in the actual world.</p>

      <h2 id="flatbuffer-as-serialization-agnostic-idl">FlatBuffer as serialization agnostic IDL</h2>

<p>Many popular IDLs mix the following two separate concerns into one leading to less than optimal results.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Language agnostic type system supporting enums, types and variants/unions.</li>
  <li>RPC oriented wire format with backward compatibility as a first class concern</li>
</ul>

<p>Mixing these two concerns has many downsides. The first one is the weakening of the type system.
Suppose we have a union containing two things:</p>



<p>The generated code from the IDL compiler may add a third state - “not defined” or similar to deal with the
case that the RPC was sent from an old client. This concern now permeates code at other layers in the stack
where one doesn’t necessarily need to worry about this third state. This could happen for example if we fail
the request at the lower levels of the stack and deal with only two possibilities in the application logic.</p>

<p>Secondly, scalars and types may have different syntax in how optionality is expressed. My understanding is that
this is also driven by the serialization concern in the flatbuffer IDL.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-serialziation-then">What about serialziation then?</h2>

<p>Yes, someone has to do the work for serialization. A good way forward is to do it in a language specific library.
Rust has <code>serde</code> and Python has pure-protobuf.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>@message
@dataclass
class Cat:
    name: str
    age: int
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="example-idl">Example IDL</h2>

<p>This work (<a href="http://github.com/adsharma/flattools">flattools</a>) separates these two concerns as described above. It adopts the flatbuffer IDL (since it doesn’t have the
field numbering concern in the IDL, significantly simplyfying the language). Attributes have been used to support 
high level type safe concepts such as Protocols and Views (a concept similar to graphql fragments).</p>

<p>Here is a flatbuffer derived IDL file.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>enum Color : byte { Red = 1, Green, Blue }

table NamedAnimal (protocol) {
    name : string (required);
    age : short;
}

table Colorophile (view) {
    favorite_color: Color;
}

table Animal {
    name : string (required);
    length: ulong;
}

// Some languages prefer protocols like NamedAnimal
// as a subclass syntactically. When all supported
// languages do so, it's ok to add the protocol here
table Person (Animal, Colorophile) {
    address : string;
    age : short = 18;
}

table Product {
    label: string;
    price: int;
}

union Item {
    Product,
    Person,
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running it through the generator results in the following Rust code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>// automatically generated by the FlatBuffers compiler, do not modify
#[derive(PartialEq,Clone)]
enum Color {
    Red = 1,
    Green = 2,
    Blue = 3,
}

#[derive(PartialEq,Clone)]
pub struct NamedAnimal {
    pub name: String,
    pub age: Option&lt;i16&gt;,
}

#[derive(PartialEq,Clone)]
pub struct Animal {
    pub name: String,
    pub length: Option&lt;u64&gt;,
}

#[derive(PartialEq,Clone)]
pub struct Person {
    pub address: Option&lt;String&gt;,
    pub age: Option&lt;i16&gt;,
    pub favorite_color: Color,
}

impl Default for Person {
    fn default() -&gt; Person {
        Person {
           age: Some(18),
          ..Default::default()
        }
    }
}

#[derive(PartialEq,Clone)]
pub struct Product {
    pub label: Option&lt;String&gt;,
    pub price: Option&lt;i32&gt;,
}

#[derive(PartialEq,Clone)]
enum Item {
    Product,
    Person,
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Similar output exists for Kotlin, Swift and Python3 + dataclasses in the same directory.</p>

<h3 id="backward-compatibility">Backward Compatibility</h3>

<p>Using the <code>deprecated</code> attribute is recommended.</p>

<h3 id="future-improvements">Future Improvements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Expand the set of supported languages</li>
  <li>Add decorators for serialization</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p><em>Selecting great test cases is very hard. Unless you summon the undead.</em></p>

<p>Software Testing is a novel discipline for most developers. </p>
<p>Quality Assurance Engineers have great methodologies for use cases creation.</p>
<p>Besides, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test-Driven Development</a> (TDD) technique pushed developers into test writing world. <em>(Not testing world because <strong>TDD is not a testing technique</strong>)</em>.</p>
<p>But we are not ready yet.</p>

<p>I came across TDD back in 2005. I fell in love with <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUnit">XUnit</a> regressions, domain discovery and full coverage.</p>
<p>TDD is an incredible technique but deciding <em>what</em> to test is cumbersome. </p>
<p>I wrote TDD tests in a chaotic way for several years.</p>
<p>I'll summarize some things I learnt these years hoping to spare some time to new developers.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-differentiate-test-case-against-test-data">Learn to differentiate Test Case against Test Data.</h2>
<p>Most programmers love data and instantiation, and have difficulties dealing with abstract concepts.</p>
<p>They rush to create <em>test data</em> missing the big picture of choosing <em>relevant cases</em>.</p>
<p>Choosing <em>accurate data</em> representing <em>test cases</em> should be straightforward. The opposite is not true.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://diranieh.com/Testing/TestCaseDesign.htm">Equivalence Partitioning</a> is a technique for picking right <em>ambassadors</em>
partitioning all possible cases into a finite number of equivalence classes. </p>
<p>You can reasonably assume that a test of a representative value of each class is equivalent to a test of any other value. </p>
<h2 id="number-the-tests">Number the tests</h2>
<p>If you are developing TDD way creation order shows how you approached the problems. </p>
<p>First cases should be easy to understand and very low coupled.</p>
<p><em>Baby Steps</em> require we slowly increment our test complexity so we can gradually cope with it. Early green light is a priceless feedback.</p>
<h2 id="pick-zombie-representant">Pick Zombie representant</h2>
<p>Zombie testing is an acronym for:</p>
<p><strong>Z</strong> – Zero</p>
<p><strong>O</strong> – One</p>
<p><strong>M</strong> – Many (or More complex)</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> – Boundary Behaviors</p>
<p><strong>I</strong> – Interface definition</p>
<p><strong>E</strong> – Exercise Exceptional behavior</p>
<p><strong>S</strong> – Simple Scenarios, Simple Solutions</p>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>Let's create an email message <em>T.D.D. Way</em>.</p>
<p>One behavior at a time!</p>
<hr>
<p>Let's start from an empty test class:</p>
<pre><code><span>TestCase</span> subclass: 
    instanceVariableNames: <span>''</span>
    classVariableNames: <span>''</span>
    poolDictionaries: <span>''</span>
    category: <span>'Zombies'</span>
</code></pre><hr>
<p>First test will be our (Z)ero. Since we are working TDD, we have not defined  <em>EmailMessage</em> class yet.</p>
<pre><code>test01ZeroRecipients

    <span>self</span> deny: (EmailMessage forRecipients: <span>Array</span> <span>new</span>) isValid
</code></pre><p>name test01ZeroRecipients is composed by</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a prefix <em>test</em> mandatory in many testing frameworks. (<em>mandatory</em>)</p>
</li>
<li><p>a sequential order (to incrementally show the learning/testing procedure). (<em>optional</em>)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Zero/One/Many to represent zombies. (<em>optional</em>)</p>
</li>
<li><p>a functional description (<em>mandatory</em>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We start denying (asserting false) our first email will be valid. (since there are no recipients). </p>
<p>(denying is equal to <em>asserting for not</em> but clearer to read and avoids double negatives).</p>
<p>We run our first test. </p>
<p><em>EmailMessage</em> class is not defined</p>
<pre><code><span>Object</span> subclass: 
    instanceVariableNames: <span>''</span>
    classVariableNames: <span>''</span>
    poolDictionaries: <span>''</span>
    category: <span>'TDD-Zombies'</span>
</code></pre><p><em>forRecipients:</em> (the constructor)</p>
<pre><code><span>forRecipients</span>: recipients 

<span>    ^<span>self</span> <span>new</span> initializeForRecipients: recipients</span>
</code></pre><p>The constructor creates the instance and initializes with the essence (no anti-pattern setters and no mutation from scratch).</p>


<p>The <em>private</em> initializer</p>
<pre><code><span>initializeForRecipients</span>: emailRecipients 

<span>    recipients := emailRecipients.</span>
</code></pre><p>initializer sets the private attribute. </p>
<p>This is the first (good enough) implementation for <em>isValid</em>.</p>
<pre><code>isValid
     ^<span>false</span>
</code></pre><p><em>isValid</em> is hardcoded to <em>false</em>. </p>
<p>This is one of TDD values. The simplest solution should be hardcoded.</p>
<p>First test passes!!!</p>
<hr>
<p>Let's go for the (O)ne.</p>
<pre><code>test02OneRecipient

    self <span>assert</span>: (EmailMessage forRecipients: (<span>Array</span> <span>with</span>: <span>'john@example.com'</span>)) isValid.
</code></pre><p>Test does not work since we hardcoded it to <em>false</em> in previous step.</p>
<p>We change <em>isValid</em> implementation.</p>
<pre><code><span>isValid</span>
    <span> ^recipients</span> notEmpty
</code></pre><p>This condition is more general. Now test01 and test02 work!</p>
<p>Let's add new protocol to test02. It should be a different test case but we will overload test02 so we stick to one test per zombie.</p>
<pre><code>test02OneRecipient

    self <span>assert</span>: (EmailMessage forRecipients: (<span>Array</span> <span>with</span>: <span>'john@example.com'</span>)) isValid.
    self <span>assert</span>: (EmailMessage forRecipients: (<span>Array</span> <span>with</span>: <span>'john@example.com'</span>)) plain = <span>'to: john@example.com'</span>.
</code></pre><p><em>plain</em> message will return plain text from email. let's implement it.</p>
<pre><code><span>plain</span>
    <span> ^'to:</span> <span>' , recipients first.</span>
</code></pre><p>We concatenate <em>to:</em> header with the first recipient. Hardcoded.</p>
<hr>
<p>(ZO) tests are ready. Let's go for the (M)any.</p>
<pre><code><span>test03ManyRecipients</span>

    | message |
    message := (EmailMessage forRecipients:
 (Array with: <span>'john<span>@example</span>.com'</span> with: <span>'jane<span>@example</span>.com'</span> with: <span>'lucas<span>@example</span>.com'</span>)).

    self assert: message plain = <span>'to: john<span>@example</span>.com,jane<span>@example</span>.com,lucas<span>@example</span>.com'</span>.
    self assert: message isValid
</code></pre><p>At this point <em>is harder to fake it than to make it</em>. This is a hint we should refactor and make a generic solution instead of hardcoding.</p>
<p>Many is represented by a 3 elements collection. <em>isValid</em> is working but <em>plain</em> isn't.</p>
<pre><code><span>plain</span>
     ^(recipients <span>inject</span>: <span>'to: '</span> <span>into</span>: [:<span>plainText </span>:address | plainText, address ,<span>' ,'</span> ]) <span>allButLast</span>
</code></pre><p>This idiom iterates over recipients (a private attribute, no getters), inserting a comma (,) and removing last one (<em>allButLast</em>). Since we have no <em>explode</em>.</p>

<p>3 tests working! (ZOM)</p>
<hr>
<p>We should tackle (B)oundaries.</p>
<pre><code>test04BoundaryRecipients

    | recipients |
    recipients := OrderedCollection new.
    1 to: 10 <span>do</span>: [:<span>index</span> | recipients <span>add</span>: (<span>'john'</span>, <span>index</span> asString, <span>'@example.com'</span>)].

    <span>self</span> deny: (EmailMessage forRecipients: recipients) isValid
</code></pre><p>We create 10 different emails <a href="mailto:john1@example.com" target="_blank">john1@example.com</a>, <a href="mailto:john2@example.com" target="_blank">john2@example.com</a>, ..., <a href="mailto:john10@example.com" target="_blank">john10@example.com</a>.</p>
<p>We decide 10 is an arbitrary upper limit for recipients size for this exercise.
Message with 10 recipients is not valid.</p>
<pre><code><span>isValid</span>
    <span> ^recipients</span> notEmpty and: [recipients size &lt; <span>10</span>]
</code></pre><p>This condition now checks for lower limits and upper ones. it is equal to:</p>
<pre><code><span>isValid</span>
    <span> ^recipients</span> size between: <span>1</span> and: <span>9</span>
</code></pre><p>Since we have <strong>full coverage</strong> we can change implementation any time!</p>
<hr>
<p>ZOMB in. It is the time for (I)nterfaces checking.</p>
<pre><code><span>test05InterfaceDefinition</span>

    <span>self should:</span> [ <span>EmailMessage forRecipients:</span> <span>1</span> ] <span>raise:</span> <span>Exception</span>
</code></pre><p>We try to create a message with an integer which violates our interface, therefore it should raise an exception.</p>
<pre><code><span>forRecipients</span>: recipients 

<span>    recipients <span>do</span>: [:eachAddress | 
        eachAddress isString
            ifFalse: [ <span>self</span> <span>error</span>: (eachAddress , <span>' is not a valid recipient'</span>)]].

    ^<span>self</span> <span>new</span> initializeForRecipients: recipients</span>
</code></pre><p>We validate addresses upon creation. No invalid objects here!</p>
<hr>
<p>ZOMBI here ! How about (E)xceptional behaviour?</p>
<pre><code>test06ExceptionalBehavior

    self should: [EmailMessage forRecipients: (<span>Array</span> <span>with</span>: <span>'john@example.com'</span> <span>with</span>: <span>'john@example.com'</span>)] <span>raise</span>: <span>Exception</span>
</code></pre><p>Duplicates are invalid according to our domain. Let's check them!</p>
<pre><code><span>forRecipients</span>: recipients 

<span>recipients <span>do</span>: [:eachAddress | 
    eachAddress isString
        ifFalse: [ <span>self</span> <span>error</span>: (eachAddress , <span>' is not a valid recipient'</span>)]].
    (recipients asSet <span>size</span> = recipients <span>size</span>)
        ifFalse: [<span>self</span> <span>error</span>: <span>'Duplicates'</span>].

    ^<span>self</span> <span>new</span> initializeForRecipients: recipients</span>
</code></pre><p>We check for duplicates mapping our recipients to a Set and checking both sizes. Not the most performant way. </p>
<p>We need to keep the example working and avoid premature optimization. With all tests running we can optimize code.</p>

<p>How about readability? Method is too ugly. Let's do TDD step 3: Refactor.</p>
<pre><code><span>forRecipients</span>: recipients 

<span>     <span>self</span> assertAllAddressesAreValid: recipients.
     <span>self</span> assertThereAreNoDuplicates: recipients.         
    ^<span>self</span> <span>new</span> initializeForRecipients: recipients</span>
</code></pre><p>That's better!</p>
<hr>
<p>Last test! (S)imple Scenarios.
In this small piece there's no need. We can add one redundant way for teaching purposes:</p>
<pre><code>test07SimpleScenarios

    self <span>assert</span>: (EmailMessage forRecipients: (<span>Array</span> <span>with</span>: <span>'john@example.com'</span>)) plain =     <span>'to: john@example.com'</span>
</code></pre><p>And that's it. 
We have our model built with TDD and great confidence. Full coverage and no gold plating!.</p>
<ul>
<li>No empty constructors</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p>Model is ummatable</p>
</li>
<li><p>No setters</p>
</li>
<li><p>No getters</p>
</li>
<li><p>No accidental ifs</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>No Nulls</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>With these tips we can do very basic test writing. </p>
<p>That will be enough for TDD. </p>
<p>TDD does no replace Quality Assurance process and QA Engineers would work together with developers to learn from each other. </p>
<p>Developing software is a human and collaborative activity.</p>
<p>Let's enjoy it together!</p>

	<h3>Trump’s Campaign App Monitors Users’ Personal Data</h3>
<p>The Trump 2020 campaign’s official app allows Trump’s team to communicate directly with over 2.8 million users, the most users of a presidential campaign’s app in history (<a href="https://apnews.com/article/124d914bb082575aeec8042629aa932c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a>). Additionally, if users granted the app permission, it could and would also communicate with their phone contact list.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Once installed, it can track their behavior on the app and in the physical world, push out headlines, sync with mass texting operations, sell MAGA merchandise, fundraise and log attendance at the president’s rallies, according to the app’s privacy policy and user interface.” (<a href="https://apnews.com/article/124d914bb082575aeec8042629aa932c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Trump campaign has always been data-driven, including help by the infamous data science company <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/what-did-cambridge-analytica-really-do-for-trumps-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cambridge Analytica in the 2016 campaign</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong> This is a new era for politics, one where data science focused marketing companies can play a major contributing role in winning elections – to get a better understanding of this, and specifically the role Cambridge Analytica played in Trump’s 2016 campaign, the Brexit campaign and more, I recommend you watch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Hack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Great Hack</a>, a 2019 documentary exploring the details and aftermath of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>This is a CSS Reset for Flexbox and CSS Grid which helps you to avoid issues in responsive layouts. It is one simple CSS rule which I noticed in a UI framework. There aren’t any odd consequences and I wish it was by default in all browsers.</p>
<p><i>Edit:// Thats for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/jz173m/css_reset_for_better_flexbox_and_css_grid/gd9j8pg?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pointing out</a> that this css code reset was <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/30049" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">added</a> to Bootstrap framework, but then it was removed. I added a section with explanation <a href="#bootstrap">at the end</a> of this blog post.</i></p>
<p>In case you don’t know about css normalizers and css resets, you can check <a href="https://medium.com/@elad/normalize-css-or-css-reset-9d75175c5d1e" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this</a> blog post. Most of them don’t solve flexbox issues. <a href="https://github.com/philipwalton/flexbugs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Flexbugs</a> is a list of known bugs and flexbox issues. If you are using flexbox and something is not working, you can find a solution there.</p>
<p>The question is:</p><p>How to use workarounds of flexbox issues in my project?</p>
<p>You can use a tool for transforming your CSS. <a href="https://postcss.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PostCSS</a> is a great tool which helps you to improve your CSS by their pre-processing or post-processing. It provides a great modular system with a lot of plugins and it integrates well with any build javascript tool.</p>
<p>If you never used PostCSS before, you should consider it in your future projects. <a href="https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Autoprefixer</a> is perhaps the most popular plugin which adds vendor prefixes to CSS. You can find other plugins to fix css issues in <a href="https://github.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/docs/plugins.md" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">plugins list</a>, for example a <a href="https://github.com/Faisal-Manzer/postcss-viewport-height-correction" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">plugin</a> which solves <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37112218/css3-100vh-not-constant-in-mobile-browser" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">100vh issue</a> in mobile browsers.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/luisrudge/postcss-flexbugs-fixes" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PostCSS Flexbugs Fixes</a> is a PostCSS plugin which fixes some issues from Flexbugs list. Both <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/post-processing-css" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Create React App</a> and <a href="https://nextjs.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Next.js</a> integrate PostCSS with Autoprefixer and PostCSS Flexbugs Fixes plugins.</p>
<p>Most Flexbugs issues are related to Internet Explorer browser. Nowadays, you don’t really need to care much about <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share#monthly-201910-202010" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Internet Explorer</a>, but don’t forget to double <a href="https://andrejgajdos.com/freelance-react-developer-checklist/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">check</a> this.</p>
<p>There is an issue which is very common in flexbox layout. It’s not an issue per se, but the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#flex-common" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">specification</a> of flexbox, which says:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>By default, flex items won’t shrink below their minimum content size (the length of the longest word or fixed-size element).</i></p></blockquote>
<p>If we take a look at <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#min-size-auto" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Automatic Minimum Size of Flex Items</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>The auto keyword, representing an automatic minimum size, is the new initial value of the min-width and min-height properties.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>If you don’t know this rule, it can make some unexpected behaviour in your layout <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36247140/why-dont-flex-items-shrink-past-content-size" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">[1]</a>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40407619/min-width-rendering-differently-in-flex-direction-row-and-flex-direction-colum" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">[2]</a> and you can find blog <a href="https://dfmcphee.com/flex-items-and-min-width-0/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">articles</a> dedicated to this behaviour.</p>
<p>Here is one example you can see in all browsers. Let’s say you want to truncate labels in a flexbox layout.</p>
<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="light" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="andrej_gajdos" data-slug-hash="YzWozKw" data-pen-title="Flexbox issue">

</p>
<p>And here is the fix:</p>

on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>
<p>This is just one example, but you will come across similar funky issues in your flexbox and css grid responsive layouts in different browsers.</p>
<p>Some time ago, when I was working on a freelance React project, I decided to try out <a href="https://rebassjs.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rebass</a> UI components. As I was working on this project, I didn’t have any layout issues. Later, I decided to remove Rebass because I felt like I didn’t really need it. When I removed Rebass, I had several issues in regards to auto minimum size of flex items in my responsive layout. Then I found out that Rebass uses <code>min-width: 0px</code> as a reset rule for its components.</p>
<p>I was thinking it would be great to have this rule available for flex children elements. I decided to open an issue in PostCSS Flexbugs Fixes to add this rule into the plugin, but unfortunately it was <a href="https://github.com/luisrudge/postcss-flexbugs-fixes/issues/63" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">declined</a>.</p>
<p>After several months I was working as a freelance developer on a marketing website in Next.js. I made the whole layout responsive using CSS Grid, but when I checked the project on my iPhone, there was an overflow issue in mobile Safari browser. It was interesting to don’t see this issue in other mobile browsers or desktop browsers. It took me a few hours to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52861086/who-does-minmax0-1fr-work-for-long-elements-while-1fr-doesnt" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">find out</a> that CSS Grid inherited Flexbox’s behavior with <code>min-width: auto</code>.</p>
<p>I came across the same unexpected behaviour in my responsive layout for the second time. When I did some research, I found Dave Rupert’s <a href="https://daverupert.com/2017/09/breaking-the-grid/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">article</a> which talks more about form elements and replaced elements in CSS Grid. You can find there a CSS reset, but you need to add a class to each grid element in your HTML code. I was thinking of creating a PostCSS plugin, which could solve this issue effectively in my React and Next.js projects.</p>
<p>I decided to create two separate PostCSS plugins in case I will want to add other reset rules for flexbox or grid layouts.</p>
<p>Both <a href="https://github.com/AndrejGajdos/postcss-flexbox-reset" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><b>postcss-flexbox-reset</b></a> and <a href="https://github.com/AndrejGajdos/postcss-grid-reset" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><b>postcss-grid-reset</b></a> do only one simple thing:</p>
<pre><code>
/* Input example */
.foo {
  display: flex;
}

.foo-grid {
  display: grid;
}
</code>
</pre>
<div>
<pre><code>
/* Output example */
.foo {
  display: flex;
}

.foo &gt; * {
  min-width: 0;
}

.foo-grid {
  display: grid;
}

.foo-grid &gt; * {
  min-width: 0;
}
</code>
</pre>
</div>

<p id="bootstrap">This css rule was <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/30049" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">added</a> to Bootstrap framework and then it was <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/30979" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">removed</a>. The reason is that when someone updated to Boostrap version with this rule (<a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases/tag/v4.5.0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">4.5.0</a>) in developed UI, the whole layout was broken. It’s not surprising because all developed layouts were created with flex or grid items <code>min-width: auto</code> and flex and grid items dimensions are different now. This reset works very well in new projects, but it perhpas doesn’t work well in already created code bases. CSS normalizers and CSS resets in general don’t work if you add them to developed projects. This is something that should be done in the beginning of the project.</p>
<h2>How to use these plugins in React projects</h2>
<p>Create React App <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/5843" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">doesn’t support</a> adding new PostCSS plugins. There are other <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/alternatives-to-ejecting/#docsNav" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ways</a> to achieve that, but you would need to maintain the configuration and scripts yourself.</p>
<p>The best option seems to be the <a href="https://github.com/gsoft-inc/craco" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CRACO</a> project which adds a configuration layer on top CRA. You can find an <a href="https://github.com/gsoft-inc/craco/tree/master/recipes/extends-post-css-plugins" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">example</a> of how to add other PostCSS plugins. Adding PostCSS plugins to <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/customizing-postcss-config#customizing-plugins" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Next.js projects</a> is much easier.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This blog post is about unexpected behaviour in Flexbox and CSS Grid responsive layout. I can’t believe I wrote a blog post about a single CSS rule <code>min-width: 0</code>. When I used Rebass UI components, this rule is available for its UI elements. I didn’t come across any odd consequences and I wish it would be available in all my future projects. I decided to create two PostCSS plugins for better maintainability, postcss-flexbox-reset for Flexbox and postcss-grid-reset for CSS Grid.
</p><p>I Hope, you found this piece of content helpful and it will make you more productive in implementing responsive layouts. If you think postcss-flexbox-reset and postcss-grid-reset should transform some other css rules, don’t hesitate to contact me, PRs are open too.</p>

<p>In the realm of ultra-powerful ARM Silicon for mobile computers, Apple and Microsoft can claim they have the two most powerful, but between them which one performs the best? We will examine specs for both Apple’s new M1 and Microsoft’s SQ2 chip. </p>



<p>Apple’s commitment to move all of their Macs to Apple-made Silicon has culminated in the three new Macs announced yesterday, Mac mini, MacBook Air and MacBook Pro powered by Apple’s M1. Apple’s continued innovation with its silicon and is chips are still the ones to beat in the industry.</p>

<p>Microsoft is taking a different approach, the company is developing Windows 10 for both x86 and ARM chips concurrently, which could maintain its dominance in enterprise and gaming but could deprive the oxygen Windows 10 on ARM needs to win over developers and prosumers alike. Perhaps our recent reporting that <a href="https://platform-decentral.com/2020/09/30/arms-race-windows-x64-emulation-and-more-is-coming-to-arm-pcs-in-november/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://platform-decentral.com/2020/09/30/arms-race-windows-x64-emulation-and-more-is-coming-to-arm-pcs-in-november/">Windows 10 on ARM is gaining 64-bit legacy app emulation</a> support this month, will help a bit.</p>

<h2>Apple’s M1 benchmarks</h2>



<p>Apple’s new M1 in the MacBook Air has new benchmarks revealing the massive performance of Apple’s new silicon. Below is a screenshot of Apple’s recent claims that Apple M1 outperforms the “Latest PC laptop chip” but without any specifics on which one. At least when compared to the Surface Pro X Apple’s new M1-powered MacBook Air wipes the floor with it, it’s not even close.</p>

<p>The Surface Pro X has something that none of the M1-powered Macs have, LTE. The Surface Pro X has LTE which means that even if you are not near Wi-Fi, you will still be connected. It is likely that the M1 will outperform the SQ2 in the benchmarks because the A14 Bionic in the iPad Air slightly outperforms  the SQ2 chip inside the Surface Pro X.</p>

<h3>This is for you if:</h3>



<ol><li>Your python IDE of choice is PyCharm</li><li>You wish you had a command-line replacement for PyCharm on all the places you ssh into</li><li>You wish you had access to at least <em>some</em> of the niceties of PyCharm when editing a one-off script, without having to create/import it into a new project.</li><li>You are somewhat familiar with vim and can comfortably edit a single file on vim. You also know what a <code>.vimrc</code> is</li></ol>

<h3>Motivation</h3>



<p>PyCharm has worked wonderfully well for me, and the only time where I have to use something else is when I ssh into a server to put together a quick script. That something else tends to be vim, and this is an attempt to get vim as close to PyCharm as possible – especially  the shortcuts so that I can work on vim the way I work on PyCharm (well, almost). The end result is still a far cry from PyCharm, but it makes navigating a codebase over ssh significantly less painful (at least for me) </p>



<h3>But PyCharm can work over ssh</h3>



<p>Yeah, but I don’t use PyCharm for one-off scripts. Besides, it pleases me to know that if I can ssh into the server (from an ipad, a phone, or a washing machine), I have an (approximate) IDE I can work on. </p>

<h3>Why not just use python-mode?</h3>



<p>I simply could not figure out the shortcuts that <a href="https://github.com/python-mode/python-mode">python-mode</a> used. I thought it would be easier and more flexible if I install and configure the plugins myself.</p>



<h3>Prerequisites</h3>



<ul><li>vim 8</li><li>A Python virtualenv (or a conda environment). There’s some <code>pip install</code> involved, though this is optional</li><li>Patience</li></ul>



<h3>TL;DR</h3>



<p>Go <a href="https://github.com/kevinmartinjos/vimcharm">here</a> for the <code>.vimrc</code></p>



<h3>Let’s start from a blank .vimrc</h3>



<p>If you need a project-specific <code>.vimrc</code>, see <a href="https://andrew.stwrt.ca/posts/project-specific-vimrc/">this</a>. If not, everything goes into your <code>~/.vimrc</code></p>



<p>Let us begin by being able to see line numbers and some sort of syntax highlighting everywhere. Put these on your <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>


<pre title="">" Some basic stuff
set number
set showmatch
syntax on
imap jj &lt;Esc&gt;
</pre>


<p>The <code>set showmatch</code> is for highlighting matching parentheses – that’s useful. The last line maps double pressing the <code>j</code> key in insert mode to <code>&lt;Esc&gt;</code> – no more reaching for that far away Escape key using your pinky!</p>



<h3>NERDTree for the sidebar</h3>



<p>We’ll start our plugin-hoarding with <a href="https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree">NERDTree</a>. With Vim 8, we can simply copy over a plugin directory to a certain place and Vim would just “pick it up” – there’s no need to use a  plugin manager for achieving VimCharm. Create the necessary directory structure and clone NERDTree:</p>


<pre title="">mkdir ~/.vim/pack/vimcharm/start/ -p
git clone https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree.git ~/.vim/pack/vimcharm/start/nerdtree
</pre>


<p>Open some file (any file) on vim and type <code>:NERDTreeToggle</code> – you should see the sidebar. Executing the same command again would close the NERDTree. PyCharm by default opens/closes the sidebar using <code>Ctrl + 1</code> . However, the terminal (and consequently Vim) cannot differentiate between 1 and <code>Ctrl + 1</code>, so we’ll map this to <code>Alt + 1</code> instead. Before we do that, we need to determine what characters are sent by the terminal when we press the key combo. Simply run <code>cat</code> without any arguments, and press <code>Alt + 1</code>. You should see something like this:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="307" data-permalink="https://kevinmartinjose.com/alt1/" data-orig-file="https://kevinmartinjose.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/alt1.png" data-orig-size="287,71" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="alt1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://kevinmartinjose.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/alt1.png?w=287" data-large-file="https://kevinmartinjose.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/alt1.png?w=287" src="https://kevinmartinjose.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/alt1.png?w=287" alt="" srcset="https://kevinmartinjose.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/alt1.png 287w, https://kevinmartinjose.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/alt1.png?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 287px) 100vw, 287px"></figure>



<p>You would also see that <code>1</code> and <code>Ctrl+1</code> produces the same character on <code>cat</code> – as far as I know, there’s no way around this.</p>



<p>We need to map the character sequence for <code>Alt + 1</code> to <code>:NERDTreeToggle</code> on our <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>


<pre title="">set &lt;A-1&gt;=^[1
nmap &lt;A-1&gt; :NERDTreeToggle&lt;CR&gt;

</pre>


<p><strong>Take care not to simply copy paste the character sequence on to your <code>.vimrc</code>! </strong>That won’t work. You should open your <code>.vimrc</code> on Vim, go to <code>insert</code> mode, and press <code>Ctrl+v</code> – this would put a caret under your cursor – now press <code>Alt + 1</code> and it should fill in the necessary characters there. Restart vim, and <code>Alt+1</code> should now open and close NERDTree.</p>



<h3>Making it <em>look</em> like PyCharm</h3>



<p><a href="https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox">Gruvbox</a> looks like the default PyCharm theme, kinda, so let’s get that:</p>


<pre title="">git clone https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox.git ~/.vim/pack/vimcharm/start/gruvbox

</pre>


<p>According to the <a href="https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox/wiki/Installation">installation</a> page, we need to add this to our <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>


<pre title="">autocmd vimenter * ++nested colorscheme gruvbox
</pre>


<h3>Commenting and Uncommenting lines using Ctrl + /</h3>



<p>We are going to use <a href="https://github.com/preservim/nerdcommenter">NERDCommenter</a> for this. Clone it into the right directory, just as before:</p>


<pre title=""> git clone https://github.com/preservim/nerdcommenter ~/.vim/pack/vimcharm/start/nerdcommenter

</pre>


<p><code>Ctrl+/</code> cannot be directly mapped on your <code>.vimrc</code>. So just like before, we insert the correct escaped character sequence into our <code>.vimrc</code> by going into insert mode, pressing <code>Ctrl+v</code>, and then pressing the desired keycombo (<code>Ctrl + /</code> in this case).</p>


<pre title="">" The part after "=" in the below line should be inserted using Ctrl+v while in insert mode and then pressing Ctrl+/
set &lt;F13&gt;=^_
noremap &lt;F13&gt; :call NERDComment(0,"toggle")&lt;CR&gt;

" So that NERDCommenter can automatically decide how to comment a particular filetype
filetype plugin on

</pre>


<p>We are telling Vim to map the character sequences that <code>Ctrl + /</code> produces to the <code>F13</code> key, which probably does not exist on your keyboard, and then we map <code>F13</code> to the appropriate command to toggle comments. Restart Vim, open (or create) a python file and try <code>Ctrl + /</code> while in normal mode – it should comment/uncomment the line.</p>



<h3>Autocomplete</h3>



<p>Autocomplete on Vim does not feel as “fluid” as on PyCharm  – for example, I haven’t managed to get it to work on imports – but it is still besser als nichts. Get <a href="https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim">jedi-vim</a>:</p>


<pre title=""> git clone https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim ~/.vim/pack/vimcharm/start/jedi-vim

</pre>


<p>Restart vim, and <code>Ctrl + space</code> should already be giving you autocomplete suggestions. IMHO, jedi-vim displays too much information (what even is that bar thing that comes up on  top?) – all I wanted was a simple autocomplete prompt. Put this on your <code>.vimrc</code> to Make Autocomplete Great Again:</p>


<pre title="">let jedi#show_call_signatures = 0
let jedi#documentation_command = ""
autocmd FileType python setlocal completeopt-=preview

</pre>


<h3>Go-to definition using Ctrl+click</h3>



<p>This is something that jedi-vim already does – all we need are some <code>.vimrc</code> entries:</p>


<pre title="">set mouse=a
let g:jedi#goto_command = "&lt;C-LeftMouse&gt;"
map &lt;C-b&gt; &lt;C-LeftMouse&gt;

</pre>


<p>The above lines enable mouse support on Vim, sets <code>Ctrl + left click</code> as the combination for jedi’s goto command, and then recursively maps <code>Ctrl+b</code> (which is also what PyCharm uses by default) to <code>Ctrl + left click</code> as a keyboard-friendly alternative.</p>



<p>I also prefer the goto command to open a new tab when navigating to a different file. Here’s how to enable that, along with <code>Shift+j</code> and <code>Shift+k</code> to move between tabs:</p>


<pre title="">let g:jedi#use_tabs_not_buffers = 1
nnoremap J :tabp&lt;CR&gt;
nnoremap K :tabn&lt;CR&gt;
</pre>


<h3>Jump to previous location using Alt + minus</h3>



<p>If you end up navigating multiple tabs away using <code>Ctrl+b</code>, you can press <code>Ctrl+</code>o repeatedly to jump back to your original position.  Press <code>Ctrl+i</code> to go in the other direction. These would come in handy if you have to quickly <code>gg</code> to the beginning of the file to add an import – you can then press <code>Ctrl+o</code> to go back to the line you were editing. I believe in PyCharm the default mappings for this are <code>Ctrl + Alt + Left arrow</code> and <code>Ctrl + Alt + right arrow</code> respectively.  I remapped these to <code>Alt + -</code> and <code>Alt + Shift + -</code> (that would be in fact <code>Alt + _</code> ):</p>


<pre title="">set &lt;A--&gt;=^[-
noremap &lt;A--&gt; &lt;C-O&gt;
set &lt;A-_&gt;=^[_
noremap &lt;A-_&gt; &lt;C-I&gt;

</pre>


<p>Remember that copy-pasting these won’t work and you will have to enter insert mode and press <code>Ctrl+v</code> and then <code>Alt + -</code></p>



<h3>Fuzzy file search</h3>



<p>Fuzzy file search is what PyCharm does when you press the Shift key twice. </p>



<p>Download <a href="https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim">CtrlP</a>:</p>


<pre title="">git clone https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim.git ~/.vim/pack/vimcharm/start/ctrlp
</pre>


<p>By default pressing <code>Ctrl+p</code> should bring up the search prompt. We can’t map this to double shift (as in PyCharm) since vim can’t recognize <code>Shift</code> key presses (unless it’s combined with a printable character). I decided to map this to <code>Ctrl + </code>o instead (“o” for open), though this is not any better than the default setting. On your <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>


<pre title="">let g:ctrlp_map='&lt;C-O&gt;'
let g:ctrlp_cmd='CtrlPMixed'
</pre>


<p>The second line above specifies that the search should be over files, buffers, tags e.t.c – you may omit it if you do not want buffers to show up on your search. <code>ctrl+t</code> on a search result will open it in a new tab. </p>



<h3>Search everywhere and replace</h3>



<p>One of the most useful features in PyCharm is the “search in project” dialog that <code>Ctrl + Shift + f</code> brings up. For example, if  I delete/rename a hard-coded string literal, this is the dialog that I would bring up to look for all occurrences of that string literal so that I can rename/delete all of them – right from the search window.</p>



<p>Instead of using the built-in <a href="https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Find_in_files_within_Vim">vimgrep</a> or making an external call to the ubiquitous grep, we are going to use <a href="https://beyondgrep.com/why-ack/">ack</a> because it excludes annoying things like gitignore and binaries from the search results by …</p></div></article></div>

Why and how did I do it?</p>

<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>

<p>Whenever I need to quickly look something up (or use a calculator), I open a
new terminal (using a keyboard shortcut) and start typing into it. Slow bash
startup disrupts this workflow as I would often type before the shell prompt:</p>

<p><img src="https://work.lisk.in/img/even-faster-bash-startup/mistype.png" alt="messed up prompt"></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/danpker">Daniel Parker</a> recently wrote an excellent blog post <a href="https://danpker.com/posts/2020/faster-bash-startup/">Faster Bash
Startup</a> detailing his journey from 1.7 seconds to 210&nbsp;ms. I start at 165&nbsp;ms
and need to go significantly lower than Daniel, therefore different techniques
will be needed.</p>

<h3 id="investigation">Investigation</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine">hyperfine</a> is a brilliant command-line tool for benchmarking commands that
I discovered recently (thanks to Daniel!), so let’s see where we are now:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[tomi@notes ~]$ hyperfine 'bash -i'
Benchmark #1: bash -i
  Time (mean ± σ):     165.8 ms ±   0.7 ms    [User: 156.3 ms, System: 12.8 ms]
  Range (min … max):   164.9 ms … 167.1 ms    17 runs
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we need to find out what’s taking so long. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5014823/how-to-profile-a-bash-shell-script-slow-startup/20855353">How to profile a bash shell
script slow startup?</a> Most Stack Overflow answers suggest some
variant of <code>set -x</code>, which will help us find any single command that takes
unusually long.</p>

<h4 id="man">man</h4>

<p>In my case, that command was <code>man -w</code>, specifically <a href="https://github.com/liskin/dotfiles/blob/7d14190467fe22bf5d4f85a7b202118d2341e3ed/.bashrc.d/10_env.sh#L8-L10">this piece of my
<code>.bashrc.d/​10_env.sh</code></a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>export </span><span>MANPATH</span><span>=</span><span>$HOME</span>/.local/share/man:
<span># FIXME: workaround for /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/man</span>
<span>MANPATH</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>man <span>-w</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Turns out none of this is needed any more, <code>man</code> and <code>manpath</code> now add
<code>~/.local/​share/​man</code> automatically so I can just drop it and save more than
100&nbsp;ms<sup id="fnref:man-seccomp" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:man-seccomp">1</a></sup>.</p>

<h4 id="death-by-a-thousand-cuts">death by a thousand cuts</h4>

<p>But that’s it. No other single command stands out, it’s just a lot of small
things that add up. Daniel says “it has to take <em>some</em> time,” and he’s mostly
right, but I still have one trick up my sleeve.</p>

<p>My <code>.bashrc</code> is split into several smaller parts in <code>~/.bashrc.d</code>, so I can
profile these and see if anything stands out. My
<a href="https://github.com/liskin/dotfiles/blob/68964611b4b578b646cf5f13a47a4ee77e93e740/.bashrc"><code>.bashrc</code></a>
thus becomes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>for </span>i <span>in</span> ~/.bashrc.d/<span>*</span>.sh<span>;</span> <span>do
	if</span> <span>[[</span> <span>$__bashrc_bench</span> <span>]]</span><span>;</span> <span>then
		</span><span>TIMEFORMAT</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$i</span><span>: %R"</span>
		<span>time</span> <span>.</span> <span>"</span><span>$i</span><span>"</span>
		<span>unset </span>TIMEFORMAT
	<span>else</span>
		<span>.</span> <span>"</span><span>$i</span><span>"</span>
	<span>fi
done</span><span>;</span> <span>unset </span>i
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s see what happens…</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[tomi@notes ~]$ __bashrc_bench=1 bash -i
/home/tomi/.bashrc.d/10_env.sh: 0,118
/home/tomi/.bashrc.d/20_history.sh: 0,000

/home/tomi/.bashrc.d/90_fzf.sh: 0,011
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>118&nbsp;ms in <code>10_env.sh</code> was caused by <code>man -w</code> and we know what to do with that.</p>

<h4 id="completions">completions</h4>

<p>11&nbsp;ms in <code>31_​completion.sh</code> which loads <a href="https://github.com/scop/bash-completion">bash-completion</a>. That’s
certainly better than Daniel’s 235&nbsp;ms, probably because up-to-date
bash-completion only loads a few necessary completions and defers everything
else to being loaded on demand. I couldn’t live without the completions, so
11&nbsp;ms is a fair price.</p>

<p>8&nbsp;ms for <code>50_​git_​dotfiles.sh</code>, which defines a few aliases and
sets up git completions for my <code>git-dotfiles</code> alias, seems too much, though.
Good news is that we don’t need to drop this. We can use bash-completion’s
on-demand loading. Whenever completions for command <code>cmd</code> are needed for the
first time, bash-completion looks for
<code>~/.local/​share/​bash-completion/​completions/​cmd</code> or
<code>/usr/​share/​bash-completion/​completions/​cmd</code>.</p>

<p>Therefore,
<a href="https://github.com/liskin/dotfiles/blob/68964611b4b578b646cf5f13a47a4ee77e93e740/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/git-dotfiles"><code>~/.local/​share/​bash-completion/​completions/​git-dotfiles</code></a>
becomes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>. /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/git
complete -F _git git-dotfiles
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="fzf">fzf</h4>

<p><code>90_fzf.sh</code> loads key bindings and completions code so that <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a> is used
when searching through history, completing <code>**</code> in filenames, etc. Well worth
the 11&nbsp;ms it needs to load<sup id="fnref:fzf" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fzf">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h4 id="are-we-done-yet">are we done yet?</h4>

<p>After these changes, I got:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[tomi@notes ~]$ __bashrc_bench=1 bash -i
/home/tomi/.bashrc.d/10_env.sh: 0,001
/home/tomi/.bashrc.d/20_history.sh: 0,000

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s 29&nbsp;ms, brilliant! Or… is it? <emoji>🤔</emoji></p>

<div><div><pre><code>[tomi@notes ~]$ hyperfine 'bash -i'
Benchmark #1: bash -i

  Range (min … max):    54.8 ms …  58.9 ms    53 runs
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="history">history</h4>

<p>Some of those additional 26&nbsp;ms are spent reading my huge
(<code>HISTSIZE=​50000</code>) <code>.bash_​history</code> file. I will skip the details
about how I investigated this, because I didn’t: I stumbled upon this by
chance while testing something else.</p>

<p>We can see that using an empty history file brings us down to a little under
40&nbsp;ms:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[tomi@notes ~]$ HISTFILE=/tmp/.bash_history_tmp hyperfine 'bash -i'

  Range (min … max):    37.8 ms …  42.3 ms    75 runs
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, cutting 17&nbsp;ms by sacrificing the shell history is probably not a good
deal for most people. I settled for setting up a systemd

my bash startup below 40&nbsp;ms:</p>

<p>By dropping unnecessary invocation of <code>man -w</code>, deferring loading of git
completions to when they’re needed, and shortening my shell history file, I
managed to speed up bash startup from 165 ms to 40 ms.</p>

<p>More importantly, I no longer type before the prompt, even if I try!</p>

<p>Redditor <em>buttellmewhynot</em> (pun intended)
<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/jxfm2y/even_faster_bash_startup_165_ms_40_ms/gcxiigg/">comments</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I feel like it shouldn’t matter that the shell starts with a delay. If you
start a shell, the computer should assume that you want further input
directed there and queue somewhere to send it to the shell when it’s up.</p>

  <p>I understand that there’s probably a lot of weird quirks about how terminals
and shells work and how processes get created but surely there’s a way to do
this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They’re right on both points. The input is queued somewhere, and there is a
way to fix the messed up prompt. As some might suspect, <a href="https://www.zsh.org/">zsh</a> handles it
fine: try running <code>sleep 5</code> and type some input in the meantime:</p>

</tr>
</tbody></table>
  <figcaption>pending input handling without custom prompt</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We can see that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in all cases, the input appears twice (bit annoying, but tolerable)</li>
  <li>zsh prompt is never messed up</li>
  <li>bash prompt is messed up if there’s no newline after the input<sup id="fnref:readline-assumes" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:readline-assumes">5</a></sup></li>
  <li>no input is discarded, in contrast to the first image of this post</li>
</ul>

<p>Turns out <a href="https://github.com/liskin/dotfiles/blob/460bdc3c5fa814b874c19d172ce0e3955e278207/.bashrc.d/20_prompt.sh#L13-L27">my PROMPT_COMMAND</a> which was meant to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/19943482/3407728">ensure
the prompt always starts on new line</a> was discarding
the pending input. Zsh uses <a href="https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh/blob/19390a1ba8dc983b0a1379058e90cd51ce156815/Src/utils.c#L1599">a different approach</a>,
printing <code>$COLUMNS</code> spaces and then a carriage return
(<a href="https://serverfault.com/a/97543">explanation</a>), which I don’t like as it messes
up copy/paste. But I <a href="https://github.com/liskin/dotfiles/compare/a5db1831b37f89e00a637bcc20594a4fcf16de1d^...322ad36ec1d3ee5485c7b637e4c41fff7ea6745c">managed to improve my solution</a> to
correctly detect pending input and not discard it.</p>

<!--and [trying to do what zsh does][new-prompt-command] fixes
it:-->

<p><img src="https://work.lisk.in/img/even-faster-bash-startup/earlytype.png" alt="not messed up prompt after early typing"></p>

<p>It’s not perfect (so I’ll still try to keep bash startup fast), but it’s
definitely an improvement, and it will be useful whenever I get impatient with
a slow command and start typing the next command before the prompt appears.</p>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/buttellmewhynot"><em>buttellmewhynot</em></a> for
nudging me in the correct direction.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p><span>What sets great product managers apart from merely good ones? </span></p> <p><span>It is a difficult question to answer because there are so many things that "great" product managers do. And because the discipline itself is changing very quickly. There is no universal answer. But it is a question worth asking.</span></p> <p><span>I tackled this question by interviewing industry leaders, drawing on my own experience, and research. </span></p> <p><span>Here are the top traits, principles, and tactics I collected, that great product managers tend to share.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Data + Intuition</span></h3></p> <p><span>As product managers, we face many decisions every day. But what does "effective decision making" mean?</span></p> <p><span>Being "data-driven" is a good start. But the term is so overused that it has lost its meaning. It also has its blind spots. </span></p> <p><span>Here is how </span> <a href="https://twitter.com/trevin" target="_blank"><span>Trevin Chow</span></a> <span>, Director of Product at Nike, put it:</span></p> <div><blockquote><span>Great product managers are able to find the right balance between data and intuition at any given moment to inform and drive their decision making. This could be something as small a bug fix, or something much larger such as which features to include in a v1 vs what to cut.

The best product managers I've worked with are able to do this very well, balancing all sorts of inputs of "data" and combining it with their intuition to find the right balance of any given moment on what to index on.</span></blockquote></div>  <p><h3><span>Truth-Seeking</span></h3></p> <p><span>Both scientists and product managers play a truth-seeking game — scientists test their ideas in the natural world; product managers test theirs in the market.</span></p> <p><span>﻿</span> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielfalabella" target="_blank"><span>Daniel Falabella</span></a> <span>, Director of Product at Duolingo, believes that "90% of a Product Manager’s job is to find 'truth'". And this is one reason why Daniel thinks that entrepreneurs make the best PMs. He added,</span></p> <div><blockquote><span>Lots of PMs go through the motions: they talk to teammates, become familiar with vanity metrics, talk to 2 users, or assume that their managers are right. They give the illusion of having the right inputs, only to pay up the price when it's time to discuss outputs.</span></blockquote></div>  <p><h3><span>Adaptable</span></h3></p> <p><span>Product managers are responsible for the success of their products. But the path to get there is rarely straight-forward.  </span></p>  <div><blockquote><span>Great PMs are adaptable. They know when to go into execution mode, and when to step back and work on strategy. They make everyone around them feel heard. At the end of the day, they make their customers and business successful, and their teams and cross functional partners want to work with them over and over again.</span></blockquote></div>   <div><blockquote><span>Underrated skill for founders: Altitude shifting. 

People are often either good at high-level strategy or atomic-level execution, but rarely both.

It's the ability to zoom out &amp; paint the 5 yr vision, and then drop down into the weeds of day-to-day, &amp; see how the two connect.</span></blockquote></div>  <p><h3><span>First Principles</span></h3></p> <p><span>﻿</span> <a href="https://blackboxofpm.com/" target="_blank"><span>Brandon Chu</span></a> <span>, VP Product &amp; GM of Platform at Shopify, </span> <a href="https://blackboxofpm.com/the-first-principles-of-product-management-ea0e2f2a018c" target="_blank"><span>wrote in an article</span></a> <span> that some of the best PMs he knows make their decisions based on first principles. He explained,</span></p> <div><blockquote><span>First principle thinking helps PMs because as companies scale, communicating the rationale behind historical, current, and future decisions can be simplified in a way that their team and stakeholders can rally around. </span></blockquote></div> <div><blockquote><span>This enables people around the PM to move quickly in the same direction, decouple, and make smart trade offs without their presence.</span></blockquote></div>    <p><h3><span>Deep Understanding of the Problem</span></h3></p> <p><span>It is tempting, especially for the technically-minded folks, to start with an idea for a solution and run with it. But building a great product requires understanding the problem, and understanding the person behind the problem.</span></p>  <div><blockquote><span>If you get on the ground and hear what people are suffering from, then you can have a deeper understanding of what needs to be done. It’s not just empathy. It’s being specific and zoning in on the areas of improvement based on people’s real experiences."</span></blockquote></div>  <p><span>﻿</span> <a href="https://twitter.com/lissijean" target="_blank"><span>Melissa Perri</span></a> <em>, </em> <span>CEO and founder of Produx Labs, </span> <a href="https://roadmunk.com/blog/melissa-perri/" target="_blank"><span>said in an interview</span></a> <span> that "
what sets a decent product manager apart from a really great product manager, is really the way they think and approach problems". She continued,</span></p> <div><blockquote><span>To me, thinking like a product manager is about problem solving. It’s about synthesizing a lot of information, understanding the system, trying to piece together what is the problem, breaking it down into small manageable chunks so you can analyze it, and then figuring out what is the right solution from there.</span></blockquote></div>  <p><h3><span>Humble and Coachable</span></h3></p> <p><span>Being humble/coachable is what Daniel (from earlier) considers the other important trait of a great product manager.</span></p> <p><span>Related to the truth-seeking point, you will be wrong a lot throughout your career. This may be a tough pill to swallow for the smart and ambitious ones. But it is an important part of growing as a person and learning to make better decisions over time.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Evangelize</span></h3></p> <p><span>Your work isn't done when the requirements are defined, or even when the product gets shipped. </span></p>  <div><blockquote><span>If you’re not sick of saying it, you probably aren’t saying it enough. Constant communication might feel like “fluff,” but it isn’t. Evangelism is a critical part of the role—and it’s your job to make sure the organization is aligned and swimming in the same direction.</span></blockquote></div> <p><span>And that,</span></p> <div><blockquote><span>For you [product managers], communication&nbsp;</span> <em>is</em> <span>&nbsp;a primary “output,” and it should be exceptional.</span></blockquote></div>  <p><h3><span>Resourceful</span></h3></p> <p><span>There are always more things to build than there is time for. And often, you don't get as many people working on your product as you would like.</span></p> <p><span>Mastering the art of stretching resources given a tight budget is valuable.</span></p> <p><span>This could mean finding cheaper technical workarounds. This could mean ruthlessly focusing on the small number of things that will really move the needle.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Love of Making Things</span></h3></p> <p><span>﻿</span> <a href="https://www.ellenchisa.com/" target="_blank"><span>Ellen Chisa</span></a> <span>, Co-founder of Dark and former VP of Product at Lola, </span> <a href="https://mokriya.com/blog/the-new-product-manager-a-conversation-with-ellen-chisa/" target="_blank"><span>said in an interview</span></a> <span> that, "You have to really love making things, but you have to be okay with not being the person actually making the thing."</span></p> <p><span>Having a genuine love for making things is powerful. This intrinsic motivation can keep you going, especially when things get difficult.</span></p> <p><span>This genuine interest also translates to you noticing other cool products in your life and building things outside of work.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>At the End of the Day</span></h3></p> <p><span>Ultimately, your responsibility as a product manager to ship successful products. To help your business and customers succeed. </span></p> <p><span>Being on top of things. Delivering results. These are attributes of a great PM that few would disagree.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Further Readings</span></h3></p>  <p><span>﻿</span> <a href="https://blackboxofpm.com/the-first-principles-of-product-management-ea0e2f2a018c" target="_blank"><span>The First Principles of Product Management</span></a> <span> by Brandon Chu.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

	<h2>Opinion – Google ReCAPTCHA</h2>
<p>You’re no doubt familiar with clicking on a box declaring that you are not a robot, that looks something like this:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/e62.gif" alt="" width="383" height="102"></p>
<p>For most people, this only takes a few seconds, validates, and lets them continue on their way. However, if you’re not signed into your Google Account, don’t use Google Chrome and have any kind of tracking protection in your browser, there’s a good chance you’ll be <em>treated</em> with the opportunity of helping train Google’s Machine Learning image recognition algorithms:</p>
<figure id="attachment_395" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-395"><img loading="lazy" src="https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/google-recaptcha-issue-1024x707.png" alt="" width="800" height="552" srcset="https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/google-recaptcha-issue-1024x707.png 1024w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/google-recaptcha-issue-300x207.png 300w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/google-recaptcha-issue-768x530.png 768w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/google-recaptcha-issue.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-395"><a href="https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2019/06/internet-users-unite-to-speak-up-against-the-inconveniences-caused-by-recaptcha.html">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google has a history of mass-outsourcing free labour to the global population of internet users, with ReCAPTCHA v2, they employed the involuntarily help of millions to <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/captcha-if-you-can-how-youve-been-training-ai-for-years-without-realising-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transcribe scanned books</a>, which lead to <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/11/google-books-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">large copyright cases</a>.</p>
<p>With ReCAPTCHA v3, or the <em>I’m not a robot</em> checkbox, <a href="https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/v3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google tracks your usage around the website</a> it is embedded on before you even get to the Captcha form.</p>
<h3>You agree to Google’s Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>Ever clicked <em>I’m not a robot</em>? In doing so, you agree to Google’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Perhaps you’re thinking it’s easy to avoid, but let me assure you it isn’t – once you start paying attention to every place using Google ReCAPTCHA v3, you’ll be shocked!</p>
<p>I choose to use Firefox and DuckDuckGo, and to avoid Google services as much as possible. But if I want to do something like track a package, I have to agree to Google’s Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Google’s tracking code is <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ta-googleanalytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on more websites than any other</a>, including Facebook.</p>
<h3>Alternatives</h3>
<p>In my opinion, Google clearly holds monopolies in many areas least of all this, and needs to be broken up. Failing this, ReCAPTCHA needs to be redesigned such that it doesn’t serve as tracking and free labour for image recognition, and instead purely serves as a validation tool. A good start to this would be making the code FOSS, and allowing webmasters to self host it, rather than relying on Google’s black box proprietary cloud services.</p>
<p><strong>If you’re a website owner and looking to replace Google ReCAPTCHA, here is a <a href="https://switching.software/replace/google-recaptcha/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fantastic guide</a>.<br>

<p>Additionally, <a href="https://www.hcaptcha.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hCaptcha</a> is a much more privacy friendly, drop in replacement for Google ReCAPTCHA.</p>

    <p>If you followed the recent Apple events, you probably saw a picture of the A14 and M1 dies… that got me thinking about what you would see if you could pass iOS under X-Rays…</p>
<p>In my previous article about the <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1019-evolution-of-the-programming-languages-from-iphone-os-to-ios-14/">evolution of the programming languages from iPhone OS 1.0 to iOS 14</a>, I analyzed iOS based on the number of binaries and their programming languages. As I pointed out in this past post, the size of the binaries were not taken in account. In this new article, I look at iPhone OS 1.0 and iOS 14 from a size perspective using tree maps.</p>

<p>To produce the images in this article, I extracted the root filesystem (including the dyld shared cache) of each major iOS release:</p>

<p>I then created a tree map. You might be familiar with tree maps as they are often used to visualize a file hierarchy to give you a graphical overview of the structure. One key characteristic is that each file is shown as a rectangle with an area proportional to the file's size. The tree maps displayed in this article have been created using the awesome <a href="http://grandperspectiv.sourceforge.net/">GrandPerspective</a> and annotated with <a href="https://www.pixelmator.com/">Pixelmator</a>.</p>

<p>Let's look at what you would see if you could scan iPhone OS 1.0 using X-Rays:</p>

<p>The diagram below highlights some of the major functional blocks:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/images_article/iOS1_structures.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We can already notice that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The structure is quite simple and has similarities to macOS</li>
<li>Frameworks are taking more than a third of the size</li>
<li>Fonts are taking more than 25% of the whole operating system</li>
</ul>
<p>We can go one level deeper and identify all the components:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/images_article/iOS1_details.png" alt=""></p>
<p>From the list of components, we can clearly determine all the main features of iPhone OS 1.0:</p>
<ul>
<li>Phone</li>
<li>SMS</li>
<li>Weather</li>
<li>Clock</li>
<li>Mail</li>
<li>Safari + Web</li>
<li>Calendar</li>
<li>Maps</li>
<li>Wallpaper</li>
<li>Ringtones</li>
<li>Office support</li>
<li>Audio player</li>
<li>Video player</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>A couple of components worth mentioning:</p>
<ul>
<li>The UIKit framework is taking more than 13 % of the total size</li>
<li>The wallpapers and ringtones count for 6 %</li>
<li>ICU (International Components for Unicode) takes more than 5 %</li>
<li>SpringBoard is roughly 2 %</li>
</ul>

<p>I won't give details about each iOS release but you can inspect the tree maps from iPhone OS 2.0 to iOS 13.1:</p>

</table>
<p>Note that the number of building blocks increased with each new iOS release and the components are becoming smaller.</p>

<p>We are now in 2020 and iOS 14 is available. Without a surprise, iOS 14 is way more complex than iPhone OS 1.0:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/images_article/iOS14.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here is the diagram highlighting the functional blocks in iOS 14:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/images_article/iOS14_structures.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We can note that the main structure is still fairly similar to the original iPhone OS 1.0 version: the fonts, frameworks, applications, library, /usr, … are still there.</p>
<p>There are however a couple of big differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS 14 contains a lot of <code>Preinstalled Assets</code> and <code>Linguistic Data</code>. As far as I can tell, these components are used for on-device machine learning: language detector, voices, tokenizers, vocalizers, …</li>
<li>The dyld shared cache, a caching mechanism introduced in iPhone OS 3.1, causes the Frameworks and Private Frameworks to be split in several areas. The dyld shared cache has been marked with the red box in the diagram.</li>
<li>Health is clearly an important feature of iOS 14.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are so many components in iOS 14 that it is way more complex to identify all of them. I gave it a try nonetheless:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/images_article/iOS14_details.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Although it is now difficult to list all the features, there are some clear trends:</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS 14 is packed with on-device machine learning technologies: Face Detection, Deep Convolutional Networks, Vision frameworks, Text Recognition, Neural Network, …</li>
<li>A lot of components are related to the camera and photos: Effects, Memories, video processing, photo library, …</li>
<li>Siri and voices are clearly visible.</li>
<li>As we already mentioned, Health is an important feature.</li>
<li>We can identify a couple of features added over the years: HomeKit, Watch, CarPlay, Spotlight, Emoji 🤟, News, iWork, Wallet, Shortcuts, ARKit, …</li>
</ul>
<p>More statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fonts are now counting for less than 6 % of the size</li>
<li>Linguistic Data represent almost 8 % of the size</li>
<li>Although the ICU size was multiplied by more than 3 since iPhone OS 1.0, it now represents approximatively 0.5% of the total</li>
</ul>

<p>For readability the previous tree maps in this article were all displayed using the same size. If we present iPhone OS 1.0 next to iOS 14 with a proportional area, you would see that the whole iPhone OS 1.0 is basically taking the size of the iOS 14 wallpapers:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/images_article/Compare-iOS1-iOS14.png" alt=""></p>

<p>When iPhone OS 1.0 was released in 2007, it redefined the smartphone with a limited set of core features. Nowadays iOS 14 contains an incredible amount of components. By looking at them based on their size, we can determine the most important features. We thus distinctly see Apple's AI push into on-device machine learning with technologies like object detection in images and video, language analysis, sound classification and text recognition.</p>

<p>In this article, we will explain what the process injection technique is and how it can be detected with Sysmon.</p>



<h2>What is Process Injection?</h2>



<p>To put it simply, a process running code in the address space of another process is called process injection. Attackers and malware often make use of the “Process Injection” technique. Thanks to this technique, they can increase the success rate of the attack by preventing detection.</p>



<p>Before explaining how we can detect the Process Injection technique, let’s talk about the methods by which this technique can be performed.</p>



<p>There are many methods for process injection. Frequently used among these are as follows.</p>



<ol><li>DLL Injection</li><li>P.E. Injection</li><li>Process Hollowing</li><li>Hook Injection</li><li>AppInit_DLLs</li></ol>



<p>If you want to exercise after this article, you can use our <a href="https://letsdefend.io/?q=process" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blue team lab</a> for free.</p>



<h2>Sysmon</h2>



<blockquote><p><em>System Monitor</em>&nbsp;(<em>Sysmon</em>) is a Windows system service and device driver that, once installed on a system, remains resident across system reboots to monitor and log system activity to the Windows event log. It provides detailed information about process creations, network connections, and changes to file creation time.&nbsp;</p><cite>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon</cite></blockquote>



<p>Sysmon is to record many different events. With the EventID:8 of Sysmon, we can detect the Process Injection technique.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://letsdefend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-21-at-22.10.02-1024x546.png" alt="" srcset="https://letsdefend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-21-at-22.10.02-1024x546.png 1024w, https://letsdefend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-21-at-22.10.02-300x160.png 300w, https://letsdefend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-21-at-22.10.02-768x410.png 768w, https://letsdefend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-21-at-22.10.02-1536x819.png 1536w, https://letsdefend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-21-at-22.10.02-1050x560.png 1050w, https://letsdefend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-21-at-22.10.02-330x176.png 330w, https://letsdefend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-21-at-22.10.02.png 2002w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>



<h2>Example</h2>



<p>Let’s examine how we can detect Process Injection technique with Sysmon Events.</p>



<p>We can use <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/secrary/InjectProc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">InjectProc</a> to simulate the Process Injection technique. InjectProc is an open source project created to simulate Process Injection technique. There is also a dll file created for you to test in the project.</p>



<p>You can download InjectProc’s executable file from <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/secrary/InjectProc/releases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. Let’s inject a DLL into the “winrar.exe” process with the command below.</p>



<blockquote><p>InjectProc.exe dll_inj malicious.dll winrar.exe</p></blockquote>



<div><figure><img src="https://letsdefend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-21-at-22.16.18-1024x564.png" alt="" srcset="https://letsdefend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-21-at-22.16.18-1024x564.png 1024w, https://letsdefend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-21-at-22.16.18-300x165.png 300w, https://letsdefend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-21-at-22.16.18-768x423.png 768w, https://letsdefend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-21-at-22.16.18-1536x847.png 1536w, https://letsdefend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-21-at-22.16.18-1050x579.png 1050w, https://letsdefend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-21-at-22.16.18-330x182.png 330w, https://letsdefend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-21-at-22.16.18.png 1836w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>



<p>When we successfully injected the dll, the message box appears as in the image above, indicating that the injection was successful.</p>



<p>Now let’s detect Process Injection with Sysmon that we simulate. We can see Sysmon Events with the “Event Viewer” tool. Sysmon logs are located in the directory below.</p>



<blockquote><p>“Applications and Services Logs/Microsoft/Windows/Sysmon/Operational”</p></blockquote>



<p>When we look at the events number 8, it is seen that Process Injection has been caught.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://letsdefend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-21-at-22.17.47-1-1024x547.png" alt="" srcset="https://letsdefend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-21-at-22.17.47-1-1024x547.png 1024w, https://letsdefend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-21-at-22.17.47-1-300x160.png 300w, https://letsdefend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-21-at-22.17.47-1-768x410.png 768w, https://letsdefend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-21-at-22.17.47-1-1536x820.png 1536w, https://letsdefend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-21-at-22.17.47-1-1050x561.png 1050w, https://letsdefend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-21-at-22.17.47-1-330x176.png 330w, https://letsdefend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-21-at-22.17.47-1.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>



<p>You can detect the Process Injection technique by following this event in your SIEM products.</p>

              <blockquote>I remember vividly why I wanted to write code. &nbsp;I wanted to be a hacker...</blockquote><div><p>When <code>.com</code> was free, people built their websites using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_FrontPage">frontpage</a> or <a href="https://guidebookgallery.org/pics/gui/applications/office/notepad/win98.png">notepad</a>.<br>Websites looked very different than now. Blinking texts were the coolest thing you could put on your website, and marquee meant you could have a news bar; static nevertheless, so you need to change the HTML and upload the page using FTP again every time you need something new to show up. I am not going to talk about connecting a database to your website because, frankly, I didn't know what a database is even back then.</p><p>Circa that time, WindowsXP was around the corner, I was a recurring guest to internet cafes, and I noticed some websites looked shady, with skull pictures and lists of numbers or passwords. I tried to talk to the people who were using these websites to know what is it. But they didn't help. They just mentioned that they were hackers.</p><p>Of course, it was not true that they were hackers -no hacker will tell you he's a hacker, right ?-, I mean, they might use some tools or software - as I learned them later - to crack into someone's computer or steal his mail's password. But they didn't know how to write a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_horse_(computing)">trojan</a> or what's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_attack">password dictionary</a>. Anyhow, that was how I started to get into the rabbit's hole. What followed was years of doing script kiddy's stuff, using <a href="https://malware.wikia.org/wiki/Sub7">sub7</a> and <a href="https://malware.wikia.org/wiki/ProRat">prorat</a>, guessing a lot of passwords when it was possible, bombing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CGI">CGI</a>'s, cracking into DB's, and getting credit cards. I lived in a country where there weren't laws against that at all back then.</p></div><p>I knew I lacked something.<br>I didn't want to use someone else's software.<br>I needed to write viruses myself. I wanted to know how to write a worm that makes me super cool like Zero Cool in the movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113243/"><em>Hackers</em></a><em>.</em><br>As you can see, I was very young and naive.<br></p><p>One day, I found: <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">How To Become A Hacker</a>, <em>by Eric Steven Raymond</em>.<br>I couldn't comprehend the whole article. I was merely searching on how to become a real hacker. And that article contained a full section towards that goal.</p><blockquote>Basic Hacking Skills</blockquote><p><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#skills1">Learn how to program</a>. That was it, I will learn programming languages so I can be a hacker, I didn't know the reason, but programming languages and viruses must be connected. No wonder.</p><p>Years later, I forgot about hacking completely being a teenager and living my age, but I was always good with machines. I started learning programming languages in college at some point as I went to study computer science. I started with C# and ASP.NET. Started doing freelancing as a side job and earning money was a good sign that I made the right decision.</p><p>Three years passed, and I still felt I lacked real programming skills. Programming can't be a visual studio where I can drop textbox in a website, and that's it. While I respect all that, it just didn't fulfil my inner hungry for black screens and command lines.</p><p>By 2014 I started learning Ruby and Rails by contributing to one of the well-known open <a href="https://github.com/manshar/manshar">publishing websites back then</a>, just like medium but for Arabic people. I even <a href="https://ahmgeek.com/medium-for-arabs/">wrote about it here</a>.</p><p>By 2015 I was already working as a ruby on rails developer in Cairo. Black screens were the norm for me, Vim was the text-editor/IDE of choice, and ubuntu was my distro. <br>I made it, mom.</p><div><p>Almost 6 Years passed since I made the transition from <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-Microsoft-technology-stack-all-about">Microsoft stack</a> to open source. In contrast, Microsoft is now prominent in the open-source world. Back then, it was still lingering on the closed side of things.</p><p>From Fullstack Rails developer to Back end to cloud engineering,<br>my life changed by thinking that programming was connected to hacking. My life changed by reading "<em><strong>How to become a hacker</strong></em>" and falling in love with solving problems.</p></div>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="https://zapier.com/how-it-works">Zapier</a> is a no-code workflow automation tool that can be used to integrate apps and make them work together. I have been using Zapier for a bunch of my side projects and it was been pretty useful to hook up services like Stripe with Gmail. However, I recently started hitting their <a href="https://zapier.com/pricing">free tier limits</a> and started exploring the possibility of building a simple Zapier alternative, mostly for fun.</p>
<p>The requirements that I came up with :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Completely serverless</strong>: I don’t want to manage any infrastructure</li>
<li><strong>(almost) Free</strong>: It should cost close to $0 for my use-case which I will talk about below.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-step workflows</strong>: Currently, Zapier’s free tier only lets you perform one action for a particular trigger. I wanted the ability to perform multiple actions (for e.g. send an email and a slack message) for a particular trigger.</li>
<li><strong>Webhooks support</strong>: I’m a big fan of <a href="https://zapier.com/page/webhooks/">Zapier’s webhooks</a> functionality and want to replicate that.</li>
<li><strong>Polling-based workflows</strong>: Ability to poll an API endpoint and take action if there is new data available</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The following section will provide an overview of the system based on the requirements we came up with.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-workflow">What is a workflow?</h3>
<p>A workflow can be defined as a Trigger and a series of actions that are taken as a result of the Trigger. The trigger can be based on webhooks or polling.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/workflow.png" alt="/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/workflow.png"></p>
<p>There are various ways to model a workflow. Some of the most common ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Using code</strong>: In a system like <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/">Airflow</a>, a workflow (called a DAG) is defined in Python using Airflow specific abstractions.</li>
<li><strong>Using config files</strong>: A workflow engine like <a href="https://argoproj.github.io/projects/argo/">Argo</a>, which is built on top of Kubernetes, uses YAML to define workflows.</li>
</ul>
<p>To keep our system simple, we will define our workflows using JSON. JSON is natively supported in Python (my language of choice) along with many other programming languages.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-trigger">What is a Trigger?</h3>
<p>A trigger is the root node of a workflow. We will support two types of triggers in our system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Webhooks</strong>: The workflow will expose a webhook that can be used to initiate this particular workflow. The webhook will accept POST requests.</li>
<li><strong>Polling:</strong> The workflow will specify an API endpoint which will be polled at a regular interval. If new data is available, then specified actions will be run</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-is-an-action">What is an Action?</h3>
<p>An action is performed as a result of a workflow being triggered. We will support two types of actions in our system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Email</strong>: Send an email with the data coming from the trigger</li>
<li><strong>Slack</strong>: Send a slack message with the data coming from the trigger.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="designing-the-system">Designing the system</h2>
<p>In the following section, we will take a look at the various services we will be using to build the system based on our requirements.</p>
<h3 id="creating-webhooks">Creating Webhooks</h3>
<p>Since one of the main requirements for the system is to be serverless, we will leverage API Gateway and Lambda to support webhooks. API Gateway will create a single endpoint that we can use to send webhooks and we will do the filtering in our Lambda function.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/webhooks.png" alt="/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/webhooks.png"></p>
<h3 id="supporting-polling-based-triggers">Supporting Polling-based Triggers</h3>
<p>Polling triggers are slightly more involved. The system comprises of the following parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/services-cloudwatchevents-expressions.html">Lambda function scheduled</a> at a regular frequency. This lambda function will go through all the workflows that are polling-based and put them in an SQS queue. The benefit of decoupling the scheduling of the workflow from the processing of the workflow is that we will be communicating with external services that could be unreliable. If there is a failure, we want to isolate it to a particular workflow.</li>
<li>Lambda function which gets triggered whenever there is a new workflow has been enqueued. This function is responsible for executing the trigger i.e. querying the API endpoint and checking if there is any new data available.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/polling-trigger.png" alt="/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/polling-trigger.png"></p>
<h3 id="de-duplication">De-duplication</h3>
<p>We only want to execute our actions for the polling-based workflows when there is new data. To support this, we will use a de-duplication identifier similar to <a href="https://zapier.com/help/create/basics/data-deduplication-in-zaps">Zapier</a>. We will use DynamoDB to store the identifiers we have already processed for a particular workflow. Since our data model is pretty straightforward, DynamoDB is a good fit for us.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/deduplication.png" alt="/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/deduplication.png"></p>
<h3 id="performing-actions">Performing Actions</h3>
<p>Since we want to support workflows where a single trigger could lead to multiple actions, we will use SQS to decouple the trigger from the action.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lambda function which processes the trigger and if there are any actions to run, enqueue them to SQS.</li>
<li>Lambda function which runs the actions as a result of messages being enqueued to S3.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the benefits of this architecture are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actions are isolated from each other. If one action fails, other actions won’t be affected. We could even use a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-dead-letter-queues.html">Dead-Letter queue</a> to debug and process failed actions.</li>
<li>Trigger and action are decoupled. Since there could be multiple actions that could take a variable amount of time, processing everything in a single Lambda function could lead to Lambda timeouts.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/action.png" alt="/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/action.png"></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="cost">Cost</h2>
<p>Now that we have a rough idea of how to build such a system, let’s look at what it will potentially cost us. I came up with a rough estimate of how this system would be used based on my current usage of Zapier:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Run 5 workflows</strong>: 3 of them are webhooks based, the rest are polling-based. For simplicity, let’s assume each of these workflows have 2 actions.</li>
<li>The webhooks based workflows are triggered roughly 10 times a day. Thus, the total number of webhooks-based workflow executions would be <strong>30/day</strong>.</li>
<li>The polling workflows would run once <strong>every 12 hours</strong> and they would check for any new data in the API endpoints.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, let’s look at the pricing of the various AWS services we are planning to use.</p>
<h3 id="aws-lambda">AWS Lambda</h3>
<p>AWS Lambda has a pretty generous free tier which includes 1M free requests per month and 400,000 GB-seconds of compute time per month.</p>
<p>These are the Lambda functions that we currently have in the system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Webhooks: This function accepts any incoming webhooks and if a matching workflow exists, enqueues downstream tasks to SQS.</li>
<li>Polling Trigger: There are two lambda functions to support polling triggers. The first one runs once every 12 hours and enqueues any poll-based workflows whereas the second function runs once for each poll-based workflow and checks if any new data is available.</li>
<li>Actions: We run one Lambda function for every action in a workflow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on our previous assumptions of usage, the number of Lambda requests we would have every month are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Webhooks: 30 requests / day * 2 actions / workflow = 60 / day = 1800 / month</li>
<li>Polling: 2 requests / day + 2 workflows * 2 actions / workflow = 6 / day = 180 / month</li>
</ul>
<p>For the sake of simplicity, we can assume that our Lambda functions on average run for 30 seconds (probably much lower than this) and they take 1024 MB of memory.</p>
<p>Using these assumptions, our total compute will be (1024 MB * 30s * 1880 request) / 1024 = 56400 GB-seconds per month. We are under the free tier limit on Lambda.</p>
<p>Cost for Lambda (using free tier): <strong>$0 / month</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/Untitled.png" alt="/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/Untitled.png"></p>
<p>Cost for Lambda (assuming we aren’t eligible for the free tier): $0.20 + <strong>56400 * $0.0000166667 = $ 1.14 / month</strong></p>
<h3 id="sqs">SQS</h3>
<p>Similar to Lambda, SQS also has a pretty generous free tier. The first 1 million monthly requests are free. Every API action counts as a request.</p>
<p>A rough estimate of the number of requests we would make to SQS are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Webhooks: For every webhooks request we get, we would enqueue the actions for the workflow to SQS. Then, Lambda functions which execute the actions would dequeue these actions and run them.</li>
<li>Polling-based: Every time a polling-based workflow is scheduled, we would first enqueue all the polling-based workflows into SQS. Then, a Lambda function would dequeue these workflows and then enqueue any actions in these workflows to a different SQS queue which would eventually get dequeued by the Lambda function which runs the actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the description above, the number of SQS requests we would make are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Webhooks: 30 requests / day * 2 actions / workflow (enqueued) * 2 actions / workflow (dequeued) = 120 requests / day = 3600 requests / month</li>
<li>Polling-based: 2 requests / day * 2 polling-based workflows (enqueued) * 2 polling-based workflows (dequeued) * 2 actions / workflow (enqueued) * 2 actions / workflow (dequeued) = 32 requests / day = 960 requests / month</li>
</ul>
<p>Total number of requests to SQS in a month: ~5000 requests / month</p>
<p>Cost for SQS (regardless of tier): <strong>$0 / month</strong></p>
<h3 id="api-gateway">API Gateway</h3>
<p>The API Gateway will only be used by our webhooks workflows. Based on our assumptions above, we will make roughly 900 requests/month to our API Gateway.</p>
<p>Cost for API Gateway: <strong>~$0 / month</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/Untitled%201.png" alt="/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/Untitled%201.png"></p>
<h3 id="dynamodb">DynamoDB</h3>
<p>DynamoDB has the most complicated pricing model out of all the services we are planning to use. More details about pricing is available <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/pricing/">here</a>.</p>
<p>We will be using DynamoDB only for polling-based workflows to ensure we can deduplicate any data.</p>
<p>The schema for our table would look like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span>
    <span># primary_key
</span>    <span>"workflow_id"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>"S"</span><span>:</span> <span>"my_workflow"</span>
    <span>},</span>
    <span>"processed_keys"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>"SS"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span><span>"1234"</span><span>,</span> <span>"1235"</span><span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<ul>
<li>Primary key would be the name of the particular workflow</li>
<li>We would also store the set of processed unique identifiers for the data. For the sake of simplicity, we can assume these identifiers would be approximately <strong>10 characters</strong> in length.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on our usage model, we expect to make the following requests to DynamoDB:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Read requests</strong>: 2 polling workflows * 2 triggers / day * 1 read request = 4 requests/day or 120 requests/month</li>
<li><strong>Write requests</strong>: A Write request would only be made when there is new data available in the API. Let’s assume we will have new data every time the workflow is triggered: 4 requests/day or 120 requests/month.</li>
</ul>
<p>I used this pricing calculator for DynamoDB and used conservative estimates that we calculated above.</p>
<p>Cost for Dynamo: ~<strong>0.50 / month</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/Untitled%202.png" alt="/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/Untitled%202.png"></p>
<h3 id="total-cost">Total Cost</h3>
<p>If we assume that we are within the limits of the free tier usage for Lambda and SQS, this system will cost us ~<strong>$0.50 / month.</strong></p>
<p>If we include the cost for Lambda, our system will cost us <strong>~$1.64 / month</strong>.</p></div></div>

<p>Creativity is a widely misunderstood psychological process. Yet, it’s one of the most important and distinctive features we humans have.</p>



<p>Among the many myths about creativity, there’s one that always bothered me: inspiration.</p>



<p>One of the things I tried when I was younger was rapping. I can remember clearly how much I would struggle to write my song’s lyrics. It was so frustrating, partly, because there was nothing I could do about it (or so I believed). I had to resign myself to patiently wait for inspiration.</p>



<p>Now that I understand creativity just a little bit better, I know how much control you actually have over your creative process. Maybe you can’t rush it, but you can definitely plan for it.</p>



<p>James Webb Young believed that there is a clear, step-by-step process you can follow to produce new ideas almost as assembly lines produce cars.</p>



<p>Before learning the process, though, he thought it was essential that you embrace the two principles of creative thinking:</p>



<ol><li>New ideas are just “the combination of two old elements”.</li><li>Your ability to create these new combinations depends on your ability to detect patterns.</li></ol>



<p>Once you wrap your head around the fact that everything is a remix, you can deliberately train yourself to see patterns.</p>



<p>By being more curious, learning about a wide range of subjects, and paying more attention to your surroundings, you can gradually become a pattern-making machine.</p>

  <p><strong>By Michelle Ark and Chris Wu</strong></p>
<p>In January of 2014, Shopify built a data pipeline platform for the data science team called Starscream. Back then, we were a smaller team and needed a tool that could deal with everything from ad hoc explorations to machine learning models. We chose to build with PySpark to get the power of a generalized distributed computer platform, the backing of the industry standard, and the ability to tap into the Python talent market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fast forward six years and our data needs have changed. Starscream now runs 76,000 jobs and writes 300 terabytes a day! As we grew, some types of work went away, but others (like simple reports) became so commonplace we do them every day. While our Python tool based on PySpark was computationally powerful, it wasn’t optimized for these commonplace tasks. If a product manager needed a simple rollup for a new feature by country, pulling it, and modeling it wasn’t a fast task.</p>
<p>We’ll show you how we moved to a SQL modelling workflow by leveraging <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/" target="_blank" title="Analytics engineering is the data transformation work that happens between loading data into your warehouse and analyzing it. dbt allows anyone comfortable with SQL to own that workflow." rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">dbt</a> (data build tool) and created tooling for testing and documentation on top of it. All together, these features provide Shopify’s data scientists with a robust, production-ready workflow to quickly build straightforward pipelines.</p>

<p>When we interviewed our users to understand their workflow on Starscream, there were two issues we discovered: <em>development time</em> and <em>thinking</em>.</p>
<p><em>Development time</em> encompasses the time data scientists use to prototype the data model they’d like to build, run it, see the outcome,and iterate. The PySpark platform isn’t ideal for running straightforward reporting tasks, often forcing data scientists to write boilerplate and it yields long runtimes. This led to long iteration cycles when trying to build models on unfamiliar data.</p>
<p>The second issue, <em>thinking</em>, is more subtle and deals with the way the programming language forces you to look at the data. Many of our data scientists prefer SQL to python because its structure forces consistency in business metrics. When interviewing users, we found a majority would write out a query in SQL then translate it to Python when prototyping. Unfortunately, query translation is time consuming and doesn’t add value to the pipeline.</p>
<p>To understand how widespread these problems were, we audited the jobs run and surveyed our data science team for the use cases. We found that 70% or so of the PySpark jobs on Starscream were full batch queries that didn’t require generalized computing. We viewed this as an opportunity to make a kickass optimization for a painful workflow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our goal was to create a SQL pipeline for reporting that enables data scientists to create simple reporting data faster, while still being production ready. After exploring a few alternatives, we felt that the dbt library came closest to our needs. Their tagline “deploy analytics code faster with software engineering practices” was <em>exactly</em> what we were looking for in a workflow. We opted to pair it with Google BigQuery as our data store and dubbed the system and its tools, Seamster.</p>
<p>We knew that any off-the-shelf system wouldn’t be one size fits all. In moving to dbt, we had to implement our own:</p>
<ul>
<li>source and model structure to modularize data model development</li>
<li>unit testing to increase the types of testable errors</li>
<li>continuous integration (CI) pipelines to provide safety and consistency guarantees.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Source Independence and Safety</h2>
<p>With dozens of data scientists making data models in a shared repository, a great user experience would</p>
<ul>
<li>maximize focus on work&nbsp;</li>
<li>minimize the impact of model changes by other data scientists.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, dbt declares raw sources in a central <code>sources.yml</code>. This quickly became a very large file as it included the schema for each source, in addition to the source name. It creates a huge bottleneck for teams editing the same file across multiple PRs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To mitigate the bottleneck, we leveraged the flexibility of dbt and created a top-level ‘sources’ directory to represent each raw source with its own source-formatted yaml file. This way, data scientists can parse only the source documentation that’s relevant for them and contribute to the <code>sources.yml</code> file without stepping on each other’s toes.</p>

<p><em>Base models are one-to-one interfaces to raw sources.</em></p>
<p>We also created a Base layer of models using the <a href="https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/how-we-structure-our-dbt-projects/355" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">‘</a><a href="https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/how-we-structure-our-dbt-projects/355" target="_blank" title="How we structure our dbt projects" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">staging’ concept from dbt</a> to implement their best practice of <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/guides/best-practices/#limit-references-to-raw-data" target="_blank" title="Limit references to raw data - dbt" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">limiting references to raw data</a>. Our Base models serve as a one-to-one interface to raw sources. They don’t change the grain of the raw source, but do apply renaming, recasting, or any other cleaning operation that relates to the source data collection system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Base layer serves to protect users from breaking changes in raw sources. Raw external sources are by definition out of the control of Seamster and can introduce breaking changes for any number of reasons at any point in time. If and when this happens, you only need to apply the fix to the Base model representing the raw source, as opposed to every individual downstream model that depends on the raw source.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Model Ownership for Teams</h2>
<p>We knew that the tooling improvements of Seamster would be only one part of a greater data platform at Shopify. We wanted to make sure we’re providing mechanisms to support good dimensional modelling practices and support data discovery.</p>
<p>In dbt, a model is simply a .sql file. We’ve extended this definition in Seamster to define a model as a directory consisting of four files:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><code>model_name.sql</code></li>
<li><code>schema.yml</code></li>
<li><code>README.md</code></li>
<li><code>test_model_name.py</code></li>
</ul>
<p>You can further organize models into directories that indicate a data science team at Shopify like ‘finance’ or ‘marketing’.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To support a clean data warehouse we’ve also organized data models into these rough layers that differentiate between:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>base</strong>: data models that are one-to-one with raw data, but cleaned, recast and renamed</li>
<li>
<strong>application-ready</strong>: data that isn’t dimensionally modelled but still transformed and clean for consumption by another tool (for example,&nbsp; training data for a machine learning algorithm)</li>
<li>
<strong>presentation</strong>: shareable and reliable data models that follow dimensional modelling best practices and can be used by data scientists across different domains.</li>
</ul>
<p>With these two changes, a data consumer can quickly understand the data quality they can expect from a model and find the owner in case there is an issue. We also pass this metadata upstream to <a href="https://shopify.engineering/solving-data-discovery-challenges-shopify" target="_blank" title="How We’re Solving Data Discovery Challenges at Shopify" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">other tools</a> to help with the data discovery workflow.</p>
<h2>More Tests</h2>
<p>dbt has native support for ‘schema tests’, which are encoded in a model’s schema.yml file. These tests run against production data to validate data invariants, such as the presence of null values or the uniqueness of a particular key. This feature in dbt serves its purpose well, but we also want to enable data scientists to write unit tests for models that run against fixed input data (as opposed to production data).</p>
<p>Testing on fixed inputs allows the user to test edge cases that may not be in production yet. In larger organizations, there can and will be frequent updates and many collaborators for a single model. Unit tests give users confidence that the changes they’re making won’t break existing behaviour or introduce regressions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seamster provides a Python-based unit testing framework. Data scientists write their unit tests in the <code>test_model_name.py</code> file in the model directory. The framework enables constructing ‘mock’ input models from fixed data. The central object in this framework is a ‘mock’ data model, which has an underlying representation of a Pandas dataframe. You can pass fixed data to the mock constructor as either a csv-style string, Pandas dataframe, or a list of dictionaries to specify input data.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt="Input and expected MockModels are built from static data. The actual MockModel is built from input MockModels by BigQuery. Actual and expected MockModels can assert equality or any Great Expectations expectation" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/input-expected-mock-models.jpg?v=1605811967" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/input-expected-mock-models.jpg?v=1605811967"><br><em>Input and expected MockModels are built from static data. The actual MockModel is built from input MockModels by BigQuery. Actual and expected MockModels can assert equality or any Great Expectations expectation.</em></p>
<p>A constructor creates a test query where a common table expression (CTE) represents each input mock data model, and any references to production models (identified using dbt’s ‘ref’ macro) are replaced by references to the corresponding CTE. Once you execute a query, you can compare the output to an expected result. In addition to an equality assertion, we extended our framework to support all expectations from the open-source <a href="https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations" target="_blank" title="Great Expectations - Always know what to expect from your data." rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Great Expectations</a> library to provide more granular assertions and error messaging.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main downside to this framework is that it requires a roundtrip to the query engine to construct the test data model given a set of inputs. Even though the query itself is lightweight and processes only a handful of rows, these roundtrips to the engine add up. It becomes costly to run an entire test suite on each local or CI run. To solve this, we introduced tooling both in development and CI to run the minimal set of tests that could potentially break given the change. This was straightforward to implement with accuracy because of dbt’s lineage tracking support; we simply had to find all downstream models (direct and indirect) for each changed model and run their tests.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Schema and Directed Acyclic Graph Validation on the Cheap</h2>
<p>Our objective in Seamster’s CI is to give data scientists peace of mind that their changes won’t introduce production errors the next time the warehouse is built. They shouldn’t have to wonder whether removing a column will cause downstream dependencies to break, or whether they made a small typo in their SQL model definition.</p>
<p>To achieve this accurately, we would need to build and tear down the entire warehouse on every commit. This isn’t feasible from both a time and cost perspective. Instead, on every commit we materialize every model as a view in a temporary BigQuery dataset which is created at the start of the validation process and removed as soon as the validation finishes. If we can’t build a view because its upstream model doesn’t provide a certain column, or if the SQL is invalid for any reason, BigQuery fails to build the view and …</p></div></div>

<i>Disclaimer: despite the controversial title, this article is not trying to show that RPC is a superior approach to REST, or GraphQL is superior to RPC. Instead, the goal of the article is to give you an overview of the approaches, their strengths and weaknesses. The final choice anyway will be a trade-off.</i></p>
<p>Even though HTTP is an application layer (i.e. L7), protocol, when it comes to API development, HTTP de facto plays the role of a <em>lower-level</em> transport mechanism.</p>
<p>There are multiple conceptually different approaches on how to implement an API on top of HTTP:</p>
<ul>
<li>REST</li>
<li>RPC</li>
<li>GraphQL</li>
</ul>
<p>...but the actual list of things an average API developer needs to be aware of is not limited by these three dudes. There are also <em>JSON</em>, <em>gRPC</em>, <em>protobuf</em>, and many other terms in the realm. Let's try to sort them out, <del>once and for all</del>!</p>
<div><p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/api-developers-never-rest/kdpv.png" width="80%"></p></div>


<h2 id="a-namerestarepresentational-state-transfer-rest"><a name="rest"></a>Representational state transfer (REST)</h2>
<p>First and foremost, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a> is just a software architectural style. It's a set of design constraints, not a concrete protocol. REST relies on the idea of a resource. I.e. a REST API is comprised of a set of resources (nouns) and a fairly limited number of actions (verbs) to interact with these resources (fetch, create, update, delete, etc). It's ideologically very close to the original HTTP design heavily based on the concepts of resources (URLs) and methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Thus, from the implementation standpoint mapping of the REST model to the HTTP protocol is relatively straightforward:</p>
<pre><code># Create new book
POST http://myapi.com/books/ (author="R. Feynman", year=1975) -&gt; book_id

# Get book with ID = 1
GET http://myapi.com/books/1 () -&gt; (id=1, author="R. Feynman", year=1975)

# Update book with ID = 1
PUT http://myapi.com/books/1 (id=1, author="Richard Feynman", year=1975) -&gt; (...)

# Delete book with ID = 1
DELETE http://myapi.com/books/1 () -&gt; null</code></pre><p>Probably every modern web framework provides all the needed facilities to build a RESTful web service out of the box. And from the client-standpoint, calling a REST API is pretty trivial - it just needs to be able to send the specified HTTP methods to the set of predefined URLs.</p>
<p>However, from the API designer standpoint, it may be not so obvious how to express a real-world domain model in terms of resources (i.e. nouns) keeping the number of allowed actions (i.e. verbs) limited. Surprisingly, inspite of a super-widespread (ab)use of the word <em>REST</em> nowadays, not so many contemporary APIs can be actually considered truly RESTful. Trying to play a purist while designing a RESTful web service can lead you to a really clunky API design.</p>
<h2 id="a-namerpcaremote-procedure-call-rpc"><a name="rpc"></a>Remote procedure call (RPC)</h2>
<p>Similarly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call">RPC</a> is also an API design technique. RPC focuses on the idea of actions (verbs) and that often makes the involved resources (nouns) fairly primitive and ad hoc. For every procedure or transaction in the business model an API designer simply adds an RPC endpoint:</p>
<pre><code># Create new book
createBook(author, year) -&gt; book_id

# Get book by ID
getBook(book_id) -&gt; book

# Change book's author
setBookAuthor(book_id, author) -&gt; null

# Delete book by ID
deleteBook(book_id) -&gt; null</code></pre><p>Under the hood, there should be another layer mapping such procedure calls to the HTTP requests. E.g. <code>setBookAuthor(1, "Richard Feynman")</code> can be mapped to something like:</p>
<pre><code>POST http://myapi.com/set-book-author/ (book_id=1, author="Richard Feynman") -&gt; null</code></pre><p>Now, let's compare the tasks of changing the author's name in the REST and RPC worlds. While the implementation seems trivial in the case of RPC, there is a bunch of controversial questions that need to be answered in case of the RESTful implementation. If the author's name is an attribute of the book, should we provide the full book object with the modified author field while sending <code>PUT /books/1</code>? What if there is no full book object around on the client-side? Should we fetch the book first or can we just send only the book ID and the new author name? But what's about the rest of the attributes on the server-side? Should they be zeroed out if an almost empty <code>PUT</code> request arrives (that would be disastrous but fully aligned with the REST principles decision)? Or maybe we should give up on the HTTP <code>PUT</code> method and start using <code>PATCH</code> (have you ever heard of it)?</p>
<p>Luckily, if we follow the RPC approach, we can simply omit most of the questions from above. But of course, there is always a downside - a typical RPC API usually consists of a pretty high number of custom procedures. Obviously, it makes the mapping of the RPC model to the HTTP layer a non-trivial task. The good thing is that API designers rarely need to think of this part at all. There are a lot of libraries implementing the RPC layer on top of HTTP and some of them are truly prominent (yes, I'm talking about Google's gRPC and Facebook's Thrift). But there is another, probably much more complicated problem with the RPC approach...</p>
<p>A dozen rich REST resources combined with 3-5 HTTP methods usually can cover a hundred use cases. REST API deliberately brings a regular structure to the domain model making its growth and evolution much more controllable. On contrary, RPC APIs grow organically. Introducing a new use case often require adding a few more API endpoints to the already bloated list. Since there is no entity-oriented structure enforced by the API design, over a relatively short period of time the number of RPC calls may exceed the maximum level of complexity a team can handle.</p>
<h2 id="a-namegraphqlagraphql"><a name="graphql"></a>GraphQL</h2>
<p>By this time, we already learned that neither RPC nor REST approach is ideal. REST suffers from <a href="https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/rest-vs-graphql-418eac2e3083">over and under fetching problem</a> and may lead to a significant mental overhead on the design phase. But if we try to avoid the entity-oriented design by replacing it with a hundred ad hoc RPC endpoints, over time the maintenance of the overgrown RPC API may become a nightmare.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphQL">GraphQL</a> tries to address the weaknesses of both techniques. Assuming the entity-oriented domain model contributes to the peace of mind of developers in the long term, the GraphQL approach starts from defining a schema, i.e. set of resources (i.e. nouns) and their interconnections. Sounds like a graph, doesn't it? Having a formal scheme definition, GraphQL bumps a fairly complex server and client on top of it. The thick client allows querying (QL stands for query language) custom and compound resources. The thick server knows how to populate the response based on the client's query and the domain schema.</p>
<p>Thus, GraphQL API basically consists of a single endpoint. I.e. no more bloated APIs. At the same time, its super-flexible and tailored queries help to avoid fetching unnecessary data from the server. Additionally, developers still benefit from the formal entity-oriented domain schema. But magic always comes at a price (c). And the price in that case is the utter complexity of the GraphQL client and server sides. So, yeah, it's all about trade-offs...</p>
<h2 id="a-namecontent-encodingawhats-up-with-protobuf-json-etc"><a name="content-encoding"></a>What's up with protobuf, JSON, etc?</h2>
<p>What could help with wrapping your head around the API development realm is the proper categorization of the moving parts. At this time we already know that REST and RPC are just architectural styles. And GraphQL, well... I tend to consider it as a style as well, even though technically it's a formal language backed by a runtime.</p>
<p>But if GraphQL is backed by a particular implementation, we probably could expect the same from RPC and REST. And indeed, there is a bunch of prominent RPC frameworks - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRPC"><em>gRPC</em></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Thrift"><em>Apache Thrift</em></a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Avro"><em>Apache Avro</em></a> to name a few. Surprisingly though, there seem to be no clear leaders among REST frameworks. Probably because REST is technically super-close to HTTP and almost every web framework already plays well with it.</p>
<p>Hm, but what's the deal with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_Buffers"><em>protobuf</em></a>? Apparently, it's just one of the ways to serialize your data before it will be sent over the wire or stored somewhere. It just so happened that gRPC, a particular RPC framework, fully relies on <em>protobuf</em>. And since they often used hand in hand and have been released altogether, lots of people negligently use the terms <em>gRPC</em> and <em>protobuf</em> interchangeably. However, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/35349813/1201488">it's perfectly fine to use <em>protobuf</em> in your RESTful API</a> as an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type">encoding format</a> and we do it currently at work for some of our services. Thus, <em>protobuf</em> should not be compared with REST or RPC frameworks but instead, it can be compared with <em>XML</em> or <em>JSON</em>.</p>
<p>To confuse you even further, <em>Apache Thrift</em> has its own serialization format called... <em>Thrift</em>! I.e. there is <em>gRPC over protobuf</em> and <em>Thrift over Thrift</em> 🙈</p>
<p><strong>Summarizing</strong>, there are different architectural styles to design an HTTP API. The three most popular ones are REST, RPC, and GraphQL. Every style in turns can be implemented in many ways and there is a bunch of well-known frameworks such as gRPC or Apache Thrift. Under the hood, they rely on lower-level mechanisms like data serialization (<em>protobuf</em>, <em>JSON</em>, <em>XML</em>) or protocols (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-RPC"><em>JSON-RPC</em></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-RPC"><em>XML-RPC</em></a>). And these lower-level bits sometimes can be reused between styles making the whole realm of API development looking pretty convoluted at first sight.</p>

November 22, 2020 | https://homebrewserver.club/low-tech-website-howto.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://homebrewserver.club/low-tech-website-howto.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
<p>Earlier this year we’ve been asked to help redesign the website of <a href="http://lowtechmagazine.com/">lowtechmagazine.com</a>. The primary goal of the redesign was to radically reduce the energy use associated with accessing their web content. At the same time it is an attempt to find out what a low-tech website could be.</p>
<p>In general the idea behind lowtechmagazine.com is to understand technologies and techniques of the past and combine them with the knowledge of today. Not in order to be able to ‘do more with the same’, but rather ‘to do the same with less’.</p>
<p>In this particular case it means that all the optimizations and increases in efficiency do not go towards making a website which is faster at delivering even more megabytes. Rather it is a website which uses all the advances in technological efficiency, combined with specific hardware and software choices, to radically and drastically cut resource usage. At the same time for us a sustainable web site means ensuring support for older hardware, slower networks and improving the portability and archivability of the blog’s content.</p>
<p>This meant making a website and server which could be hosted from the off-grid solar system used in the lowtechmagazine.com’s home-office in Barcelona.</p>
<p>The article <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/09/how-to-build-a-lowtech-website/">‘How To Build A Low-Tech Website?’</a> gives more insights into the motivations on making a self-hosted solar-powered server, while this companion article on will give in-depth technical information.</p>
<p>Both the articles and the readesign should be read as a proposition how things could be done, but also as a question on <a href="#room-for-improvements">what could be improved</a>. So we really appreciate additional insights and feedback.</p>

<h2 id="operating-system">Operating system</h2>
<p>The webserver is running on <a href="https://www.armbian.com/olimex-lime-2/">Armbian Stretch</a>, which is a <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> based distribution built around the <a href="http://linux-sunxi.org/Main_Page">SUNXI</a> kernel. This is kernel for low-powered AllWinner-based single board computers. The Armbian project provides good documentation on how write an Armbian image to an SD card an boot the board for the first time in the <a href="https://docs.armbian.com/User-Guide_Getting-Started/">Armbian User Guide</a>.</p>
<h2 id="pelican-static-site-design">Pelican Static Site &amp; Design</h2>
<p>The main change in the webdesign was to move from a dynamic website based on Typepad<sup id="fnref:typepad"><a href="#fn:typepad">1</a></sup> to a static site generated by <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>. Static sites load faster and require less processing than dynamic websites. This is because the pages are pre-generated and read off the disk, rather than being generated on every visit.<sup id="fnref:static"><a href="#fn:static">2</a></sup></p>
<p>You can find the source code for ‘solar’, the Pelican theme we developed <a href="https://github.com/lowtechmag/solar">here</a></p>
<h3 id="image-compression">Image compression</h3>
<p>One of the main challenges was to reduce the overall size of the website. Particularly to try and reduce the size of each page to something less than 1MB . Since a large part of both the appeal and the weight of the magazine comes from the fact it is richly illustrated, this presented us with a particular challenge.</p>
<p><img alt="Image from the blog showing 19th century telephone switchboard operators, 159.5KB" src="https://homebrewserver.club/images/international-switchboard.jpg"></p><p>Image from the blog showing 20th century telephone switchboard operators(<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bell_System_switchboard.jpg">original source</a>), 159.5KB</p>
<p>In order to reduce the size of the images, without diminishing their role in the design and the blog itself, we reverted to a technique called dithering:</p>

<p>This is a technique ‘to create the illusion of “color depth” in images with a limited color palette’<sup id="fnref:illusion"><a href="#fn:illusion">3</a></sup>. It based on the print reproduction technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halftone">halftoning</a>. Dithering, or digital half-toning<sup id="fnref:digitalhalftone"><a href="#fn:digitalhalftone">4</a></sup>, was widely used in video games and pixel art at a time when a limited amount of video memory constrained the available colors. In essence dithering relies on optical illusions to simulate more colors. These optical illusions are broken however by the distinct and visible patterns that the dithering algorithms generate.</p>
<p><img alt="Dithered with a six tone palette" src="https://homebrewserver.club/images/international-switchboard6.png"></p><p>Dithered with a six tone palette, 76KB</p>
<p>As a consequence most of the effort and literature on dithering is around limiting the ‘banding’ or visual artifacts by employing increasingly complex dithering algorithms<sup id="fnref:dithering"><a href="#fn:dithering">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Our design instead celebrates the visible patterns introduced by the technique, this to stress the fact that it is a ‘different’ website. Coincidentally, the ‘Bayesian Ordered Dithering’ algorithm that we use not only introduces these distinct visible patterns, but it is also quite a simple and fast algorithm.</p>
<p><img alt="Dithered with an eleven tone color palette" src="https://homebrewserver.club/images/international-switchboard11.png"></p><p>Dithered with an eleven tone palette, 110KB</p>
<p>We chose dithering not only for the compression but also for the aesthetic and reading experience. Converting the images to grayscale and then dithering them allows us to scale them in a visually attractive way to 100% of the view port, despite their small sizes. This gives each article a visual consistency and provides the reader with pauses in the long articles.</p>
<p>To automatically dither the images on the blog we wrote <a href="https://github.com/lowtechmag/solar-plugins">a plugin for pelican</a> that converts all source images of the blog. The plugin is based on the <a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/5.2.x/#">Python Pillow</a> imaging library and <a href="https://github.com/hbldh/hitherdither">hitherdither</a>, a dithering palette library by <a href="https://blog.hbldh.se/">Henrik Blidh</a>.</p>
<p>Using this custom plug-in we reduced the total weight of the 623 images that are on the blog so far by 89%. From 194.2MB to a mere 21.3MB.</p>
<h3 id="archiving-and-portability">Archiving and portability</h3>
<p>Another reason to switch to a static site generator was to be able to ensure an off-line workflow, where the articles can be written and previewed locally in the browser. For this to happen the articles had to be converted to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>, a light weight markup language based on plain text files.</p>
<p>While this is quite a bit of work to do with an archive that spans 10 years of writing, it ensures the portability of the archive for future redesigns or other projects. It also makes it possible for us to archive and version the entire blog using the <a href="https://git-scm.com/doc">git</a> versioning system.</p>
<h3 id="off-line-archive">Off-line archive</h3>
<p>Because we designed the system to have an uptime of only 90% it is expected to go off-line 35 days a year.</p>
<p>Increasing the uptime of the server to 99% on solar energy means increasing the website’s ecological footprint by adding more and more tech in the form of extra solar panels, massively increased battery capacity or extra servers in different geographic locations.</p>
<p>Rather than that we opted for a low-tech approach that accepts being off-line during longer stretches of cloudy weather. However, we wanted to provide the reader with off-line reading options. Our primary method of doing so currently is by providing an <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/feeds/all.rss.xml">RSS feed containing all the articles and images on the site</a>. In the future we will explore other means of providing off-line reading of the magazine.</p>
<p><img alt="An image of the built-in feed reader of Firefox showing solar.lowtechmagazine.com's RSS feed" src="https://homebrewserver.club/images/off-line-reading.png"></p><p> Most browsers preview only the article titles and summaries of the RSS feed. In fact the feed contains the full articles. Once you add the feed to your favorite reader, it will download the full articles that you can read at any given time.</p>
<h2 id="material-server">Material Server</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>”[…] the minimal file-based website is contrary to a cloud mentality, where the material circumstances of the hardware and hosting location are made irrelevant (for the cloud/vps customer) meaning that any ‘service’ can be ‘deployed’, ‘scaled’ ‘migrated’ etc. Our approach instead informs what can be hosted based on the material circumstances of the server.”<sup id="fnref:varia"><a href="#fn:varia">6</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the page’s fundamental design elements is to stress the materiality of the webserver. In web design there is a clear distinction between ‘front-end’, the visual and content side of the website and the ‘back-end’, the infrastructure it runs on top. Outside of professional circles, the material conditions of the web or the internet’s infrastructure are rarely discussed. This has become especially the case with cloud computing as the dominant paradigm, as resources are taken for granted or even completely virtualised.</p>
<p>A low-tech website means this distinction between front-end and back-end needs to disappear as choices on the front-end necessarily impact what happens on the back-end and vice-versa. Ignoring this connection usually leads to more energy usage.</p>
<p>An increase in traffic for example will have an impact on the amount of energy the server uses, just as a heavy or badly designed website will. Part of <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/">solar.lowtechmagazine.com</a>‘s design aims to give the visitor an insight in the amount of power consumed and the potential (un)availability of the page in the coming days, based on current power usage and forecasts of the weather.</p>
<p>The power statistics can actually be queried from the server hardware. More on that <a href="#server">below</a>. To make the statistics available to the web site we wrote <a href="https://github.com/lowtechmag/materialserver">a bash script</a> that exposes them as JSON in the webroot.</p>
<p>To activate this feature there is a <code>cron</code> entry that runs the script every minute and writes it into the web directory:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>*/1 * * * * /bin/bash /home/user/stats.sh &gt; /var/www/html/api/stats.json</span>
</pre></div>
<h2 id="configuring-the-webserver">Configuring the webserver</h2>
<p>As a webserver we use <a href="https://www.nginx.com/">NGINX</a> to serve our static files. However we made a few non-standard choices to further reduce the energy consumption and page loading times on (recurrent) visits.</p>
<p>To test some of the assumed optimizations we’ve done some measurements using a few different articles. We’ve used the following pages:</p>
<p><code>FP</code> = <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/">Front page</a>, 404.68KB, 9 images</p>
<p><code>WE</code> = <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2017/09/how-to-run-the-economy-on-the-weather/">How To Run The Economy On The Weather</a>, 1.31 MB, 21 images</p>
<p><code>HS</code> = <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2017/03/heat-storage-hypocausts-air-heating-middle-ages/">Heat Storage Hypocausts</a>, 748.98KB, 11 images</p>
<p><code>FW</code> = <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/12/fruit-walls-urban-farming/">Fruit Walls: Urban Farming in the 1600s</a>, 1.61MB, 19 images</p>
<p><code>CW</code> = <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2011/12/the-chinese-wheelbarrow/">How To Downsize A Transport Network: Chinese Wheelbarrows</a>, 996.8KB, 23 images</p>
<p>For this test the pages which are hosted in Barcelona have been loaded from a machine in the Netherlands. The indicated times are all the averages of 3 measurements.</p>
<h3 id="compression-of-transmitted-data">Compression of transmitted data</h3>
<p>We run gzip compression on all our text-based content, this lowers the size of transmitted information at the cost of a slight increase in required processing. By now this is common practice in most web servers but we enable it explicitly. Reducing the amount of data transferred will also reduce the total environmental footprint.</p>

Different pieces of media (artists, albums, songs, playlists, users) all have a URI.</p><p>The ABBA song “Take a Chance on Me” has this URI:</p><p><code>spotify:track:6vQN2a9QSgWcm74KEZYfDL</code>.</p><p>The ABBA Album “The Album” has the following URI:</p><p><code>spotify:album:5GwbPSgiTECzQiE6u7s0ZN</code></p><p>As you can see, the URIs can be broken up into components:</p><p><code>spotify:&lt;media type&gt;:&lt;22 characters&gt;</code>.</p><p>The 22 characters are the numbers 0-9, characters a-z and A-Z. This means there are <code>10 + 26 + 26 = 62</code> possibilities for each character (almost <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">Base64</a>). So the potential number of Spotify URIs is <code>62^22</code> which is equal to <code>2.7e39</code> or</p><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>2</span>,<span>707</span>,<span>803</span>,<span>647</span>,<span>802</span>,<span>660</span>,<span>400</span>,<span>290</span>,<span>261</span>,<span>537</span>,<span>185</span>,<span>326</span>,<span>956</span>,<span>544</span>

I suspect setting the first and last bar set to 0 is an aesthetic choice: it makes the barcode look more like a sound wave.

I used to think academic papers were full of jargon until I read some technical patents.</p><h3 id="the-process">The Process</h3><p>When you visit <a href="https://www.spotifycodes.com/">Spotify codes</a> and input a Spotify URI, a “media reference” is created by Spotify. This media reference is 37 bits long and is the key that links a barcode to a given URI. The media reference may just be the hash of an incrementing index. After extracting a media reference from a barcode, you check with Spotify’s database (a look-up table) to determine what URI it corresponds to.

This makes the decoding process more reliable. Decoding Spotify codes involves going from analog (bar lengths) to digital (media reference), so it is a good candidate for this error correction.</p><blockquote><p>The fundamental principle of [error correction] is to add redundant bits in order to help the decoder to find out the true message that was encoded by the transmitter.</p></blockquote><p>A simple example of error correction would be to replicate each bit twice. So instead of sending <code>1</code>, you would send <code>111</code>. When that triplet is sent across a “noisy” communication channel, some of the bits could get flipped. But since there are 2 redundant bits, the receiver can guess what the value was meant to be:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Triplet received</th><th>Interpreted as</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>000</td><td>0 (error-free)</td></tr><tr><td>001</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>010</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>111</td><td>1 (error-free)</td></tr><tr><td>110</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>101</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>011</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The patents don’t specify what forward error correction schema Spotify uses, but they do say that they add 15 bits at this step. The code rate of an error correction scheme is the ratio of the information bits to the total encoded bit length. Spotify adds 15 bits to the 45 bit code, so the code rate is <code>45 / 60 = 0.75</code>. This code rate is high (close to 1) meaning it is fairly weak. It facilitates a limited amount of error correction, but that is okay. If you are sending a message to a deep space probe you want a very strong code. A Spotify code is pretty low risk: it’s easy to ping the server a few times if you decode the wrong media reference.</p><p>The total forward error corrected code is 60 bits long, which is the exact amount of information that can be encoded in the 20 octals (bar heights) in the Spotify barcode!</p><p>The patents do mention that Spotify uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_decoder">Viterbi algorithm</a> to decode the media reference from the forward error corrected code. I won’t go into it here, but that algorithm uses the redundant bits from the forward error correction to determine the best guess of the actual media reference.</p><h3 id="gray-code">Gray Code</h3><p>I really like this part of the Spotify codes.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code">Gray code</a> is an alternative way to represent a binary number. If you look closely at the following table, you will see that Gray code works by changing only one bit at a time.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Decimal</th><th>Binary</th><th>Gray</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>000</td><td>000</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>001</td><td>001</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>010</td><td>011</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>011</td><td>010</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>100</td><td>110</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>101</td><td>111</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>110</td><td>101</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>111</td><td>100</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Why does Spotify use Gray code? What is wrong with normal binary representation of the code?</p><p>The difference between 3 and 4 in Gray code is only 1 bit (<code>010 -&gt; 110</code>). In normal binary representation, that difference is 3 bits (<code>100 -&gt; 011</code>). When going from analog (the height of a given bar) to binary, using Gray codes reduces the number of bits that are “wrong” if we calculate the wrong height.</p><p>If the height of a bar is supposed to be 3, but we calculate that it is 3.51 and we round up to 4, the binary representation of that number in Gray code will only be off by one bit. <strong>This makes the forward error …</strong></p></div></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                

<p>Here is a common error you might encounter on Linux: you download a Python script from the internet and try to run it. You receive an error like the following because Python supposedly doesn’t exist:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./script.py
-bash: /path/to/script.py: /usr/local/bin/python^M: bad interpreter: No such file or directory
</code></pre>

<p>You try to run <code>python ./script.py</code> and it works. You run <code>which python</code> and verify that python is in fact at the path <code>/usr/local/bin/python</code>. Nothing should be wrong. Why can’t you run <code>./script.py</code>?</p>

<p>If you need a quick-fix then skip to the end of this post. To explore the issue further, read on!</p>

<h2 id="a-brief-investigation">A Brief Investigation</h2>

<p>If you open up script.py then the first line looks exactly like it should:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/local/bin/python
</code></pre>

<p>This is obviously a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)">shebang</a> which lets the Linux kernel<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> know which interpreter should be used to execute the python script. The sharp-eyed readers among you might have already spotted the problem with the shebang earlier. In the error message we have a mysterious <code>^M</code> character. That’s no coincidence.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1552749/difference-between-cr-lf-lf-and-cr-line-break-types"><code>^M</code>, better known as <code>\r</code>, also known as ASCII <code>CR</code>,</a> is the unwanted Windows line ending that occasionally slips its way into Linux files and causes mischief. Here is an excerpt from <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/fs/binfmt_script.c#L34">the load_script function in the Linux kernel which reads shebangs</a>:</p>

<pre><code>i_end = strnchr(bprm-&gt;buf, sizeof(bprm-&gt;buf), '\n');
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the kernel assumes that the shebang ends with <code>\n</code>. If the shebang ends with <code>\r\n</code> (as lines typically end on Windows) then <code>\r</code> is included in the interpreter’s name just like any other character.</p>

<p>This explains the original error. The kernel is looking for a python executable which is literally named <code>/usr/local/bin/python^M</code> and no such executable exists.</p>

<h2 id="two-solutions-and-a-prank">Two Solutions and a Prank</h2>

<p>The easy and obvious solution is to run <code>dos2unix</code> on the python script and strip out the insidious <code>\r</code> character.</p>

<p>The hackish solution is to create a symlink literally named <code>/usr/local/bin/python^M</code> which points to <code>/usr/local/bin/python</code>. This will let you run all such python scripts in the future without running <code>dos2unix</code> on them first.</p>

<p>As for the prank: if you want to drive a co-worker crazy then go one step farther and replace other characters in <code>/usr/local/bin/python</code> with their unicode look-alikes. You can use <a href="https://www.irongeek.com/homoglyph-attack-generator.php">the homoglyph attack generator</a> to easily do so. For example, try copy-pasting the following shebang into a python file:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/local/bin/рythοn
</code></pre>

<p>Do you see what I’ve done there? This shebang will never work and it is hard to see why. Try looking at the string in an online hex-editor like <a href="https://hexed.it/">hexed.it</a> if you’re confused.</p>

<h2 id="closing-notes">Closing Notes</h2>

<p>If you read until here you obviously like reading about strange bugs. You will enjoy other posts in my <a href="https://natanyellin.com/tags/code-sleuth">Code Sleuth series</a> and probably enjoy the content that I post on <a href="https://twitter.com/aantn">twitter</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="817d6f8" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default">
<div>
<p>Expanding a business can be profitable, but at the same time, it can add new expenses such as a larger payroll and succeeding expenditures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A strong freelance workforce gives companies a significant game-changing advantage. Niche freelancers boost your company’s flexibility, allowing you to bring in critical talent for increased productivity and innovation. This is invaluable for firms looking to scale up but may not have or want the additional overhead expenses of having additional regular employees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Upwork, in 2019, freelancers contributed almost $1 trillion to the <a href="https://websitebuilder.org/blog/freelance-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">US economy</a>, which covers roughly 5 percent of the country’s gross domestic product. As a point of comparison, the freelance economy contributed more than that of the construction industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To maximize the benefits of having freelancers on your team, your recruitment strategy must be on point. Below are 7 tips for companies who are breaking barriers and looking into exploring freelancers to supplement in-house staff:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. Clearly Define Needs and Project Description&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>If you are wondering how to hire freelancers, the first thing you need to ensure clarifying your&nbsp; company’s overall objective and completing project details. Some critical details to iron out include the project budget, expected deliverables with project deadlines, as well as the skills, tools, and expertise needed to complete the project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of these details should be reflected in a project description that will be the basis of recruiters in assessing applicants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. <strong>Prepare a Realistic Budget&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Having an adequate budget for the project is only one aspect of financial preparation. Considering the expertise required during the contract period, companies should gauge existing rates for the required skills as reference for your budget. It is also important that your budget is not wholly based on the most economical rate in the market. At the end of the day, you get what you pay for. If budget is a concern, re-adjust your project implementation plan and consider shortening the duration or removing deliverables that may be taken on by your in-house team.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Identify and Advertise in Quality and Wide-Reaching Marketplaces</strong></p>
<p>Finding freelancers requires referrals and posting much like finding regular employees. There are many popular <a href="https://freelance-platforms.financesonline.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">freelance platforms where you can find good freelancers</a>. These freelance recruitment and advertising websites display the resumes of available freelancers and also allow recruiters to post project opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on the talent you are looking for, it is best to post on reputable sites that have a wide reach and a large pool of freelancers. When reviewing applications and profiles, pay careful attention to professional rates and professional history.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. </strong><strong>Review Sample Work</strong></p>
<p>Freelancers are typically expected to be quality candidates in their fields of specialization. As part of the screening process, request for their portfolio or sample work for review. You need freelancers to perform efficiently, and asking for sample work relevant to your project will be a strong and objective indicator if they are a fit for the job. Freelancers who will provide a work sample will likely need to be paid because of the time they would allot for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5. Check References for Feedback&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>If you are wondering how to recruit freelancers that perform as expected with high quality outputs, it is important to perform due diligence prior to hiring a freelancer to ensure that they can deliver your expectations. Once you have narrowed down the list of potential candidates, request references who can testify to the quality of their performance. Also, marketplaces are a great way to narrow down the field to some choice talent and they typically have spaces for previous client feedback and ratings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. <strong>Agree on a Project Scope and Payment Scheme</strong></p>
<p>Using your project description as a take-off point, it is vital that every aspect of the engagement is clear to all parties. The chosen freelancer should understand their responsibilities, line of reporting, the timeline for completion, list of deliverables, as well as the schedule and basis for payment. This should be done before the work begins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This can be in the form of a contract that outlines all of those elements mentioned above. If the freelancer will be gaining access to confidential information, proprietary technology, and/or business details, you can also consider enforcing a non-disclosure agreement to protect your company from your competition. This is usually a concern for <a href="https://xpertspool.com/is-flutter-app-development-going-to-dominate-mobile-app-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mobile app development</a>, technology, and research and development firms.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7. Ensure Open and Constant Communication</strong></p>
<p>When talking about tips for hiring freelancers, you cannot overlook the importance of communications. Most freelancers work remotely, but it is vital to have constant and open lines of communication with your freelancer. Prior to hiring, it is recommended that you have directly communicated at least via face-to-face interview, phone conversation or video conference. This humanizes your interaction and paves the way for a personal rapport – the foundation of a warm professional relationship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A freelancer who is unwilling to have a meeting or evasive when it comes to communication and deadlines may be an indication of professional habits and attitudes that may be a challenge for you in the long run.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jumpstart Your Business Expansion with Freelance Talent</strong></p>
<p>The future of work is digital, remote-based, and highly specialized. Every year there has been an <a href="https://xpertspool.com/why-hiring-freelancers-after-2020-is-going-to-stay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increase in the number of small business hiring freelancers</a>. Hiring freelancers is advantageous because it allows you temporary skill sets you may need intermittently. It is also a cost-effective alternative to recruitment agencies or bolstering your in-house team.</p>
<p>Hiring freelance labor can boost your company’s skill set, expertise, and talent all the while being a cost-saver to your businesses. Be mindful of the recruitment process and treat them fairly and they can be an asset that helps you expand your business.</p>

<p>AMOS BASIC&nbsp;is a dialect of the&nbsp;BASIC&nbsp;programming language&nbsp;implemented on the&nbsp;Amiga&nbsp;computer. AMOS BASIC was published by&nbsp;Europress Software in 1990&nbsp;and originally written by&nbsp;François Lionet&nbsp;with&nbsp;Constantin Sotiropoulos. AMOS is considered one of the best-selling non-game Amiga software packages and sold at least over 40,000 copies worldwide. AMOS itself was created using the DevPac II Assembler, DPaint III, Pix Mate, Cross-DOS and Mini Office Pro Communications. In the end, AMOS was a rewrite of the Atari ST BASIC language or STOS. </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="765" height="450" src="https://www.generationamiga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/History-30-Years-of-AMOS-programming-language-commodore-amiga-programming-history.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.generationamiga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/History-30-Years-of-AMOS-programming-language-commodore-amiga-programming-history.jpg 765w, https://www.generationamiga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/History-30-Years-of-AMOS-programming-language-commodore-amiga-programming-history-300x176.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 765px) 100vw, 765px"></figure></div>



<p>Beginner’s All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code (BASIC) was one of the first languages most people were introduced to programming on. Versions of BASIC were included with the Commodore 64 and 128, the IBM PC and clones, the Atari ST and the Commodore Amiga. AMOS came in three packages. The first is The Creator, which contains AMOS itself, the editors, interpreter, tools and a number of example programs. AMOS: The Compiler is a compiler for AMOS programs and an update to the main program. AMOS-3D is another update to the main program and a 3D modeler and manipulator. The editor has two modes. Direct and edit. In edit, you are in a text editor designed to support AMOS. The concept is similar to LSE with Lattice/SAS C. Direct mode is where you enter a command, hit and it does it. </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="765" height="450" src="https://www.generationamiga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/History-30-Years-of-AMOS-programming-language-BASIC-STOS-TOS-workbench-compiler-amiga-news-commodore-news-games-made-with-AMOS.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.generationamiga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/History-30-Years-of-AMOS-programming-language-BASIC-STOS-TOS-workbench-compiler-amiga-news-commodore-news-games-made-with-AMOS.jpg 765w, https://www.generationamiga.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/History-30-Years-of-AMOS-programming-language-BASIC-STOS-TOS-workbench-compiler-amiga-news-commodore-news-games-made-with-AMOS-300x176.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 765px) 100vw, 765px"></figure></div>



<p>Most commands are mapped to function keys and work smoothly. AMOS uses the ALT, SHIFT, CTRL, Left-AMIGA and Right-Amiga to delimit functionkeys, good for 60 function keys. AMOS is BASIC all right. Most of the commands are very familiar and those that are not are very similar to what you would expect a BASIC command to look like. AMOS has over 500 commands. More than a few of those are specialized in dealing with graphics, sound, animation and effects. Commands for manipulating sprites, bobs, SMUS files, NT files, screens and windows abound. AMOS also had AMAL, and animation language that is interrupt driven. AMAL updates items at a rate of 60 times a second and it makes it very easy to have two-dozen bobs and half-a-dozen sprites on screen at the same time moving in complex patterns. AMOS comes with a number of tools, including a map editor, a sprite editor, grabbers and much more. The easy and popular map editor will take an IFF screen and cut it up to use the sections as tiles for creating those ever-so-popular smooth scrolling backgrounds. </p>

<p>AMOS enjoyed a lot of support in the Amiga community. There was an AMOS PD disk collection with at least over 300 disks in Europe and a contests paying cash for good AMOS programs. AMOS, along with the compiler, can generate commercial-quality software as long as the author has it in him. Big selling game titels such as Flight of the Amazon Queen and Jetstrike are just a few of them. The programming language is still used by many indie game developers in the Amiga community. The source code of AMOS was released in 2001 under a BSD style license by Clickteam.</p>

        <div>
  
  <p><time datetime="2020-11-21T00:00:00Z">Sat, Nov 21, 2020</time></p><p>Don’t we all love it when things “just work”? Colab is exactly that. Whether you want to play around with Python in your browser or need to test your machine learning pipeline, it makes your life easier.</p>
<p>While using Colab for the last couple of years, I was looking for ways to optimize its workflow. In this article, I will be sharing tweaks, solutions to the inconveniences I faced, and new ways of utilizing Colab’s power.</p>
<h2 id="mounting-google-drive">Mounting Google Drive</h2>
<p>I hated having to mount my Google Drive each time I opened my notebook or my virtual machine (VM) crashed. I had to go in the link, copy the code, and paste it back into the notebook. That’s no way of living. Fortunately, Google added a one-time mounting mechanism to allow you to link your notebook with your Google Drive. You can find it on the left menu you <code><svg viewBox="0 0 45 20" focusable="false" style="width: 5%; height: 5%;">
    <g>
        <path d="M20 6h-8l-2-2H4c-1.1 0-1.99.9-1.99 2L2 18c0 1.1.9 2 2 2h16c1.1 0 2-.9 2-2V8c0-1.1-.9-2-2-2zm0 12H4V8h16v10z"></path>
    </g>
</svg>Files</code> &gt; <code><svg viewBox="0 0 45 20" focusable="false" style="width: 5%; height: 5%;">
    <g>
        <path d="M20,6H12L10,4H4A2,2,0,0,0,2,6V18a2,2,0,0,0,2,2H20a2,2,0,0,0,2-2V8A2,2,0,0,0,20,6ZM13.57,9.32,13,8.4l.34-.6h3.11l3.69,6.5H16.38M12.11,17l-.67,1.2h-1L9,15.42,12.72,9l2,3.46h0M19.3,18.2H12.09l.67-1.2,1.15-2h6.64l.34.6Z"></path>
    </g>
</svg>Mount Drive</code>. Now each time you allocate or reconnect to a VM through that notebook, Google Drive is mounted automatically.</p>
<p>Once you mount your Drive, you should not be fetching individual files <a href="https://colin-scott.github.io/personal_website/research/interactive_latency.html">across the network</a>. The best solution is zipping your files and copying them to your VM on Colab. A single request to fetch all your files and then work on your local storage. I used this code to copy an audio dataset from my Drive to my local storage:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>copy_clips_dataset</span>(name): 
  <span>"""
</span><span>  Copies files from Google Drive to local storage
</span><span>
</span><span>  Keyword arguments:
</span><span>    name: of the tar file
</span><span>  """</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>not</span> os<span>.</span>path<span>.</span>exists(f<span>'/content/{name}/'</span>):
    <span>!</span>cp <span>"/content/drive/My Drive/audio-clips/{name}.tar.gz"</span> <span>/</span>content<span>/</span>
    <span>!</span>tar <span>-</span>xzf <span>/</span>content<span>/</span>{name}<span>.</span>tar<span>.</span>gz <span>-</span>C <span>/</span>content<span>/</span>
  <span>!</span>ls <span>-</span>l <span>/</span>content<span>/</span>{name}<span>/</span>clips <span>|</span> egrep <span>-</span>c <span>'^-'</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This function checks if the path exists; in which case you might be running the cell a second time. If the path doesn’t exist, it will copy the <code>.tar.gz</code> file to the storage on the current VM, decompress it, then print the number of files inside it.</p>
<h2 id="timing-your-code">Timing your code</h2>
<p>I needed more control over time than <code>%timeit</code> and <code>%time</code> (<code>%lsmagic</code> for the full list of magic commands). So instead of injecting time logic throughout my code, I am using decorators. By doing so, I avoid boilerplate and get the flexibility I want.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span># Source: https://stackoverflow.com/a/27737385</span>

<span>from</span> functools <span>import</span> wraps
<span>from</span> time <span>import</span> time

<span>def</span> <span>timing</span>(f):
    <span>@wraps</span>(f)
    <span>def</span> <span>wrap</span>(<span>*</span>args, <span>**</span>kw):
        ts <span>=</span> time()
        result <span>=</span> f(<span>*</span>args, <span>**</span>kw)
        te <span>=</span> time()
        <span>print</span>(f<span>'{f.__name__}{args}, {kw} took: {te-ts:2.6f} sec'</span>)
        <span>return</span> result
    <span>return</span> wrap
</code></pre></div><p>and to use it, all you have to do is:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>@timing</span>
<span>def</span> <span>calculate</span>(num):
  <span>return</span> sum([i <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> range(num)])
</code></pre></div><p>Each time you execute this function, the output would be something like this:</p>
<p><code>calculate(10000000,), {} took: 0.979142 sec</code></p>
<h2 id="reusing-code">Reusing Code</h2>
<p>Often I find myself reusing portions of code across multiple notebooks. That’s a sin. Thus, I created a repository to aggregate my utility functions. All I have to do now, to set up my notebook, is clone that repository. Keep in mind that your default <code>!pwd</code> in Colab is <code>/content</code>. When you clone your repository using:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>!</span>git clone <span>"https://github.com/AYBLBD/utils.git"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>You will be creating a folder inside your present working directory, matching <code>/content/utils</code>. For you to use your module like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> utils <span>import</span> utils_colab <span>as</span> uc
uc<span>.</span>save_model(model)
</code></pre></div><p>Your folder structure should resemble something like this:</p>
<pre>+-- __init__.py
+-- utils
|   +-- __init__.py
|   +-- utils_colab
|   +-- ...
</pre>
<h2 id="using-mlflow">Using MLflow</h2>
<p>Have you ever tried to manage your hyperparameters using an Excel file? or worse a text file? I know the feeling. Luckily, there are tools to do that tedious work. The industry standard is <a href="https://mlflow.org/">MLflow</a>. However, new tools are arising, such as <a href="https://neptune.ai/">Neptune</a> and <a href="https://www.comet.ml/site/">Comet</a> that provide storage, data exploration, and teamwork management. I wanted to experiment with these tools without adding another dependency to my projects. And luckily again, these tools implement interfaces to integrate with MLflow. So by using MLflow, I was able to switch between tools as they emerged, experimenting with little to no changes to my code, and all while staying grounded to industry standards.</p>
<p>In this example, I will be using MLflow linked to Neptune. We can start by installing dependencies:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>!</span>pip install mlflow<span>==</span><span>1.12</span><span>.</span><span>1</span>
<span>!</span>pip install neptune<span>-</span>mlflow<span>==</span><span>0.2</span><span>.</span><span>5</span> future<span>==</span><span>0.18</span><span>.</span><span>2</span>
</code></pre></div><p>After creating a Neptune account, you will receive a <code>NEPTUNE_API_TOKEN</code> to use. It’s up to you to create and pick a project name. Once you have those two variables, you can set them up in your environment:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">os<span>.</span>environ[<span>'NEPTUNE_API_TOKEN'</span>] <span>=</span> <span>'''[Your key here]'''</span>
os<span>.</span>environ[<span>'NEPTUNE_PROJECT'</span>] <span>=</span> <span>'[User name]/[Project name]'</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Then in your code, do your thing with MLflow:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span># witchery stuff</span>
<span>...</span>
mlflow<span>.</span>log_metric(<span>'validation_loss'</span>, validation_loss, step<span>=</span>epoch)
mlflow<span>.</span>log_metric(<span>'validation_cer'</span>, avg_cer, step<span>=</span>epoch)
mlflow<span>.</span>log_metric(<span>'validation_wer'</span>, avg_wer, step<span>=</span>epoch)
<span>...</span>
<span># more witchery stuff</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Once you have those metrics, you can persist them to the storage offered by Neptune by executing:</p>
<p>Et voilà! You can now access and visualize the history of your hyperparameters and models, per experiment, through the Neptune dashboard.</p>
<h2 id="using-pyspark-in-colab">Using Pyspark in Colab</h2>
<p>Who doesn’t get the urge to run some Spark code on the fly? Right? The following setup is my go-to for that:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> os
<span>import</span> site

<span>def</span> <span>install_pyspark</span>():
  <span>!</span>pip install pyspark
  PACKAGES_PATH <span>=</span> site<span>.</span>getsitepackages()[<span>0</span>]
  os<span>.</span>environ[<span>"SPARK_HOME"</span>] <span>=</span> f<span>"{PACKAGES_PATH}/pyspark"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The function <code>site.getsitepackages()</code> will return a list of paths to the installed packages in the system. We are interested in the first one that should be <code>/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages</code>. Then <code>os.environ["SPARK_HOME"] = f"{PACKAGES_PATH}/pyspark"</code> will add that path as an environment variable.</p>
<p>After that, you are ready to go! To run a Spark session:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> pyspark.sql <span>import</span> SparkSession

spark <span>=</span> SparkSession<span>.</span>builder<span>.</span>appName(<span>"Spark in Colab"</span>)<span>.</span>config(<span>"spark.ui.port"</span>, <span>"4050"</span>)<span>.</span>getOrCreate()
</code></pre></div><p>Then test that it works:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">spark<span>.</span>createDataFrame([(<span>1</span>, <span>"Hello"</span>), (<span>2</span>, <span>"World"</span>)], [<span>"id"</span>, <span>"name"</span>]) \
     <span>.</span>show()
</code></pre></div><p>And yes, there is a way to check Spark UI. The following code snippet is proudly stolen from <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs246/">CS246</a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> time

<span>def</span> <span>create_spark_ui_link</span>():
  <span>!</span>wget <span>-</span>q https:<span>//</span>bin<span>.</span>equinox<span>.</span>io<span>/</span>c<span>/</span><span>4</span>VmDzA7iaHb<span>/</span>ngrok<span>-</span>stable<span>-</span>linux<span>-</span>amd64<span>.</span>zip
  <span>!</span>unzip <span>-</span>qq ngrok<span>-</span>stable<span>-</span>linux<span>-</span>amd64<span>.</span>zip
  get_ipython()<span>.</span>system_raw(<span>'./ngrok http 4050 &amp;'</span>)
  time<span>.</span>sleep(<span>3</span>) <span># For when the tunnel takes seconds to open</span>
  <span>!</span>curl <span>-</span>s http:<span>//</span>localhost:<span>4040</span><span>/</span>api<span>/</span>tunnels <span>|</span> python <span>-</span>c <span>"import sys, json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['tunnels'][0]['public_url'])"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The generated link will be your access point to Spark UI.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I guess a good reason for me to start reading PEP8, is that I am yet to find a way to indent cells in Colab. But I think I would rather spend hours trying to figure out a way around that 10min read. This is the way.</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/technology/twitter-hackers-interview.html"> New York Times story on the recent Twitter hack</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>Mr. O’Connor said other hackers had informed him that Kirk got access to the Twitter credentials when he found a way into Twitter’s internal Slack messaging channel and saw them posted there, along with a service that gave him access to the company’s servers.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>It’s too soon after this incident to put too much faith in the reporting, but let’s assume it’s accurate. A collective cry of “<em>Posting credentials to a Slack channel? How could engineers at Twitter be so stupid?</em>” rose up from the internet. It’s a natural reaction, but it’s not a constructive one.</p>



<p>I don’t personally know any engineers at Twitter, but I have confidence that they have excellent engineers over there, including excellent security folks. So, how do we explain this seemingly obvious security lapse?</p>



<p>The problem is that we on the outside can’t, because we don’t have enough information. This type of lapse is a classic example of a <em>workaround</em>. People in a system use workarounds (they do things the “<em>wrong</em>” way) when there are obstacles to doing things the “right” way.</p>



<p>There are countless possibilities for why people employ workarounds. Maybe some system that’s required for doing it the “right” way is down for some reason, or maybe it simply takes too long or is too hard to do things the “right” way. Combine that with production pressures, and a workaround is born.</p>



<p>I’m willing to bet that there are people in your organization that use workarounds. You probably use some yourself. Identifying those workarounds teaches us something about how the system works, and how people have to do things the “wrong” way to actually get their work done.</p>



<p>Some workarounds, like the Twitter example, are dangerous. But simply observing “they shouldn’t have done that” does nothing to address the problems in the system that motivated the workaround in the first place.</p>



<p>When you see a workaround, don’t ask “how could they be so stupid to do things the obviously wrong way?” Instead, ask “what are the properties of our system that contributed to the development of this workaround?” Because, unless you gain a deeper understanding of your system, the problems that motivated the workaround aren’t going to go away.</p>

        <p>Before you start reading this piece, I want to inform that the question presented here is equivalent to a mathematical problem that has multiple possible answers. The answer depends on you; how do you arrive on one of his articles, and what are you seeking.</p>
<p>Sounds like a zen proverb, right?</p>
<p>Yes. Take my “personal” answer/solution to this question for example.</p>
<p>Looking in the past, most of the times I’ve found myself reading the essays when I’m sitting in MTR on my own trying to spend some time off, amidst the constant background noise of people ordering the same three items over and over.</p>
<p>And that’s exactly where I found this question.</p>
<p>I was wondering if they can be presented in a manner which is relevant to some readers. In this article, I’ve collated the essays in <strong>five different categories</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="a-chronological-order">A. Chronological order</h3>
<p>This one is easy. You can just go to the <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html">essays section</a> of his website and start from the very first essay he wrote. Obviously, You will have to scroll to the end.</p>

<p>You can’t deny the fact that the essays are extremely relatable if you’re somewhat close to startups. They give the feeling of a favourite book or movie that you just keeps giving, and you still feel there is something that you’ve missed.</p>
<p>It seems like you can find everything there. Some of the articles are underrated too, and it brings a different feeling when you read them. I’ve used them to <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/bias.html">design better survey or interview questions</a>, to <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/copy.html">learn from others</a>, and much more.</p>

<p>Yesterday I saw this tweet of Chris Campbell passing by in my timeline:</p>



<p>Aah, the memories. Quake III Arena, one of my favourite first-person shooter games.</p>

<p>Years ago, I spent (and lost) so much time playing this fast-paced game with friends and foes, and now it is brought into the world of containers and Kubernetes with <strong><a href="https://github.com/criticalstack/quake-kube" target="_blank">QuakeKube</a></strong> by <a href="https://twitter.com/CapitalOneTech" target="_blank">Capital One Tech</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>QuakeKube is a Kubernetes-ified version of</em> <a href="https://github.com/inolen/quakejs" target="_blank"><em>QuakeJS</em></a> <em>that runs a dedicated</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_III_Arena" target="_blank"><em>Quake 3</em></a> <em>server in a Kubernetes Deployment, and then allow clients to connect via QuakeJS in the browser.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, I couldn’t wait to give it a try, especially after reading the documentation, saying:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Container images are being cross-compiled with</em> <a href="https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/" target="_blank"><em>Docker Buildx</em></a> <em>so it can run on hardware with different architectures and operating systems. Currently, it is building for <code>linux/amd64</code> and <code>linux/arm64</code>.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>ARM64 support!</strong> Great, it means I can run it on one of my Raspberry Pis!</p>

<h2 id="let-s-get-fragging">Let’s get fragging!</h2>

<p>Most of the work is already done by others, so with the proper tools and projects, it will take you only a few minutes to get everything up and running.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<ul>
<li>a Raspberry Pi with Ubuntu 20.04, which supports arm64<br></li>
<li><code>k3sup</code>, a light-weight utility to get from zero to KUBECONFIG with k3s on any local or remote VM.<br></li>
<li><code>arkade</code>, a simple Golang CLI with strongly-typed flags to install charts and apps to your cluster in one command.<br></li>
<li><code>kubectl</code><br></li>
<li>a DigitalOcean account and an API Token</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>

<p>First, install <code>k3s</code> on your Raspberry Pi running a arm64 OS like Ubuntu 20.04</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ k3sup install --ip <span>192</span>.168.0.52 --user ubuntu --k3s-extra-args <span>'--no-deploy servicelb --no-deploy traefik'</span></code></pre></div>
<p>After the installation of k3s on the Raspberry Pi, k3sup also downloads the required kubeconfig file in your current working directory.<br>
Make sure to configure <code>kubectl</code> to use this config file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ export KUBECONFIG<span>=</span><span>$(</span>pwd<span>)</span>/kubeconfig</code></pre></div>
<p>Next, install the inlets-operator with <code>arkade</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ arkade install inlets-operator --provider digitalocean --token-file ~/do-api-token</code></pre></div>
<p>The inlets-operator will create an inlets exit-node on DigitalOcean, giving the LoadBalancer services in the private k3s cluster a public IP address.</p>

<p>As clients connect to the server via QuakeJS in the browser with websockets, the OSS version of inlets will do just fine. If you want to have better support for TLS etc, I can highly recommend having a look at inlets PRO version.</p>

<p>Finally, take the example yaml file from the QuakeKube GitHub repository and make the appropriate changes. The service should be updated to a LoadBalancer instead of type NodePort, and of course you can change the configuration to tweak the game preferences to your own needs.</p>

<p>Example of a QuakeKube yaml file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml">apiVersion: apps/v1

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      
        <time datetime="2020-08-12">2020-08-12</time>
      <p>Let's write some Elixir.</p>
<pre><code>defmodule FooBar do
  def foo(a) do
    if a &lt; 0 do
      bar(a, -1)
    else
      bar(a, 1)
    end
  end

  defp bar(a, b) do
    IO.inspect(a * b)
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>Not very useful, but that's good enough for our purpose.</p>
<p>I like Elixir, but I think most of the time it just looks like functional Ruby. I want to make this code look like Elixir.</p>
<p>First, this code is lacking every Elixir developer's best friend: <code>|&gt;</code>. Let's add some <code>|&gt;</code>s.</p>
<pre><code>defmodule FooBar do
  def foo(a) do
    if a &lt; 0 do
      a |&gt; bar(-1)
    else
      a |&gt; bar(1)
    end
  end

  defp bar(a, b) do
    (a * b) |&gt; IO.inspect()
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>Meh. It's definitely better, but I mean, that's only 3 <code>|&gt;</code>s. I want more <code>|&gt;</code>s.</p>
<p>We have an <code>if</code> in there, so maybe we can do something with it?</p>
<pre><code>defmodule FooBar do
  def foo(a) do
    (a &lt; 0) |&gt; if do
      a |&gt; bar(-1)
    else
      a |&gt; bar(1)
    end
  end

  defp bar(a, b) do
    (a * b) |&gt; IO.inspect()
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>We sure can! That's one more <code>|&gt;</code>. Can we do better than this?</p>
<p>Well... <code>&gt;</code> and <code>*</code> are <code>Kernel</code> functions, so maybe...</p>
<pre><code>defmodule FooBar do
  def foo(a) do
    a |&gt; Kernel.&lt;(0) |&gt; if do
      a |&gt; bar(-1)
    else
      a |&gt; bar(1)
    end
  end

  defp bar(a, b) do
    a |&gt; Kernel.*(b) |&gt; IO.inspect()
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>This is great, can we keep going?</p>
<p>The Elixir docs say <code>defmodule</code> is just a macro. Does that mean I can just <code>|&gt;</code> into <code>defmodule</code>?</p>
<pre><code>FooBar |&gt; defmodule do
  def foo(a) do
    a |&gt; Kernel.&lt;(0) |&gt; if do
      a |&gt; bar(-1)
    else
      a |&gt; bar(1)
    end
  end

  defp bar(a, b) do
    a |&gt; Kernel.*(b) |&gt; IO.inspect()
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>Yes you can!</p>
<p><code>def</code> and <code>defp</code> are macros too right?</p>
<pre><code>FooBar |&gt; defmodule do
  a |&gt; foo() |&gt; def do
    a |&gt; Kernel.&lt;(0) |&gt; if do
      a |&gt; bar(-1)
    else
      a |&gt; bar(1)
    end
  end

  a |&gt; bar(b) |&gt; defp do
    a |&gt; Kernel.*(b) |&gt; IO.inspect()
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>So many pipes! 😍</p>
<p>We're getting somewhere, but something still doesn't feel right. This module really isn't doing much, so maybe it should not be that long? Also, I think we need more <code>:</code>. Atoms are very Elixir-y, so let's do more of that:</p>
<pre><code>FooBar |&gt; defmodule(do: (
  a |&gt; foo() |&gt; def(do: a |&gt; Kernel.&lt;(0) |&gt; if(do: a |&gt; bar(-1), else: a |&gt; bar(1)))

  a |&gt; bar(b) |&gt; defp(do: a |&gt; Kernel.*(b) |&gt; IO.inspect())
))
</code></pre>
<p>We're <code>:do</code>ing great!</p>
<p>You know what's also very Elixir-y? Lists. Lists and tuples.</p>
<pre><code>FooBar |&gt; defmodule([{:do, (
  a
  |&gt; foo()
  |&gt; def([{:do, a |&gt; Kernel.&lt;(0) |&gt; if([{:do, a |&gt; bar(-1)}, {:else, a |&gt; bar(1)}])}])

  a |&gt; bar(b) |&gt; defp([{:do, a |&gt; Kernel.*(b) |&gt; IO.inspect()}])
)}])
</code></pre>
<p>Who's going to say this looks like Ruby now? ⚗️</p>

<h3>
The dubiousness of digitized signature services
</h3>
</div><div>
<div id="post-body-8553362812323687543">
<div><p>Notice I referred to "digitized" instead of digital, this is a very important distinction. These services essentially offer ways to transport handwritten scribbles into digital processes. They can be anything from attaching a Microsoft paint scribble or a scan of one written on a piece of paper, to custom font generation that makes&nbsp; your signature look like you are a former president of the united states. </p><p>I wont mention any such services by name but if you've purchased a house or engaged in any sort of contract paperwork activity (leases..etc) you have likely encountered these services. Last I checked, one of these companies is worth north of $40B, no doubt reflecting the size of the market for such services.</p><p>First, what is the purpose of any signature? as the name suggests, it is primarily to ascribe provenance to something, be it an abstract thing such as a legal agreement expressed in writing or a physical object such as a painting. We also use the notion of signature to refer to a manifestation that serves as a tell-tale sign of some fact (or the truthfulness thereof) without necessarily observing the actual manifestation of the fact itself.</p><p>What is the purpose of signing a paper then? Well, it is suppose to first, attest to the fact that the entity whose identity is associated with the document is consenting to whatever it is that the paper implies. Second, your scribbles are supposed to be unique, such that someone could not forge them and fool others into accepting an agreement that the identified entity is in fact not a party to.</p><p>Hand written signatures even in the days of king Henry were more of an intellectual pretense than an effective mechanism for genuine projection of trust. That they have persisted into the 21st century is more than distressing. </p><p>We now have even the democratic franchise of voting citizens tethered to matching variations of such scribbles. My handwritten signature varies based on what I had for breakfast, so the idea that anyone would want to judge the authenticity of any document based on it would be hilarious if it weren't such a serious matter.</p><p>The entire edifice of affixing handwritten scribbles (or their digital imitations) to documents is quite mindless if the aim of signatures as described above is to be achieved.</p><p>Obviously the need for entities to affirmatively agree to conditions and to have that recorded in a way that is tamper-proof and indisputable has not gone away. However, given the purpose of signatures, it is clear that scribbles on paper or their digitized cousins are certainly not an answer. At best one can consider these services as ceremonial, in as far as they facilitate the continuation of the pre-digital processes that demand handwritten signatures.</p><p>What then is the solution to signatures in the digital era? The answer is simple and well understood (hard to believe perhaps), PKI certificates. Given that Certisfy is about leveraging PKI for trust on the internet, this is a self-serving answer but it is also a true answer.</p><p>A digital signature (not a digitized one) of a document, along with the certificate whose private key was used to generate such a signature is all that is needed to achieve the intended goal of handwritten signatures. </p><p>From a purely technical requirement perspective, you would need to add no more than two new entries to your data model to support this, a field to store the cryptographic signature and a field to store the cryptographic certificate-chain that can verify that signature. If a dispute were to emerge a century from now, you wouldn't need to hire medieval forensic experts to authenticate the document, you would simply run the signature and document through the appropriate cryptographic verification function to authenticate it.</p><p>There are of course legitimate arguments to make against PKI (some favor blockchain contracts..etc), but when the alternative is handwritten scribbles, such arguments diminish towards meaninglessness.</p></div>

			<p><span>O</span>n May 29, 1810, Katherine Fritsch, a sister in the Moravian Church, boarded a coach in Lititz, Pennsylvania, along with a group of her friends and began the 75-mile trek to Philadelphia. Fritsch noted in her diary the one city site she most wished to see: Peale’s Museum. On the grounds of the museum, whose two buildings sat on State House Square, with rows of trees and manicured lawns, Fritsch passed through a menagerie that included a large cage with a live eagle sitting “right majestically on his perch—above his head a placard with this petition on it: feed me daily for 100 years.”</p><figure data-alt="Dugatkin_BREAKER-1"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/17940_1221132d8390ea66832cf2eabd8eb668.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>THE MET OF ITS TIME:</strong> Charles Willson Peale painted this self-portrait to celebrate his pioneering museum. Its goal, he wrote his friend Thomas Jefferson, was to collect subjects in nature and “enlighten the minds of my countrymen.”</span><span>Charles Willson Peale; <i>The Artist in His Museum</i>, 1822; Oil on canvas; Courtesy of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia.&nbsp;Gift of Mrs. Sarah Harrison (The Joseph Harrison, Jr. Collection), 1878.1.2</span></figcaption></figure><p>From the yard, Fritsch went into the Peale Museum proper, through a door with “Whoso would learn Wisdom, let him enter here!” posted above. Fritsch walked past a turnstile that rang chimes to announce visitors. She walked up the stairs and into the Quadruped Room, which included a moose, llama, bear, bison, prong-horned antelope, hyena, and a jackal. She explored the Marine Room, overflowing with fish, amphibians, lizards, sponges, and corals. In the Long Room, glass cases were filled with hundreds of birds set against backdrops matching their natural environments; she saw insect cases in which the specimens could be rotated under a microscope. Fritsch didn’t get to see the museum’s mammoth skeleton, but noted in her diary that “all our talk was of how delightful had been our visit to the museum.”<br></p><p>Fritsch was not the only one who felt that way. From the time Peale’s Museum had opened its doors in 1786, annual attendance had averaged more than 10,000 people. Born both of science and art, it was the first true museum in the fledgling United States and the first must-see attraction not only for Philadelphians but for visitors from around the U.S. and the world. The museum’s creator, Charles Willson Peale, saw the museum as a national good. The “very sinews of government are made strong by a diffused knowledge of this science,” he wrote. The museum’s success made Peale a proud man for many years. It embodied the age of Enlightenment in the new world. After a visit, the French philosopher Comte de Volney proclaimed the museum housed “nothing but truth and reason.” But national funding for truth and reason foundered on the shore of politics. And then the circus came to town.</p><p><span>P</span>eale was born in Maryland in 1741. When he was 9, his father, a schoolteacher, died, leaving the family in poverty. Peale was apprenticed to a saddler at age 13, but spent almost as much time tinkering with mechanical devices of all sorts as he did saddling. His other interest lay in paint brushes and sketching pads. Ambitious as could be, Peale became the Colony’s most famous portrait painter. In 1771, Peale met Martha Washington and convinced her that Colonel Washington should sit for him—the first of 25 portraits, miniatures, mezzotints, or sculptures he would do of the soon-to-be general. Peale also painted portraits of Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and Alexander Hamilton. He named most of his 17 children after famous painters, including Rembrandt, Rubens, and Titian.</p><p>A true autodidact, Peale saw himself as a naturalist and scientist. And any self-respecting deist of the Enlightenment should have a museum. Fortunately, Peale knew all the right people. Robert Patterson, professor of mathematics at the University of the State of Pennsylvania, gave Peale his first specimen for the museum, “a curious fish called the paddle fish caught in the Allegheny River,” Peale wrote. Ben Franklin sent his friend the body of an angora cat that Madame Helvétius had given him when he departed Paris, and Washington sent the body of a just-deceased golden pheasant from the aviary of Louis XVI that the general had received as a gift from the Marquis de Lafayette. Other specimens soon came flooding in.</p><blockquote><p>Peale wrote that society raised roadblocks to women, which didn’t allow them to pursue science.</p> </blockquote><p>In a letter to Jefferson, Peale explained that his goal for the museum was to bring together “a variety of interesting subjects of Nature … collected in one view as would enlighten the minds of my countrymen, and, demonstrate the importance of diffusing a knowledge of the wonderful and various beauties of Nature, more powerful to humanize the mind, promote harmony, and aid virtue than any … yet imagined.”<br></p><p>Peale, a former member of the Philadelphia Militia, was a true-blooded patriot. He created an effigy of a double-faced model of Benedict Arnold in a carriage, dressed in a red coat and holding a letter to Beelzebub with the devil standing behind him shaking a purse full of money. When it came to his museum, he had no intent of curating the sort of European hall that catered only to “particular classes of society only, or open at such turns or at such portions of time, as effectually to debar the mass of society, from participating in the improvement, and the pleasure resulting from a careful visitation,” he wrote. His museum would be open to all—“the unwise as well as the learned.”</p><p>Peale held progressive views on women and children, and because he knew that a family-friendly venue would attract more visitors, he reached out to bring women and children into his museum. Women were not only encouraged to visit the museum, Peale wanted them to contribute to the enterprise, sending in samples and sharing ideas. Society, he believed, raised roadblocks to women “which allow no time for them to devote in the arduous pursuits of science,” but, he was quick to point out, “when females have devoted themselves to these pursuits they have given every demonstration of the intensity and depth of their intellectual powers.” He wanted to tap into those powers to better the museum and the plight of women.</p><figure data-alt="Dugatkin_BREAKER"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/17932_bbc90218e55a81732f0f78c16cbf2b6f.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>TOM THUMB’S BLUES:</strong> Charles Stratton (right) was a child when P.T. Barnum (left) first hired him to perform in his museum. Barnum publicized Stratton as “General Tom Thumb,” a character who became a major attraction for the circus impresario for decades.</span><span>Wikimedia</span></figcaption></figure><p>Reverend Manasseh Cutler, a respected naturalist of the day, who had gained fame for his bravery as a chaplain during the Revolution, was an early visitor to Peale’s Museum in 1787 and was struck by the exhibits “arranged in a most romantic and amusing manner.” He describes two dioramas—a mound with trees and an artificial pond, each the result of Peale having spent many a morning “dressing the museum in moss.” The pond was stocked with fish, geese, ducks, cranes, and herons, “all having the appearance of life, for their skins were admirably preserved.” On the beach around the pond Cutler was dazzled by an assortment of “shells of different kinds, turtles, frogs, toads, lizards, water snakes, etc.” Cutler’s diary ends: “Mr. Peale’s animals reminded me of Noah’s Ark, into which was received every kind of beast and creeping thing in which there was life. But I can hardly conceive that even Noah could have boasted of a better collection.”<br></p><p>From the outset, the museum was meant to be a collaborative effort. Jefferson, Hamilton, James Madison, Gouverneur Morris, famed astronomer David Rittenhouse, and naturalists Benjamin Smith Barton and William Barton, sat on the museum’s board of directors. But this museum was not to be some highfalutin society club. Peale turned more often to his fellow citizens than to his board of directors to contribute what they could, be it specimen or knowledge. Each year, he would publish dozens of newspaper advertisements that included not just a call for specimens, but lists of new specimens received of late, information about new exhibits, changes to museum hours of operation, and perhaps strangest to our eyes, praise or admonitions of the way the public was responding to activities at the museum.</p><p>A few years after it opened, in a series of parades, young boys (and older men) moved all the exhibits to the museum’s new home in the American Philosophical Society’s Philosophical Hall. Peale and his family moved their own home to the basement of the museum, so as to better manage the ever-growing enterprise. Soon, the museum outgrew even Philosophical Hall and moved to the State House (what we now call Independence Hall), above the rooms where the Declaration of Independence were signed, and below where a soon to be rather famous bell rang each day.</p><p><span>I</span>n 1801, Peale and a team undertook the first major paleontological excavation in the U.S. Near Newburgh, New York they dug up, and then painstakingly reconstructed, the complete skeleton of a mammoth (technically, it was a mastodon, but that distinction did not yet exist). It was quite the sight and caught the fancy of locals. “Every farmer with his wife and children, for twenty miles round in every direction flocked to see the operation,” wrote Peale’s son Rembrandt. The <i>Mercantile Advertiser</i> soon ran tantalizing headlines like “Bones of a Mammoth or some other Wonderful Animal,” titillating readers with tales of “a monster so vastly disproportionate to every creature; as to induce a momentary suspension of every animal faculty but admiration and wonder.”</p><blockquote><p>Ben Franklin sent his friend the body of an angora cat and George Washington sent a golden pheasant.</p> </blockquote><p>In <i>Skeleton of the Mammoth</i>, a broadside that Peale posted across Philadelphia in 1802, he informed readers that though “numerous have been the attempts of scientific characters of all nations to procure a satisfactory collection of bones,” he and his museum had at last done just that. Peale even had one of the museum employees distribute the broadside throughout the city while on horseback …</p></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>I can build this.</p>

  <p>— <cite>every developer at least once</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Knowledge is hard to manage, as mind is hard to materialize and visualize.</p>

<p>Bi-directional networked tools like <code>roam-research</code> and <code>obsidian</code> are on the trend for a while now. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph">The idea behind them</a> is not brand new, yet the much evolved web-based tech makes them possible.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-want-to-build">what I want to build</h2>

<p>I record my building of <code>fiber-note</code> in this series of dev posts, what I want to build is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tag-based bi-directional networked note-taking</li>
  <li>web-based real-time experience
    <ul>
      <li>constantly auto-saving</li>
      <li>real-time reactive interface
        <ul>
          <li>updating components other than the editor (related notes, navigation, tags network, calendar, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>a highly-customized editor
    <ul>
      <li>enforce a custom schema to control the layout of the documents
        <ul>
          <li>say everything is a list item, there may be only text and tags in a paragraph, etc.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>handle meta-data like tags, assigning unique ids for the block</li>
      <li>complex UI like inline drop-down menu</li>
      <li>…</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>visualize data as a network and a calendar</li>
  <li>open-sourced and self-hosted</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="code--demo">code &amp; demo</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/namiwang/fiber-note" target="_blank">
  <img src="https://namiwang.github.io/assets/images/fiber-note.gif" width="480" alt="fiber note screenshot">
</a></p>

<p>I placed the source <a href="https://github.com/namiwang/fiber-note">here</a>, which could be hosted by yourself. There’s even a configured deploy-to-heroku button for one-click hosting.</p>

<p>I also put up a public demo running at <a href="https://fiber-note-demo.herokuapp.com/session/new">fiber-note-demo.herokuapp.com</a> (password is <code>password</code>).</p>

<h2 id="naming-the-project">naming the project</h2>

<p>I always use rails as my first choice for web projects, and the first code name for this project is <code>roam-on-rails</code>, which is a bad joke since I’ve already got a project called <a href="https://github.com/ruby-on-rust/ruby-on-rust">ruby on rust</a>.</p>

<p>I’m bad at this, so I just picked the word <code>fiber</code> as a synonym for <code>network</code> from the thesaurus.</p>



<h2 id="a-prototype-on-paper">a prototype on paper</h2>

<p><a href="https://namiwang.github.io/assets/images/fiber-note-series/fiber-note-diagram.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="https://namiwang.github.io/assets/images/fiber-note-series/fiber-note-diagram.png" alt="fiber note data structure">
</a></p>

<h2 id="a-data-structure-in-mind">a data structure in mind</h2>

<p>The whole database is structured as a directed graph. The basic unit is a <code>block</code>, a node in the graph, representing a paragraph, bearing data like its content and optional tags.</p>

<p>Every block-node may have one parent. Thus a note, spawning from the root (a parent-free block-node), forms a tree and the whole database forms a forest.</p>

<p>There’re some edge cases to consider</p>

<ul>
  <li>have to avoid cycles in the graph</li>
  <li>a tag may points to the same note</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="a-data-structure-on-disk">a data structure on disk</h2>

<p>Apparently we need to maintain a graph, yet I didn’t choose a graph-oriented database like <code>neo4j</code>. Using good old SQL to simulate one is good enough for now.</p>

<p>There’re both plugins to do graph on database level (<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/announcing-age-a-multi-model-graph-database-extension-for-postgresql-2050/">AGE</a> for postgresql), and rails level (like <a href="https://github.com/jackc/edge">edge</a>). For the initial implementation, I chose to hand-written everything from the grounded up for faster iteration because I was constantly changing things.</p>



<p>This is gonna be a front-end-heavy project, I have to choose an editor as one of the first steps.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">requirements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>restrict the doc to a special set of content types
    <ul>
      <li>e.g. allow list, list item, and inline tags; disallow individual paragraphs or images</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>render existing data into the editor</li>
  <li>inspect and manipulate input from the user
    <ul>
      <li>enforce input rules like properly wrapping/indenting list items</li>
      <li>assign unique ids to created blocks</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>implement drop-down menu to auto-complete tags</li>
  <li>send updated content to the server</li>
  <li>features we may need in the future
    <ul>
      <li>copy-and-paste, drag-and-drop, image, etc.</li>
    </ul>

<p>I tried a few options. At the end I settled with <a href="https://prosemirror.net/">prose-mirror</a> to build fiber-note due to thorough guides and references, up-to-date maintaining, and <a href="https://discuss.prosemirror.net/">a friendly forum</a>.</p>

<h2 id="trix">trix</h2>

<p>As a rails user, my first thought are <code>actiontext</code> and <a href="https://trix-editor.org/">trix</a>. Trix is perfect for adding out-of-box rich-text editing to a normal rails app, like rails, it just works.</p>

<p>It’s just hard to tweak for more custom features.</p>

<ul>
  <li>it completely intertwined with rails’ components like <code>actionview</code> (rendering) and <code>activestorage</code> (image uploading), it’s hard to mutate the saved content without hacking into hidden methods.</li>
  <li>it saves content as raw HTML fragment, which is bad because
    <ul>
      <li>unique content have multiple legit representations</li>
      <li>it’s slow to parse and manipulate the content (say tags detection, image processing, table mutation, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>it doesn’t come with detailed docs/specs about the format of generated HTML docs, which is not reliable when you system relies on processing the content on-the-fly.</li>
  <li>minimal events not enough to compose complex logic around the user’s operation</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="quill">quill</h2>

<p><a href="https://quilljs.com/">quill</a> is another competitive  candidate, regarding elaborated docs, data format specs, themes, and typescript support.</p>

<p>It’s easy to integrate the library, tweak some configurations, and apply different themes. You can add markdown syntax support in like 10 minutes.</p>

<p>It’s not easy to limit what kind of content is allowed in the document, or what would happen if a special formatted text is pasted.</p>

<p>It’s hard to pragmatically control the mutation of the data to manually implement functions like “create another list item with the same indent when <em>return</em> is pressed and current cursor on the end of a list item, including the end of an inline span of a list item”.</p>

<p>It’s not impossible, yet it will get over-complicated if you need many mutations like this.</p>

<h2 id="prose-mirror">prose-mirror</h2>

<p><code>prose-mirror</code> has the most complicated structure.  You have to import <strong>at least ten packages</strong> to build a simple demo, each managing a single aspect of the editor (model, view, schema definitions, keymaps, etc.).</p>

<p>There’s a starter kit kind of package (<code>prosemirror-example-setup</code>) which makes the journey a little bit easier. I’d recommend that kit to users who demand only basic features, while for complex functions you’ll have to compose each part and piece them together for better control. It’s like how advanced users almost never want the pre-set default preferences or <code>rails scaffold</code>.</p>

<p>Verbosity and redundancy means total control and vice versa, it just have to be like this. You posses the ability to custom the schema, listen to each key press, oversee every transaction of the model, and to arrange how to create (also parse, and wrap, and truncate during drag-n-drop, etc.) different kind of element.</p>

<p>You’ll spend a lot of time jumping between the <a href="https://prosemirror.net/docs/guide/">guides</a>, the <a href="https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/">references for individual packages</a>, and even the source code. I can promise you that the guide will be a great read about the designing of a complicated modular system.</p>



<p>Thanks for reading. In the next post, I’ll discuss how I built and tweaked the editor.</p>

              <p>We learn differently at different ages. The learning advantages of the young mind are well established, particularly in the area of language acquisition. But in some dimensions, we may actually learn better at a more advanced age.</p>
<p>If you know about Kahneman’s theory of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow">fast and slow thinking</a>, it seems to me that the younger brain’s fast thinking engine has a significant advantage, while the older brain’s slow thinking facilities are likely more refined.</p>
<p>The article below relates the story of a father who set out to teach his young daughter how to play chess, while learning the game himself at the same time. An excerpt I found poignant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…but there was the look in her eyes as I checkmated her a second time. For whatever the games had taught me about brains young and old, about the different ways we learn and deploy our cognitive resources, they also taught me that the only thing harder than losing to your daughter in chess is winning against her.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This article reminded me of my own experience teaching my daughter the game of chess, which is captured in the photo above.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Google acquired YouTube for US$1.6 billion back in 2006. We estimate YouTube to be worth up to US$170 billion in 2020, delivering Google a +100x return in under 15 years.
<img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/vwq10xzbe6iz/6YrHqLoRpqCr5w4JwDJvtI/b5a86d3af5149953770bf1814a9c473c/IMG_18657804259D-1.jpeg" alt="youtube-valuation-comparison"></p>
<p>This article will cover in-depth how we arrive at this valuation and the steps you can follow to build your own model for YouTube and to value any technology company:</p>

</ul>
<h2><a name="1"></a>5 Key Questions to Answer</h2>
<p>To reach a valuation for YouTube, we must firstly answer 5 questions about the business:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Industry</strong>: What industry does it compete in?</li>
<li><strong>Customer</strong>: Who are its customers and how does it deliver them value?</li>
<li><strong>Revenue</strong>: What is its revenue model and key drivers?</li>
<li><strong>Costs</strong>: What are its major costs and how are they managed?</li>
<li><strong>Growth</strong>: What is the growth thesis?</li>
</ol>
<h3>1. What industry does YouTube compete in?</h3>
<p>YouTube is the world’s largest online video service and competes for user viewership in order to compete for digital advertising spend from businesses. YouTube’s parent is Google/ Alphabet and operates globally except China where Google is banned.</p>
<p>Global ad spend (ex China) is over half a trillion dollars annually, of which half is spent on digital (web and mobile). The lion’s share of this is dominated by Google and Facebook which capture over 80% of digital ad spend.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/vwq10xzbe6iz/4kzjexfgsxFPhJOyyo2jS0/9b06d17b7cc5d7e0a6b080ec5beb7bf2/globaladshare.png" alt="globaladshare"></p>
<p>Splitting up Google and Facebook’s major ad platforms we reveal YouTube is the 5th largest digital ad platform with 6% share, behind Google Search, Facebook, Google Display and Instagram.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/vwq10xzbe6iz/2EbkvWiatOFXQYBVoqNlE5/03b1f3088e0b11f783116028d2682985/globaladfbyoutube.png" alt="globaladbyproduct"></p>
<p>Future growth of the digital ad market is any oracle’s guess. But if we assume digital remains a dominant advertising medium industry, then digital spend could reach over half a trillion by 2030 (assumes 7% annual growth).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When looking at the industry a company operates in, focus on how the company generates revenue and compare against competitors and alternative mediums. Research industry statistics and competitor annual reports to get a rough estimate of how large the current industry is.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>2. Who are YouTube’s customers and how do they deliver them value?</h3>
<p>YouTube is an online video platform that allows content creators (individuals and businesses) to publish videos for users to watch. YouTube sells ads to businesses placed within video content and shares the revenue with publishers.</p>
<p>YouTube delivers value to 3 key stakeholders:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Creators</strong>: monetize their video content on the platform with the widest reach. Allows creators to focus on producing quality content and outsource hosting and marketing costs to YouTube</li>
<li><strong>Users</strong>: free, targeted and relevant video content and entertainment (for better or worse)</li>
<li><strong>Advertisers</strong>: brand impressions and targeted reach across a global audience</li>
</ul>
<p>YouTube ultimately competes for global viewership and monetizes this by selling ads to businesses. YouTube has over 2 billion monthly active users and is the second largest social media platform in the world. The chart below compares the monthly active users across major ad supported social media platforms and video platforms:</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/vwq10xzbe6iz/yQISXiQ5Gh5jgiQWcYKLu/61903f1edd297535079c73c0d7b17d22/mausocial.png" alt="mausocial"></p>
<p>Whilst each player competes for viewership, their target audience and monetization models differ:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram and Twitter  sell ads placed in a user’s social media feed of images, video, news, articles</li>
<li>Netflix sells subscription services to users for its original and purchased content</li>
<li>TikTok is early in its monetization strategy</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>When understanding how a company generates revenue, ask yourself: Who is the customer and why would they pay for the offering? For technology platform companies, understand the ecosystem of stakeholders and the benefit each of them receive from using the platform.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>3. What is YouTube’s revenue model and key drivers?</h3>
<p>YouTube has two primary revenue streams:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ad sales</strong> (90% revenue): YouTube sells targeted ads within video content across its 2 billion monthly active users. It shares ad revenue with content publishers via a 45/55 split in favour of publishers; and</li>
<li><strong>Subscription</strong> (10% revenue): YouTube premium offers an ad free video experience and music service offered at ~$10 per month. There are currently 20 million premium subscribers representing ~1% of YouTube’s total monthly active user base</li>
</ul>
<p>YouTube’s key revenue driver is its ability to monetize its monthly active user base. We can assess its performance vs peers by comparing the average annual ad spend generated by each provider divided by its monthly active user base.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/vwq10xzbe6iz/5SzsrFRvxXSiFttWKHFSxm/596bb1ecbda955f39031a46059e20178/arputitle.png" alt="arpu"></p>
<p>Facebook currently generates 2x higher ad revenue per active user than YouTube across both Facebook and Instagram platforms. This could be explained by Facebook’s greater variety of ad formats and granular audience targeting (interests, age, behaviour, lookalike audience) and being further along its journey of ad monetization.</p>
<p>The biggest driver of revenue for YouTube will likely be its ability to drive higher ad spend to its already large audience via product innovation (e.g. new ad formats, improved targeting) rather than growing its audience. YouTube is also earlier in its monetization strategy and has also invested significant resources to clean up the quality of content published.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The key to understanding any revenue model is to identify the key revenue drivers: 1) volume (e.g. customers, users, businesses), 2) pricing (ARPU, new products, upsell) and 3) churn (% customers leaving each month, non-renewals). Try and understand the narrative of how the company can influence these drivers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>4. What are YouTube’s biggest cost drivers?</h3>
<p>YouTube’s major costs can be separated across 3 categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cost of Revenue</strong>: variable costs associated with delivery of services and revenue. Includes ad share revenue paid to creators and data-centre operation and hosting costs;</li>
<li><strong>Operating Costs</strong>: largely staff and support related costs to drive platform and product development (R&amp;D), revenue growth and creator support (Sales &amp; Marketing), content moderation, finance, admin (General &amp; Admin); and</li>
<li><strong>Capex &amp; Acquisitions</strong>: investments in data-centre infrastructure, acquisitions of businesses and supporting tech. These are cash outflows not captured in the income statement</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/vwq10xzbe6iz/7yjEplwqk3bj6K9lfULGQm/2fa7a97f21a0ff6821ead4e0fb0a5918/opextitle.png" alt="youtubeopex"></p>
<p><strong>Cost of Revenue</strong>
YouTube’s largest cost base is the revenue it shares with content publishers. It splits ad and subscription revenue attached to content viewership in the ratio 45/ 55% in the favour of publishers.</p>
<p>YouTube’s other major variable costs are the delivery and data-centre operation costs for the 500 hours of video content that gets uploaded every minute. These costs largely include depreciation charges following major upfront capex investments in data-centres. We estimate 7% in line with Alphabet’s overall depreciation charge as % of revenue.</p>
<p><strong>Operating Costs</strong>
Alphabet does not publicly disclose YouTube’s other operating expenses so we will need to estimate.</p>
<p>YouTube’s major fixed costs are its operating costs which are largely staff related and associated with sales and marketing, supporting creators, research &amp; development (software and product roles), content moderation (outsourced contractors), finance, admin and support.</p>
<p>We can estimate YouTube’s opex margins by comparing against peers. Netflix has a total opex/ revenue of 20% and Facebook at ~35-45%. We can estimate that YouTube may currently operate within the range at 35% opex/ revenue. We can assume given scale benefits that this will lower over time in line with Netflix at 20% opex as % of revenue.</p>
<p>This analysis highlights that YouTube’s profitability is lower than other social media platforms and Google’s other ad businesses. This is largely due to YouTube’s reliance on ad sharing with content publishers.</p>
<p><strong>Capex &amp; Acquisitions</strong>
Alphabet does not separate YouTube’s cashflow financials so we must estimate capex figures.</p>
<p>In our methodology, depreciation is already accounted for in the operating expenses hence we must estimate the incremental net capital expenditure (e.g. capex less depreciation) in order to estimate the total cash outflows associated with investment in infrastructure.</p>
<p>We will adopt the Godfather of Valuation’s (Aswath Damodaran) approach of using the <a href="https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2928207&amp;seqNum=5">sales to capital ratio</a> to estimate the required net capex to support revenue growth. This is calculated as the net change in revenue divided by the net capex of each year.</p>
<p>Alphabet has an average sales to capital ratio of 1.9x (annual change in revenue divided by change in invested capital (debt + equity less cash)). This implies that for every $100 of incremental revenue Alphabet generates each year it reinvests $50 as capital to support growth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When estimating costs, identify the major drivers across cost of revenue, operating costs and capex costs. Go through annual financial reports to identify the major line items and review notes to understand what is included and not included and understand the main drivers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>5. What is the growth thesis for YouTube?</h3>
<p>Based on our above analysis and understanding we can base our growth thesis for YouTube on two key drivers: ad monetization and stable user growth.</p>
<p><strong>Ad Monetization</strong>
YouTube is early in its monetization strategy and has largely relied on ad revenue from high quality in-video ad formats driven by impressions. It has begun to experiment with new formats including direct response display ads within homepage recommendation feeds and direct text search ads. These new formats support greater ability to sell more ads to its user base.</p>
<p>We can estimate that YouTube over the next 10 years will increase its ad monetization from $8 ARPU to $23 ARPU in line with Facebook currently.</p>
<p><strong>Stable User Growth</strong>
YouTube shares a majority of ad revenue to content publishers which is negative for gross profit margins but positive for supporting high quality content creation. This will likely attract amateur and …</p></div></div>

<p>Most programmers I know started programming out of sheer curiosity and joy. Joy is what keeps one motivated to keep up with the changing landscape of technology. It’s what keeps one happy. That is why I am recommending these 10 best books for programmers, books I really enjoyed reading. These are the books that I keep picking up and coming back to or have fond memories of. These are also the books that I hardly see recommended elsewhere, except for a few classics that are certainly worth repeating. And now I would like to share these books with you.</p>



<p><em>This post contains affiliate links where applicable. If you’re planning to buy any of these books yourself you can support this blog by buying it with the links</em> provided in the titles.</p>

<h2><a href="https://amzn.to/36ALozx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Pragmatic Programmer<br></a><sub>Your Journey to Mastery, 20th Anniversary Edition</sub></h2>

<p>I would recommend any programmer to read this book. It contains a lot of wisdom, tips, and advice. Most of it is pretty basic but therein lies the beauty. The first edition released in 1999 and was getting pretty dated. Despite it being old it was still highly recommended. To my surprise they released a new edition 20 years later, all up-to-date! Now you’ve got no excuses left to not read this book. A wonderful book that you surely will be referring back to over and over again, I know I do.</p>

<p>Similar to the The Pragmatic Programmer, I consider this book a must-read. It focuses on the bigger picture and your career, not just about writing code. This book is the reason I started this blog in the first place! A great book for any ambitious programmer and want to take your career to the next level.</p>

<h2><a href="https://amzn.to/36ulPQI">Apprenticeship Patterns<br></a><sub>Guidance for the Aspiring Software Craftsman</sub></h2>

<p>If you’re new to programming, making the same mistakes as the programmers that have gone before you can be costly and detrimental for your career. Let this book guide you on avoiding these same mistakes. This book is similar to the ones mentioned above and makes for a nice addition. It’s split up into smaller sections that can be read in any order you’d like, this makes it a fun and easy read.</p>

<h2><a href="https://amzn.to/3prQVAU">Beginning C++ Through Game Programming</a></h2>

<p>This is the book that taught me how code and was the first book I read on the subject of programming. It made learning new programming languages that much easier. Ever since I read this book it seems I’ve always been one step ahead of the herd. This book is about learning the fundamentals of programming and C++ and less about games. It merely uses games as an example to reinforce programming concepts. This book was a lot of fun to read and because it uses games as a theme it keeps one motivated.</p>

<p>To be honest I have not read this book in it’s entirety yet as I currently lack the time to do so. But I am really excited about this one and can’t wait to read it in combination with learning a new programming language: Rust. This book makes use of C++ but I’d figure these languages are similar enough as to implement the same ideas in Rust. I’ve put this book on this list because of the pure excitement it makes me feel. I would recommend to at least peruse this book to see if it resonates with you.</p>

<p>This is a book I got recommended, I read it, I loved it. I recommended it to a friend, and he loved it. And now I recommend it to you! It’s a really fun read and I could hardly put it down. This book really is written like a novel and packed with great lessons. Go read it! There is also a part two of sorts: The Unicorn Project. I hear it contains much of the same lessons, only told with a different story. I have yet to read it but will certainly do so in the near future.</p>

Some could be used to help grow greenhouse plants, make plastics, or even carbonate fizzy drinks. The first step is to fit factory chimneys with solvent filters, which trap carbon emissions before they escape, then the gas can be piped to locations to be used or stored. For the moment, t<span>here are about 30 CCUS projects operating around the world, which is nowhere near enough to clean up all of our emissions. </span></span></p><h3 id="viewer-fds85"><span><span>Why is CCUS needed?</span></span></h3><p id="viewer-7vj3h"><span><span>Nowadays, </span>Industrial production <span>accounts for one-quarter of CO</span>2﻿<span> emissions from energy and industrial processes.

	<div>

		
<p>I recently read this article: <a href="https://www.bigdata-insider.de/qlik-uebernimmt-blendrio-a-976600/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bigdata-insider.de/qlik-uebernimmt-blendrio-a-976600/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Qlik übernimmt Blendr.io</a>. From the article it was clear what happened:</p>



<p>Qlik a Business Intelligence-company acquired Blendr.io, a Data Integration-company.</p>



<p>However, I was wondering: What am I missing? What information is not evident from the article alone.</p>



<p>To answer this question I built a knowledge graph. The knowledge graph consists of companies, industries, and company strategies that are related to Qlik and Blendr.io.</p>



<p>An overview of the knowledge graph is shown in the image below:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1004" height="1024" src="http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/graph-1004x1024.png" alt="" srcset="http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/graph-1004x1024.png 1004w, http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/graph-294x300.png 294w, http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/graph-768x783.png 768w, http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/graph.png 1235w" sizes="(max-width: 1004px) 100vw, 1004px"></figure>



<p>The meaning of the colors are as follow:</p>



<ul><li>orange: represents a company</li><li>blue: represents an industry</li><li>red: represents a company strategy</li></ul>



<p>There a several reasons why such a knowledge graph can answer the question ‘What am I missing?’. They are explained below.</p>







<p>The image below shows two graphs:</p>



<ul><li>in the upper left corner you see the basic graph that represents ‘Qlik acquired Blendr.io’</li><li>in the remaining image you see the full picture with all the relationships that Qlik and Blendr.io have</li></ul>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="819" src="http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Untitled-1-1024x819.png" alt="" srcset="http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Untitled-1-1024x819.png 1024w, http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Untitled-1-300x240.png 300w, http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Untitled-1-768x614.png 768w, http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Untitled-1.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>It is immediately clear that ‘Qlik acquired Blendr.io’ is too simplistic. If you look at the whole graph you immediately notice:</p>



<ul><li>industry outsiders like Google or PwC are active in this field indicating shifting industry trends</li><li>the business intelligence space is very crowded indicating fierce competition</li><li>there are edge case with little activity like ‘Cloud’ indicating new innovative areas</li><li>it is a diversified field with industries like IoT or process mining</li><li>companies have diversified relationships with each other:<ul><li>there are partnerships</li><li>there are acquisitions</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>Besides these general observations you can also derive several specific observations:</p>



<ol><li>Discover innovation opportunities via white spaces</li><li>Analyze company strategies: diversification</li><li>Measure competition via hot spots</li><li>Identify partners, competitors, or acquisition targets</li></ol>







<p>Knowledge graphs are useful for the identification of innovation opportunities.</p>



<p>This is done via so-called ‘white space-analysis’: A white space is an area – centered around a node – that has only a few nodes connected to it; for a company, this signalizes a potentially new industry, segment, or product.</p>



<p>In the graph below this is, for example, ‘Cloud Data services’.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="819" src="http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Untitled-2-1024x819.png" alt="" srcset="http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Untitled-2-1024x819.png 1024w, http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Untitled-2-300x240.png 300w, http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Untitled-2-768x614.png 768w, http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Untitled-2.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Such a ‘white space-analysis’ is also useful to identify <strong>fringe cases</strong> which might signalize trends or new segments.</p>



<p>For instance, in the image below, Domo is the only company in the field of ‘Data Science’.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="819" src="http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Untitled-3-1024x819.png" alt="" srcset="http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Untitled-3-1024x819.png 1024w, http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Untitled-3-300x240.png 300w, http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Untitled-3-768x614.png 768w, http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Untitled-3.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>







<p>By analyzing companies that are related to more than one industry, you can uncover the diversification strategy these companies apply.</p>



<p>The knowledge graph below shows that companies that are in business intelligence are also in Machine Learning or Big Data (inside the green squares).</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="655" src="http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/graph-3-2-1024x655.png" alt="" srcset="http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/graph-3-2-1024x655.png 1024w, http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/graph-3-2-300x192.png 300w, http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/graph-3-2-768x491.png 768w, http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/graph-3-2.png 1496w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>In other words: for a business intelligence-company it is not enough to just offer business intelligence, they must diversify into other areas.</p>







<p>A hot spot is an area – centered around a node – that has many other nodes connected to it. For a company, this signalizes a segment with fierce competition.</p>



<p>In the image below one such field is ‘Machine Learning’.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="819" src="http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Untitled-2-1-1024x819.png" alt="" srcset="http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Untitled-2-1-1024x819.png 1024w, http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Untitled-2-1-300x240.png 300w, http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Untitled-2-1-768x614.png 768w, http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Untitled-2-1.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>







<p>Another area where knowledge graphs are useful is for the identification of ‘somewhat close’ companies. Such companies are companies that indirectly related to ‘our’ company and could thus be partners, potentially new competitors, or acquisition targets.</p>



<h2>Identify partners</h2>



<p>The two graphs below show the partnership between the consultancy PwC – and business intelligence company Alteryx</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="819" src="http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Untitled-4-1024x819.png" alt="" srcset="http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Untitled-4-1024x819.png 1024w, http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Untitled-4-300x240.png 300w, http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Untitled-4-768x614.png 768w, http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Untitled-4.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>The enlarged version of the black square from the graph above:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="790" height="277" src="http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/graph-3-1.png" alt="" srcset="http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/graph-3-1.png 790w, http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/graph-3-1-300x105.png 300w, http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/graph-3-1-768x269.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 790px) 100vw, 790px"></figure>



<p>If you use the knowledge graph to expand your ‘knowledge’ about PwC these partnerships might not surprise you at all because PwC has always been associated with Business Intelligence, as the graph below shows (the graph below is a subsection of the whole graph).</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="630" height="421" src="http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/graph-4.png" alt="" srcset="http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/graph-4.png 630w, http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/graph-4-300x200.png 300w, http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/graph-4-120x80.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px"></figure>



<p>In the graph above you see that PwC acquired Selera Labs (in 2016) a company in the analytics space. In the graph you also see that ‘Analytics’ belongs to ‘Business Intelligence’. Based on this, it is not surprising that PwC is moving further into the Business Intelligence field by partnering with companies from that space.</p>



<h2>Identify competitors or acquisition targets</h2>



<p>A knowledge graph can also be used to identify potential acquisition targets or company strategies.</p>



<p>BearingPoint, a consultancy, provides an example exemple to demonstrate this. The graph regarding BearingPoint is shown below. Again, this is a subsection of the whole graph.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="973" height="687" src="http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/graph-2-2-1.png" alt="" srcset="http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/graph-2-2-1.png 973w, http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/graph-2-2-1-300x212.png 300w, http://leobosankic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/graph-2-2-1-768x542.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 973px) 100vw, 973px"></figure>



<p>The graph shows:</p>



<ul><li>BearingPoint partnered with Celonis</li><li>Celonis is a Data Integration company – through their acquisition of Integromat</li><li>Many companies that are a Data Integration company – such as Alterxy – are also a Business Intelligence company</li></ul>



<p>Although it is not a direct relationship, BearingPoint is still <em>somehow</em> related to Business Intelligence.</p>



<p>Based on the PwC pattern above – PwC acquired a company in the Business Intelligence field and is also partnering in this field – one could assume that BearingPoint might also acquire somebody from that space.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
 		
<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about corporate knowledge management systems recently.</p>



<p>If we think about a company as an organism, then a knowledge management system is essentially the (collective) brain that keeps that organism alive and running. A corporate knowledge management system should contain every single bit of codifiable information within the company resulting in a library of all projects, processes and procedures.</p>



<p>In an ideal state, it is the single source of truth that helps to inform every individual in the firm about what everyone else is up to. Information should be easy to add (input) as well as easy to search and find (output) resulting in quick knowledge transfer between different employees.</p>



<p>In reality, however, this hardly ever is the case. As anyone who has ever worked at a larger company can attest to, company knowledge bases always end up being a huge mess. </p>



<p>What starts with a neatly organized Confluence wiki, over time morphs into a multi-headed monster consisting of millions of notes and documents that live across Google Docs, Dropbox Paper, Asana and half a dozen different wiki tools. Most docs will be outdated, some will contradict others and the one you are really looking for only shows up on page 14 of your search results.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/monster-4.png"></p><p>It seems like things usually start to fall apart once a company surpasses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar number</a> of 150 employees. This is probably when people start to realize that all the different documents of <em>explicit knowledge</em> they were amassing over the years have been held together with <em>implicit knowledge</em>. </p>



<p>It’s easy to find – and understand – the right documents when you know every other person in the company, but once you’re past that point, you need a system to organize all the data so that people can make sense of it.</p>



<p>The idea behind tools like Notion is to solve this problem by using just one tool for all your different knowledge documents. Instead of Google Docs AND Asana AND Trello AND Airtable, you just do everything in Notion. This reduces complexity because you don’t have to switch and search across different apps. At the same time, Notion forces you to think about a system that makes information easy to find with its folder-like structure and links between different databases.</p>



<p>I’ve never used Notion with more than half a dozen people myself, but from what I’ve heard from people at larger companies, Notion knowledge bases also don’t scale very well beyond a certain number of users. Once too many people start contributing to it, things become bloated and unnavigable.</p>



<p>A friend at Stripe recently suggested – half-jokingly – that we should hire a librarian to organize all our internal data and documentation. The more I think about it, the more I like the idea. Perhaps every company should hire a Chief Notion Officer once it hits 100 employees?!</p>



<p>An alternative approach to Notion is a knowledge management system that can live across different tools and without active manual curation because it’s based on really powerful search. The folder structure of your Google Drive, for example, doesn’t <em>really</em> matter because looking up documents via search is faster and more convenient. Meta search tools like <a href="https://usefyi.com/">FYI</a> are supposed to offer the same but across different productivity tools.</p>



<p>But again I’m skeptical that this really works beyond a certain amount of users (and thus documents). I remember even Google’s internal search engine doing only a mediocre job of surfacing the most relevant documents (and even if it did you weren’t sure if there wasn’t a better or more up-to-date version of it).</p>



<p>I’m sure we’ll get there eventually, but until then we probably need a mix of automated search and manual human help – which is where Slack comes in. I’ve <a href="https://twitter.com/lehrjulian/status/1097940802737704960">always thought</a> Slack plus Notion plus <a href="https://www.atspoke.com/">Spoke</a> would make a really powerful product (and I’m surprised Slack hasn’t made any major acquisitions in this space).</p>



<p>If you think about it, Slack is basically a search engine powered by humans: Most Slack messages are just questions. <a href="https://kwokchain.com/2019/08/16/the-arc-of-collaboration/">It’s 911 for when everything else fails</a>. So if Slack had access to your entire knowledge base, it could answer at least the most commonly asked questions automatically. The rest would still get answered manually by the channel participants. Or your Chief Notion Officer.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Hey team,</p>

<p>This is the continuation (and end) of the <em>Language(s) of Science</em> series that we started <a href="https://languagetools.io/forum/t/3191" target="_blank">here</a>. It's a long one, so let's dive right into it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/b6P7x4S/Part-II.png"></p><h3>English is the language of science</h3>
<p>Today, English is the dominant language of science. There are many factors - political, economic, social, or regulatory - that help explain this phenomenon. The geopolitical dominance of the British Empire and then of the United States in the last few centuries gave the language a head-start, and a momentum. Rich English-speaking countries are some of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_scientific_and_technical_journal_articles" target="_blank">most prolific</a> in terms of scientific output. The quasi-totality of the <a href="https://www.scimagojr.com/journalrank.php?type=j" target="_blank">most influential scientific journals</a> are English-language, and an <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-five-companies-control-more-than-half-of-academic-publishing" target="_blank">oligopolistic academic publishing sector</a> reinforces a monolingual scientific communication. English might be the <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/most-popular-languages-in-the-world.html" target="_blank">most widely spoken language</a> in the world, at more than 1 billion people. The "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish_or_perish" target="_blank">publish or perish</a>" culture, where funding and tenure are conditional on publication performance above all else, and the incentive systems that result from this lead scientists to write in the language that will increase the likelihood of the article getting published, reaching a large readership, and garnering citations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Intentionally or not, the whole system seems to be clamouring for English to be <em>the</em> language in which science is done.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<h3>The two sides of the mirror</h3>
<p>The existence of a <em>lingua franca</em> in science has undeniable advantages. It removes all linguistic barriers – except one – to communicating and accessing scientific developments the world over. It underpins the internationalisation of universities, which broadens the education and career prospects of students and professors worldwide. It further standardizes the production of knowledge, which facilitates organization of and access to knowledge.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The factors listed above, be they implicit or explicit, could be described as high-level characteristics of the global system we inhabit, only tenuously related to science. However, as desirable as the resulting advantages are, their corollaries are no less hypothetical, if much less researched.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<h3>Large scale effects...</h3>
<p>A bird-eye look at the dominance of English yields some striking insights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on the scientific field, and the data one looks at, <a href="https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/leap.1089" target="_blank">up to 97% of scholarly publication</a> can be in English, with hard sciences being more monolingual than humanities. Even in countries with a large scientific output, articles are written in English-only, and <a href="https://www.researchtrends.com/issue-31-november-2012/the-language-of-future-scientific-communication/" target="_blank">increasingly so</a>. Journals that used to be plurilingual are increasingly <a href="https://blog.scielo.org/en/2016/05/10/the-adoption-of-english-among-scielo-brazil-journals-has-been-increasing/" target="_blank">becoming English-only</a>. Non-English-language journals are further hidden from view by their <a href="https://blog.scielo.org/en/2015/08/02/motion-to-repudiate-mr-jeffrey-bealls-classist-attack-on-scielo/" target="_blank">exclusion from leading journal indexes</a>. Scientific terminology often remains confined to English, making other languages potentially <a href="http://lcn.pascalobservatory.org/sites/default/files/joe_lo_bianco_-_language_place_and_learning_-_august_2007.pdf" target="_blank">inadequate for doing science</a>. The assumption that <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/english-language-science-can-cause-problems-180961623/" target="_blank">all important information is in English</a> biases understanding of science (the flu virus H5N1, which could have been a major pandemic, famously <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/430955a" target="_blank">went unnoticed for months</a> because it was first reported in Chinese, not in English).&nbsp;</p>

<p>At a time where science is suffering from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis" target="_blank">replication crisis</a> and a crisis of trust, it is desirable to facilitate discussion around each and every publication, and few languages have more speakers than English. But then again, a monolingual research produced for an exclusive (if heterogeneous) readership provides for little diversity in terms of perspective, and the perverse outcomes of an English-only science weaken the local nature of research communities and remove research cultures from the very contexts that nurtured them.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<h3>...and their individual underpinnings</h3>
<p>English is so <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2018/03/13/domination-english-language-journal-publishing-hurting-scholarship-many-countries" target="_blank">deeply ingrained</a> in the metrics of science that it is more a requirement than a choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because the costs of translation services are prohibitively high for most scientists, few of them can afford to produce two versions of their paper, so they often choose to write in English only. This includes humanities: researchers who are interested in fundamentally local topics (the Quechua language, or Bantu traditions, or Spanish history) are increasingly compelled to publish their work in English. Those scientists who can afford producing their papers both in English and their local language need to contend with bans on dual publication enforced by most journals, which forbid papers to be republished elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This situation is also profoundly unfair, because <a href="http://www.teljournal.org/article_66109_85c526124faf5bde548ad8bf65cf9eb3.pdf" target="_blank">proficiency in English is not evenly distributed and is dependent on socioeconomic status</a>: an English-only science provides a massive advantage to those who have English as their first language, or who have been able to access high-quality education in English.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And this disadvantage has a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/08/english-universal-language-science-research/400919/" target="_blank">compound effect</a>. Those with a poorer level of English are less likely to choose to study science, are more likely to lag behind, take longer to process their English-language material, incur more costs and take longer to produce research, are refused publication because of language mistakes, are more likely to face prejudice because of their poorer writing, are less likely to have good metrics and get funding, can even get snubbed in favor of their Anglophone collaborators in media. The list goes on. The effect is that less people do science, and a large majority of scientists work in a language they're less confident in, while those who choose to work in a language other than English have trouble making themselves visible.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<h3>Potential solutions</h3>
<p>An English-first science <a href="http://eprints.rclis.org/23682/1/Current-socio-published-non-Sage-format.pdf" target="_blank">impedes the development of national and regional research communities and cultures</a>, limits both the quantity and quality of research, <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/english-language-science-can-cause-problems-180961623/" target="_blank">allows loss of knowledge</a>, and reduces science's diversity. While the final balance is unclear, it is undeniable that global research does not only stand to gain from a <em>lingua franca</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite the criticisms presented here, the dominance of English in science is unlikely to be imperilled in the foreseeable future, because too many feedback loops within the systems that science exists in buttress this supremacy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, some mechanisms push back against this, directly or indirectly. Open-access journals, which are becoming increasingly commonplace, have <a href="https://www.openaccess.nl/en/what-is-open-access/pros-and-cons" target="_blank">many advantages</a> over traditional journals and these qualities indirectly make the existence of non-English journals more viable. Machine translation, while still being inadequate for translating complex academic language, is constantly improving and lowering translation costs. Some of the largest journal indexes have started accepting non-English-language journals, and non-English indexes (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SciELO" target="_blank">SciELO</a>) are gaining ground, which in turn fuels their advocacy for a more diverse science.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But further efforts, big and small, are required. While there has not been enough discussion to identify what these could be, existing literature seems to converge on some ideas. National policies that <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2000933" target="_blank">financially support scientists to learn English, translate their work, and publish it</a> could strengthen national, and global, research. Dual publishing bans, which benefit journals at the expense of the community at large, need to be regulated away. Anglophone journals should make efforts to welcome multilingual research, and the metrics that scientists are evaluated against need to decouple themselves from English. The negative effects of an English-first science need to be more thoroughly researched. Finally, the <a href="https://phys.org/news/2020-10-english-lingua-franca-science.html" target="_blank">individual experiences</a> of those who have had to abandon science, who struggle against a system geared against them, experiences that are deeply human, harrowing, and relatable, need to become a focus of popular science writing, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/27/peru-student-roxana-quispe-collantes-thesis-inca-language-quechua" target="_blank">achievements</a> need to be celebrated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To quote <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/does-english-have-to-be-the-dominant-language-of-science/" target="_blank">another article</a>: "<em>The language we use when we speak science is as important as any other part in a methods section and should be deliberate and fair.</em>"</p>

November 22, 2020 | https://blog.gchinis.com/posts/serverless-specification-with-tla/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.gchinis.com/posts/serverless-specification-with-tla/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In this guide, I want to demonstrate how to use <em>TLA+</em> to specify a simple serverless system.</p>
<p>AWS defines serverless as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A serverless architecture is a way to build and run applications and services without having to manage infrastructure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You design your system as a collection of small runtime entities, often connected to queues to exchange messages.</p>
<p>AWS offers services like Lambda and SQS to easily provision such systems.
With managed services, less development effort is required to have something up and running.
Additionally, they make it easier to build scalable and resilient solutions.</p>
<p>This comes at a price since the increased asynchronicity makes it harder to reason about the behaviour of the system as a whole and because we need to take into account in our design the failure modes of those external services.
There is more information in the ThoughtWorks Radar about <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/de/radar/techniques/serverless-architecture">Serverless architecture</a> and <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/aws-lambda">AWS Lambda</a>.</p>
<p>Services like SQS and Lambdas describe what you get.
For example, SQS provides by default <strong>at-least-once delivery</strong>, and <strong>no message ordering</strong> guarantees.</p>
<p>As with any other piece of software, cloud services fail from time to time, delivering even less than what they document.
Since we lack visibility in those systems, they are managed by the cloud provider after all, harmful failures can go unnoticed.</p>
<p>As an example:
How do you know that all the messages you published in the queue got delivered, without instrumenting the consumer?</p>
<p>On the one hand, taking advantage of services offered by your cloud provider reduces the development effort.
On the other hand, failures are insidious, we don’t know if things are going well or not.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I attempt to demonstrate how to use <em>TLA+</em> and <em>PlusCal</em> to explore some of this failure modes.</p>
<p>Describing <em>TLA+</em> and <em>PlusCal</em> in detail would take more that a blog post, and it is not my goal.
My goal is twofold: to show how to specify concurrent systems and nondeterministic behaviour with <em>TLA+</em>, and to warn about the dangers of building overly asynchronous systems, since us humans are very bad at reasoning how they can fail.</p>
<p>For those excited to learn more about <em>TLA+</em> and <em>PlusCal</em>.
I’ve added some resources in the end.</p>
<h2 id="short-introduction-in-tla-and-pluscal">Short introduction in TLA+ and PlusCal</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>TLA+ is a high-level language for modeling programs and systems–especially concurrent and distributed ones.</p>
<p>Leslie Lamport</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TLA+ is well suited to model concurrent systems to make sure they meet your requirements.</p>
<p>We are going to write a <em>specification</em>.
Our <em>specification</em> is going to consist of <em>steps</em>.
Each step it atomic and is going to update the state of the system.
For every step, <em>TLA+</em> computes all possible next steps, but not all transitions are legal.
For example, in a user management system, the step to delete a user is only available after at least one user is in the system.</p>
<p>A sequence of steps is called a <em>behaviour</em>.
You use behaviours to express powerful <em>liveness</em> conditions that your system should meet.
For example, whether a database will eventually be updated even in the face of failures.
It is a very powerful tool to be able to express properties on behaviours, because you can validate whether different execution paths eventually lead to the same outcome.</p>
<p>We are going to write the specification in <em>PlusCal</em>, a language that translates to <em>TLA+</em> but has flow control structures that would be more familiar to people with programming background.</p>
<p><em>TLC</em> is a powerful model checker that will validate the specification or find counter-examples when our <strong>invariants</strong> fail.</p>
<h2 id="specifying-a-simple-system">Specifying a simple system</h2>
<p>Let’s specify a <strong>producer</strong> that pushes data over a <strong>queue</strong> in a <strong>consumer</strong> who stores them in a <strong>store</strong>.
For AWS users, think of a Lambda sending data to another Lambda via a queue.
The second Lambda stores them in S3.</p>
<p>I intentionally did not add any business logic to the example, because I want to focus on the drawbacks that arise by using this architectural style, and the increased asynchronicity it brings.</p>
<h3 id="global-state">Global state</h3>
<div><div>

</span><span>3
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="text">variables
    queue = {},
    store = {};</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p>That’s how we define the global state of our system.
In our specification, we are going to model both the <em>queue</em>, and the <em>store</em> as <strong>Sets</strong> of unordered values.
The reason I chose to model the <em>queue</em> with the set data structure is because I am looking to model a service which does not guarantee ordering of messages.</p>

<p>We specify a producer that makes only one action which is to <em>Publish</em>.
All the actions under a label (like <em>Publish</em>) are executed atomically.
So in one step, the producer picks a message from the <em>Messages</em> set and adds it in the <em>queue</em> set.
At the end of the step, the line <code>goto Publish</code> ensures that the publisher is allowed to publish again.</p>
<p>Notice how the construct <code>with m \in Messages do</code>.
Allows us to model that we don’t know which message is going to be picked.
<em>TLA+</em> will make sure to verify our model for all possible picks.</p>

<p>The consumer also has only one action which is to <em>Consume</em>.
The step is disabled until there is at least a message in the queue, that’s what Line 4 does.</p>
<p>Line 5 picks a message from the queue. Not necessarily the first one, remember it is an unordered set.</p>
<p>Lines 6-10 are a conditional.
Either the consumer is going to remove the message from the queue (Line 7), or not.
Remember, that SQS guarantees at-least-once delivery.
By leaving the message in the queue, it is going to be consumed again in the future.</p>

<p><em>QueueInvariant</em> does some basic sanity check ensuring that our queue contains <em>Messages</em> and only <em>Messages</em>.
It guards against publishing in queue something that is not of type <em>Message</em>.
It may seem trivial but is a nice example how an <em>invariant</em> can look like.<br>
You can specify when defining the model this <em>invariant</em> should hold in every step of our model.</p>
<p><em>Liveness</em> describes a property over a whole behaviour (not a single step) of the algorithm.
It says: <code>Eventually, always the store is going to be equal to the Messages</code>.
The operator <code>&lt;&gt;[]</code> means “eventually always”.
That is a very powerful operator to describe that your algorithms does the right thing in the end.</p>

<p>Let’s specify the simplest model for the above specification:</p>
<pre><code>Messages  = {m1} # Only one message
Producers = {p1} # Only one producer
Consumers = {c1} # Only one consumer

QueueInvariant   # Invariance that should hold for every step
Liveness         # Invariance that should hold eventually for every execution
</code></pre><p>In simple terms, one producer is going to be running in a loop.
Every time it runs, it is going to be publishing the same message in the queue.</p>
<p>One consumer also running in a loop, but only when there are available messages.
Every time it runs, it is going to be reading the message in the queue (potentially removing it from the queue) and adding it in the store.</p>
<p>The model checker tells us that our invariants are satisfied in every possible execution.</p>
<p>Success!</p>
<h2 id="progressing-thought-time">Progressing thought time</h2>
<p>Let’s extend our simple example.
Let’s say that as time goes by, the producer is sending us new revisions of the data.
For example, the producer is sending us the current “view count” for a video, over time it publishes new messages containing the latest “view count”.
In the store, we are only interested in storing only the latest “view count”.
Thus, when we receive an update, we should override any older data, if present.
We are still going to limit our system to send updates for only one video.</p>
<p>We now have to model a system that evolves thought time, to do that we are going to introduce a new process that models a clock.</p>

In the 1960s, that somewhere was Bell Labs, and the operating system they were building was Unix. They were building more than just an operating system though. They were building a way to work with computers that had never existed before. To find out more, I reached out to this guy.</span></p><p><strong>Brian:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span>I’m Brian Kernighan, and at the moment, I teach computer science at Princeton University.</span></p><p><strong>Adam:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span>He’s the K in K&amp;R, the famous book about C that still tops most recommended book lists. He was part of this computer science research group at Bell Labs for 30 years. He’s going to share the story of the creation of Unix, and hopefully, I’m going to try to figure out some of their secrets to being so impactful. Along the way, we’re going to have to learn about the Unix philosophy and printing patent applications, but we’re also going to have to learn about 10-kilo chocolate bars and fake demos to the CIA, and of course, British satirical magazines.</span></p><p><strong>Adam:</strong></p><p><span>The story of Unix is a story about Bell Labs, so let’s start at the beginning when Brian is a grad student and he gets an internship to work there for the summer.</span></p><p><strong>Brian:</strong></p><p><span>Bell Labs is a very big building, a sequence of connected buildings, and probably 3,000 people working over these long multi-story buildings. The thing that I remember most clearly about the first day, and I think it was the first day of the first internship, so call it the summer of 1967, and I got an office, and if I recall correctly, I had an office to myself. So this is something that’s unheard of in the modern era.</span></p><p><strong>Brian:</strong></p><p><span>But I had an office to myself, and I was sitting there in my office at probably 11:00 or something like that in my first morning, I wondered, “What the heck do I do? I have no idea what’s going on.” And this older gentleman came past my office and he said, “Hi, I’m Dick… Let’s go to lunch.” I thought, “Well, okay.” I went off to lunch with Dick…, whose name I hadn’t caught. We had a good lunch, he was an interesting kind of curmudgeonly, but intriguing guy. Then after lunch, he went off somewhere else.</span></p><p><strong>Brian:</strong></p><p><span>I snuck past my office to his office on the same corridor to see who the heck he was because everybody had name tags on the doors. It turns out it was Dick Hamming, the inventor of error-correcting codes.</span></p><p><strong>Adam:</strong></p><p><span>Dick Hamming is aka Richard Hamming. His Wikipedia page is huge. He worked on the Manhattan project programming computers to calculate the equations needed to develop nuclear weapons. One year after this lunch with Brian, he would win the Turing Award, the so-called Nobel Prize of Computing for his work on error-correcting codes. Hamming is also famous for this talk he gave on the secret to having impact in your professional life.</span></p><p><strong>Brian:</strong></p><p><span>The talk was called You and Your Research, and it was basically a retrospective on his career, thinking whether there were general lessons that would help other people in some way to have a better career. He was very, very interesting, and I think a good example of somebody with clearly lots of talent, but not a super genius type, who made the most of what he had. Who in every way, amplified so that he compounded his effect on the world. The other thing that’s maybe is appropriate for today, he used to say that he would reserve Friday afternoons for thinking great thoughts.</span></p><p><strong>Brian:</strong></p><p><span>He would sit in his office, he would put his feet on the desk, and he would think great thoughts, whatever that might be. It was usually introspection on himself or on where was the field going, or what might happen in the future? What might you do to take advantage of that or deal with it in some way or other? This is Friday morning when we’re talking, and I don’t get that luxury on Friday afternoons very often, but it’s a useful way to think of it. You say, “I’m going to stop and do it regularly to take stock of what’s going on, and in some way, think about, ‘What could I be doing that in some way would be better, that would be more useful for me or my family or the world or whatever?'”</span></p><p><strong>Brian:</strong></p><p><span>He did that quite religiously, you went in after lunch on Friday, you’d find him sitting in his office thinking great thoughts. So he’s fun.</span></p><p><strong>Adam:</strong></p><p><span>I love this advice, it presupposes that if I just had my Fridays free, and I wrote thinking great thoughts on my calendar, I would upgrade thoughts. I mean, maybe that’s the case, I’ll give it a try. There’s one concept though that Hamming is most famous for, and that is about how you choose what to work on.</span></p><p><strong>Brian:</strong></p><p><span>The way he told it to me and probably lots of others was that he used to eat with some group of people like chemists, I think the specific thing was, and he would eat at their table at lunchtime, big cafeteria setting. He would sit down with chemists and talk to them and he would ask them what they were working on, and whether what they’re working on could possibly lead to a Nobel Prize. The answer was often no, not a chance, and that was the point where he’d say, “Well, then why are you working on it? Because if it couldn’t at least potentially lead to a Nobel Prize, it isn’t important. Why are you wasting your time on something that isn’t important?”</span></p><p><strong>Adam:</strong></p><p><span>Whether intentionally or not, Brian followed this advice. When he returned to Princeton to work on his thesis, he was working on graph partitioning, which we now know is in some sense, equivalent to the traveling salesman problem. You have to find an optimum route that the salesman would travel from city to city minimizing travel distance. To complete his thesis, Brian had to work on the computers of Princeton at the time. Computers today are a lot different than they were in 1967 and ’68 at Princeton. At the time, computers were all about Fortran and punch cards.</span></p><p><strong>Brian:</strong></p><p><span>Fortran was designed in a card environment very definitely, and I assume the cards came before Fortran, but in my mind, they’re very strongly linked. And so yes, it was basically one statement per line, which was, therefore, one physical card. And so, when you wrote a program, you had to punch it on these punch cards, and then make sure you kept them in order and things like that and then you handed them to somebody who operated a very big, expensive machine. And a while later, back would come to your results, very often where it’s just something like there was a syntax error somewhere, and you had to find the cards that were wrong, replace them with new cards that were right and repeat the process, but with a very, very long latency that could be often measured in hours or sometimes even days.</span></p><p><strong>Brian:</strong></p><p><span>It’s not exactly like an instant compilation. And Fortran itself is a kind of clunky language as well in part reflecting those early days in computing, and partly just the fact that we didn’t understand a lot, and the computers themselves were not particularly sophisticated. Then finally, Fortran was intended for scientific computing. It was not intended for, let’s say, general-purpose system programming or anything like that. All of those things meant that although the program was a lot of fun, it’s not the same as it became five or 10 years later, and it has continued to evolve.</span></p><p><strong>Adam:</strong></p><p><span>I had to watch a couple of YouTube videos to get a sense of this punch card world. A punch card is like an index card, but it’s wider because it has 80 columns. And each of these columns corresponds to a single character. You punch holes in that column to indicate what letters should go there, and so each punch card represents one line of Fortran code. People build the programs this way, punching these cards, putting them into big boxes in order that they would carry around, then you take someplace to give them to a computer operator who would give them to the computer that would read all this in and run the program.</span></p><p><strong>Adam:</strong></p><p><span>So if you had a 1,000-line program, you would have 1,000 cards. There were no screens, no interactive output. You gave your cards to the computer operator and waited for your printout that was the result of your program. Computers were expensive and giant, so they wanted to maximize the throughput. Your program might be doing expensive mathematical calculations, but you could also just be doing word processing. One card might say, “In bold, print my thesis,” and the next would say, “Print, by Brian Kernighan,” and so on. It’s like a verbose way of using a typewriter, except the advantage is you could change the cards around and have it reprinted.</span></p><p><strong>Brian:</strong></p><p><span>T…</span></p></div></div>

November 22, 2020 | https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/israeli-queues | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/israeli-queues">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>A queue is a data structure that holds up elements for a brief period of time until a peripheral processing system is ready to process them. The most common implementation of a queue is a FIFO queue - First In First Out - that evicts the element that was inserted the first i.e. it evicts the one that has spent the most time in the queue. There are other variations of Queues one of which is called Priority Queue.</p>
<p>In Priority Queue, every element is associated with a priority, usually provided by the user during enqueueing; This associated priority is used during eviction where the element with the highest priority is evicted first during dequeuing.</p>
<p>In this essay, we take a detailed look into a variation of Priority Queue, fondly called Israeli Queues, where the priority of the element is defined by the affinity of it with one of its "friends" in the queue. Israeli Queues were first introduced in the paper <a href="https://pure.tue.nl/ws/files/2152975/632939.pdf">Polling with batch service</a> by Boxma, O. J., Wal, van der, J., &amp; Yechiali, U in the year 2007.</p>

<p>Queues in Israel are usually unorganized, due to which people tend to find their friends, who are already waiting, and instead of adhering to the usual protocol of joining at the back end, they cut through and directly join their friends. Israeli Queues mimic this behavior and hence get this <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15326340802427497">punny name</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99894937-fddc4380-2cac-11eb-8a73-a4dc5c490d2b.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/99894937-fddc4380-2cac-11eb-8a73-a4dc5c490d2b.png"></p>
<p>Israeli Queues are a variation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue">Priority Queues</a> where instead of associating priority with the element to be enqueued, the priority is implicitly derived using the "friend" element and it joins right at the back end of the group that the friend belongs to. The function signature of the enqueue operation is as shown below, while other operations like <code>dequeue</code> and <code>peek</code> remains fairly similar.</p>
<pre><code>

<span><span>void</span> <span>enqueue</span><span>(israeli_queue * q, element * e, element * f)</span></span>;
</code></pre>
<h2>How could this help?</h2>
<p>Every Data Structures is designed to solve a niche use case efficiently and Israeli Queues are no different as they prove to be super-efficient where one could batch and process similar elements or where the <em>set-up</em> cost for a task is high.</p>
<p>Consider a system where a queue is used to hold up heterogeneous tasks and there is a single machine taking care of processing. Now if some of these tasks are similar and have a high <em>set-up or preparation cost</em>, for example downloading large metafiles, or spinning up a parallel infrastructure, or even setting up persistent connections with device farms, queuing them closer and processing them sequentially or in batch helps in reducing redundant processing and computation by promoting reuse.</p>
<h2>Issue of starvation</h2>
<p>By enqueuing elements in between Israeli Queues reduces redundant processing, but by doing that it makes itself vulnerable to the classical case of starvation. Elements stuck at the rear end of the list could potentially starve for longer durations if elements having "friends" in the queue keep coming in at high frequency.</p>
<p>The original implementation of Israeli Queues suggests batch processing where instead of processing tasks one at a time, it processes a batch (a group of friends) in one go. This proves to be super-handy when the time required to processes a single task is much lower than the set-up cost for it.</p>
<h2>Implementation Guidelines</h2>
<p>The best way to implement Israeli Queues is by using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list">Doubly Linked List</a> with a bunch of pointers pointing to the head and tail of groups within it. Insertion to an existing group happens at the tail of it while if the element has no friend element, then it goes at the tail end of the list and forms its own group.</p>
<p>A constraint that could be added during implementation is that the friend element should always be the leader (head) element of the group. Details of the implementation could be tweaked so long the core concept remains unaltered.</p>

<p>Israeli Queues were the outcome of a problem statement dealing with Polling Systems. Polling System usually contains <code>N</code> queues <code>Q1</code>, <code>Q2</code>, ..., <code>Qn</code> where the processing unit visits each queue in cyclic order processing one element at a time i.e. <code>Q1</code>, <code>Q2</code>, ..., <code>Qn</code>, <code>Q1</code>, <code>Q2</code>, ..., <code>Qn</code>, etc.</p>
<p>When the server attends a queue instead of processing just one element from it, it processes the entire batch present in the queue utilizing the setup-cost efficiently assuming that time to process an element from a queue is much lesser than the set-up cost.</p>

November 22, 2020 | https://boxbase.org/entries/2020/nov/22/plan9-port-kapow/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://boxbase.org/entries/2020/nov/22/plan9-port-kapow/">archive.org</a>

<p>I have mentioned that applications duplicate operating system's functionality.
How severe issue is it and what kind of consequences there are?</p>
<p><a href="https://gottcode.org/kapow/">Kapow punch clock</a> tracks hours and constructs reports.
Its author has done well in maintaining complexity.
The whole program is only 4171 lines (+594 lines of copyright headers),
with total 146kB of source code.
This post presents a program for Plan 9 that serves the same purpose.
Finally lets do some comparison.</p>
<p><img alt="kapow screenshot" src="https://boxbase.org/entries/2020/nov/22/plan9-port-kapow/kapow.png"></p>
<p>The source code presented is attached: <a href="https://boxbase.org/entries/2020/nov/22/plan9-port-kapow/task.zip">task.zip</a></p>
<h2>task entries</h2>
<p>The clock has this kind of a nice directory -tab.
I have seen this tool being used.
The tabs were used to track customer_project_day instead of projects.
The dialog looks like a file browser.</p>
<p>The 'task' program treats each task as a file.
For instance here's the '0.kapow.task'.</p>
<pre><code>Punch clock port experiment
</code><code>start: Sat Nov 21 11:00:06 GMT 2020</code></pre>
<p>This is a running task.
When I'm done, I append in the stop: -line.</p>
<p>The time stamps aren't using Finnish abbreviations for weekdays or months
and it is bit inconvenient for me.
Though they are slightly more convenient than unix timestamps
because I can type the hour there if I forget to mark it.</p>
<p>The system benefits from not needing a locale to parse dates.
If you don't like english dates, you can use ISO-8601 timestamps,
those should work as well and look like this:</p>
<pre><code>2020-11-21T20:16:49+00:00</code></pre>
<h2>task/start and task/stop</h2>
<p>To start a task you write a timestamp into a file and mark it to start the task.
Although it'd be easy to do it manually,
I add few convenience scripts so you don't lose an entry
just because you write &gt; instead of &gt;&gt;.
Here's task/start and task/stop.
They are used to mark a task completed or start a task.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/rc
</code><code>rfork e
</code><code>for (taskname in $*) { echo start: `{date} &gt;&gt; $taskname }
</code><code>
</code><code>#!/bin/rc
</code><code>rfork e
</code><code>for (taskname in $*) { echo stop: `{date} &gt;&gt; $taskname }</code></pre>
<p>You can consider these are up to you to configure,
they're for your convenience.</p>
<h2>task/span</h2>
<p>Next you need a tool to know task status. Here's the 'task/span':</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/rc
</code><code>if (~ $#* 1) {
</code><code>  if (test -f $1) {
</code><code>    rfork e
</code><code>    taskname=$1
</code><code>    start=`{sed -n 's/^start: (.*)$/\1/p' &lt;$taskname | xargs seconds}
</code><code>    stop=`{sed -n 's/^stop: (.*)$/\1/p' &lt;$taskname | xargs seconds}
</code><code>    if (~ $stop '') stop=`{date | xargs seconds}
</code><code>
</code><code>    dt=`{echo print $stop(1) - $start(1) | bc}
</code><code>    s=`{echo print $dt % 60 | bc}
</code><code>    m=`{echo print $dt / 60 % 60 | bc}
</code><code>    h=`{echo print $dt / 3600 | bc}
</code><code>    echo span: $h hours $m minutes $s seconds
</code><code>    }
</code><code>  if not { echo not a file: $1&gt;[1=2]; exit usage }
</code><code>  }
</code><code>if not { echo usage: $0 taskfile &gt;[1=2]; exit usage }</code></pre>
<p>It presents how many hours, minutes, seconds have been spent in the task.
If the task is still running, it uses the current time as range.</p>
<h2>task/report</h2>
<p>The 'task/report' sorts the tasks and builds a report out of them.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/rc
</code><code>rfork e
</code><code>tasks=`{for (t in $*) {
</code><code>  p=`{sed -n 's/^start: (.*)$/\1/p' $t | xargs seconds}
</code><code>  echo $p $t } | sort -n | awk '{ print $2 }'}
</code><code>
</code><code>for(taskname in $tasks) {
</code><code>  span=`{task/span $taskname | awk '{ print $2,$3,$4,$5 }'}
</code><code>  start=`{sed -n 's/^start: (.*)$/(\1)/p' $taskname}
</code><code>  stop=`{sed -n 's/^stop: (.*)$/(\1)/p' $taskname}
</code><code>  if (~ $stop '') { echo $span $start '*' }
</code><code>  if not { echo $span $start }
</code><code>  sed '/^start:|^stop:/d' $taskname | sed 's/^/  /g'
</code><code>  }
</code><code>
</code><code>total=0
</code><code>for(taskname in $tasks) {
</code><code>  d=`{task/span $taskname | awk '{ print $2,$4 }'}
</code><code>  total=`{echo print $total + ($d(1) '*' 60) + $d(2) | bc}
</code><code>}
</code><code>echo total: `{echo print $total / 60 | bc} hours `{echo print $total % 60 | bc} minutes</code></pre>
<p>When a task is ongoing, this utility shows a star on it's entry.
This script could be customized for different uses.
Right now it's a plaintext report.</p>
<h2>display</h2>
<p>Some people like to have a display that tracks what is going on.
The 'task/track' -script executes a command periodically every minute
and the window where it runs is cleaned every time it repeats.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/rc
</code><code>task/report `{rc -c $"*} &gt;/dev/text
</code><code>while (sleep 60) task/report `{rc -c $"*} &gt; /dev/text</code></pre>
<p>It again is merely a convenience.
All of this functionality composes with rest of what the system has to offer.
For instance if you want to see all tasks in some directory:</p>
<pre><code>while (sleep 1) {
</code><code>    echo -n &gt;/dev/text
</code><code>    for (x in *.task) {
</code><code>        echo -n $x: ' '
</code><code>        task/span $x }}</code></pre>
<p>Also here's a cool thing,
if you want completed task list to appear when you log into your terminal,
you can add this into the rio start script:</p>
<pre><code>window -r 2338 15 2853 345 task/track 'echo *.task'</code></pre>
<p>Ok, we're done now. Here's how the finished program looks like:</p>
<p><img alt="task screenshot" src="https://boxbase.org/entries/2020/nov/22/plan9-port-kapow/task.png"></p>
<h2>tally</h2>
<p>The whole program suite is 48 lines and 1.5kB.</p>
<pre><code>cpu% wc bin/rc/task/*
</code><code> 21     119     703 bin/rc/task/report
</code><code> 18     100     578 bin/rc/task/span
</code><code>  3      11      73 bin/rc/task/start
</code><code>  3      11      72 bin/rc/task/stop
</code><code>  3      15     100 bin/rc/task/track
</code><code> 48     256    1526 total</code></pre>
<p>This is about 85 times less than kapow punch clock.</p>
<h2>apples and oranges?</h2>
<p>It may seem the comparison is unfair.
Are the programs equivalent in functionality?
The answer is no.
The 'task' implements much less functionality than the kapow punch clock.
It's barely considered bunch of scripts.
However the tasks are merely files and you edit them with existing tools,
this thing introduces very little to learn.
The manual is 1kB and I think I made it verbose.
Yet despite that:</p>
<ul>
<li>You're able to search from your tasks.</li>
<li>Exporting/Importing of tasks is easy because they are files
and to use the program you have to know where they are.</li>
<li>Tasks can be interleaved with other contents on the system.</li>
<li>Tasks archive properly given your other files archive properly.</li>
<li>You can attach and receive tasks in the mail.</li>
<li>The status of the tasklist can be securely live-displayed
on a remote info board and shared with collaborators.</li>
<li>There are lots of customization options.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do wonder what the take-away from here is.
Despite this all, kapow punch clock, it's fine software.
I don't mind that it's been written.</p>
<h2>experiences</h2>
<p>I did this to try off this 'rc' and try to write a manual page.
I'm surprised how usable the 'troff' is once you don't assume it should be something familiar.
The 'rc' is equally incredible by having an actual structure that you can rely on.
Plan 9 is such an incredibly good operating system,
I constantly find things that surprise in a good way.</p>

<![CDATA[Having Fun with Signal Handlers]]>

November 22, 2020 | https://www.giovannimascellani.eu/having-fun-with-signal-handlers.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.giovannimascellani.eu/having-fun-with-signal-handlers.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>As every C and C++ programmer knows far too well, if you dereference a
pointer that points outside of the space mapped on your process'
memory, you get a segmentation fault and your programs crashes. As far
as the language itself is concerned, you don't have a second chance
and you cannot know in advance whether that dereferencing operation is
going to set a bomb off or not. In technical terms, you are invoking
<em>undefined behaviour</em>, and you should never do that: you are
responsible for knowing in advance if your pointers are valid, and if
they are not you keep the pieces.</p>
<p>However, turns out that most actual operating system give you a second
chance, although with a lot of fine print attached. So I tried to
implement a function that tries to dereference a pointer: if it can,
it gives you the value; if it can't, it tells you it couldn't. Again,
I stress this should never happen in a real program, except possibly
for debugging (or for having fun).</p>
<p>The prototype is</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>word_t peek(word_t *addr, int *success);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The function is basically equivalent to <code>return *addr</code>, except that if
<code>addr</code> is not mapped it doesn't crash, and if <code>success</code> is not NULL it
is set to <code>0</code> or <code>1</code> to indicate that <code>addr</code> was not mapped or
mapped. If <code>addr</code> was not mapped the return value is meaningless.</p>
<p>I won't explain it in detail to leave you some fun. Basically the idea
is to install a handler for <code>SIGSEGV</code>: if the address is invalid, the
handler is called, which basically fixes everything by advancing a
little bit the instruction pointer, in order to skip the faulting
instruction. The dereferencing instruction is written as hardcoded
Assembly bytes, so that I know exactly how many bytes I need to skip.</p>
<p>Of course this is very architecture-dependent: I wrote the <code>i386</code> and
<code>amd64</code> variants (no <code>x32</code>). And I don't guarantee there are no bugs
or subtelties!</p>
<p>Another solution would have been to just parse <code>/proc/self/maps</code>
before dereferencing and check whether the pointer is in a mapped
area, but it would have suffered of a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-of-check_to_time-of-use">TOCTTOU</a>
problem: another thread might have changed the mappings between the
time when <code>/proc/self/maps</code> was parsed and when the pointer was
dereferenced (also, parsing that file can take a relatively long
amount of time). Another less architecture-dependent but still not
pure-C approach would have been to establish a <code>setjmp</code> before
attempting the dereference and <code>longjmp</code>-ing back from the signal
handler (but again you would need to use different <code>setjmp</code> contexts
in different threads to exclude race conditions).</p>
<p>Have fun! (and again, don't try this in real programs)</p>

<p>Hi, folks!</p>
<p>Every single program allocates memory. Byte buffers are at the core of many essential libraries which power the services the modern internet is built upon. If you’re building such a library, or even just copying data between different files, chances are you’ll need to allocate a buffer.</p>
<p>In Java, <code>ByteBuffer</code> is the class that allows you to do so. Once you’ve decided to allocate a buffer, you’ll be presented with two methods <code>allocate()</code> and <code>allocateDirect()</code>. Which one to use? The answer is, as always, it depends. If there were no tradeoffs, there wouldn’t be two methods. In this article, I’ll explore some of these tradeoffs, demystify this behaviour, and I hope that the answer will be clear for you by the end of it.</p>

</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_two_buffers">Two buffers</h3>
<p>At first glance, the two methods <code>allocate()</code> and <code>allocateDirect()</code> are very simple. The <code>allocate()</code> allocates a buffer in the managed heap of the Java process, a part of this exact space which size is specified with the <code>Xmx</code> option. The <code>allocateDirect()</code> method allocates a buffer residing outside of the managed heap.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://serce.me/img/allocatedirect/server3.png" alt="server3"></span></p>
<p>This difference, however, creates a number of significant runtime implications, which I’m going to dive into here. But first, let me start by telling a debugging story where direct byte buffers were the murderer.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_the_story">The story</h3>
<p>Every story needs a protagonist. In this case, the protagonist was a Java application built on top of RSocket, a modern application protocol. Here’s the oversimplified version of the app which you can find on <a href="https://github.com/SerCeMan/allocatedirect/blob/master/src/main/java/me/serce/allocatedirect/Main.java">Github</a>. Let’s call this app an echo app. The echo code isn’t trying to do anything complicated, it is a simple echo service built with an awesome <a href="https://github.com/rsocket/rsocket-java">rsocket-java</a> library. All it does is spins up a client and a server, where the client sends messages, and the server echoes them back.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">var server = RSocketServer.create(echo) //...
var client = RSocketConnector.create() //...
while (true) {
  assert Objects.equals(client.send(), client.receive())
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div>

The supporting code for this article is available <a href="https://github.com/SerCeMan/allocatedirect">on Github</a>. You can, and I highly encourage you to, choose to go through each step yourself by cloning the code and running each example with a simple bash script. All measurements were taken on an EC2 AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/m5/">m5.large</a> instance. Unless specified otherwise, <em>Java 13</em> is used. The point of this article is not to show the numbers but rather demonstrate the techniques that you can use to debug your own application.
</td>

</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>The code is useless if it’s just sitting in the repo and doing nothing, so let’s clone the repo and start the app.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="bash">git clone https://github.com/SerCeMan/allocatedirect.git
cd allocatedirect &amp;&amp; ./start.sh</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The app starts, and you should see that the logs are flowing. As expected, now it’s processing a large number of messages. However, if the echo app was exposed to users, they would start noticing significant pauses every now and then. All Java developers know that the first thing to look at in the case of spurious pauses is GC.</p>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Note</p>
</td>
<td>
You can find GC logs of the app are stored in <code>/tmp/${gcname}</code>. The example logs for each run are also available in the <a href="https://github.com/SerCeMan/allocatedirect/tree/master/logs">repo</a>. In this article, gceasy.io was used for visualisation. It’s a great free online tool which supports the log format of multiple garbage collectors. Even though you can always visualise GC logs using a tool like gceasy, as we’ll see later, the raw logs often contain a lot more information than most of the tools can display.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Indeed, GC logs show that GC is to blame here. The application is running under G1, which is the default collector since JDK 9. There are multiple young GC pauses on the graph. Young GC is a stop-the-world pause in GC in G1. The application stops completely to perform a cleanup. For the echo server, the graph shows multiple young GC pauses that last for 100-130ms and occur every 10 seconds.</p>
<div>
<p>G1 GC</p>
<p><span><img src="https://serce.me/img/allocatedirect/g1before.png" alt="g1before"></span></p>
</div>
<p>Luckily for us, in the last few years, there has been an amazing development in the GC space. There are not just one but two new fully concurrent garbage collectors, <a href="https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/zgc/Main">ZGC</a> and <a href="https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/shenandoah/Main">Shenandoah</a>.</p>
<p>While I’ve had <a href="https://twitter.com/SerCeMan/status/1246676501925224449">great success</a> with ZGC before, Shenandoah has a great advantage of being much friendlier to application memory consumption. Many applications, especially simple JSON in, JSON out stateless services are not memory-constrained. Some application, on the other hand, especially the ones that process a large number of connections might be very sensitive to memory usage.</p>
<p>Even though the echo app only has a single client and a server in its current state, it could as well handle tens of thousands of connections. It’s time to enable Shenandoah, and run the echo app again.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="bash">./start.sh shen # starts with -XX:+UseShenandoahGC</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>After enabling Shenandoah, the GC logs start showing an interesting picture. There is definitely a huge improvement in the pause frequency. The pauses now only occur every minute or so. However, the pauses are still around 90ms long, which is far away from the desired sub-millisecond pauses.</p>
<div>
<p>Shenandoah GC</p>
<p><span><img src="https://serce.me/img/allocatedirect/shenandoah.png" alt="shenandoah"></span></p>
</div>
<p>Now that the symptoms are clear, and the problem is reproducible, it’s time to look at the cause. GC graphs don’t show much more information. Looking at the raw logs directly, on the other hand, reveals the cause which is clearly stated right on the pause line.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="log">...
[info][gc] GC(15) Pause Final Mark (process weakrefs) 86.167ms
...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Turns out, weak references are to blame. Put simply, weak references are a way to keep an object in memory until there is a demand for this memory. Large in-memory caches is a common use-case for weak references. If there is enough free heap, a weak reference cache entry can stay there. As soon as GC figures out that there is not enough memory, it’ll deallocate weak references. In most of the cases, this is a much better outcome than the application failing with an out of memory exception because of a cache.</p>
<p>A frantic search across the repository doesn’t show any usages of weak, soft or phantom references. Not even the search through the third party libraries can show anything. After staring at the metrics for a while, one of the graphs gives a clue! The long GC pauses correlate with a sudden drop in the number of direct byte buffers.</p>
<div>
<p>GC vs DirectByteBuffer count</p>
<p><span><img src="https://serce.me/img/allocatedirect/jmc-gc.png" alt="jmc gc"></span></p>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Note</p>
</td>
<td>
You can get a similar graph by running the echo app and connecting to the JMX port. For this screenshot, I used Java Mission Control (JMC). The <a href="https://github.com/SerCeMan/allocatedirect/blob/master/start.sh#L53">start.sh</a> script contains the options that you can enable to connect to an app with JMX remotely.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>At first, the correlation might not make any sense. Byte buffers are not weak references, are they? They are not weak references themselves. However, you might notice, that creating a new direct byte buffer gives you back a plain <code>ByteBuffer</code> interface which doesn’t have a <code>close</code> method or any other way of deallocating the buffer.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">ByteBuffer buf = ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(42);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The underlying buffer needs to go away once the last reference to this buffer goes away. The modern API for this in Java is <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/ref/Cleaner.html"><code>java.lang.ref.Cleaner</code></a>. As we can see, it’s exactly what <code>DirectByteBuffer</code> class uses to determine when the underlying buffer should be deallocated.</p>
<div>

<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">DirectByteBuffer(int cap) {
    // ...
    base = UNSAFE.allocateMemory(size); // malloc call
    UNSAFE.setMemory(base, size, (byte) 0);
    // ...
    cleaner = Cleaner.create(this, new Deallocator(base, size, cap));
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Yet, there are no usages of direct buffers in the code of the echo app either, so how could we find them? One way would be to search through the third party libraries using IntelliJ. The approach would work very well for the echo example but would completely fail for any real applications of a decent size. There are just way too many places where byte buffers are used. Looking at the graphs, one can notice that the number of created buffers per minute is huge, literally millions of them.</p>
<p>Instead of searching through the code to find all byte buffer references, it is easier to find the place at runtime. One way to find out where the majority of the buffers is created is to fire up the async profiler and profile the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/malloc.3.html"><code>malloc</code></a> calls which are used by direct buffers to allocate memory.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"># async profiler can be downloaded from https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler
./profiler.sh -d 30 -f /tmp/flamegraph.svg $(pgrep -f java) -e malloc</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>While running, the profiler managed to sample more than 500000 malloc calls which non-ambiguously show where all of the buffers were created from.</p>

<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Note</p>
</td>
<td>
The flame graph above visualises the code paths where most of the captured malloc calls occur. The wider the column is, the larger the number of times the code path appeared in the sample. This graph, as well as other flame graphs in this article, is clickable. You can read more on how to read flame graphs <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html">here</a>.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>As it turned out, there was a place in the code which was using direct buffers. With this rich knowledge of where exactly the direct buffer allocations occur, creating a fix is easy. All that’s needed is to make a one line change and to replace <code>allocateDirect</code> with <code>allocate</code> and send a <a href="https://github.com/rsocket/rsocket-java/pull/945">PR upstream</a>.</p>
<p>Running the same app on shenandoah after applying the single line change produces a completely different graph which pleases the eyes with sub-millisecond GC pauses.</p>
<div>
<p>Shenandoah GC</p>

<div>
<h3 id="_the_costs">The costs</h3>
<p>The story revealed a dark side of direct byte buffers. If there is a dark side, there must be a bright side as well! There is. But before we look at the bright side, we need to explore a few more sides which also appeared to be grey.</p>
<div>
<h4 id="_allocations">Allocations</h4>
<p>Previously, we’ve observed implicit deallocations costs, so now it’s time to take a look at allocations. Could direct buffers be much cheaper to create? After all, going off-heap has been a performance trend for a while. A small benchmark can help to estimate the costs.</p>

<h2 id="integer-underflow"><a href="#integer-underflow">Integer Underflow</a></h2>
<p>
Let us talk a little bit about integer underflow and undefined behaviour
in C before we discuss the puzzle I want to share in this post.
</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 6; i--)
        printf(".");
    return 0;
}</code>
</pre>

<p>
This code invokes undefined behaviour. The value in variable
<code>i</code> decrements to <code>INT_MIN</code> after
<code>|INT_MIN| + 1</code> iterations. In the next iteration, there is a
negative overflow which is undefined for signed integers in C. On many
implementations though, <code>INT_MIN - 1</code> wraps around to
<code>INT_MAX</code>. Since <code>INT_MAX</code> is not less than
<code>6</code>, the loop terminates. With such implementations, this
code prints <code>|INT_MIN| + 1</code> dots. With 32-bit integers,
that amounts to 2147483649 dots. Here is one such example output:
</p>

<pre><samp>$ <kbd>gcc -std=c89 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic foo.c &amp;&amp; ./a.out | wc -c</kbd>
2147483649</samp>
</pre>

<p>
It is worth noting that the above behaviour is only one of the many
possible ones. The code invokes undefined behaviour and the ISO standard
imposes no requirements on a specific implementation of the compiler
regarding what the behaviour of such code should be. For example, an
implementation could also exploit the undefined behaviour to turn the
loop into an infinite loop. In fact, GCC does optimize it to an infinite
loop if we compile the code with the <code>-O2</code> option.
</p>

<pre><samp><kbd># This never terminates!</kbd>
$ <kbd>gcc -O2 -std=c89 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic foo.c &amp;&amp; ./a.out</kbd>
</samp></pre>


<h2 id="puzzle"><a href="#puzzle">Puzzle</a></h2>
<p>
Let us take a look at the puzzle now.
</p>

<div>
<p>
Add or modify exactly one operator in the following code such that it
prints exactly 6 dots.
</p>

<pre><code>for (i = 0; i &lt; 6; i--)
    printf(".");</code>
</pre></div>

<p>
An obvious solution is to change <code>i--</code> to <code>i++</code>.
</p>

<pre><code>for (i = 0; i &lt; 6; i++)
    printf(".");</code>
</pre>

<p>
There are a few more solutions to this puzzle. One of the solutions is
very interesting. We will discuss the interesting solution in detail
below.
</p>


<h2 id="solutions"><a href="#solutions">Solutions</a></h2>
<p>
<em><strong>Update on 02 Oct 2011:</strong> The puzzle has been solved
in the <a href="https://susam.in/blog/loopy-c-puzzle/comments/">comments</a> section. We will discuss the
solutions now. If you want to think about the problem before you see the
solutions, this is a good time to pause and think about it. There are
spoilers ahead.</em>
</p>

<p>
Here is a list of some solutions:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <code>for (i = 0; i &lt; 6; i++)</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>for (i = 0; i &lt; 6; ++i)</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>for (i = 0; -i &lt; 6; i--)</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>for (i = 0; i + 6; i--)</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>for (i = 0; i ^= 6; i--)</code>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The last solution involving the bitwise XOR operation is not immediately
obvious. A little analysis is required to understand why it works. 
</p>


<h2 id="generalization"><a href="#generalization">Generalization</a></h2>
<p>
Let us generalize the puzzle by replacing \( 6 \) in the loop with an
arbitrary positive integer \( n. \) The loop in the last solution now
becomes:
</p>

<pre><code>for (i = 0; i ^= n; i--)
    printf(".");</code>
</pre>

<p>
If we denote the value of the variable <code>i</code> set by the
execution of <code>i ^= n</code> after \( k \) dots are printed as
\( f(k), \) then

\[
  f(k) =
    \begin{cases}
      n                       &amp; \text{if } n = 0, \\
      n \oplus (f(k - 1) - 1) &amp; \text{if } n &gt; 1
    \end{cases}
\]

where \( k \) is a nonnegative integer, \( n \) is a positive integer,
and the symbol \( \oplus \) denotes bitwise XOR operation on two
nonnegative integers.

Note that \( f(0) \) represents the value of <code>i</code> set by the
execution of <code>i ^= n</code> when no dots have been printed yet.
</p>

<p>
If we can show that \( n \) is the least value of \( k \) for which \(
f(k) = 0, \) it would prove that the loop terminates after printing
\( n \) dots.
</p>

<p>
We will see in the next section that for odd values of \( n, \)

\[
f(k) =
\begin{cases}
n &amp; \text{if } k \text{ is even}, \\
1 &amp; \text{if } k \text{ is odd}.
\end{cases}
\]

Therefore there is no value of \( k \) for which \( f(k) = 0 \) when \(
n \) is odd. As a result, the loop never terminates when \( n \) is odd.
</p>

<p>
We will then see that for even values of \( n \) and
\( 0 \leq k \leq n, \)

\[
f(k) = 0 \iff k = n.
\]

Therefore the loop terminates after printing \( n \) dots when \( n \)
is even.
</p>


<h2 id="lemmas"><a href="#lemmas">Lemmas</a></h2>
<p>
We will first prove a few lemmas about some interesting properties of
the bitwise XOR operation. We will then use it to prove the claims made
in the previous section.
</p>

<!-- Lemma 1 -->
<p>
<strong>Lemma 1.</strong>
<em>
For an odd positive integer \( n, \)

\[
n \oplus (n - 1) = 1
\]

where the symbol \( \oplus \) denotes bitwise XOR operation on two
nonnegative integers.
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Proof.</em>
Let the binary representation of \( n \) be \( b_m \dots b_1 b_0 \)
where \( m \) is a nonnegative integer and \( b_m \) represents the most
significant nonzero bit of \( n. \) Since \( n \) is an odd number,
\( b_0 = 1. \)

Thus \( n \) may be written as

\[ b_m \dots b_1 1. \]

As a result \( n - 1 \) may be written as

\[ b_m \dots b_1 0. \]

The bitwise XOR of both binary representations is \( 1. \)
</p>

<!-- Lemma 2 -->
<p>
<strong>Lemma 2.</strong>
<em>
For a nonnegative integer \( n, \)

\[
n \oplus 1 =
  \begin{cases}
    n + 1 &amp; \text{if } n \text{ is even}, \\
    n - 1 &amp; \text{if } n \text{ is odd}.
  \end{cases}
\]

where the symbol \( \oplus \) denotes bitwise XOR operation on two
nonnegative integers.
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Proof.</em>
Let the binary representation of \( n \) be \( b_m \dots b_1 b_0 \)
where \( m \) is a nonnegative integer and \( b_m \) represents the most
significant nonzero bit of \( n. \)
</p>
<p>
If \( n \) is even, \( b_0 = 0. \) In this case, \( n \) may be written
as \( b_m \dots b_1 0. \) Thus \( n \oplus 1 \) may be written as \( b_m
\dots b_1 1. \) Therefore \( n \oplus 1 = n + 1. \)
</p>

<p>
If \( n \) is odd, \( b_0 = 1. \) In this case, \( n \) may be written
as \( b_m \dots b_1 1. \) Thus \( n \oplus 1 \) may be written as \( b_m
\dots b_1 0. \) Therefore \( n \oplus 1 = n - 1. \)
</p>

<p>
Note that for odd \( n, \) lemma 1 can also be derived as a corollary of
lemma 2 in this manner:

\[
k \oplus (k - 1)
= k \oplus (k \oplus 1)
= (k \oplus k) \oplus 1
= 0 \oplus 1
= 1.
\]
</p>


<!-- Lemma 3 -->
<p>
<strong>Lemma 3.</strong>
<em>
If \( x \) is an even nonnegative integer and \( y \) is an odd positive
integer, then \( x \oplus y \) is odd, where the symbol \( \oplus \)
denotes bitwise XOR operation on two nonnegative integers.
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Proof.</em>
Let the binary representation of \( x \) be \( b_{xm_x} \dots b_{x1}
b_{x0} \) and that of \( y \) be \( b_{ym_y} \dots b_{y1} b_{y0} \)
where \( m_x \) and \( m_y \) are nonnegative integers and \( b_{xm_x}
\) and \( b_{xm_y} \) represent the most significant nonzero bits of \(
x \) and \( y, \) respectively.
</p>

<p>
Since \( x \) is even, \( b_{x0} = 0. \) Since \( y \) is odd,
\( b_{y0} = 1. \)
</p>

<p>
Let \( z = x \oplus y \) with a binary representation of \( b_{zm_z}
\dots b_{z1} b_{z0} \) where \( m_{zm_z} \) is a nonnegative integer and
\( b_{zm_z} \) is the most significant nonzero bit of \( z. \)
</p>

<p>
We get \( b_{z0} = b_{x0} \oplus b_{y0} = 0 \oplus 1 = 1. \) Therefore
\( z \) is odd.

<!-- Theorem 1 -->
<p>
<strong>Theorem 1.</strong>
<em>
Let \( \oplus \) denote bitwise XOR operation on two nonnegative
integers and

\[
  f(k) =
    \begin{cases}
      n                        &amp; \text{if } n = 0, \\
      n \oplus (f(n - 1) - 1)  &amp; \text{if } n &gt; 1.
    \end{cases}
\]

where \( k \) is a nonnegative integer and \( n \) is an odd positive
integer. Then

\[
  f(k) =
    \begin{cases}
      n &amp; \text{if } k \text{ is even}, \\
      1 &amp; \text{if } k \text{ is odd}.
    \end{cases}
\]
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Proof.</em>
This is a proof by mathematical induction. We have \( f(0) = n \) by
definition. Therefore the base case holds good.
</p>

<p>
Let us assume that \( f(k) = n \) for any even \( k \) (induction
hypothesis). Let \( k' = k + 1 \) and \( k'' = k + 2. \)
</p>

<p>
If \( k \) is even, we get

\begin{align*}
f(k')  &amp; = n \oplus (f(k) - 1)  &amp;&amp; \text{(by definition)} \\
       &amp; = n \oplus (n - 1)     &amp;&amp; \text{(by induction hypothesis)} \\
       &amp; = 1                    &amp;&amp; \text{(by lemma 1)},\\
f(k'') &amp; = n \oplus (f(k') - 1) &amp;&amp; \text{(by definition)} \\
       &amp; = n \oplus (1 - 1)     &amp;&amp; \text{(since \( f(k') = 1\))} \\
       &amp; = n \oplus 0 \\
       &amp; = n.
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>
Since \( f(k'') = n \) and \( k'' \) is the next even number after
\( k, \) the induction step is complete. The induction step shows that
for every even \( k, \) \( f(k) = n \) holds good. It also shows that as
a result of \( f(k) = n \) for every even \( k, \) we get \( f(k') = 1
\) for every odd \( k'. \)
</p>

<!-- Theorem 2 -->
<p>
<strong>Theorem 2.</strong>
<em>
Let \( \oplus \) denote bitwise XOR operation on two nonnegative
integers and

\[
  f(k) =
    \begin{cases}
      n                        &amp; \text{if } n = 0, \\
      n \oplus (f(n - 1) - 1)  &amp; \text{if } n &gt; 1.
    \end{cases}
\]

where \( k \) is a nonnegative integer, \( n \) is an even positive
integer, and \( 0 \leq k \leq n. \) Then

\[
  f(k) = 0 \iff k = n.
\]
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>Proof.</em>
We will first show by the principle of mathematical induction that for
even \( k, \) \( f(k) = n - k. \) We have \( f(0) = n \) by definition,
so the base case holds good. Now let us assume that \( f(k) = n - k \)
holds good for any even \( k \) where \( 0 \leq k \leq n \) (induction
hypothesis).
</p><p>
Since \( n \) is even (by definition) and \( k \) is even (by induction
hypothesis), \( f(k) = n - k \) is even. As a result, \( f(k) - 1 \) is
odd. By lemma 3, we conclude that \( f(k + 1) = n \oplus (f(k) - 1) \)
is odd.
</p>

<p>
Now we perform the induction step as follows:

\begin{align*}
f(k + 2) &amp; = n \oplus (f(k + 1) - 1)
                 &amp;&amp; \text{(by definition)} \\
         &amp; = n \oplus (f(k + 1) \oplus 1)
                 &amp;&amp; \text{(by lemma 2 for odd \( n \))} \\
         &amp; = n \oplus ((n \oplus (f(k) - 1)) \oplus 1)
                 &amp;&amp; \text{(by definition)} \\
         &amp; = (n \oplus n ) \oplus ((f(k) - 1) \oplus 1)
                 &amp;&amp; \text{(by associativity of XOR)} \\
         &amp; = 0 \oplus ((f(k) - 1) \oplus 1) \\
         &amp; = (f(k) - 1) \oplus 1 \\
         &amp; = (f(k) - 1) - 1
                 &amp;&amp; \text{(from lemma 2 for odd \( n \))} \\
         &amp; = f(k) - 2 \\
         &amp; = n - k - 2
                 &amp;&amp; \text{(by induction hypothesis).}
\end{align*}

This completes the induction step and proves that \( f(k) = n - k \)
for even \( k \) where \( 0 \leq k \leq n. \)
</p>

<p>
We have shown above that \( f(k) \) is even for every even \( k \) where
\( 0 \leq k \leq n \) which results in \( …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>In the C++ application development, sometimes, we would like to hide the private methods and member variables so that the users will not try to get access to those member methods and variables.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to briefly discuss how to do it using abstract class declarations.</p>

<h3 id="abstract-class">Abstract Class</h3>

<p>An abstract class is a class that either defines or inherits at least one function for which the final overrider is pure virtual.</p>



<p>To understand virtual and pure virtual, we have to understand what C++ polymorphisms are. I have a blog post <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/CPP-Polymorphisms/">“C++ Polymorphisms”</a> on this topic. Some of its simple examples could also be found on <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/abstract_class">CPP Reference</a>.</p>

<h3 id="example">Example</h3>

<p>Here we would create a bot application which will simply introduce itself and say hello to the user. All the source code could be found on my <a href="https://github.com/leimao/CPP-Public-Header-Abstract-Class-Declarations-Example">GitHub</a>.</p>



<p>We would like to create an implementation for class <code>Bot</code>. The following declaration was used for building the library <code>libbot.so</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// bot.h</span>
<span>#include &lt;string&gt;
</span>
<span>class</span> <span>Bot</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>public:</span>

    <span>Bot</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>botName</span><span>);</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>greet</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span><span>;</span>

<span>private:</span>

    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string</span> <span>mBotName</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, sometimes, we don’t want the users to know the private methods and members. In more complex cases, the number of private methods and members could be huge. Only the public methods are designed to be useful for the users. If we provide the following simplified header to the users, and ask the users to use the header in their application implementations, the users will run into problems.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// public_bot.h</span>
<span>#include &lt;string&gt;
</span>
<span>class</span> <span>Bot</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>public:</span>

    <span>Bot</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>botName</span><span>);</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>greet</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span><span>;</span>
    
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is because C++ has to know all the methods and the members of an object during compile-time. The size of such object is thus determined during compile-time. Using an object declaration that does not contain the private methods and members that it should have will result in the building of an incomplete object during runtime. Thus running those applications will run into errors if any private methods and members were accessed by the public methods.</p>



<p>So what could we do if we would like to only expose the public methods and the program is still executable? We could use abstract class. The following header is used for building the library <code>libvirtual_bot.so</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// virtual_bot.h</span>
<span>#include &lt;string&gt;
</span>
<span>class</span> <span>IBot</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>public:</span>
    <span>virtual</span> <span>void</span> <span>greet</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>IBot</span><span>*</span> <span>createBot</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>botName</span><span>);</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Bot</span> <span>:</span> <span>public</span> <span>IBot</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>public:</span>

    <span>Bot</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>botName</span><span>);</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>greet</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span> <span>override</span><span>;</span>

<span>private:</span>

    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string</span> <span>mBotName</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The following header is given to the user for creating the application.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// public_virtual_bot.h</span>
<span>#include &lt;string&gt;
</span>
<span>class</span> <span>IBot</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>public:</span>
    <span>virtual</span> <span>void</span> <span>greet</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>IBot</span><span>*</span> <span>createBot</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>botName</span><span>);</span>

<span>// The declaration of Bot is hidden.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With this header, the users do not know the existence of <code>Bot</code> yet they can still call all the public methods of <code>Bot</code>. All they should deal with is the abstract class <code>IBot</code>. An instance of <code>Bot</code> could be created by calling the <code>createBot</code> method and returning a base <code>IBot</code> pointer.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><span><p>Say you're about to build a new project. You're an expert in a few languages, and you have a sense of the ecosystem in general. How do you choose the language you build with? I wanted to share my decision framework with you. </p><p>Some requirements can eliminate entire categories of choices. Let’s use that to our advantage: start by narrowing down your choices. For example:</p><p><strong>Do you need extreme efficiency?</strong> This would mean your code may need to be compiled and that you can’t have run-time garbage collection. Well, that narrows down your choices quite a bit. </p><p><strong>Do you need math-level proofs that your code works as expected?</strong> This would mean you need an <em>extremely</em> strong type system. Bam, narrows choices down quite a bit </p><p><strong>Do you need concurrency?</strong> There are only a few VMs and a few languages that are known to be <em>excellent</em> for concurrency. Depending on what you need, this will narrow your choices down to a few families.</p><p><strong>Do you work in a larger environment?</strong> If you are building something, and your entire company is on one stack, there’s so much power to the existing ecosystem that this effectively narrows down your choice to the language of your environment.<sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Is your problem in a domain where the ecosystem in one language is strongest?</strong> If you’re in machine learning, the ecosystem in python is so powerful that it almost guarantees to narrow down your choice to that language.</p><p><strong>Is your problem a small script that needs to run everywhere?</strong> This narrows your choices down to the languages that are available by default on Linux</p><p>Now, there’s a leverage point here: constraints narrow down your choices in a significant way. If you add a constraint you didn’t need, you risk sacrificing a large set of options. For example, many think their system needs to scale from the get-go. This is rarely the case and kills some of the choices that contributed to the success of the biggest companies today <sup>2</sup></p><p>So pick your constraints carefully. Once you do though, you’ll be pleasantly surprised with how much clarity they give you: your choices will have gone through a significant filter.</p><p>The next filter is effectiveness. Choose the language that maximizes your output on a time scale you care about.</p><p>At this stage, there is often a tradeoff between what you’re comfortable with and what you need to discover. Say you’re comfortable in assembly, but don’t know any other languages. What should you do?</p><p>Well, for some very small problems, it <em>does</em> make sense to just write them in assembly. If they’re urgent, you have no other choice. But for any significant work, you’ll outstrip the productivity of assembly within a few days of ramp-up. </p><p>The same kind of spectrum exists in higher-level languages, but the differences take longer to show up. If you’re comfortable with Java, for example, you can get a lot done pretty quickly. But within <em>some</em> period, the productivity benefits pale in comparison to more powerful languages.</p><p>Making this choice is a bit of an art, but it works like this. You want to think about a time-frame that you’d like to optimize and pick the language that optimizes for effectiveness within that timeframe. </p><p>If you’re in a hurry, you have no choice but to use what you’re comfortable with, no matter how limiting. There are two ways to avoid the dilemma. You can either play with different languages before you start your project, so you have a wider array of comfortable choices to pick from, or give yourself a few months to ramp up and select the language that’s most effective for your problem.</p><p>With that, the question comes, <em>what time frame</em> should you optimize for? This is in itself an art. For startups, I would say about 8-12 months. Planning further than that is over-optimization. For larger companies, I’d think 2-5 years.</p><p>Now you’ve gone through two filters. Say you narrowed down to just a few choices, but you aren’t sure which one to take. How should you break the tie? </p><p>I’d say fun. There are so many schleps in a startup that programming should be as fun as possible. Once. I narrowed down. I’d choose the language I’m most excited about.</p><hr><p><em>Thanks to Sean Grove, Daniel Woelfel, Joe Averbukh, Alex Reichert for reviewing drafts of this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>“What industries badly need is a universal way to communicate documents across a wide variety of machine configurations, operating systems and communication networks.

While Apple is talking about saving the earth by producing less electronic waste, I would hope to see how they are backing up their attempts with statistics. Beyond that, I just think its ridiculous to say that and charging new charging brick and new charging wires at such an exorbitant price. One always wonder what would Steve Jobs do.</li>

<p>Rather than to fight the slow fight to convince others to drive less and thus have less cars on the road, how about a radical alternative?</p>

<p>Give them an pleasant alternative, escooters. This can help to cover short distance travels, it also help us to see how the government can chart the way for a societal change in lifestyle. A step forward for countries to reduce in carbon footprint is to create bicycle lanes to encourage more bicycle as preferred mode of transport.</p>

<p>Give them space and time to work, free from distractions. Work from home’s top distractions are actually the consistent messages that keeps coming in while being physically around your coworkers.</p>

<p>Work from home allows you the socially acceptable approach to mute your employees so you can focus on the tasks before you. While WFH heightens the room for productivity, people are feeling more lonely than before.</p>

<p>The disconnection with their coworkers can also affect their productivity as their mental wellness can be affected with prolong isolation. Companies however feels that it is personal employee responsibility to get themselves connected. Essentially, while it is true to a large extent, companies can play its part to setup itself up for success; not by luck but by design. This includes digital engagements, interactive digital townhall, more frequent get togethers once in a while to bring people together.</p>

<p>Using null might be interesting if you care about property existence. If it is undefined, you wouldnt know if the variable foo might be undefined or if the object doesn’t have a property foo. If you want to explicitly communicate via types that property foo exists and might have a bottom value. Then null is one of your approach.</p>

<p>The secret to serving static video content is to use CDNs.<br>
<a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/CDN.html">This</a> is a simple description of what is a CDN. This might be my an interesting topic to delve deeper to explore the science behind this magic.</p>

<p>Some of the CDNs includes Limelight, Level 3, Akamai, CloudFront, and CloudFlare. For Netflix, they created their own CDN call <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://openconnect.netflix.com/en/">Open Connect</a>. This is definitely another tool to explore.</p>

<p>Here’s an overview of how Netflix uses the client to determine the *best CDN to use:</p>
<ul>
<li>The API signals that the content this person is trying to watch is on, say, 10 different CDN servers.</li>
<li>The client intelligence picks the CDN that it calculates to be best*</li>
<li>The client intelligence continually probes to find the best way of receiving content</li>

A short glimpse into what pet vs cattle systems are. The definitions based on the post has accurately described them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pets</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Servers or server pairs that are treated as indispensable or unique systems that can never be down. Typically they are manually built, managed, and “hand fed”. Examples include mainframes, solitary servers, HA loadbalancers/firewalls (active/active or active/passive), database systems designed as master/slave (active/passive), and so on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cattle</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Arrays of more than two servers, that are built using automated tools, and are designed for failure, where no one, two, or even three servers are irreplaceable. Typically, during failure events no human intervention is required as the array exhibits attributes of “routing around failures” by restarting failed servers or replicating data through strategies like triple replication or erasure coding. Examples include web server arrays, multi-master datastores such as Cassandra clusters, multiple racks of gear put together in clusters, and just about anything that is load-balanced and multi-master.\</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They can go down whenever, however. But they are always creating new server applications to ensure that the service is online.</p>

<br>
<h2>TLDR;</h2>

<p>Reading has this compounding effect with tangible effects budding months or even years of consistent practice. In technology, while it is easy to just chase the work and code, one of the most fundamental habits of x10 engineers is the habit of reading and immersing themselves in tech talks and discussions. May us all engineers develop this habit and make the world a better place; one piece of code at a time.</p>

			<p>Founded in 2020 amidst the pandemic, Minus Zero is on a quest to build indigenous fully Self Driving Car in India by late 2023, competing with the likes of Elon Musk’s Tesla, Google’s Waymo and others in the industry. It’s not long before India will have its own ‘Made in India’ autonomous vehicle able to drive itself with zero human supervision in a challenging traffic like India’s. Being one of the most rising use cases of Artificial Intelligence, this can make India a leader in global tech ecosystem.&nbsp;Minus Zero is a deep-tech start-up working to leverage the power of moon-shot innovation to an inclusive society at large.                <!-- <div class="PT10 TAC PB10"><div id="crt_728x90a"></div></div> -->

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You've validated your micro-SaaS idea and are ready to start building the product.</p><p>The obvious next questions are</p><ol start="" role="list"><li>Which features should the product include in its first version?</li><li>How long should you take to build it?</li></ol><p>Through this post, I provide you with a framework to identify your initial product features, how to decide what to include or exclude from the first versions, and continue building upon it.</p><p>Before jumping into MLP, let's first understand what MVP&nbsp;is and why it's not enough in today's times.</p><h2>What is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)?</h2><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ericries" target="_blank">Eric Ries</a> popularized the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product" target="_blank">minimum viable product</a> in his book <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/" target="_blank">The Lean Startup</a> as that version of a new product that is just usable enough by early customers who can then provide feedback to the team. This feedback should help the team generate validated learnings and guide them on future product development and features.</p><h4>When MVP still works</h4><p>MVP is not dead though. It still works, given the right kind of problem statements.</p><p>Suppose you're building something that simply doesn't exist in the world, and it's something that people really want and have no alternative to getting it except from you.</p><p>At this time, people will accept a textbook MVP, simply because they have no frame of reference to compare it with. Or better yet, because they have no alternative to replace your MVP with.</p><h4>Why MVP&nbsp;is not enough in 2021</h4><p>Over the past few years as smartphone penetration boomed, products matured, product design and user experience matured, people's expectations have increased.</p><p>No longer does a quickly thrown together prototype cut it. People expect a minimum level of good UX and ease-of-use, else they'll leave your app before even giving it a proper try.</p><p>In fact, in 2021 great UX might be one strong reason people pick your product over incumbents. That's what happened with <a href="https://transistor.fm/" target="_blank">Transistor.fm</a>, who made podcast hosting simple and easy.</p><p>People expect good aesthetics that make a first impression, simply because that's what they have become used to from the plethora of beautiful and well-designed apps out there in the world.</p><p>People expect products to be fully functional as advertised. Buggy products are not acceptable, and in fact people might quickly take to Twitter or social media to let others know that a product is unreliable.</p><p>The MVP mindset intensely focuses on building the bare minimum, and that often leaves users frustrated and drives them to seek alternative solutions. Stiffer competition means that people WILL compare your product to alternatives in the market, it's inevitable. And unless you provide something unique and valuable that nobody else does, people are likely to leave.</p><p>All these reasons and more make MVP&nbsp;a dated concept, especially in the context of SaaS products. But above all, I think the MVP mindset makes product builders think too heavily about the "minimum" and often so at the cost of "viable".</p><p>That's a common pitfall and to avoid that, I propose the MLP framework.</p><h2>What is a Minimum Loveable Product (MLP)?</h2><p>A great new concept that I've fallen in love with and personally follow in every product I build is MLP, or Minimum Loveable Product.</p><p>The term MLP was first coined by Brian de Haaff, the co-founder of Aha!, in his book <a href="https://www.aha.io/lovability" target="_blank">Lovability</a>.</p><p>Its definition is an extension of what Eric Ries already introduced to the world with MVP. With MLP though, you are trying to build the minimum "loveable" product, with a focus on no matter how small or feature-stripped the first version of your product is, it is sufficient to deliver a delightful experience to your user.</p><h4>Minimum Viable Product and the burnt pizza analogy</h4><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiaona/" target="_blank">Jiaona Zhang</a>, who is currently VP&nbsp;of Product at Webflow (this blog is built using Webflow) introduced the <a href="https://firstround.com/review/dont-serve-burnt-pizza-and-other-lessons-in-building-minimum-lovable-products/" target="_blank">burnt pizza analogy</a> to her students at Stanford.</p><p>“<em>Say you’re trying to test whether people like pizza. If you serve them burnt pizza, you’re not getting feedback on whether they like pizza. You only know that they don’t like burnt pizza. Similarly, when you’re only relying on the MVP, the fastest and cheapest functional prototype, you risk not actually testing your product, but rather a poor or flawed version of it.</em>"</p><p>A great practical example of Minimum Loveable Product is the Apple iPad. All the tablets that came before Apple's tablet were MVPs.</p><h2>MLP vs MVP</h2><p>If you're new to all these terminologies, I understand that it can be confusing. Bear with me, you'll wrap your head around it soon enough.</p><p>Build an MLP when you are solving a problem that's already understood by people, and an MVP when people don't easily understand a problem.</p><p>Build an MLP when you can clearly define and understand a market and you are trying to stand out from the existing tools. Build an MVP when you're trying to gauge if there even exists a market to serve.</p><p>An&nbsp;MLP can be built when you know exactly what customers want. An MVP is when you don't know what customers want, and therefore you want to throw things at the wall as quickly as possible and see what sticks.</p><p>An MLP is necessary if you are building in a market where several large and well-known alternatives already exist. An MVP is the right approach for a new market with barely any alternatives, or those solutions are not yet known by the masses.</p><p>While building an MLP, you make a dedicated effort to succeed with that idea. With MVP, you are trying to determine quickly whether the idea can succeed or whether it will fail.</p><p>Building an&nbsp;MVP means you're ready for failure and also ready to pivot quickly as you learn more about the market. Which means you should make tech and architecture decisions that help you move fast above anything else. Scalability or good architecture design is a concern to pay attention to while building an MLP.</p><p>Finally, the end goal of an MLP is that the customers who use it find it sufficient in functionality and experience to be able to "love" it. With an MLP, you're building just enough that a customer with (hopefully) a real pain point would "tolerate" and continue using your product while you validate your assumptions.</p><h2>Minimum Marketable Product, Minimum Remarkable Product, Minimum Launchable Product</h2><p>The what?</p><p>I know, I know. I came across these terms for the first time today while researching to write this post. And I went through the literature so that I can tell you to safely ignore it.</p><p>If you understand and embody the concept of MLP, you don't need to think about any other frameworks or terminologies that you may discover while researching on Google.</p><h2>How to build an MLP for your Micro SaaS idea</h2><p>Alright, let's put aside theory and dive right in.</p><p>Here are the steps you should loosely follow to building an MLP.</p><h4>1. Understand the #1 problem you're trying to solve</h4><p>What's the #1 reason someone would want to use your Micro SaaS product over existing alternatives?</p><p>Is it that existing options have poor UX?&nbsp;Great, create a well designed and easy-to-use product. You'd be surprised to know how often people switch to an easier to use tool, simply because they are fed up of the poor UX that they encounter repeatedly.</p><p>Is it that existing alternatives are very expensive?&nbsp;Carve out a minimum set of features that people are paying a lot of money for and charge 1/10th for your v1 product. This might not work for very large customers, but vast majority of customers who are small or mid-sized are always looking for affordable alternatives.</p><p>It might not just be raw quantum of pricing, but certain companies targeting Enterprise customers have very complicated pricing slabs and tiers that are designed to give their sales person more room. In such a case, coming out with a competitor product which has a simple, easy-to-understand pricing is how you attract customers.</p><p>Are existing alternatives lacking certain features that leaves a subset of users very dissatisfied?&nbsp;Great, your MLP should specifically address that problem by building functionality that attracts these dissatisfied users. Side note - This is perhaps one of the best ways to go about building a new product.</p><p>In all cases, it involves understanding the problem you are solving and the exact reason why someone would use your product.</p><h4>2. Design a simple product that solves the top customer needs satisfactorily</h4><p>Once you have identified the #1 reason, it's time to decide on a feature set for your product that solves your customer's top pain points satisfactorily.</p><p><strong>Let's take an example</strong> - People want to add a feedback tracking tool inside their product, so that they can collect user feedback automatically. However, the existing solutions don't allow them to embed the feedback tracker within their tool.</p><p>That's your entry point into providing value that customers seek, but are not getting as of today.</p><p>Having understood the #1 problem, you also have to understand other requirements that fall under the "minimum" set of things you need to do to build a "loveable" product.</p><p>These could be:</p><ul role="list"><li>existing solutions are all well designed and aesthetically pleasing =&gt;&nbsp;your minimum loveable product needs to be well designed too</li><li>existing solutions are affordably priced with a easy to understand pricing structure =&gt; your MLP also needs a simple pricing structure that's affordable</li></ul><p>In general, you want to analyze your competitors and understand </p><ol start="" role="list"><li>What they are doing well</li><li>What users value from among those things</li></ol><p>In your MLP, you need to cover the intersection of (what they are doing well) x (what users value from among those).</p><h4>3. Set a short timeline for building your MLP</h4><p>No matter what you build, building in isolation for too long is dangerous. The main reason for that is - you get to know too late whether your assumptions about what the user really values are on point or off course.</p><p><strong>"But Preetam, you just told me to build a Minimum Loveable Product. And now you're saying I got to build it quickly?"</strong></p><p>Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.</p><p>Short timeframe depends on what you are building, and the size of your team.</p><p>For example - with SuperLemon (WhatsApp plugin for Shopify), Sankalp and I built a MLP in 2 weeks time.</p><p>How?</p><p>We identified precisely the way we could do better - …</p></div></div>

<h2>C++ Vector</h2>
<p>A <b>vector</b> is a sequence container implementing array that can change in size. Unlike array, the size of a vector changes automatically when elements are appended or deleted. </p>
<p>Vector stores elements in contiguous memory location which enables direct access of any elements using <span>operator []</span>. To support shrink and expand functionality at runtime, vector container may allocate some extra storage. Hence, compared to array, vector requires more memory and in return it manage memory dynamically and efficiently.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>
<div>
<pre>template &lt; class T, class Alloc = allocator&lt;T&gt; &gt; class vector; 
</pre>

<p>Both are APIs for shared-memory programming. In C, OpenMP is a relatively high-level extension, providing compiler directives for parallelizing many programs with ease while some low-level thread interactions may be difficult to program. Pthreads provide some low-level coordination constructs that are unavailable in OpenMP, making other programs easier to parallelize while requiring explicit specification of the behavior of each thread, which may virtually be any that is conceivable.</p>
<p>Pthreads programs can be used with <em>any</em> C compiler, provided the system has a Pthreads library. OpenMP requires compiler support for some operations, which <em>many</em> compilers provide.</p>
<h3 id="area-under-the-curve">Area Under the Curve</h3>
<p>The program we are about to develop is oftentimes called the 'Hello world!' of parallel programming. We will be using the following formula for <cite>arctan(1)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></cite> in approximating the value for π.</p>
<p><span><span><img src="https://hasithsen.github.io/tech/posts/parallelizing-pi-approx-openmp/Leibniz-formula-for-pi.png" alt="Leibniz-formula-for-pi.png"></span><span><span>Just as we learned a long time ago in Kindergarten, the value of the integral here is the area between the graph and the x-axis while x goes from 0 to 1.</span></span></span></p>
<p>Going through the serial version of the program in C, the value for above is calculated for each integer within range <strong>[1, N)</strong> and summed up within a loop. The resulting <strong>sum</strong> is them divided by <strong>N</strong> for getting an estimate of <strong>π / 4</strong>, before printing out the calculated <em>approximate</em> for π.</p>

<p>To compile above with <code>gcc</code>, use following.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">gcc -o &lt;outputname&gt; &lt;filename&gt;.c -f openmp -lm -Wall -g
</code></pre></div><h3 id="modifying-parallelized-code">Modifying Parallelized Code</h3>
<p>Before changing anything, it pays to understand whatever we want changed in the first-place. So, let us go through the above code. The function <code>omp_get_wtime()</code>, defined in <code>omp.h</code>, returns the amount of seconds since a previous <em>fixed</em> point in time (included for execution timing purposes). Setting the number of threads to spawn when running parallel code (code inside parallel scope, that is) done by <code>omp_set_num_threds</code>. Changing the <code>set</code> to <code>get</code> and calling from <em>within</em> a parallel section returns the number of threads in execution (<code>get</code> counterpart is available for most functions with <code>set</code>). However, due to resource constraints on the system, it is possible we ending up with a lower number of threads.</p>
<p>The directive <code>#pragma omp parallel</code> is for parallelizing the code–it is safe to assume if this is not present somewhere, the program will not be parallelized by OpenMP. The scope of code that needs to be executed in parallel may be defined the same way we do scoping in C, with <code>{}</code>, or without–whereas only immediately following code line will be considered in-scope. This is where new threads will be spawned and start running alongside the master thread, branching the execution.</p>
<p>Any variables created within the parallel scope are private for each thread (i.e. <code>sum_thread</code>), and will not contribute to race conditions. Therefore, the <code>for</code> loop incrementing <code>sum_thread</code> is divided among threads spawned. Please note the way threads divide the iterations among themselves can be handled up to some extent with specific directives, the default behavior is expected here by omitting them.</p>
<p>Critical sections may be scoped within <code>#pragma omp atomic</code> or <code>#pragma omp critical</code>. The former enables low level atomicity of execution (with higher performance) if available, and only accepts a single assignment statement (of an allowed form) within scope, while the latter can handle multiple statements. Both effectively serializes execution. If we end up with most of the code within the scope of either, our code is probably too poor for parallelization with OpenMP.</p>
<p>Outside the <code>#pragma omp parallel</code> scope, previously spawned threads will join the master thread, and it will continue executing similar to a serial program. It is worth mentioning that we may have as many parallel/serial sections as we please.</p>
<p>As should be apparent from above, OpenMP is designed to be easy to learn and can be used for parallelizing existing serial code with minimal modifications. What if we could further simplify the above code?</p>
<h3 id="reducing-the-parallel-code">Reducing the Parallel Code</h3>
<p>Modifying the <code>sum</code> variable at the end of the <code>for</code> loop in above code could be simplified with a reduction operation provided by OpenMP. That is, we can instruct OpenMP to synchronously add the <em>local sum</em> calculated by each thread (within loop) to the shared variable <code>sum</code> as shown in the parallel version below.</p>

<p>Here, we have a single statement <code>#pragma omp parallel for</code> that tells we want the immediately-following <code>for</code> loop parallelized, which is identical to having <code>#pragma omp for</code> immediately before a <code>for</code> loop <em>within</em> the scope of <code>#pragma omp parallel</code>. The <code>reduction(+:sum)</code> tells that we want the <code>sum</code> variable to contain the <em>sum</em> of each local sum calculated in each iteration only available locally to the thread that runs it. OpenMP does this by creating a private <em>sum</em> variable for each thread and initializing it to <strong>unit</strong> according to the operation (ex. <strong>0</strong> for <code>+</code>, <strong>1</strong> for <code>*</code>), this is how we use the <strong>reduction operator</strong> in OpenMP. The <code>shared(N)</code> tells that the <code>N</code> variable should be shared with all threads, this is fine since threads are only reading it–therefore no potential data races. Finally, the approximated values along with the time taken for calculations are printed.</p>
<p>Now that we went through the code, note that the  <code>omp_set_num_threads</code> is not mandatory when using OpenMP, the program defaults to spawning the maximum number of threads possible on the system at execution time.

      <p>The social sciences have witnessed a dramatic shift in the last 25 years. Rigorous research designs have drastically improved the credibility of research findings. However, while research designs have improved, less progress has been made in relating experimental findings to the views of the broader scientific community and policy-makers. Individual researchers have begun to gather predictions about the effects they might find in their studies, as this information can be helpful in interpreting research results. Still, we could learn more from predictions if they were elicited in a coordinated, systematic way.</p>
<p>This prediction platform will allow for the systematic collection and assessment of expert forecasts of the effects of untested social programs. In turn, this should help both policy makers and social scientists by improving the accuracy of forecasts, allowing for more effective decision-making and improving experimental design and analysis.</p>

<div>
<h3>Measuring and improving the accuracy of forecasts</h3>
<p>Collecting and evaluating a body of priors across members of an expert community can expose whether and how predictions are systematically biased or inaccurate, and can allow us to explore adjustments or corrections that yield more reliable forecasts. It can similarly allow us to identify circumstances that affect the accuracy of predictions and superforecasters, guiding the improvement of the accuracy of future forecasts.</p>
<p>Improving the accuracy of forecasts and identifying consistently accurate forecasters will be particularly valuable to policy makers who often must rely on expert predictions and scientific consensus when considering policy options, and particularly when investment decisions must be made in the absence of RCTs or other rigorous evidence. Many policy analysts already make and use predictions informally and could benefit from infrastructure that standardizes the sourcing and cataloguing of knowledge, similar to how the American Economic Association has systematized registration with the RCT Registry. If forecasts and their accuracy are tracked over time, they can also be combined with newer or crowdsourced predictions, giving more weight to those of superforecasters, to weed out interventions with a lower likelihood of success. There is clear demand from research organizations and funders for this kind of standardization.</p>
</div>


<div>
<h3>Mitigating publication bias</h3>
<p>In cases where null results are known to have been unexpected, we can treat them not as null results, but as rejecting previously held priors. We propose to use ex ante priors, such as the mean or median forecast, as an alternative hypothesis against which to test experimental results. Importantly, forecasts will need to be collected ex ante, given that it is all too easy to rationalize any result ex post (hindsight bias).</p>
</div>




<div>
<h3>Improving experimental design</h3>
<p>The collection of priors, much like pre-analysis plans, focuses attention on the hypotheses to be tested and helps to highlight which research questions have the highest value. It can also improve the efficiency of research by allowing for a more optimal allocation of participants across treatment arms or by focusing attention on those outcome variables for which more data would have the highest value of information.		</p>

 </p> <p>Class&nbsp;A Common Stock </p> <center>
</center> <p>This is the initial public
offering of shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock of Roblox Corporation. </p> <p>We are offering to sell
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock in this offering. The selling stockholders identified in this prospectus are offering to sell an additional
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares being sold by the selling stockholders. </p>
<p>We have two classes of authorized common stock, Class&nbsp;A common stock and Class&nbsp;B common stock. The rights of the holders of Class&nbsp;A common
stock and Class&nbsp;B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting and conversion. Each share of Class&nbsp;A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class&nbsp;B common stock is entitled to twenty votes per share
and is convertible at any time into one share of Class&nbsp;A common stock. Following this offering, entities affiliated with David Baszucki, our Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chair of our board of directors will hold all
outstanding shares of our Class&nbsp;B common stock representing approximately &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. As a result, Mr.&nbsp;Baszucki will be able to significantly influence any action
requiring the approval of our stockholders, including the election of our board of directors, the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the approval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all
of our assets or other major corporate transaction. Also as a result, we believe we are eligible for, but do not intend to take advantage of, the “controlled company” exemption to the corporate governance rules for New York Stock
Exchange-listed companies. </p> <p>Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our Class&nbsp;A common stock. It is currently estimated that
the initial public offering price per share will be between $&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and $&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. We intend to apply to list our Class&nbsp;A common stock on the New York Stock
Exchange under the symbol “RBLX.” </p> <p>We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of
2012 and, as such, we have elected to comply with certain reduced public company reporting requirements for this prospectus and may elect to do so in future filings. </p> <center>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="https://zapier.com/how-it-works">Zapier</a> is a no-code workflow automation tool that can be used to integrate apps and make them work together. I have been using Zapier for a bunch of my side projects and it was been pretty useful to hook up services like Stripe with Gmail. However, I recently started hitting their <a href="https://zapier.com/pricing">free tier limits</a> and started exploring the possibility of building a simple Zapier alternative, mostly for fun.</p>
<p>The requirements that I came up with :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Completely serverless</strong>: I don’t want to manage any infrastructure</li>
<li><strong>(almost) Free</strong>: It should cost close to $0 for my use-case which I will talk about below.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-step workflows</strong>: Currently, Zapier’s free tier only lets you perform one action for a particular trigger. I wanted the ability to perform multiple actions (for e.g. send an email and a slack message) for a particular trigger.</li>
<li><strong>Webhooks support</strong>: I’m a big fan of <a href="https://zapier.com/page/webhooks/">Zapier’s webhooks</a> functionality and want to replicate that.</li>
<li><strong>Polling-based workflows</strong>: Ability to poll an API endpoint and take action if there is new data available</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The following section will provide an overview of the system based on the requirements we came up with.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-workflow">What is a workflow?</h3>
<p>A workflow can be defined as a Trigger and a series of actions that are taken as a result of the Trigger. The trigger can be based on webhooks or polling.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/workflow.png" alt="/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/workflow.png"></p>
<p>There are various ways to model a workflow. Some of the most common ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Using code</strong>: In a system like <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/">Airflow</a>, a workflow (called a DAG) is defined in Python using Airflow specific abstractions.</li>
<li><strong>Using config files</strong>: A workflow engine like <a href="https://argoproj.github.io/projects/argo/">Argo</a>, which is built on top of Kubernetes, uses YAML to define workflows.</li>
</ul>
<p>To keep our system simple, we will define our workflows using JSON. JSON is natively supported in Python (my language of choice) along with many other programming languages.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-trigger">What is a Trigger?</h3>
<p>A trigger is the root node of a workflow. We will support two types of triggers in our system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Webhooks</strong>: The workflow will expose a webhook that can be used to initiate this particular workflow. The webhook will accept POST requests.</li>
<li><strong>Polling:</strong> The workflow will specify an API endpoint which will be polled at a regular interval. If new data is available, then specified actions will be run</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-is-an-action">What is an Action?</h3>
<p>An action is performed as a result of a workflow being triggered. We will support two types of actions in our system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Email</strong>: Send an email with the data coming from the trigger</li>
<li><strong>Slack</strong>: Send a slack message with the data coming from the trigger.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="designing-the-system">Designing the system</h2>
<p>In the following section, we will take a look at the various services we will be using to build the system based on our requirements.</p>
<h3 id="creating-webhooks">Creating Webhooks</h3>
<p>Since one of the main requirements for the system is to be serverless, we will leverage API Gateway and Lambda to support webhooks. API Gateway will create a single endpoint that we can use to send webhooks and we will do the filtering in our Lambda function.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/webhooks.png" alt="/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/webhooks.png"></p>
<h3 id="supporting-polling-based-triggers">Supporting Polling-based Triggers</h3>
<p>Polling triggers are slightly more involved. The system comprises of the following parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/services-cloudwatchevents-expressions.html">Lambda function scheduled</a> at a regular frequency. This lambda function will go through all the workflows that are polling-based and put them in an SQS queue. The benefit of decoupling the scheduling of the workflow from the processing of the workflow is that we will be communicating with external services that could be unreliable. If there is a failure, we want to isolate it to a particular workflow.</li>
<li>Lambda function which gets triggered whenever there is a new workflow has been enqueued. This function is responsible for executing the trigger i.e. querying the API endpoint and checking if there is any new data available.</li>
</ul>

<p>We only want to execute our actions for the polling-based workflows when there is new data. To support this, we will use a de-duplication identifier similar to <a href="https://zapier.com/help/create/basics/data-deduplication-in-zaps">Zapier</a>. We will use DynamoDB to store the identifiers we have already processed for a particular workflow. Since our data model is pretty straightforward, DynamoDB is a good fit for us.</p>

<h3 id="performing-actions">Performing Actions</h3>
<p>Since we want to support workflows where a single trigger could lead to multiple actions, we will use SQS to decouple the trigger from the action.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lambda function which processes the trigger and if there are any actions to run, enqueue them to SQS.</li>
<li>Lambda function which runs the actions as a result of messages being enqueued to S3.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the benefits of this architecture are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actions are isolated from each other. If one action fails, other actions won’t be affected. We could even use a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-dead-letter-queues.html">Dead-Letter queue</a> to debug and process failed actions.</li>
<li>Trigger and action are decoupled. Since there could be multiple actions that could take a variable amount of time, processing everything in a single Lambda function could lead to Lambda timeouts.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cost">Cost</h2>
<p>Now that we have a rough idea of how to build such a system, let’s look at what it will potentially cost us. I came up with a rough estimate of how this system would be used based on my current usage of Zapier:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Run 5 workflows</strong>: 3 of them are webhooks based, the rest are polling-based. For simplicity, let’s assume each of these workflows have 2 actions.</li>
<li>The webhooks based workflows are triggered roughly 10 times a day. Thus, the total number of webhooks-based workflow executions would be <strong>30/day</strong>.</li>
<li>The polling workflows would run once <strong>every 12 hours</strong> and they would check for any new data in the API endpoints.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, let’s look at the pricing of the various AWS services we are planning to use.</p>
<h3 id="aws-lambda">AWS Lambda</h3>
<p>AWS Lambda has a pretty generous free tier which includes 1M free requests per month and 400,000 GB-seconds of compute time per month.</p>
<p>These are the Lambda functions that we currently have in the system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Webhooks: This function accepts any incoming webhooks and if a matching workflow exists, enqueues downstream tasks to SQS.</li>
<li>Polling Trigger: There are two lambda functions to support polling triggers. The first one runs once every 12 hours and enqueues any poll-based workflows whereas the second function runs once for each poll-based workflow and checks if any new data is available.</li>
<li>Actions: We run one Lambda function for every action in a workflow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on our previous assumptions of usage, the number of Lambda requests we would have every month are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Webhooks: 30 requests / day * 2 actions / workflow = 60 / day = 1800 / month</li>
<li>Polling: 2 requests / day + 2 workflows * 2 actions / workflow = 6 / day = 180 / month</li>
</ul>
<p>For the sake of simplicity, we can assume that our Lambda functions on average run for 30 seconds (probably much lower than this) and they take 1024 MB of memory.</p>
<p>Using these assumptions, our total compute will be (1024 MB * 30s * 1880 request) / 1024 = 56400 GB-seconds per month. We are under the free tier limit on Lambda.</p>
<p>Cost for Lambda (using free tier): <strong>$0 / month</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/Untitled.png" alt="/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/Untitled.png"></p>
<p>Cost for Lambda (assuming we aren’t eligible for the free tier): $0.20 + <strong>56400 * $0.0000166667 = $ 1.14 / month</strong></p>
<h3 id="sqs">SQS</h3>
<p>Similar to Lambda, SQS also has a pretty generous free tier. The first 1 million monthly requests are free. Every API action counts as a request.</p>
<p>A rough estimate of the number of requests we would make to SQS are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Webhooks: For every webhooks request we get, we would enqueue the actions for the workflow to SQS. Then, Lambda functions which execute the actions would dequeue these actions and run them.</li>
<li>Polling-based: Every time a polling-based workflow is scheduled, we would first enqueue all the polling-based workflows into SQS. Then, a Lambda function would dequeue these workflows and then enqueue any actions in these workflows to a different SQS queue which would eventually get dequeued by the Lambda function which runs the actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the description above, the number of SQS requests we would make are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Webhooks: 30 requests / day * 2 actions / workflow (enqueued) * 2 actions / workflow (dequeued) = 120 requests / day = 3600 requests / month</li>
<li>Polling-based: 2 requests / day * 2 polling-based workflows (enqueued) * 2 polling-based workflows (dequeued) * 2 actions / workflow (enqueued) * 2 actions / workflow (dequeued) = 32 requests / day = 960 requests / month</li>
</ul>
<p>Total number of requests to SQS in a month: ~5000 requests / month</p>
<p>Cost for SQS (regardless of tier): <strong>$0 / month</strong></p>
<h3 id="api-gateway">API Gateway</h3>
<p>The API Gateway will only be used by our webhooks workflows. Based on our assumptions above, we will make roughly 900 requests/month to our API Gateway.</p>
<p>Cost for API Gateway: <strong>~$0 / month</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/Untitled%201.png" alt="/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/Untitled%201.png"></p>
<h3 id="dynamodb">DynamoDB</h3>
<p>DynamoDB has the most complicated pricing model out of all the services we are planning to use. More details about pricing is available <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/pricing/">here</a>.</p>
<p>We will be using DynamoDB only for polling-based workflows to ensure we can deduplicate any data.</p>
<p>The schema for our table would look like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span>
    <span># primary_key
</span>    <span>"workflow_id"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>"S"</span><span>:</span> <span>"my_workflow"</span>
    <span>},</span>
    <span>"processed_keys"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>"SS"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span><span>"1234"</span><span>,</span> <span>"1235"</span><span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<ul>
<li>Primary key would be the name of the particular workflow</li>
<li>We would also store the set of processed unique identifiers for the data. For the sake of simplicity, we can assume these identifiers would be approximately <strong>10 characters</strong> in length.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on our usage model, we expect to make the following requests to DynamoDB:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Read requests</strong>: 2 polling workflows * 2 triggers / day * 1 read request = 4 requests/day or 120 requests/month</li>
<li><strong>Write requests</strong>: A Write request would only be made when there is new data available in the API. Let’s assume we will have new data every time the workflow is triggered: 4 requests/day or 120 requests/month.</li>
</ul>
<p>I used this pricing calculator for DynamoDB and used conservative estimates that we calculated above.</p>
<p>Cost for Dynamo: ~<strong>0.50 / month</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/Untitled%202.png" alt="/assets/img/serverless-workflow-automation/Untitled%202.png"></p>
<h3 id="total-cost">Total Cost</h3>
<p>If we assume that we are within the limits of the free tier usage for Lambda and SQS, this system will cost us ~<strong>$0.50 / month.</strong></p>
<p>If we include the cost for Lambda, our system will cost us <strong>~$1.64 / month</strong>.</p></div></div>

<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25174048">Hacker News discussion.</a></p>
<hr>
<p>This week's post is about Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html">bisect</a> module. You will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_binning">Statistical data binning</a> with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.bisect">bisect.bisect</a>.</li>
<li>Adding new data to a sorted list with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.insort">bisect.insort</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html">bisect</a> module is to allow you to efficiently search and
update sorted lists. To this end, it provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">binary search</a> implementation, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.bisect">bisect.bisect</a>.</li>
<li>An "insert" -- as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort">insertion sort</a> -- implementation, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.insort">bisect.insort</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_binning">statistical data binning</a>, you have data that you want to group into "bins". E.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>You have data on different fruits and want to group "lemon" and "orange" into
"citrus".</li>
<li>You have data on students' grades and want to group scores between 80 and 90
into "B", scores between 90 and 100 into "A", etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>To me, a straightforward approach is to write a function that computes the bin.
E.g., binning fruits:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>def bin_fruit(fruit):
    if fruit in ["lemon", "orange"]:
        return "citrus"
    elif fruit in ["apple", "pear"]:
        return "malinae"


import random

data = random.choices(
    ["lemon", "orange", "apple", "pear"], k=10
)
data
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>['lemon',
 'lemon',
 'apple',
 'apple',
 'apple',
 'lemon',
 'apple',
 'apple',
 'lemon',
 'pear']
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[bin_fruit(x) for x in data]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>['citrus',
 'citrus',
 'malinae',
 'malinae',
 'malinae',
 'citrus',
 'malinae',
 'malinae',
 'citrus',
 'malinae']
</code></pre>
<p>E.g., turning test scores into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_grading_in_the_United_States">letter grades</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>def bin_score(score):
    if 90 &lt;= score &lt;= 100:
        return "A"
    elif 80 &lt;= score &lt; 90:
        return "B"
    elif 70 &lt;= score &lt; 80:
        return "C"
    elif 60 &lt;= score &lt; 70:
        return "D"
    elif score &lt; 60:
        return "F"


import random

data = [random.randint(50, 100) for _ in range(10)]
data
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>[78, 87, 93, 78, 53, 92, 64, 70, 75, 60]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[bin_score(x) for x in data]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>['C', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'F', 'A', 'D', 'C', 'C', 'D']
</code></pre>
<p>For a dataset of <var>n</var> records and <var>m</var> bins, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time
complexity</a> of this approach tends to be</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation">O</a>(<var>m</var><var>n</var>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because binning one record takes O(<var>m</var>) time -- O(<var>m</var>)
if-statements are checked -- and <var>n</var> records need to be binned.</p>
<p>If the number of bins <var>m</var> is constant, then the overall time
complexity is simply O(<var>n</var>).</p>
<p>But what if the number of bins <var>m</var> is large enough that the
straightforward approach is too slow?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_or_discrete_variable">discrete data</a>, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict">dictionaries</a>. E.g., binning
fruits:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>bins = {
    "lemon": "citrus",
    "orange": "citrus",
    "apple": "malinae",
    "pear": "malinae",
}

def bin_fruit(fruit):
    return bins[fruit]


import random

data = random.choices(
    ["lemon", "orange", "apple", "pear"], k=10
)
data
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>['lemon',
 'pear',
 'lemon',
 'lemon',
 'apple',
 'orange',
 'apple',
 'orange',
 'pear',
 'apple']
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[bin_fruit(x) for x in data]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>['citrus',
 'malinae',
 'citrus',
 'citrus',
 'malinae',
 'citrus',
 'malinae',
 'citrus',
 'malinae',
 'malinae']
</code></pre>
<p>Binning one record this way takes O(1) time -- regardless of the number of
bins <var>m</var> -- because <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict">dictionaries</a> are implemented using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">hash tables</a>. And creating the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict">dictionary</a> take O(<var>m</var>) time --
one entry for each bin. Thus, the overall time complexity, for <var>n</var>
records and <var>m</var> bins, is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O(<var>m</var> + <var>n</var>).</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>And, for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_or_discrete_variable">continuous data</a>, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.bisect">bisect.bisect</a>. E.g., turning
test scores into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_grading_in_the_United_States">letter grades</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>score_bins = [60, 70, 80, 90]
score_letters = ["F", "D", "C", "B", "A"]

import bisect


def bin_score(score):
    i = bisect.bisect(score_bins, score)
    return score_letters[i]


import random

data = [random.randint(50, 100) for _ in range(10)]
data
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>[60, 100, 88, 98, 55, 52, 52, 94, 71, 85]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[bin_score(x) for x in data]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>['D', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'A', 'C', 'B']
</code></pre>
<p>Binning one record this way takes O(logÂ&nbsp;<var>m</var>) time, because
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.bisect">bisect.bisect</a> uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">binary search</a> to navigate <code>score_bins</code>. And
creating <code>score_bins</code> takes O(<var>m</var>) time. Thus, the overall time
complexity, for <var>n</var> records and <var>m</var> bins, is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O(<var>m</var> + <var>n</var> log <var>m</var>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>NOTE: If you are able to use 3rd-party libraries, such as <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a> or
<a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a>, then look at these functions: <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.digitize.html">numpy.digitize</a>,
<a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.searchsorted.html#numpy.searchsorted">numpy.searchsorted</a>, <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.searchsorted.html">pandas.Series.searchsorted</a>, <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.qcut.html#pandas.qcut">pandas.qcut</a>,
<a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.cut.html">pandas.cut</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In this scenario, you have a sorted list of data and you want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_statistic">order statistics</a> (e.g. compute the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median">median</a>).</li>
<li>Add new data.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, you can imagine having a temperature sensor that regularly reports
the temperature. You want to regularly report the median temperature, as well
as be able to incorporate new temperature data as it arrives.</p>
<p>To me, a straightforward approach is to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mutable-sequence-types">list.append</a> and
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.median">statistics.median</a>. E.g., monitoring temperatures:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>def add_new_measurement(data, temperature):
    data.append(temperature)


def median(data):
    return statistics.median(data)


import random
import statistics

data = [random.randint(93, 100) for _ in range(10)]
data
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>[98, 94, 97, 94, 94, 98, 98, 94, 94, 95]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>median(data)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>94.5
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>add_new_measurement(data, 97)
data
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>[98, 94, 97, 94, 94, 98, 98, 94, 94, 95, 97]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>median(data)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>95
</code></pre>
<p>For a dataset of <var>n</var> records, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time complexity</a> of this approach
tends to be</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Computing median:</strong> O(<var>n</var>) or O(<var>n</var> log <var>n</var>) --
depending on how the median is computed.</li>
<li><strong>Adding new data:</strong> O(1).</li>
</ul>
<p>So if the workload requires frequently adding new data and infrequently
computing the median, this approach works well.</p>
<p>But what if the workload is inverted? For example, if temperature measurements
are received every couple of minutes, but the median must be computed every
couple of seconds.</p>
<p>In that scenario, I think we would be better suited by speeding up computing
the median, even at the expense of slowing down adding new data.</p>
<p>Computing order statistics can be done in O(1) time if the data is already
sorted. So a straightforward way to handle this workload would be to sort the
data after appending and use the fact that the data is sorted to efficiently
compute the median:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>def add_new_measurement(data, temperature):
    data.append(temperature)
    data.sort()


def median(data):
    n = len(data)
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return (data[(n // 2) - 1] + data[n // 2]) / 2
    else:
        return data[n // 2]


import random

data = sorted(random.randint(93, 100) for _ in range(10))
data
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>[93, 94, 94, 96, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 100]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>median(data)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>96.5
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>add_new_measurement(data, 97)
data
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>[93, 94, 94, 96, 96, 97, 97, 98, 99, 100, 100]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>median(data)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>97
</code></pre>
<p>For a dataset of <var>n</var> records, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time complexity</a> of this approach
tends to be</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Computing median:</strong> O(1).</li>
<li><strong>Adding new data:</strong> O(<var>n</var> log <var>n</var>).</li>
</ul>
<p>But I think that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time complexity</a> for adding new data can further be
improved by using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.insort">bisect.insort</a>, which runs in</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O(<var>n</var>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's Python code that does that:</p>
<pre><code>import bisect


def add_new_measurement(data, temperature):
    bisect.insort(data, temperature)
</code></pre>
<p>Doing this changes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time complexity</a> of adding new data from</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O(<var>n</var> log <var>n</var>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O(<var>n</var>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this week's post you learned how to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html">bisect</a> module for
statistical data binning and adding new data to sorted lists.</p>
<p>For further reading:</p>
<ul>
<li>Algorithms that process input piece-by-piece -- like the temperature sensor
scenario -- are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_algorithm">online algorithms</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.insort">bisect.insort</a> can be used to implement an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort">Insertion sort</a>. Insertion
sort is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_algorithm">online algorithm</a> and -- along with Python's built-in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort">timsort</a> -- is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_sort">adaptive sorting algorithm</a> because it takes
advantage of data that is partially sorted.</li>
</ul>
<p>My challenge to you:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <section id="main_content">
        

<p>Some days back I assembled a top of the line(ish) workstation for working on hobby projects and gaming. I bought the latest and greatest processor (Ryzen 3900x - 12 Core 24 Threads) from AMD and 32 GB of RAM for a no-compromises experience. I assembled the PC and it was blazing fast. I configured the system to run Windows and Linux (PopOS) using dual booting. I already had an SSD from a previous build that had the Linux OS installed and configured. I had my Twitter crawls set up on it and other services set up and working on it. I used Linux for Productivity and Windows mostly gaming as is the custom.</p>

<p>After some time, I realized this arrangement came with a very obvious drawback. Whenever I used to game, my Twitter crawls and other services in Linux, were effectively shut down. To solve this issue, I changed the boot order to set the Linux OS to boot by default. Even then, I wasn’t ready to accept this tradeoff when I had a processor that was more than capable of handling both of these OSes at the same time. If I were to somehow manage, to virtualize the existing Linux installation I had, the CPU I bought wouldn’t even break sweat handling both my OSes at the same time. I am also lazy and found it very hard to switch off a running OS and switch to the other one frequently. I just wanted to reduce my overhead.</p>

<p>So summarizing the above, I wanted to boot the already existing Linux installation I had on a different SSD as a guest VM in windows. I already had a Windows 10 Professional version so, the choice of hypervisor was easy, as this particular version of Windows comes with Hyper-V. The challenge here is booting from an actual hard disk instead of a virtual hard disk. The problems with the above approach are</p>

<ol>
  <li>Passthrough the hard disk (having Linux installation) directly to the VM</li>
  <li>Boot from this hard disk by using virtualized GRUB media</li>
  <li>Solve other issues for smooth operation</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="enabling-virtualization-and-hyperv">Enabling virtualization and HyperV</h2>

<p>The first step in this process is to activate Virtualization features from the BIOS and enable it in Windows. In my case, it was a simple setting in BIOS called Secure Virtual Machine Mode (SVM) which when enabled allows you to use HyperV in Windows. Enabling HyperV in Windows is then straight forward. Follow the below steps to activate HyperV.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Search Windows Features in the Windows search bar.</li>
  <li>Click the checkbox near Hyper-V. Press OK and you should be done.</li>
  <li>Windows will restart once to enable this feature.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://bagdeabhishek.github.io/images/enableHV.PNG" alt="EnableHyperV"></p>

<h2 id="passing-through-the-ssd-to-vm">Passing through the SSD to VM</h2>
<p>The next challenge here is to make sure the actual media (SSD in my case) is passed through without interference to the VM we create. You have to make sure Windows is not using this media and forwards it cleanly to our target VM.</p>
<h3 id="make-the-device-offline-in-windows">Make the device offline in Windows</h3>
<p>To make sure that the media we are passing to the new VM is not being used by the host OS, we need to make sure the disk is offline. You can do that by doing the following steps.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the Disk Management tool by searching for it in the Windows search bar.</li>
  <li>All your disks should appear at the bottom along with all the partitions in the bottom.</li>
  <li>Go to the Linux media you want to forward (the drive which has Linux installed on it) and left-click on it. You’ll get an option to make this device offline, click on it. Now the disk should be offline and the UI should be reflecting the change.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://bagdeabhishek.github.io/images/offlineHDD.PNG" alt="offlineHDD"></p>

<h3 id="create-a-vm-using-hyperv">Create a VM using HyperV</h3>
<p>Once you complete the above step, you need to create a VM using HyperV. Go to HyperV Manager and create a new VM. Create a new VM with all the necessary configurations like memory and CPU cores. While creating a new VM make sure that you select generation 2 (No specific reason just seems newer and better suited to me) in the Specify Generation section and in the Connect Virtual Hard disk section select the “Attach a Virtual Hard disk later” option. Once you do that your VM should be created. To mount our Linux media and make sure we can boot to it we need to do a device passthrough to the VM.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to the settings of the newly created VM, under the SCSI controller section you need to add a Hard disk.</li>
  <li>In the media section your Linux HDD should show up under the Physical Hard disk section. Select the Hard disk and click apply.</li>
  <li>Mount any other disks if needed.</li>
  <li>Download the SuperGrub 2 disk image from <a href="https://www.supergrubdisk.org/super-grub2-disk/">here</a></li>
  <li>In the DVD drive under the SCSI section select the recently downloaded ISO as an image file. 
<img src="https://bagdeabhishek.github.io/images/HDD.PNG" alt="VMHDDConfiguration"></li>
</ol>

<p>SuperGrub2 helps us to solve the issue of not finding the GRUB partition as we are booting in a VM. We use SuperGrub2 to boot into our Linux install.</p>

<p>Once you are done, keep the DVD drive boot priority highest.</p>

<h2 id="disable-snapshots">Disable Snapshots</h2>

<p>HyperV won’t allow you to boot the created VM as the HyperV Manager cannot create a snapshot. This is because our installation media is an actual HDD instead of a virtual one. You can disable Snapshotting by going to the VM settings -&gt; Management -&gt; Checkpoints and deselect the “Enable Checkpoints” check box.</p>

<h2 id="boot-into-the-linux-vm">Boot into the Linux VM</h2>

<p>Once you are done with the above steps you can spin up the VM and you should be able to boot into the SuperGrub Menu. In this menu select the “Detect and show boot methods” entry.</p>

<p><img src="https://bagdeabhishek.github.io/dualbootasVM/imagesgrub.PNG" alt="superGrub"></p>

<p>You should then be able to select your Linux version and be able to boot into it.</p>

<h2 id="configure-the-display-driver">Configure the display driver</h2>
<p>If you were using Nvidia proprietary drivers on the existing Linux installation you’ll need to remove them. Once you do that you need to install the xserver-xorg-video-fbdev package to make xorg server work.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>apt-get <span>install </span>xserver-xorg-video-fbdev 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I also added an x11 configuration file which might or might not have helped. Adding it just in case this might help someone. Create a new file /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/30-hyperv.conf and add the below snippet to it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Section <span>"Device"</span>
 Identifier <span>"HYPER_V Framebuffer"</span>
 Driver <span>"fbdev"</span>
EndSection
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I wasn’t able to boot into the GUI (though CLI is still accessible) without the above fixes. Once you do that and reboot you should be able to boot into the Linux GUI.</p>



<p>Congratulations! you now have a Virtualized version of your Linux Installation which can be accessed inside your Windows OS. The advantage of this approach is you can still normally boot into the Linux OS and all your changes are consistent across both VM and the actual Linux system as the media is the same. The only problem I can see is enabling GPU drivers. In the future maybe I can dynamically switch the display drivers based on the context.</p>

<p>This method also won’t work if your Linux install exists on the same Hard disk. I feel in that case just converting the whole partition to a VHDX file would be easier. This method has its own drawbacks like the data won’t be consistent across both instances.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><h3>November 21, 2020</h3><h3>7 min read</h3></p><hr><p>Technical mechanisms for building trust do help people trust systems - the rise of e-commerce sites and in particular sharing economies is in large part due to the mechanisms the platforms use to address trust concerns between the two parties. However, these trust mechanisms break down if the users feel there is a lack of transparency, or if they feel the system is no longer acting in their best interests.</p><p>Whenever two parties participate in a transaction, each party must <strong>trust</strong> that the other party will uphold their side of the bargain. However these transactions are often made on the basis of <strong>incomplete information</strong> about the other party. Trust mechanisms are used to provide signals about the other party to reduce the asymmetry of information. Platforms use trust mechanisms to reduce users’ risk.</p><p>For example, Apple’s security and review mechanisms around the App Store facilitates the installation of third-party iOS applications. The vetting of apps submitted to the App Store signals a minimum level of quality, whilst the sandboxing of apps when run guarantees the security of the user. This means that users no longer have to rely on whether a third-party vendor was reliable. Their trust in Apple, the platform provider, means they are willing to install third-party apps from vendors they haven’t heard of.</p><p>The most prominent example of a trust mechanism is a ratings or review system. <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/journals/auk/26/1/article-p185.pdf">Apps and online products are a “market of lemons”</a> as, aside from the brands with existing reputations, customers cannot distinguish the quality of products. Customers therefore do not trust the system, as they anticipate sellers could profit from selling low-quality cheap items (“lemons”). Ratings and reviews serve to filter out the “lemons” in the market, and emulate word-of-mouth networks to increase trust amongst users. The market forces now disincentivise lemons as deceitful sellers’ short-term gains are outweighed by the long-term loss of reputation.</p><p>Amazon’s recommender systems achieve a similar result: here the platform (the institution) filters out low-quality items, and ranks the products in order of relevance to the user, rather than the user having to sift through reviews. These ratings and recommender mechanisms have a ripple effect in terms of trust over the entire system. Zhao et al. show that buyers’ trust in these institutional mechanisms <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969698918309445">“engender trust, not only in a few reputable sellers, but also in the entire community of sellers”</a>.</p><p>Trust mechanisms play an even bigger role in sharing economies, such as Airbnb and Uber, where the level of trust required between consumers and providers on the platforms is especially high, as sharing economies offer services not products. Services are <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261517716300127">“intangible goods [whose] quality cannot be verified”</a>, and offer additional risks (not just monetary), for example a reckless Uber driver could endanger the passenger. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299812647_Trust_in_the_Sharing_Economy">Hawlitschek et al describe that trust is composed of 3Ps</a> - peer, platform (and product) – which “positively influence consuming (and supplying) intention”. Airbnb ensures trust in the platform through dependability - maintaining a high system quality. In order to get consumers to trust the providers, Airbnb shows the person behind the service, by getting hosts to upload photos and show the guests the living space. The photo also acts as a means of identity verification. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261517716300127">Ert et al</a> argue that this “visual-based trust” affects the consumers’ perception of hosts as much as previous ratings. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Who-Can-You-Trust-Technology/dp/024129617X">Botsman</a> describes how Airbnb and Uber’s rating mechanisms facilitate a notion of distributed trust between users of the platform. Two-sided reviews incentivise good behaviour for both consumers and providers, since users have a reputation to preserve, as the ratings affect future interactions on the platform. Whilst there is potential for users to game the system, these platforms have mechanisms in place to mitigate against these. Airbnb has double-blind reviews to prevent guests and hosts from writing retaliatory reviews. Finally, Airbnb offers payment protection for the consumer, and insurance protection for the host, reducing their financial risk. <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/46521973.pdf">Möhlemann</a> finds that (as with e-commerce sites) this protection, simultaneous reviews and large network increased the trust in the platform provider, and this trickled down to increased trust in the peers.</p><p>Trust mechanisms aren’t perfect however, as bad actors can manipulate the trust mechanisms by posting false reviews, especially when the seller is new to the market and doesn’t have a reputation to preserve. Which? found that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawoollacott/2019/04/16/amazons-fake-review-problem-is-getting-worse/?sh=44c86c68195f">almost 90% of 12,000 reviews for headphone products were from unverified consumers.</a> Even good actors can bias the ratings mechanism upwards, as they fear the threat of retaliatory feedback, leading to inflation of reviews. These mechanisms aren’t just manipulated by users of a platform but the platform itself - treating the trust mechanism as a public good, Amazon can <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/smj.2932">free-ride off third-party sellers and use the ratings to determine which product categories are successful</a>, and enter them themselves.</p><p>More concerning side effects of trust mechanisms include discrimination. Airbnb’s policy of requiring hosts and guests to upload photos has led to a <a href="https://archive.thinkprogress.org/Airbnb-changes-photo-policy-combat-racial-discrimination-4f71c375553a/">“dizzying array of stories” about racial bias exhibited by hosts</a>, violating the Civil Rights Act of 1964: Title II – Public Accommodation. Here, the issue is that in the process of attempting to build trust, the trust mechanism revealed protected characteristics (race, gender) of the users of the platform, opening the platform up to discrimination. <a href="https://www.thespec.com/news/world/2016/09/08/airbnb-makes-changes-to-halt-racist-discriminatory-practices.html">Airbnb has since addressed this with an updated anti-discrimination policy</a>, which was praised for its speed and transparency by the CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.</p><p>In the case of Uber, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08579">Hanrahan et al.</a> found that the ratings mechanism used was too crude and lacked a “human in the loop to impart a level of flexibility or subjectivity to the process” and that the rating system failed to capture the nuance and reasoning behind a poor review. They argue that the digital infrastructure powering the Uber platform potentially reinforces and propagates the sociodemographic biases present in users, and these poor ratings assigned to drivers go on to affect future service requests. However, the key difference between Airbnb and Uber was the lack of transparency regarding the rating system. This led to suspicion amongst drivers of racial bias and a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/10/26/927851281/uber-fires-drivers-based-on-racially-biased-star-rating-system-lawsuit-claims">lawsuit filed against Uber for racial discrimination</a> regarding the firing of minority drivers with low ratings. The ratings mechanism in this scenario propagated mistrust, as frustrated drivers posted retaliatory poor ratings for passengers.</p><p>The lack of transparency in the ratings system also belies a lack of accountability, which fosters mistrust in the system. This is a pattern that has permeated more broadly in tech companies. The <a href="https://www.edelman.com/research/2019-trust-tech-wavering-companies-must-act">Edelman Trust Barometer Survey</a> found that consumers “report high levels of “weak trust,” which means while they remain trusting, they do so with significant misgivings”. The survey further states that only 39 percent of respondents in developed markets believe tech is putting the welfare of its customers ahead of profits.</p><p>Herein lie the limitations of technical mechanisms in fostering trust in a system. <a href="https://people.wku.edu/richard.miller/Mayer%20Trust%20article.pdf">Mayer et al. state that organisational trust is composed of three factors</a>: <strong>ability</strong> (the capability of a trustee to accomplish a trust goal); <strong>benevolence</strong> (the extent to which the trustee is believed to want to do good to the truster) and <strong>integrity</strong> (the perception that the trustee adheres to a set of principles the trustor finds acceptable). Moreover, Mayer et al argue that the effect of perceived benevolence plays a larger role in users’ trust as their relationships with the system become more established. Technical mechanisms can only improve the ability of a system, but cannot address the perception of benevolence or integrity.</p><div><h3>Subscribe to my newsletter!</h3><p>I write a mixture of tutorials, comment pieces and technical content on my blog.</p></div><p>Technical mechanisms of improving trust typically seek to produce signals as a proxy for the private data the other party has not divulged. In the case of <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/soups2014/proceedings/presentation/zhang">recommender and ratings systems</a>, this typically comes from an aggregation of huge swathes of users’ personal data. The same mechanisms that sought to address the asymmetry of information have become so good at aggregating data that <a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en/blog/2019/1/why-targeted-advertising-is-becoming-creepy">users find them “creepy”</a> . Again, the lack of transparency around recommendations leads users to distrust the platforms, accusing them of “listening in on their conversations”. Earlier in 2020, Airbnb acquired a patent for AI to perform a background check on guests, <a href="https://artificialintelligence-news.com/2020/01/09/airbnb-uses-ai-enabled-trait-analyser-to-check-if-its-customers-are-psychopaths/">predicting personal traits from social media accounts</a>. However this damages the third pillar of trust - integrity - as this level of automated inference using personal information violates users’ principles regarding privacy. Indeed, here the perceived increase in trust due to better guest vetting is significantly outweighed by the damage of integrity. In the case of Amazon, the increasingly personalised recommendation systems lead to users believing that the system is optimising for the platform’s profits over providing better-value recommendations to users, damaging the perceived benevolence of the brand.</p><p>The increased automated decision-making as a result of these technical mechanisms <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3460903">“change the nature of trust produced by these institutions” according to Bodó</a>. Bodó argues that even if these technical mechanisms do “no more than formalize and encode internal rules and procedures”, the removed human discretion will lead to the inability to adjust for exceptions or interpretations. This lack of nuance could lead to incorrect decisions that damage users’ trust, for example if Uber bans innocent drivers from its platform. Furthermore, the lack of transparency means that these mechanisms lack accountability, and, as Uber demonstrates, contain unchecked …</p></article></div>

					<div><p>PASK – Pianists for Alternatively Sized Keyboards – is an international movement committed to achieving change in relation to piano keyboard size.</p><p>Specifically, PASK aims to convince piano manufacturers to begin producing piano keyboards in three standard sizes. Purchasers of new pianos will then have a choice of keyboard size. In addition to the current ‘large’ size, we need two additional sizes with <u>narrower keys</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The current piano keyboard has prevailed since the 1880’s and was not designed for the physical capabilities of the population at large. It has been assumed that the current size is suitable for all, whereas in fact it is isn’t. The keys are too wide for the majority of pianists, considering men, women and children of all nationalities and across all age groups.</p><p>The current keyboard size and key width suits people with large hands, generally adult males with average to above average spans. However, for those with smaller hands, today’s piano increases technical difficulties and learning time. It limits musical expression and prevents access to a large amount of the piano repertoire. Worst of all, it can cause debilitating pain and injury.</p><p>A simple analogy illustrates the point. Does it make sense that all men in an athletics race should have to wear the same size shoes? And that female athletes have to run in the same size shoes as the men? And that children have to run in the same size shoes as adults?</p></div>

					<div><p>The<strong> long term goal of PASK </strong>is for acoustic and digital piano manufacturers to offer a choice of three standard keyboard sizes in accordance with the DS standards. These are: DS5.5® (7/8) and the DS6.0® (15/16) as well as the current ‘large’ DS6.5<em>&nbsp;</em>keyboard. They need to be&nbsp;mass-produced and marketed worldwide in such a way that the new alternative sizes are readily available and naturally accepted options for all pianists and teachers.&nbsp;</p><p>For this to happen, we need to focus on both building the demand from the piano world as well as encouraging supply from manufacturers. Clearly, these are interdependent.&nbsp;</p><p>Pianists with smaller hands must create a united voice and demand access to keyboards with narrower keys. Piano teachers, universities and conservatoriums need to recognise their benefits. Competitions and concert venues should provide a choice of keyboard for performers.</p><p>Alternatively sized keyboards are currently only available from a limited number of sources, are expensive and often involve long wait times for customers. The major piano manufacturers need to take up this challenge.&nbsp;A key factor in creating change will be public support from prominent pianists, academics and teachers around the world.</p><p>There are three main strategies required to achieve this goal:</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raising awareness of the benefits of reduced size keyboards for those with smaller hands.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creating opportunities for pianists to experience the difference in playing on narrower keys.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Breaking down barriers and resistance to change.</p></div>

					<p>PASK is not a formally constituted organisation, but a network of people working towards a common goal.

There are three founders of PASK:

Ms Erica Booker from Sydney, Australia – Graduate of the New South Wales Conservatorium of Music, pianist and piano teacher. Erica is also a Suzuki teacher trainer and leading advocate for alternatively sized piano keyboards:<a href="https://ericabookerpiano.com/%E2%80%8B" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://ericabookerpiano.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://ericabookerpiano.com</a>

Dr Carol Leone from Dallas, Texas – Chair of Keyboard Studies at SMU Meadows School of the Arts in Dallas, internationally recognized performing artist, teacher, lecturer, and author. Carol is one of the world’s leading researchers and proponents of ergonomic piano keyboards to promote a pianist’s wellness:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.carolleone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.carolleone.com</a>

Ms Rhonda Boyle from Melbourne, Australia – Former government policy analyst/strategic planner with qualifications in physics, environmental science and urban planning. Rhonda is a pianist, independent researcher and author of peer-reviewed articles relating to hand size and piano playing:

<span>These three founders have no financial connections with any piano or keyboard manufacturers.</span>

The PASK network is gradually growing and now includes many others around the world who support the PASK goals and who are actively engaged in encouraging change.

					<div><p>The term ESPK (ergonomically scaled piano keyboard) is now mostly used in the academic community when referring to keyboards smaller than the current ‘standard’ size i.e., with 6.5 inch octave. The term ‘reduced-size keyboard’ has also been used in some literature. &nbsp;Also note that the DS5.5®<em>&nbsp;</em>is often referred to as the ‘7/8 keyboard’ as the key widths are close to (but not exactly) 7/8 of the ‘standard’ keyboard. Likewise, the DS6.0®<em>&nbsp;</em>is often referred to as the 15/16 keyboard. ESPK is a generic term that also includes keyboards of other sizes, i.e. that do not conform to the DS standards.&nbsp;</p><p>The ‘DS’ abbreviation stands for Donison-Steinbuhler. (Chris Donison and David Steinbuhler pioneered the introduction of piano keyboards with narrower keys for acoustic pianos, mainly in North America.) &nbsp;The PASK movement (Pianists for Alternatively Sized Keyboards) generally uses the term ‘alternative sizes’ to avoid confusion as ‘reduced size’ could imply fewer than 88 keys.</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      

      <p><i>4<sup>th</sup> November, 2016</i></p>

      <p>
	<q>SVG 2 is on life support.</q>
      </p>
      
      <h2>Background</h2>

      <p>
	About a month ago the W3C's SVG staff contact person (Doug
	Schepers) relayed some very alarming news... that the SVG
	Working Group charter was not going to be renewed when it
	expired at the end of October, 2016. This was quite shocking
	as the group had worked quite hard to get the SVG 2
	specification to
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#Reports"><i>Candidate
	Recommendation</i></a> status. If the charter is not renewed,
	it would mean <span>an immediate end to
	SVG 2</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
	While shocking and unexpected, it didn't come out of left field.
	The active participation in the working group has dropped to
	just a handful of people, none representing any of the browser
	vendors. In fact, the last two "face-to-face" meetings had
	attendance of just three regular participants, one from Canon
	(which is dropping membership in the W3C as the end of the year)
	and two <q>invited experts</q> who are working for free. The weekly
	teleconferences were down to four or five participants (with
	representatives from KDDI and the W3C).
      </p>

      <h2>Recent Developments</h2>

      <p>
	The working group appealed to the browser vendors for support
	in renewing the charter. A teleconference was organized with
	multiple representatives from each of the major browser
	vendors as well as a number of other interested parties
	(Adobe, Canon, KDDI, etc.). The general consensus from the
	browser vendors is that SVG 2 should be finished but that it
	should be restricted to <q>fixing</q> the problems with SVG
	1.1 2nd edition along with a few choice selected new features
	(like 'paint-order') which have already been implemented by
	multiple browsers. <span>New features
	(meshes, hatches, etc.) should be removed and pushed into
	a <a href="https://wicg.io/">WICG group</a>.</span> (Wrapped
	text was not discussed.) (See
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/10/06-svg-minutes.html">minutes</a>.)
	A resolution was made to <q>Re-charter SVG WG for one more year
	with a focus on moving SVG 2 to REC with only the features that
	have implementer experience.</q> Note that this is a WG resolution
	and not a W3C agreement to continue the group.
      </p>
      <p>
	With a focus on a limited SVG 2 specification, the W3C has
	agreed to extend the current SVG Working Group charter until the
	end of January in order to give the group a chance to sort out a
	new charter. Any new charter will focus on completing SVG 2 by
	developing a test suite and in pushing for implementations.
      </p>
      <p>
	An additional discussion by the WG was that all joint CSS/SVG
	specifications will be completely taken over by CSS. This
	includes
	<a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-transforms/">Transforms</a>,
	<a href="https://drafts.fxtf.org/filters/">Filters</a>,
	<a href="https://drafts.fxtf.org/css-masking-1/">Masking and Clipping</a>,
	<a href="https://drafts.fxtf.org/compositing-1/">Compositing and Blending</a>,
	etc. This completes the long process of CSS
	<span>stealing</span>
	absorbing the most interesting SVG features.
      </p>

      <h2>Future</h2>

      <p>
	The future is pretty cloudy at the moment. Here are some observations:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    There are only two browser implementations of importance:
	    Blink (Chrome/Opera) and Gecko (Firefox). Of these, only
	    Blink has the resources to fully implement new features
	    quickly although Gecko has implemented more of SVG
	    2. Chrome commands a huge lead in browser market share
	    (almost 75%). Google has a habit of unilaterally removing
	    features it doesn't like from Blink, basically dictating
	    that those features are removed from specifications.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Two other significant browser implementations, WebKit
	    (Safari) and Edge, are more followers than leaders and
	    have relatively little market share (5% and 4%
	    respectively).  For example, Microsoft explicitly stated
	    that they would not even look at SVG 2 until the
	    specification was a Candidate Recommendation (while the
	    other browser vendors have implemented a limited set of
	    SVG 2 features such as 'paint-order', see
	    <a href="https://nikosandronikos.github.io/svg2-info/svg2-feature-support/">SVG
	    2 Feature Support</a> for current status of SVG 2
	    implementation).
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    There seems to be a disconnect between the browser vendors
	    and the content creators. Even Adobe has expressed
	    frustrations with the current status (and they have
	    significantly reduced their involvement with W3C as a
	    result).
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    Moving things into a WICG is not a viable strategy.
	    Without browser vendor buy-in, things are likely to never
	    emerge from a WICG group. In addition, a WICG group is
	    intended to develop new ideas to the point where the
	    browser vendors can have a look at them. Both meshes and
	    hatches are already well developed with Inkscape
	    supporting full rendering for several years. (Note that
	    the browsers already have code to render meshes as they
	    all support meshes in PDF.)
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    Despite the large turnout for the SVG WG meeting where we
	    discussed the future of SVG 2, we have received almost no
	    feedback (after requesting it several times) from the
	    browser vendors on which SVG 2 features they are likely to
	    implement. This seems to be indicative of the low interest
	    they have in implementing SVG 2.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    Even the CSS working group, which has a much larger active
	    participation, is having trouble getting their specifications
	    out. Both SVG and CSS seem to be <q>passé</q>. The new
	    darling of the browser vendor set is
	    <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/03/houdini-maybe-the-most-exciting-development-in-css-youve-never-heard-of/">Houdini</a> which offers lower level
	    access to browser internals. This is not unexpected as
	    browsers continue on the path to being the new OS.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    The most important long term observation is that browser
	    vendors respond to demand. I've been told SVG would never
	    have been part of HTML5 if it wasn't for Inkscape which
	    allowed the production of tons of SVG's used in the
	    Wikipedia. Browser vendors keep track of the use of
	    various features. <span>Features with
	    more use get more attention.</span>
	  </p>
	</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What should Inkscape do?</h3>

      <p>
	Given the above observations, if we really want mesh, hatches,
	etc. to remain part of SVG 2 and to be supported by
	browsers <span>we must generate content that
	uses those features</span>; content that gets people excited
	enough to put pressure on the browser vendors to implement
	them.  We've already started to do this in a limited way by
	enabling the use of 'paint-order' which is supported by three
	of the four major browsers.
      </p>
      <p>
	Of course this means that some artwork created using Inkscape
	won't be viewable directly on the web. We should accept this
	as a necessary (and hopefully temporary) step. We can provide
	warnings in Inkscape when artists use features that are not
	widely supported. We can advise artists of work-arounds, i.e.
	converting a mesh to an internal image when exporting. And we
	can provide
	<q><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill">polyfills</a></q>
	that replace internal browser functionality with JavaScript
	implementations. (I've already started work on a mesh gradient
	polyfill.)
      </p>
      <p>
	I've been working on improvements to the mesh gradient
	GUI. This work has been back-ported to 0.92. We plan on
	enabling mesh gradients by default in the 0.92 release. This
	will start generating public content that uses mesh gradients.
      </p>

<h2>Backbone of Functional Programming</h2>
<p><code>map</code> &amp; <code>flatmap</code> form the backbone of Functional Progamming. It is very important be comfortable with these two concepts and this guide will help you develop an intuition for them.</p>
<p>This guide is language agnostic but I expect you to be familiar with basic programming concepts like functions, types, data type/objects and list. </p>
<h3>Nomenclature</h3>
<p>Let me introduce you to some basic terms we will be using to talk about <code>map/flatmap</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>Type</code>s are data constructs and they can be <code>Basic Types</code> like Int, String etc.</li>
<li>
<code>Container</code> is a special <code>type</code> which contains another <code>type</code>. For example a List of Ints.</li>
<li>
<code>Function</code> is a function whose input is of Type 1 and output is of Type 2. Type 1 &amp; Type 2 can be same type.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Visualize</h3>
<p>Though I have defined three terms it will be easier to think about them visually.</p>

<h4>
<code>Containers</code> will be represented by shapes</h4>
<p><img alt="Empty Containers" src="https://last-ent.com/images/fmap/empty-containers.png"></p>
<p>In reality, we will always use</p>
<h4><code>Container for a Type</code></h4>
<p><img alt="Square for Triangle" src="https://last-ent.com/images/fmap/full-containers.png"></p>
<p>etc.</p>
<h4>
<code>Functions</code> will be denoted as</h4>
<p><img alt="f : Triangle -> Star" src="https://last-ent.com/images/fmap/fun.png"></p>
<h3>Verbalize</h3>
<p>Let's see how to verbalize these terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="Square for Triangle" src="https://last-ent.com/images/fmap/t-sq.png"> Container for Triangle</p>
<p><img alt="Square for Circle for Triangle" src="https://last-ent.com/images/fmap/t-crl-sq.png"> Square for Circle for Triangle</p>
<p><img alt="f : Triangle -> Star" src="https://last-ent.com/images/fmap/fun.png">  f is a function from Triangle to Star</p>
<p><img alt="g : Triangle -> Square for Triangle" src="https://last-ent.com/images/fmap/g-fun.png"> g is a function from Triangle to Container of Triangle</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Fundamentals</h2>
<p>In this section, I want to introduce one basic concept along with <code>map/flatmap</code>.</p>
<h3>Function Composition</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Function Composition</code> is chaining two or more functions such that output of one function feeds into to the input of second function and so on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Derivation of g . f : Triangle to Container of Reverse Triangle" src="https://last-ent.com/images/fmap/gof-derive.png"></p>
<h3><code>map</code></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><code>map</code> is a function that takes a Container (C1) &amp; a Function (F) as input and returns a new Container (C2) for Function's (F) output type.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Rules for <code>map</code>
</h4>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Type contained by Container (C1) has to match Function's (F) input type.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="map : (f : Triangle -> Reverse Triangle, Container for Triangle) -> Container for Reverse Triangle" src="https://last-ent.com/images/fmap/map.png"></p>
<h3><code>flatmap</code></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><code>flatmap</code> is a function that takes a Container (C1) &amp; a Function (F) as input and returns a new Container (C2) for Function's (F) output type.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Rules for <code>flatmap</code>
</h4>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Type contained by Container (C1) has to match Function's (F) input type.</li>
<li>Function (F) has to return a Container (C2)</li>
<li>C1 == C2. This is very important to remember as many people trip up on this.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="flatmap : (f : Triangle -> Container for Reverse Triangle, Container for Triangle) -> Container for Reverse Triangle" src="https://last-ent.com/images/fmap/flatmap.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: As you can see, both <code>map</code> &amp; <code>flatmap</code> have the same written definition but the strictness is in the rules it has to adhere to.</p>
</blockquote>

<strong>FreeBSD - a lesson in poor defaults</strong>
<hr>

<p>
Last updated: 09/25/2020. 
<small><a href="https://twitter.com/blakkheim">@blakkheim</a></small>

</p><p>
This page lists some of the changes I make to a vanilla install of FreeBSD
for security hardening. Some changes to increase network performance or make
things a bit more more sane are also included. It only covers basic changes
that a sysadmin can make to a running system.

</p><p>
It could also be considered a commentary piece on the state of security in
FreeBSD's development ecosystem, highlighting their strong resistance to
change and unwillingness to replace old cruft with modern alternatives.

</p><p>
The project's
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/security.html">security page</a>
says the following:

</p><blockquote><em>
FreeBSD takes security very seriously and its developers are constantly
working on making the operating system as secure as possible.
</em></blockquote>

<p>
But is that really true? Let's find out.

<h2 id="openssh">OpenSSH Modifications</h2>

FreeBSD has a history of making "interesting" choices with regard to the
version of OpenSSH they bundle in the base system, often deliberately going
against upstream in the name of retaining backward compatibility or to gain
perceived performance improvements. Disabling or ignoring security features
in favor of performance seems to be a recurring theme, as we'll see later on.

<p>
It is my belief that quite a few poor decisions have been made in this area.
As a primary example, they insisted on maintaining the
<a href="https://www.psc.edu/hpn-ssh">HPN-SSH</a> patchset and enabling it
by default for quite a long time.

</p><p>
You might say "Well OK, but what's actually <em>wrong</em> with those patches?"

</p><p>
OpenSSH increased the channel limits enough to support a cross-country gigabit
connection without slowdown years ago. For most users, this means that the HPN
patches are an unnecessary complexity with little or no benefit. In addition
to that, they would frequently hold FreeBSD back from updating their version
of OpenSSH because of HPN backporting and manual refactoring of the patchset.

</p><p>
Support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_Wrappers">tcp_wrappers</a>
was abandoned long ago in OpenSSH upstream, but FreeBSD still
<a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&amp;revision=294328">patched it back in</a> and enabled it for everyone.

</p><p>
The same was true for weak DSA host keys, which they
<a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&amp;revision=294495">switched back on</a> for compatibility with older clients.

</p><p>
FreeBSD also
<a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&amp;revision=296634">re-enabled</a>
insecure encryption ciphers in their build after they were disabled upstream,
with backward compatibility apparently being more important to them than the
security of their users.

</p><p>
If we don't deprecate insecure options bit by bit somewhere in the ecosystem,
we end up with a situation like OpenSSL. Pressure has to be applied somewhere.
One can be part of that team, or one can play against them. In this case,
FreeBSD is the team trying to increase the risk.

</p><p>
They've made local changes to their OpenSSH build and its default config files
that left their users vulnerable when other platforms were unaffected. Here's
a (possibly incomplete) list of examples:

</p><ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-00:21.ssh.asc">FreeBSD-SA-00:21.ssh</a>

<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-16:14.openssh.asc">FreeBSD-SA-16:14.openssh</a>
</li></ul>

<p>
And the PAM issues in these two:

</p><ul>

</li><li>
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-15:22.openssh.asc">FreeBSD-SA-15:22.openssh</a>
</li></ul>

<p>
A list of FreeBSD's modifications to both the code and config files can be
seen
<a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/crypto/openssh/FREEBSD-upgrade?view=markup#l93">here</a>
for the base system (possibly outdated/unmaintained) and 
<a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/security/openssh-portable/files">here</a>
for the ports version.

</p><p>
Thankfully, as hinted above, it's fairly easy to install OpenSSH from ports
with all the FreeBSDisms removed. Their
<a href="https://www.freshports.org/security/openssh-portable">openssh-portable</a>
port has a hefty set of options you can toggle:

</p><pre>BLACKLISTD      FreeBSD blacklistd(8) support
BSM             OpenBSM Auditing
DOCS            Build and/or install documentation
FIDO_U2F        FIDO/U2F support (security/libfido2)
HPN             HPN-SSH patch
KERB_GSSAPI     Kerberos/GSSAPI patch (req: GSSAPI)
LDNS            SSHFP/LDNS support
LIBEDIT         Command line editing via libedit
NONECIPHER      NONE Cipher support
PAM             Pluggable authentication module support
TCP_WRAPPERS    tcp_wrappers support
XMSS            XMSS key support (experimental)
MIT             MIT Kerberos (security/krb5)
HEIMDAL         Heimdal Kerberos (security/heimdal)
HEIMDAL_BASE    Heimdal Kerberos (base)
</pre>

<p>
Besides the modifications mentioned above, two other patches in particular
have been popular with FreeBSD users: threaded AES-CTR and the "NONE" cipher.

</p><p>
Threaded AES-CTR, as the name might imply, introduces threads to the code.
OpenSSH developerss have publicly said threads are too risky and won't be
added. What's more, it's largely obsoleted by AES-NI in modern CPUs and the
fact that ChaCha20-Poly1305 (the current default cipher) is even faster
when taking the message authentication code (MAC) into consideration.

</p><p>
The NONE cipher is somewhat of a misfeature, removing the encryption bits
and only keeping the data integrity. It allows users to accidentally shoot
themselves in the foot pretty easily. The trade-off in performance isn't
really worth it either, as the bottlenecks one might experience have a lot
more to do with the MAC than the actual encryption overhead.

</p><p>
I recommend disabling all of the port options. The majority of users don't
need the extra risk that any of these non-standard patches introduce.

</p><p>
As for the <code>/usr/local/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> file, I would recommend
enabling only modern crypto. However, cryptography is a very complicated and
important topic, so you would be better served to research each algorithm and
come to your own conclusions instead of just taking my word. Thankfully,
upstream OpenSSH cares about security and continues to remove old, broken
algorithms as time goes on. FreeBSD can't keep patching them back in and
maintaining their backports. It's simply too much work.

</p><p>
This isn't meant to be an entire SSH tutorial, but consider changing your
default port to something other than 22 if you want less spam in your logs,
set up public keys and disable password authentication... the usual stuff.

</p><p>
The following config lines are just to revert FreeBSD's local changes that
introduce new risks:

</p><pre>ChallengeResponseAuthentication no         
UsePAM                          no 
VersionAddendum                 none  # Prevent some OS information from being
                                      # leaked by your sshd, another one of
                                      # FreeBSD's "enhancements" in both the
                                      # base system and ports version.
X11Forwarding                   no        
</pre>

<p>
In addition to improved security, using the port of OpenSSH allows you to
upgrade to newer versions much faster than waiting for a new release of the
base system. As an example, FreeBSD has comically been limited to "upgrading"
their base OpenSSH to a release that's
<a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&amp;revision=357926">three versions behind the current one at the time</a>
because of their local patches. Note that you may need further configuration
changes if using the bundled OpenSSH, as its options aren't as easily fixable.

</p><h2 id="mail">Mailer Daemon</h2>

FreeBSD includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sendmail">Sendmail</a>
in the base system and enables it by default.

<p>
I'd like to share a quote from one of the earliest security advisories FreeBSD
ever published:

</p><blockquote><em>
The sendmail mail transfer agent has a rather poor reputation
for security related problems.  FreeBSD ships a version of
sendmail that has all known security problems fixed, but this
doesn't mean there won't be more found in the future.
</em></blockquote>

And it turns out whoever wrote that
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-96:03.sendmail-suggestion.asc">back in 1996</a>
wasn't wrong.

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-01:57.sendmail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-01:57.sendmail</a>
</li><li>
<a href="https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-03:04.sendmail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-03:04.sendmail</a>

</li><li>
<a href="https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-03:13.sendmail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-03:13.sendmail</a>
</li><li>
<a href="https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-06:13.sendmail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-06:13.sendmail</a>
</li><li>
<a href="https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-06:17.sendmail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-06:17.sendmail</a>
</li><li>
<a href="https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-14:11.sendmail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-14:11.sendmail</a>
</li></ul>

There are
<a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vendor/31/Sendmail.html">many more</a>
where those came from.

<p>
Even with Sendmail's reputation, FreeBSD has kept it around and left it on
by default for all their users.

</p><p>
To make matters worse, FreeBSD sometimes imports
<a href="https://marc.info/?l=sendmail-announce&amp;m=159394546814125&amp;w=2">sendmail updates</a>
with
<a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&amp;revision=363233">no mention</a>
of the included security fixes. As you might guess, this means no advisory
is published, and most users don't get those security fixes for a long time,

</p><p>
I think most users will agree that this old program is mostly just a bother.
A full mail server, especially one that's been full of holes since the 90s,
shouldn't be in the base system at all if you ask me. Something simple for
local mail delivery should be enough.

</p><p>
I stop all the related services because it makes startup slower and I'd like
as few things running in the background as possible. The lines needed to
disable Sendmail will be in the rc.conf section later on.

</p><p>
If you actually run a mail server, there are better options like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postfix_(software)">Postfix</a> or
<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/opensmtpd">OpenSMTPD</a>.
If you only need to send mail through a third party provider like
Gmail, <a href="https://marlam.de/msmtp/">msmtp</a> is a another
lightweight alternative. All three are in ports.

</p><h2 id="firewall">Firewall</h2>

There are three firewalls included with FreeBSD: IPFW, PF, and IPFilter.
None of them are enabled by default.

<p>
I don't know anything about IPFilter, nor do I know anyone that uses it,
so we'll pretend it doesn't exist. IPFW is the native firewall.
It was written by FreeBSD, for FreeBSD, with their usual coding standards.
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-20:10.ipfw.asc">The</a>
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-20:12.libalias.asc">result</a>
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-20:13.libalias.asc">is</a>
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-06:04.ipfw.asc">about</a>
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-05:13.ipfw.asc">what</a>

<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-01:08.ipfw.asc">might</a>
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-96:14.ipfw.asc">expect</a>.
PF is the OpenBSD firewall. It was ported from OpenBSD to FreeBSD. Which one
you use mostly comes down to preference. Since I'm more familiar with PF,
that's what I use. Unfortunately, the version of PF included with FreeBSD
hasn't been synced with upstream <strong>since 2009</strong>. Do you want
such a critical component of your OS or network device left largely
unmaintained?

</p><p>
Check the documentation for whichever firewall you decide to use for proper
configuration instructions.

</p><h2 id="portspkg">Ports and Packages</h2>

Other than just manually compiling things yourself, there are three main ways
to install software on FreeBSD:

            <cite><a href="https://sanctum.geek.nz/">Tom Ryder</a></cite>, 27 Oct 2017<br>
            Last updated 12 October 2019
        </p>
        <p>
            I host all my own code on my <a href="https://sanctum.geek.nz/cgit/">cgit instance</a>. I do have <a href="https://github.com/tejr">an account on GitHub</a>, but only because it’s a requirement to contribute to certain projects and even to log into some websites. I avoid using the account where possible, and I don’t host code on it anymore since June 2016.
        </p>
        <p>
            The primary reason I host code on my own domain is a practical one: I can retain control over its location via <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> redirects if it needs to move, including redirects to another site if necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, I also dislike the tacit acceptance of GitHub as the dominant free software hosting platform for a decentralised version control protocol, when it is itself centralised, proprietary, for-profit, closed-source, and politically active. These things make it vulnerable to the same issues and abuse that affected <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/05/sourceforge-grabs-gimp-for-windows-account-wraps-installer-in-bundle-pushing-adware/">SourceForge</a>. I feel that the free software and open source communities turn a blind eye to this massive liability.
        </p>
        <p>
            Regardless of your position on individual cases, the fact that so much controversy results from any censorship activity from GitHub should be considered a warning sign that too much depends on their service. Some examples:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151208143727/https://github.com/opal/opal/issues/941">https://github.com/opal/opal/issues/941</a> [archive]
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/12/19/feminist_software_foundation_c_plus_equality/">https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/12/19/feminist_software_foundation_c_plus_equality/</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150802/20330431831/github-nukes-repository-over-use-word-retard.shtml">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150802/20330431831/github-nukes-repository-over-use-word-retard.shtml</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The issue here is not political correctness, it’s centralisation. If GitHub were not in this monopolistic position, nobody would care so much about any of the above.  The overwhelming monopoly that GitHub has as a code host is a problem that the free software community chooses to ignore.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Rules of acquisition
        </h2>
        <p>
            GitHub has investors who do not care a whit for free software principles, and eventually <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-03/microsoft-is-said-to-have-agreed-to-acquire-coding-site-github">the company <em>will</em> get acquired</a>—maybe tomorrow, maybe next year—and as we all know, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLWbp3w2eqM">money changes everything</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Don’t leave your project’s nerve center—its primary address, its means of contribution, its issue tracker, its website, its primary documentation, its continuous integration, everything—in a way you can’t redirect!—at the mercy of people who merely want a return on their investment, and do not care about the principles of a minority of angry nerds.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Using Git does not require GitHub!
        </h2>
        <p>
            If you are managing a free software project, <em>please do not host it on GitHub</em>, or at least allow a method of contributing that does not depend on using it or any other proprietary code hosting platform:
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>
                Formatting and sending patches:
            </dt>
            <dd>
                Use <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-send-email">git-send-email(1)</a>. The manual page even has instructions for using it with Gmail. Using this method, you don’t need to host the code at all.
            </dd>
            <dt>
                Pull requests:
            </dt>
            <dd>
                Host your own repositories—<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/no-nb/v1/Git-on-the-Server-The-Protocols#The-HTTP/S-Protocol">it’s really easy</a>—and point maintainers to them with <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-request-pull">git-request-pull(1)</a>.
            </dd>
            <dt>
                Web frontend:
            </dt>
            <dd>
                Use the superb <a href="https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/about/">cgit</a>, or <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitweb">gitweb(1)</a>, which is included in the Git source. Both are straightforward to configure for any <abbr title="Common Gateway Interface">CGI</abbr>-capable webserver.
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
            Other options include a <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/install/">self-hosted GitLab</a>, <a href="https://gogs.io/docs/installation">Gogs</a>, <a href="https://www.gerritcodereview.com/">Gerrit</a>, or <a href="https://gitea.io/">Gitea</a> instance.  More ambitious or puritan sysadmins might choose to self-host Drew DeVault’s stellar <a href="https://meta.sr.ht/">sr.ht</a> system, which implements a much wider range of GitHub’s features, for an “integrated development hosting” environment.

        <p>
            Since this page was published, <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-to-acquire-github-for-7-5-billion/">Microsoft has acquired GitHub</a>, and there’s been a small exodus to third-party hosting on GitLab, proving as a community we still aren’t really learning our lesson about third-party code hosting. That said, at least the core software for GitLab is open source, so it’s a marginal improvement, but we could be doing so much better.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you’re reading this because you’re angry about the acquisition and pondering a move to GitLab, I advise you instead to take the plunge and self-host your code repositories, even if you use the resource-hungry GitLab to do it. It is not as hard as you think, and once done, this problem will never bite you again.

            <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/github-starts-blocking-developers-in-countries-facing-us-trade-sanctions/">GitHub is blocking</a> users from Crimea, Iran, and other places.  For developers dependent on it as a service for their projects, this has been crippling, in yet another vindication for the decentralized design of Git that GitHub and other third-party hosting sites have so callously butchered.

            Hello, <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/s0s8fu/why_not_github">visitors from lobste.rs</a>!  Thank you for your discussion and critique.  I’ve added mention of the excellent-looking Gogs, Gerritt, and Gitea, and adjusted some wording for accuracy and clarity.

        <p>
            To emphasise: nothing in this essay is intended as praise or criticism specifically of social justice, advocacy for protected groups, censorship, United States foreign policy, or its <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-and-trade-controls">effect on GitHub specifically</a>—they have to follow the law, like anyone else.  The focus here is on centralisation onto a commercial service, running proprietary code, subject to the laws of a single country, that already has a monopoly on code hosting for free and open source software, and the free software community’s wilfully ignoring the issues therewith.

            It’s become more widely known that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906213/github-ice-microsoft-software-email-contract-immigration-nonprofit-donation">GitHub had a contract with United States Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE)</a>, an ethical hot-topic at present after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/20/chef-ceo-says-hell-continue-to-work-with-ice-in-spite-of-protests/">similar disputes with config management software Chef</a>.  Again, the issue here is not whether this is good or bad, it’s that you’re handing GitHub power over your work, while they may be using their proprietary software to political ends that you find repugnant, and refusing you the right to fork and apply their code in the way that suits you, the user.  Avoiding these sorts of problems is the entire basis of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">Freedom 0</a>.

<![CDATA[Covid Vaccine Delays – Why?]]>

November 21, 2020 | http://blog.benwiener.com/economics/2020/11/19/vaccine-delays.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://blog.benwiener.com/economics/2020/11/19/vaccine-delays.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I keep hearing about small delays in the vaccine development process that I don’t understand given how urgent the need is. I read a perfect example today. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/18/health/pfizer-covid-vaccine.html">A New York Times article</a> sharing good news about the effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine mentioned that the company would be applying for emergency use authorization “within days”. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/16/health/Covid-moderna-vaccine.html%22">A similar article</a> cited a period of weeks for the Moderna vaccine. This progress is great news. It made me wonder, though, why not today? What prevented these companies from being ready to file with the FDA right away?</p>

<p>By all accounts, the rapid progress of COVID-19 vaccine candidates has been miraculous. Still, I’m confused by the apparent lack of urgency in certain parts of the process. Most of the vaccine development work is probably difficult to speed up. For example, it isn’t possible to speed up the rate at which trial participants get exposed to the virus so that effectiveness can be proven<sup id="fnref:hcc" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:hcc">1</a></sup>. But what prevents Pfizer and Moderna from pre-writing their application to the FDA while the trial is running and netting a few days or weeks? Even just a few days has serious value. Of course, the data is still coming in so there would be some uncertainty about what should be written in the application. But they must have a pretty good sense of how the trial is going. They could even pre-write two or three versions to cover the most likely scenarios. And of all possible trial outcomes, why would these companies both be unprepared for best-case scenarios where their vaccines are proving to be highly effective?</p>

<p>Getting a bit more speculative, why aren’t scientists at Pfizer and Moderna already in conversation with decision makers at the FDA so that the evaluation process can be started based on preliminary data? Then they could be possibly be ready to issue emergency use authorization immediately once the trial concludes. If there is an unexpected change in the latest data regulators should of course be prepared to reassess. To be clear, I am not suggesting that the approval process be less rigorous. I just want it happening in parallel with the trial as much as it can. Given how ridiculously destructive this pandemic is, I sure hope COVID vaccines are the FDA’s top priority.</p>

<p>This possibility reminds me of the mechanics of my thesis defense. My adviser, the main decision maker, was already very familiar with my work. Little information was actually transmitted to him that day. He already knew what he needed to know to make his decision. In fact, we wouldn’t have even gone forward with the defense if he wasn’t ready to pass me. He didn’t take a month after the defense to closely read my thesis, consider all the arguments, check the math, and then deliberate. That process occurred while the data was coming in. Maybe some parallelization of the approval process like this is happening for the COVID vaccines, but I’ve never read anything that gives the sense that it is.</p>

<h3 id="possible-answers-to-my-own-questions">Possible answers to my own questions:</h3>
<h4 id="why-werent-the-eua-applications-ready">Why weren’t the EUA applications ready?</h4>

<p>Maybe a document like this is <em>way</em> more complicated than I’m imagining and the drug companies are writing them as fast as possible. This sort of suggests that writing the application is a similar challenge to developing the vaccine. I hope that’s not right.</p>

<p>Maybe the drug companies <em>are</em> already working with the FDA, and the timing of the application isn’t important. As I mentioned above, I’ve never seen anything that suggests this.</p>

<p>Maybe these companies aren’t incentivized to actually get the vaccine to market as fast as they can. Off the bat this didn’t seem right to me, but could the advance purchase agreements that Moderna and Pfizer signed with governments eliminate their urgency?</p>

<h4 id="why-arent-the-drug-companies-working-with-the-fda">Why aren’t the drug companies working with the FDA?</h4>

<p>Maybe this just isn’t the way the FDA usually works and they weren’t able to adapt to this extraordinary situation.</p>

<p>Obviously scientific integrity is important here. Maybe the scientists are intentionally kept separate from other parts of Pfizer and from the FDA to prevent some kind of academic dishonesty. I wonder about the relative dangers involved, but I could imagine an explanation like this.</p>

<h3 id="answers-that-other-people-have-suggested">Answers that other people have suggested:</h3>

<p>Commenters on Hacker News and Reddit have suggested that the things I want to happen are already happening. I’ve looked into this a little bit, and I’m unsure. Both Moderna and Pfizer have been granted the FDA’s <a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/fast-track-breakthrough-therapy-accelerated-approval-priority-review/fast-track">Fast Track status</a>. This sounds great. It apparently means these companies have the opportunity for closer collaboration with the FDA, at least on clinical trial design. Some have suggested that the companies would also already be sharing advance results from their studies, but I haven’t found any reference saying that.</p>

<p>Fast Track also gives them the opportunity to participate in Rolling Review, which allows them to submit sections of their applications as they become ready. The references I’ve found discussing this are mostly <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-submit-emergency-use-authorization">press releases by the companies</a> or closely based on them. They discuss participation in Rolling Review in Europe and elsewhere, but I haven’t seen that they are doing this in the US.</p>

        <p><span>After Steve Jobs was forced out of Apple
        in 1985, everyone wanted to know what Steve would do
        next.... so NeXT was what he did.
        <p>
        
        In 1988 his NeXT team launched a new kind of computer for
        it's time, built on standards with a Unix core but with a
        user experience "my grandma could understand". It was well
        ahead of it's time, so naturally, it was not embraced by
        main stream consumers... a classic "Crossing the Chasm"
        issue. But many saw it for what it was, a breakthrough
        product as innovative as today's iTunes, iPod and iPhone.
        </p><p>
        
        Building upon NeXT's hardware and more importantly, their
        software development environment, many third party NeXT
        developers added their own magic dust to create
        revolutionary products, like the world's first web browser,
        or a new form of spread sheet, Lotus Improv or WebObjects,
        the foundation upon which the iTune store is built, to name
        only a few. Some of these ground breaking products may
        never be repeated. Most contained innovations embraced by
        future applications, with a clear lineage back to NeXTSTEP.
        </p><p>
        
        During the relatively short time of NeXT ascendency
        (1985-1996), Apple was bleeding red ink from repeated
        financial losses and two hugely expensive attempts to
        create a follow on Operating System. Apple's third
        president since Steve's departure, Gil Amelio saw the
        merits of Steve, his team and their technology. In December
        1996 Apple bought Next. Then the Next team took over Apple.
        The result is their hugely successful Mac OS X, built on
        the foundations of the NeXTSTEP OS.
        </p><p>
        
        While NeXT is no more, as a product or a stand alone
        company, it's impact on the industry will be felt for years
        to come. We should remember it, perhaps even study it. In
        decades to come, it will be understood as a watershed of
        innovation. Current Mac and iPhone users will be astonished
        to see how many of their beloved Mac OS X innovations had
        their roots in NeXTSTEP. There are many lessons about
        product innovation, market acceptance, and the creative
        people involved, that have yet to be uncovered.
        </p><p>
        
        This web site details part of our unique collection of NeXT
        related products and assorted items which grew up around
        NeXT Computer ecosystem, including of course NeXT hardware
        but also those rare items such as dealer sales kits, logo'd
        clothing, NeXT jewelry, banners, training tapes for
        servicing NeXT computers and printers, developer guides,
        plus third party software and hardware products.
        </p><p>
        
        While the site describes only part of the actual
        collection, the site does cover over 800 NeXT and third
        party products, many with multipage brochures and white
        papers. If you were to print all the html and PDF documents
        it would be over 3,000 pages.
        </p><p>
        
        This site describes what may well be the most extensive
        NeXT related collection available today.
        </p><p>
        
        It's history worth preserving.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/8dc0160ef5e99c2bfb45abd90770b186e2eba397/318dd/img/what-i-wish-i-knew-as-a-junior-dev.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I've been a developer for over fifteen years and I've loved almost every minute of it. I can't imagine doing anything different but there are moments when I think back to starting out and how different the development landscape was, especially when it comes to learning how to code.</p>
<p>I'm really <em>not</em> that old, but things in the tech world move fast and there weren't as many resources around to help people get into frontend development and learn how to build something from HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. There wasn't as many great communitys like Dev or Hashnode or WeStryve, not learning platforms such as Free Code Camp or The Odin Project.</p>
<p>So a lot of my early career felt like fumbling around for me, picking up everything I could from senior developers, hoping that they knew what they were doing, reading as many books as a I could and practicing my craft.</p>
<p>It's fair to say there were quite a few things I wish I'd known a lot earlier in my career that could have helped me progress faster or just develop both my coding skills, as well as my more complimentary skills, such as dealing with people or learning <em>how</em> to learn.</p>
<p>Hopefully, with this article I can distill what I've learned to date and share some things to watch out for and take on board to help you with your career as a frontend developer.</p>
<p><em>(Pssst -- If you like this article, come</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/kendalmintcode"><em>find me on Twitter</em></a> <em>where I post regular helpful content every day)</em></p>
<h2>Start writing a blog</h2>
<p>This very blog you're reading now (whether it's on my own website or my Dev or Hashnode accounts) has grown quite popular and that's great. But I really wish I'd started much earlier and written more frequently.</p>
<p>Honestly, blogging is such a great way to cement what you've learned <em>as you're learning it</em>. You absolutely do not have to be a developer with X years in the business, nor do you have to be an expert.</p>
<p>All you need is a curios mind and to think about writing for your past self: write the article you wish you'd had on the subject.</p>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/551d70ccb71c4ae17340ca3c67475fe0bb796b93/cc36f/img/workplace-2303851_640.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>As a bonus, if you fix something particularly tricky, you'll be able to refer back to your own article to help you solve it in the future!</p>
<p>My friend Catlin Pit has a couple of recommended articles on blogging too:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://catalins.tech/should-you-start-a-blog-as-a-developer" title="Catlin Pit's article on starting a developer blog">Should you start a blog as a developer</a></li>
<li><a href="https://catalins.tech/how-to-start-your-blog-as-a-developer" title="Catalin Pit's article on how to start a blog">How to start a blog</a> - a common question after 'what do I write about?'</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ask more questions!</h2>
<p>This seems obvious, but in my experience it's really not. A lot of developers, especially those early on in their careers are easily intimidated by more experienced devs or just those that have been around longer, and this can prevent them from speaking up.</p>
<p>But you know what? That's how you learn: you ask questions, you get answers (and, back to the previous point, you now have content for a blog article!).</p>
<p>Never be afraid of asking questions, especially if you're stuck on something. There are no stupid questions, but I'm not going to lie, you will at some point come across arrogant or unhelpful people who will make you feel otherwise. My advice, ignore them and find more open and helpful people.</p>
<h2>Be honest on what you're passionate about</h2>
<p>If you love what you do and are fortunate enough to get to do that regularly, especially as a full time career then you've hit the jackpot.</p>
<p>However, I see a lot of people stuck in places and in roles that they just don't have the passion or drive for. I'm well aware that not everyone is fortunate enough to be able to pick and choose, but as developers we have long held a valuable position in the job market where there are more jobs than there are developers.</p>
<p>But this is really about having a truthful discussion with your inner dev and being both honest about what you <em>really</em> enjoy doing/not doing, and realistic about how to start a role doing this.</p>
<p>For example, if you really really really don't like PHP, then take care when interviewing or seeking out roles in development agencies where WordPress is heavily featured.</p>
<p>This advice is especially true for those seeking, perhaps, their first development roles. Be honest and candid about what's right for you and (if you're able to), don't just jump at the first opportunity that comes your way.</p>
<p>The more you can discover what direction you want to travel, the better aligned you'll be down the line in your career.</p>
<p>With all of the above said, please don't put pressure on yourself to decide too early. Sometimes you have to experience what you <em>don't</em> want to know what <em>is</em> right for you.</p>
<h2>Get a coding mentor</h2>
<p>I was supremely fortunate to have worked with some amazing developers back when I started. They were experienced, knowledgable, helpful and humble and really took me under their wing. I'll never be able to thank them enough.</p>
<p>Therefore, I'd highly recommend getting yourself a mentor to help with your development journey.</p>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f095de9a3d4e32487247b46342959b1cc2f8e9d1/3c273/img/people-2569234_640.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This is different from a teacher or tutor (although there is overlap at the edges of the roles): a mentor is a guiding light to help give you focus and direction, to answer questions and point you along the right path for your particular journey.</p>
<p>I'd recommend taking a look at <a href="https://codingcoach.io/" title="Coding Coach website">Coding Coach</a> or my very own <a href="https://robkendal.co.uk/mentorship" title="Rob Kendal coding mentorship programmes">mentorship programmes</a> to find a mentor that's right for you.</p>
<h2>Mentor others</h2>
<p>Following on from the last point, you too can be a mentor and again, you don't have to have coded for decades or be an absolute expert.</p>
<p>Think about where you are on your journey and how far you've come. Even if you're 6-8 months into learning to code, there are people only 1-2 <em>weeks</em> into theirs; these are the people you can definitely help out.</p>
<p>That said, if you <em>are</em> quite experienced, then all the more reason to help someone else who's just starting out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Become the guide you wish you'd had when you started</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's rewarding beyond measure, and a win win situation: someone getting started is helped and guided, and you learn so much in the process, believe me.</p>
<h2>You don't get what you don't ask for</h2>
<p>I'm from Yorkshire in the UK and there's a saying in this North East part of the world: Shy bairns get nowt.</p>
<p>In essence we're really saying that 'you get nothing by keeping quiet'.</p>
<p>It's easy to look at seemingly successful developers and popular Twitter personas and assume that everyone has lucky breaks and opportunity just falls from the sky.</p>
<p>To be honest, this does happen to a small number of people, but most of the successful people you'll know are a combination of trying (a lot), keeping their eyes open for opportunities and only a little sprinkle of luck.</p>
<p>Most of the time it's about asking for what you want. Now I'm not suggesting you just go kicking your boss' door in a demanding a raise, but in all seriousness, if you think you deserve a pay rise, prove it and then <em>ask for it</em>!</p>
<p>Want to switch up your career? Ask about training programs at your current workplace. Want to talk to someone on LinkedIn about their career? Ask them.</p>
<p>The worst that will happen is you get a 'no'. In which case, time to move on and try something else.</p>
<h2>Keep track of all your wins</h2>
<p>This is a big one for me. It's very easy as a human to skew towards the negative. Even if you've just launched five features on a product used by millions, I would bet that it's that single tiny error that happened that you'll be thinking about, right?!</p>
<p>I keep a notebook of little victories and compliments I've received and look through them from time to time, especially when the <a href="https://robkendal.co.uk/blog/2019-05-10-fighting-imposter-syndrome-as-a-developer" title="Fighting imposter syndrome as a developer">imposter syndrome</a> kicks in from time to time.</p>
<p>It's not about ego or vanity, but it's about celebrating your victories and remembering how far you've come.</p>
<h2>You don't have to know everything</h2>
<p>The world of deveopment is HUGE. I mean seriously almost infinite. Between languages, frameworks, patterns, platforms, frontend, backend, the list goes on.</p>
<p>When you're starting out there can be an overwhelming urge to have to know everything all at once. But I'm here to tell you that you don't need to know everything and, in reality, you can't or won't ever know it all q-- the landscape is just too vast.</p>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3f6e59a451413441a9a9f410a3dd2bf527cf301f/b6003/img/magic-cube-1976725_640.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Of course, as a frontend developer starting out, I'd recommend focussing on the three core pillars of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but once you're getting into the swing of things, start to add bits and pieces to your knowledge depending on what takes your fancy.</p>
<h2>Senior doesn't mean encylopedia</h2>
<p>Just because someone is a senior developer or an architect or principle, or has been programming for 100's of years, does not automatically make them the all knowing beasts you think they may be.</p>
<p>I'll let you into a secret: I've been developing in a fullstack fashion for over fifteen years and I still have to look up some of the most trivial snippets of code; I still miss semicolons out of things and I still make mistakes.</p>
<p>Sure, I know a lot about a lot, but there's oceans of knowledge I haven't even sailed upon. Just because people have been around the block doesn't directly equate to an infallible, all-knowing knowledge. Neither does it mean they're always automatically right or know better.</p>
<p>The point I'm driving at here is that just because you're less experienced or starting out doesn't mean your ideas are less valuable or that you have less to contribute.</p>
<p>It's also why adopting a life long approach to learning is so important as a developer.</p>
<h2>Titles don't really mean much in the long run</h2>
<p>Another thing to bear in mind is that some people get caught up in a title race and it's easy to think that becoming a 'principle developer' or 'lead architect' is the end goal. Yes, titles and recognition are nice and there's money and rewards that come with more senior titles, but they don't always reflect the abilities of the holder nor</p>
<p>I'm not saying that it's not OK to have 'become a lead developer' as a goal, but don't set your standards by the titles that you, or others, hold. It's your attitude, actions, and what you contribute to the development community that will ultimately shape your legacy.</p>
<h2>Networking is essential!!</h2>
<p>It really is <em>who you know</em> not always <em>what you know</em>.</p>
<p>I wish I'd spent more time making connections with other developers, recruiters, leaders, and makers …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>As Bitcoin approaches a new price record after 3 years delay a new wave of its popularity and advertisement is expected. In such waves all the risks, downsides, pitfalls are usually hidden and the bright future is pleasantly described. I want to highlight all those dark corners and also to give my view of this field.</p>

<h3 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>

<p>As the first decentralized digital currency Bitcoin’s main purpose was to serve as a digital money service that requires no trust in a central authority, and that will be free from control. But with an extreme raise of its value it gained another purpose — as an investment asset. Current data suggests that the second purpose greatly supersedes the original one.</p>

<p>In accordance with those two purposes, we’ll consider two types of downsides and risks — technical and economical.</p>

<h3 id="technical-downsides"><strong>Technical downsides</strong></h3>

<p>Two main technical downsides of Bitcoin are inefficiency and limited scalability.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption/">Bitcoin energy consumption index</a>, as of the time of writing, one single transaction consumes 700 kWh of energy, a huge waste. And this consumption will only increase with the growth of the network.</p>

<p>But increasing energy consumption isn’t the biggest problem since the growth of the total number of transactions is limited due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_scalability_problem">Bitcoin scalability problem</a>. It is estimated that the whole Bitcoin throughput can’t be more than 7 transactions per second on average. This is the dead-end for its original purpose.</p>

<p>While the absolute majority of other cryptocurrencies are useless imitators or straight-up scams, some of them indeed have slight improvements or useful extensions. It’s hard to create something perfect from the first shot, after all. Technology advancement is an evolutionary process.</p>

<p>I find this risk the most important — an emergence of a novel cryptocurrency that will contain a critical mass of improvements and extensions. Or, it could be just decent cryptocurrency, but backed by strong financial institutions (though it’s unlikely that some government will ever release a truly decentralized currency).</p>

<h3 id="economic-picture"><strong>Economic picture</strong></h3>

<p>Bitcoin proponents will argue that technical limitations are not an issue. They like to compare Bitcoin with gold, and gold isn’t transporting on the left and right. What they don’t say is that gold is a <em>natural</em> resource that has a lot of different uses in electronics, medicine, or even in food. Also, it’s naturally hard to obtain, it’s produced only in rare cosmic events, like supernova explosions or neutron stars collisions. And what is Bitcoin without its original purpose?</p>

<p>Well, it’s certainly a masterpiece, the first of a kind. But in this perspective it’s comparable with works of arts. They also have value, but no particular, instrumental purpose.</p>

<p>Thus, Bitcoin value will be pure speculation in the future with more advanced technologies. But in its current price there is also a huge amount of speculation. With no doubt the majority of people “invest” in Bitcoin just to raise a fortune, not to use it as payment. Though, I wouldn’t call it an investment. A typical investment is supposed to be spent on the production of new value. But no new value is produced when you buy Bitcoin. This is why it looks just like a financial pyramid — newcomers are the only reason for the price growth.</p>

<h3 id="a-huge-oxymoron"><strong>A huge oxymoron</strong></h3>

<p>Finally, I want to address the cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p>

<p>Despite imperfections, Bitcoin was built with great ideals in mind.
Decentralization and freedom are the values that humankind must pursue, I believe.</p>

<p>But the ecosystem that arose around Bitcoin is mostly ignorant of those ideals.</p>

<p><strong><em>Exchanges</em></strong></p>

<p>A huge part of the cryptocurrency world is the exchanges. 
But they are centralized! They are in control of your funds. You have to trust them. So there is no difference with an ordinary financial institution. Well, actually, there is. A cryptocurrency exchange found on the internet can be run by a high-school kid just for fun.</p>

<p>Exchanges possess a great value in cryptocurrencies and are responsible for a big part of all Bitcoin transactions. They are entities that have the power and resources to play with the market.</p>

<p>The problem of exchanges can’t be solved since truly decentralized exchanges are impossible or impractical.</p>

<p><strong><em>Mining pools</em></strong></p>

<p>A mining pool is a clever way to unite the computational resources needed for mining new blocks. But again, they are centralized and as a single miner you have to trust them. There are pools that require no trust in a coordinator, but they don’t propose additional incentives for a single miner.</p>

<p>A dozen mining pools generate around 75% of new Bitcoin blocks according to <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/charts/pools">these stats</a>. Control them — and you can control the network. Note that big exchanges have their own mining pools. Yeah, decentralization…</p>

<p><strong><em>Mixers</em></strong></p>

<p>Bitcoin mixer is a way to hide a transaction sender and receiver. The story is the same as with exchanges and pools. They are centralized in nature and this can’t be solved.</p>

<p><strong><em>Stable cryptocurrencies</em></strong></p>

<p>This is the most ridiculous part and the best indicator of all of this farce. For me “stable cryptocurrency” is just an oxymoron. Operators of such mimic currencies are not only centralized and you have to trust them — they do not even comply with the laws of countries that print original currencies. They are worse than ordinary banks.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">coinmarketcap</a>, Tether, a USD mimic, is in the third place by a total market value and largely exceeds Bitcoin in transactions volume. A clusterfuck in the world of cryptocurrencies, in my opinion. Decentralization? What decentralization?</p>

<h3 id="the-future"><strong>The future</strong></h3>

<p>While I’m a big proponent of decentralization, I don’t believe in the longtime future of Bitcoin. The only reason for its future survival is the respect of its users. I have no idea what price it can achieve, but I’m 100% sure the price will have a speculative nature.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
 		
<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about corporate knowledge management systems recently.</p>



<p>If we think about a company as an organism, then a knowledge management system is essentially the (collective) brain that keeps that organism alive and running. A corporate knowledge management system should contain every single bit of codifiable information within the company resulting in a library of all projects, processes and procedures.</p>



<p>In an ideal state, it is the single source of truth that helps to inform every individual in the firm about what everyone else is up to. Information should be easy to add (input) as well as easy to search and find (output) resulting in quick knowledge transfer between different employees.</p>



<p>In reality, however, this hardly ever is the case. As anyone who has ever worked at a larger company can attest to, company knowledge bases always end up being a huge mess. </p>



<p>What starts with a neatly organized Confluence wiki, over time morphs into a multi-headed monster consisting of millions of notes and documents that live across Google Docs, Dropbox Paper, Asana and half a dozen different wiki tools. Most docs will be outdated, some will contradict others and the one you are really looking for only shows up on page 14 of your search results.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/monster-4.png"></p><p>It seems like things usually start to fall apart once a company surpasses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar number</a> of 150 employees. This is probably when people start to realize that all the different documents of <em>explicit knowledge</em> they were amassing over the years have been held together with <em>implicit knowledge</em>. </p>



<p>It’s easy to find – and understand – the right documents when you know every other person in the company, but once you’re past that point, you need a system to organize all the data so that people can make sense of it.</p>



<p>The idea behind tools like Notion is to solve this problem by using just one tool for all your different knowledge documents. Instead of Google Docs AND Asana AND Trello AND Airtable, you just do everything in Notion. This reduces complexity because you don’t have to switch and search across different apps. At the same time, Notion forces you to think about a system that makes information easy to find with its folder-like structure and links between different databases.</p>



<p>I’ve never used Notion with more than half a dozen people myself, but from what I’ve heard from people at larger companies, Notion knowledge bases also don’t scale very well beyond a certain number of users. Once too many people start contributing to it, things become bloated and unnavigable.</p>



<p>A friend at Stripe recently suggested – half-jokingly – that we should hire a librarian to organize all our internal data and documentation. The more I think about it, the more I like the idea. Perhaps every company should hire a Chief Notion Officer once it hits 100 employees?!</p>



<p>An alternative approach to Notion is a knowledge management system that can live across different tools and without active manual curation because it’s based on really powerful search. The folder structure of your Google Drive, for example, doesn’t <em>really</em> matter because looking up documents via search is faster and more convenient. Meta search tools like <a href="https://usefyi.com/">FYI</a> are supposed to offer the same but across different productivity tools.</p>



<p>But again I’m skeptical that this really works beyond a certain amount of users (and thus documents). I remember even Google’s internal search engine doing only a mediocre job of surfacing the most relevant documents (and even if it did you weren’t sure if there wasn’t a better or more up-to-date version of it).</p>



<p>I’m sure we’ll get there eventually, but until then we probably need a mix of automated search and manual human help – which is where Slack comes in. I’ve <a href="https://twitter.com/lehrjulian/status/1097940802737704960">always thought</a> Slack plus Notion plus <a href="https://www.atspoke.com/">Spoke</a> would make a really powerful product (and I’m surprised Slack hasn’t made any major acquisitions in this space).</p>



<p>If you think about it, Slack is basically a search engine powered by humans: Most Slack messages are just questions. <a href="https://kwokchain.com/2019/08/16/the-arc-of-collaboration/">It’s 911 for when everything else fails</a>. So if Slack had access to your entire knowledge base, it could answer at least the most commonly asked questions automatically. The rest would still get answered manually by the channel participants. Or your Chief Notion Officer.</p>

The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine has been theorized to provide protection against COVID-19. In a new study published in mBio, an open-access journal of the American Society for Microbiology researchers provide further proof of this theory.</p><div id="text">
<p>Researches have shown, in new study <a href="https://mbio.asm.org/content/11/6/e02628-20">published in mBio</a>, that mumps IgG titers, or levels of IgG antibody, are inversely <strong>correlated</strong> with severity in recovered COVID-19 patients previously vaccinated with the MMR II vaccine produced by Merck. MMR II contains the <strong>Edmonston strain of measles</strong>, the Jeryl Lynn (B-level) strain of mumps, and the Wistar RA 27/3 strain of rubella.</p>
<p>"We found a statistically significant inverse correlation between mumps titer levels and COVID-19 severity in people under age 42 <strong>who have had MMR II vaccinations</strong>," said lead study author Jeffrey E. Gold, president of World Organization, in Watkinsville, Georgia. "This adds to other associations demonstrating that <strong>the MMR vaccine may be protective against COVID-19</strong>. It also may explain why children have a much lower COVID-19 case rate than adults, as well as a much lower death rate. The majority of children get their first MMR vaccination around 12 to 15 months of age and a second one from 4 to 6 years of age."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We found a statistically significant inverse correlation between mumps titer levels and COVID-19 severity in people under age 42 who have had MMR II vaccinations</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the new study, the researchers divided 80 subjects into 2 groups. The MMR II group consisted of 50 U.S. born subjects who would primarily <strong>have MMR antibodies from the MMR II vaccine</strong>. A comparison group of 30 subjects had no record of MMR II vaccinations, and would primarily have MMR antibodies from other sources, including prior measles, mumps, and/or rubella illnesses. The researchers found a significant inverse correlation (rs = -0.71, P &lt; 0.001) between mumps titers and COVID-19 severity within the MMR II group. There were no significant correlations between mumps titers and disease severity in the comparison group, between mumps titers and age in the MMR II group, or between severity and measles or rubella titers in either group.</p>
<p>Within the MMR II group, mumps titers of 134 to 300 AU/ml (n=8) were only found in those who were functionally immune or asymptomatic. All with mild COVID-19 symptoms had mumps titers below 134 AU/ml (n=17). All with moderate symptoms had mumps titers below 75 AU/ml (n=11). All who had been hospitalized and required oxygen had mumps titers below 32 AU/ml (n=5). Titers were measured by Quest Diagnostics using their standard diagnostic protocol.</p>
<p>"This is the <strong>first immunological study</strong> to evaluate the relationship between the MMR II vaccine and COVID-19. The statistically significant inverse correlation between mumps titers and COVID-19 indicates that there is a relationship involved that warrants further investigation," said coauthor David J. Hurley, PhD, professor and molecular microbiologist at the University of Georgia. "The MMR II vaccine is considered a safe vaccine with very few side effects. If it has the ultimate benefit of preventing infection from COVID-19, preventing the spread of COVID-19, reducing the severity of it, or a combination of any or all of those, it is a very high reward low risk ratio intervention. Maximum seropositivity is achieved through two vaccinations at least 28 days apart. Based upon our study, it would be prudent to vaccinate those over 40 regardless of whether or not they already have high serum MMR titers."</p>

<p>The <a href="https://asm.org/">American Society for Microbiology</a> is one of the largest professional societies dedicated to the life sciences and is composed of 30,000 scientists and health practitioners. ASM's mission is to promote and advance the microbial sciences.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Ever since I came to know about the <code>doskey</code> command in MS-DOS, I could barely stop myself using it. Not many Windows developers are familiar with this command, but this is a very powerful command to have in the arsenal of any Windows developer who frequently works on command line. If you type <code>doskey /?</code>, here is what you will see:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
Edits command lines, recalls Windows commands, and creates macros.

DOSKEY [/REINSTALL] [/LISTSIZE=size] [/MACROS[:ALL | :exename]]
  [/HISTORY] [/INSERT | /OVERSTRIKE] [/EXENAME=exename] [/MACROFILE=filename]
  [macroname=[text]]
vvv 
  /REINSTALL          Installs a new copy of Doskey.
  /LISTSIZE=size      Sets size of command history buffer.
  /MACROS             Displays all Doskey macros.
  /MACROS:ALL         Displays all Doskey macros for all executables which have
                      Doskey macros.
  /MACROS:exename     Displays all Doskey macros for the given executable.
  /HISTORY            Displays all commands stored in memory.
  /INSERT             Specifies that new text you type is inserted in old text.
  /OVERSTRIKE         Specifies that new text overwrites old text.
  /EXENAME=exename    Specifies the executable.
  /MACROFILE=filename Specifies a file of macros to install.
  macroname           Specifies a name for a macro you create.
  text                Specifies commands you want to record.

UP and DOWN ARROWS recall commands; ESC clears command line; F7 displays
command history; ALT+F7 clears command history; F8 searches command
history; F9 selects a command by number; ALT+F10 clears macro definitions.

The following are some special codes in Doskey macro definitions:
$T     Command separator.  Allows multiple commands in a macro.
$1-$9  Batch parameters.  Equivalent to %1-%9 in batch programs.
$*     Symbol replaced by everything following macro name on command line.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I will not be explaining all the features of this command, but will elaborate on very important feature called <code>MACROS</code>. This command lets you create a shorthand alias for your command. Once you create an alias, you can trigger that command using the alias. The alias can also take the command line parameters that you would have otherwise passed to the original command.</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>Let’s say that you frequently execute command <code>findstr /sin &lt;search string&gt;</code> to search a string in a directory, you could set an alias for that command:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>C:\&gt;doskey find=findstr /sin $*

C:\&gt;find abc

&lt;&lt;results of findstr&gt;&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, I have created an alias <code>find</code> and mapped it to the DOS command I want to execute i.e. <code>findstr /sin</code> in this case. The parameter <code>abc</code> to the alias is forwarded to the DOS command that is mapped to that alias.</p>

<p>However, I find <code>doskey</code> more useful in triggering various development commands too like build, run, copying files, opening debugger, etc. To give an example, the command to build dotnet’s <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/workflow/building/coreclr/README.md">coreclr</a> is <code>&lt;repo_root&gt;\build.cmd -subset clr -configuration checked -arch x64</code>. I have mapped <code>bclr</code> alias to this command:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>C:\runtime&gt;doskey bclr=pushd .&amp;C:\runtime\build.cmd -subset clr -configuration checked -arch x64&amp;popd

D:\some_dir&gt;bclr

&lt;&lt;triggers build for x64 checked&gt;&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now imagine you need to trigger the <code>bclr</code> command for other architectures and configurations. You could pass the arguments in the form of <code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code> and so forth to the alias. For that, you need to configure alias to accept parameter.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>D:\some_dir&gt;doskey bclr=pushd .&amp;C:\runtime\build.cmd -subset clr -configuration $2 -arch $1&amp;popd

D:\some_dir&gt;bclr arm64 checked

&lt;&lt;trigger build for arm64 checked&gt;&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="my-favorite-aliases">My favorite aliases</h2>

<p>Here are some of my favorite aliases that I have configured and use frequently.</p>

<h3 id="navigation">Navigation</h3>

<p>Below are some of the aliases I set for navigating between various directories while on DOS command line.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>C:\&gt;doskey ..=..\$*
C:\&gt;doskey ...=..\..\$*
C:\&gt;doskey mydir=cd /d C:\this\is\mydir

C:\deep\down\dir\structure&gt;..
C:\deep\down\dir&gt;
C:\deep\down\dir&gt;..anotherdir
C:\deep\down\anotherdir&gt;
C:\deep\down\anotherdir&gt;mydir
C:\this\is\mydir&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="development-commands">Development commands</h3>

<p>You can set alias to perform your development activities like building, opening your favorite IDE or debugger.</p>

<p>To open your project using appropriate version of Visual Studio:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>C:\&gt;doskey worksln="C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe" C:\git\work\somedir\work.sln
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To trigger build command:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>C:\&gt;doskey buildall=pushd C:\git\work&amp;buildir\build.cmd x64 checked&amp;popd 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To configure windbg with favorite settings:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>C:\&gt;doskey dbg=C:\debuggers\windbg.exe -o -y C:\git\work\bin\symboldirPDB -srcpath C:\git\work $*
C:\&gt;dbg work.exe hello world
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To set the environment variables:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>C:\&gt;doskey jitasm=set COMPlus_JitDisasm=$*

C:\&gt;jitasm HelloWorld
C:\&gt;set COMPl
COMPlus_JitDisasm=HelloWorld
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="getfindopen-aliases">Get/Find/Open aliases</h3>

<p>You can also configure some aliases that can help you manipulate the aliases that you have already set.</p>

<p>To list all the aliases set so far:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>c:\&gt;doskey allkeys=doskey /macros

c:\&gt;allkeys
find=findstr /sin $*
buildall=pushd C:\git\work&amp;buildir\build.cmd x64 checked&amp;popd
bclr=pushd .&amp;C:\runtime\build.cmd -subset clr -configuration checked -arch x64&amp;popd
..=..\$*
jitasm=set COMPlus_JitDisasm=$*
worksln="C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe" C:\git\work\somedir\work.sln
dbg=C:\debuggers\windbg.exe -o -y C:\git\work\bin\symboldirPDB -srcpath C:\git\work $*
...=..\..\$*
mydir=cd /d C:\this\is\mydir
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To search for an alias or command, you could set below alias inside a macro file (see below for macro file)</p>

<div><div><pre><code>c:\&gt;doskey getkey=doskey /macros | findstr /i $*
c:\&gt;getkey asm
jitasm=set COMPlus_JitDisasm=$*
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="macro-file">Macro file</h2>

<p>Instead of setting individual aliases using <code>doskey</code>, you could have all aliases in a text file and import it in at once using <code>/macrofile</code> switch.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>C:\&gt; more myaliases.txt
find=findstr /sin $*
bclr=pushd .&amp;C:\runtime\build.cmd -subset clr -configuration checked -arch x64&amp;popd
worksln="C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe" C:\git\work\somedir\work.sln
buildall=pushd C:\git\work&amp;buildir\build.cmd x64 checked&amp;popd 
dbg=C:\debuggers\windbg.exe -o -y C:\git\work\bin\symboldirPDB -srcpath C:\git\work $*
jitasm=set COMPlus_JitDisasm=$*
..=..\$*
...=..\..\$*
mydir=cd /d C:\this\is\mydir

C:\&gt;doskey /macrofile=myaliases.txt

&lt;&lt; all aliases registered &gt;&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you want to update the aliases and re-import it, you could do something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Open the macro file imported
c:\&gt;doskey okeys=notepad c:\myaliases.txt 

# Re-import macro file
c:\&gt;doskey updatekeys=doskey /macrofile=C:\myaliases.txt

# Now you could update and re-import the aliases

c:\&gt;okeys
&lt;&lt; update aliases.txt &gt;&gt;

c:\&gt;updatekeys
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>

<p>I usually have my aliases in a file <code>myaliases.txt</code>.  I wanted a way that every time I open my command prompt, all the aliases should be registered without me having to run the <code>doskey /macrofile</code> command manually. For that, I <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/run-command-prompt-commands-desktop-shortcut/">created a DOS command prompt shortcut</a>. Then, I opened the “Properties” of that shortcut and as shown below, in the “Target” section, execute the <code>doskey /macrofile</code> command.</p>

<p><img width="70%" height="70%" src="https://kunalspathak.github.io/assets/img/doskey/command-shortcut.JPG"></p>

<p>Here is the complete command that I have in “Target” section:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /k "set reporoot=c:\git\runtime&amp;&amp;set BuildArch=arm64&amp;&amp;set BuildType=Debug&amp;&amp; doskey /MACROFILE=C:\myaliases.txt"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you see above, I also set some environment variables like <code>reporoot</code> and <code>BuildArch</code>. I use these environment variables inside <code>myaliases.txt</code> and so I make sure that they are set before I import the <code>myaliases.txt</code> file as a <code>doskey macro</code>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p><code>doskey</code> proved to be a very productive command for me and I realized that there is no limit on how creative you could get with it. I hope you find some good use of this command to make your day-to-day DOS commands productive.</p>

<p>Namaste!</p>

		<h3>② Source Files</h3>
		<p>Tell the compiler which source files to compile. There are various options:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Manually list all source files (possibly including <code>module-info.java</code>), separated by space</li>
			<li>Automatically determine all source files with <code>`find ${path_to_src} -name *.java`</code>
				(include backticks, replace <code>${path_to_src}</code> with actual path; 🐧)</li>
			<li>Use <code>--source-path</code> or <code>--module-source-path</code> (not covered here)</li>
			<!-- <li>See alternative box <span class="cheat-modules-reference">Source Path</span></li> -->

		<h3>① Path to JARs</h3>
		<p>Tell the compiler where to find your application's JARs.
			Works exactly as during compilation, but remember to include your JARs.</p>

		<h3>② More Options</h3>
		<p>Option of particular interest when running modules:</p>
		<dl>

		</ul>
		<p>If the main class is in a JAR on the module path:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><code>--module ${module}</code> if <code>jar</code> recorded <code>${module}</code>'s main class</li>

<p>Other than that, I hope you like this sheet and it helps you, should you ever need to build a module by hand.
Why you would need to do that?
Because building modules from the command line is the best way to get to know them.
So if you're <a href="https://nipafx.dev/course-java-module-system/">learning what Java's module system has to offer</a>, I recommend putting your build tool aside for a day and go old-school.</p></article></section></main></div></div>]]>

			<h2><img src="https://labs.blueboxsw.com/poacher2020/favicon.png">&nbsp;Poacher2020 Instructions</h2>
			
			<p>Poacher2020 is a free, real-time Texas Hold 'em poker coach used to analyze previously played hands or while playing the game. It is useful at helping you find holes in your game — times when you bet too much or too little.</p>
			<p>Poacher2020 gives you the strength of your hand based on the number of players, your position at the table, and number of live hands.</p>
			<p>Strength is measured in big blinds, where positive numbers mean you are expected, on average, to win this amount. Negative numbers mean you are expected to lose this amount.</p> 
			<p>In general, you should be betting positive amounts (multiply the number by the current big blind), and avoid playing when the value is negative.</p>
			<p>There may be reasons to play negative value situations, such as when you are chip lead against much smaller stacks, or when your spidey-sense tells you an opponent is bluffing.</p>
			<p>There are also reasons to avoid betting positive value situations, such as when you are short stacked or when setting a trap.</p>
			<p>To start, select the number of players at the top. As players get knocked out, make sure you adjust this number. You can change it mid-hand if you need to.</p>
			<p>You also will want to select your position at the table. Each time you select Reset (or press Enter/Return/Space), your position will shift to the right to align with your position from the dealer. You can also change this value mid-hand. You may need to adjust this as players get knocked out.</p>
			<p>Click the two cards in your hand and Poacher2020 will show you the value of the hand for all positions at the table, with your position marked. Later positions are always considered stronger than earlier positions.</p>
			<p>As additional cards are revealed, select them and Poacher2020 will update the data.</p>
			<p>The pyramid below the initial position strengths shows values for when players drop out of the hand.</p>
			<p>For instance, you may be in position 3 of 5 players (UTG), but if the two players in front of you drop out of the hand, you will be in position 1 of 3 live hands, a weaker position. Roll overs show this information.</p>
			<p>Similarly, if you start in position 3 of 5 but the two players after you drop out, you will be in position 3 of 3 live hands, a stronger position.</p>
			<p>You can use your browser controls (back/forward) to review play. You can also click on cards to rewind to that situation (ie, click on any of the flop cards to go back to the flop).</p>
			<p>You can use bookmarks to save hands or copy URLs to share on social media.</p>
			<p>Poacher2020 is based on limited data from an artificial intelligence game-playing engine and should be considered an estimated value of strength.</p>
			<p>No guarantees, warrantees, or compliance with any municipalities, are provided. Treat it as skeptically as you would any other free information on the web.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf">eqaf</a>, a constant-time compare function implementation in <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>, is a great case to demonstrate the <a href="https://signalsandthreads.com/language-design/#0008401">predictable performance of OCaml’s compiler</a>. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>The goal of a constant-time compare function is to avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack">timing attacks</a>, which requires fully deterministic and predictable runtime performance.</li>
<li>Usually, cryptography functions are written in assembly to have total control of resulting binary and avoid unneeded optimization by the compiler.</li>
<li>However, <a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf">eqaf</a> showed us that you can write clean OCaml and get simple and predictable resulting assembly.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>This is the first issue of <a href="https://learnocamlthehardway.substack.com/welcome">Learn OCaml the Hard Way</a>. A publication about learning OCaml from the ground up.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="about-garbage-collection">About Garbage Collection</h2>
<p>It’s hard to have a stable runtime performance for languages that comes with a garbage collector. To have a predictable runtime performance characteristic in these languages, the following rules are usually required to be followed religiously:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid garbage collections by avoiding memory allocations.</li>
<li>Avoid boxed values to generate assembly as low-level as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, the resulting code are usually unidiomatic and hard to maintain.</p>
<h2 id="compiler-explorer">Compiler Explorer</h2>
<p><a href="https://godbolt.org/">Compiler Explorer</a> is a handy tool for exploring compilers and its assembly output. It has built-in OCaml support and removes boilerplate automatically. I recommend you to test the following example with it.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="code">Code</h2>
<p>Here’s the implementation of <code>eqaf</code>’s <code>equal</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ocaml"><span>let</span><span>[@</span>inline<span>]</span> get x i <span>=</span> String.unsafe_get x i <span>|&gt;</span> Char.code

  <span>then</span> false
  <span>else</span> equal <span>~</span>ln<span>:</span>al a b
</code></pre></div><p>Besides basic OCaml syntaxes[1], interesting bits in the example are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can force OCaml to always inline a function via adding an attribute <code>[@inline]</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>String.unsafe_get</code> works like <code>String.get</code> but without bound-checking. It’s unsafe for most use-cases but it’s used here to <a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf/blob/master/lib/eqaf.ml#L3">avoid jumping to exception</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OCaml provides a FFI <code>external</code> for <a href="https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/intfc.html">interfacing with C</a>. Here we use it to call a primitive function provided by OCaml’s runtime <code>%caml_string_get16u</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>external</code> is always unsafe and should be really take care about.</li>
<li>Primitives are not stable. For example: <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-base64/pull/36">https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-base64/pull/36</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>n asr m</code> shifts <code>n</code> to the right by <code>m</code> bits. This is an arithmetic shift: the sign bit of <code>n</code> is replicated. The result is unspecified if <code>m &lt; 0</code> or <code>m &gt; Sys.int_size</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ref</code> creates a <a href="https://dev.realworldocaml.org/imperative-programming.html">reference cell</a> and allows in-place replacement with <code>:=</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>pred x</code> is <code>x - 1</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>lor</code>, <code>lxor</code>, and <code>land</code> are logical bit-wise <code>or</code>, <code>xor</code>, and <code>and</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the OCaml code is quite low-level (and not very functional). It’s still cleaner than most constant-time compare functions implemented in assembly.</p>

<p>Here’s the resulting assembly of the previous example, copied from the <code>eqaf</code> <a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf/blob/master/lib/eqaf.ml">source</a>. You can get the same output via <a href="https://godbolt.org/">Compiler Explorer</a>.</p>

Similar to their syndicates, AngelList is powering a new generation of Venture Capital Funds known as Rolling Venture Capital Funds. This will be an interesting evolution in the venture investing landscape. With a ongoing funding model and a diverse set of LPs, can emerging GPs use this new model to bring new forms of Venture Investing to help better serve startups?</p><p>With a quarter-to-quarter funding model, these Rolling Funds will have cashflow similar to that of their startup compatriots. Recurring money in, recurring expenses out. A lot of the new GPs that are emerging to start these funds are former startup founders who have been part of a recurring revenue business. </p><p>Venture capital funds have traditionally operated in a singular investing model, equity. As startups begin to grow and require capital to help do so, VC funds step in and provide capital in return for equity in the business. Given the risk involved, VC typically need to maximize their equity positions so that they companies that emerge as winners can return enough capital to cover their losses. The issue is that the model in which these companies grow isn’t so stepwise, they don’t get huge chunks of revenue dumped on them like &nbsp;in a funding round, their growth is gradual, with deferred revenue meaning that their revenue and customer base can often outgrow their capabilities with the burn rate they set based on their funding round.</p><p>With a new rolling venture capital model could we find new ways to adapt this? With fresh capital available to rolling fund GPs each quarter, could we find ways to inject capital and liquidity into startups on a more rolling basis, just like the subscriptions in these new funds. With more consistent access to capital, could we help more portfolio companies become winners as they use this capital to help grow faster and gain traction? Can we take these new tools and help innovate access to capital for startups the same way founders and entrepreneurs innovate products and service?</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<img src="https://postgres.ai/assets/images/thumbnails/dle-2.0-blog.png" alt="Database Lab 2.0 release">
</p>
<h2 id="database-lab-engine-2-0-for-postgresql-released">Database Lab Engine 2.0 for PostgreSQL released</h2>
<p>The Postgres.ai team is proud to announce version 2.0 of Database Lab Engine (DLE) for PostgreSQL, a modern database tool for building powerful development and testing environments based on <a href="https://postgres.ai/docs/questions-and-answers#what-is-thin-cloning-thin-vs-thick-clones">thin cloning</a>. Using Database Lab API or CLI (and if you are using Database Lab SaaS, GUI), on a single machine with, say, a 1 TiB disk, you can easily create and destroy dozens of database copies of size 1 TiB each. All these copies are independently modifiable and created/destroyed in just a few seconds. This can become a game-changer in your development and testing workflow, improving time-to-market, and reducing costs of your non-production infrastructure.</p>
<p>This release continues our strategy to automate all routine tasks such as initialization of the PostgreSQL data directory, data transformation, and snapshot management. In DLE 2.0, all these tasks can be flexibly configured in a single configuration file. As a result, building dev&amp;test environments for projects with many databases (such as those that adopted microservice architecture) becomes much easier.</p>
<p>The previous versions of the Database Lab introduced the core technology: thin clone provisioning, based on either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS">ZFS</a> (default) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_Volume_Manager_(Linux)">LVM</a>. It was already possible to provision full-sized multi-terabyte database clones in just a few seconds and use them for a broad spectrum of tasks such as database schema changes verification, SQL query analysis, or general application testing.</p>
<p>Version 2.0 speeds up and empowers the initialization of DLE itself. Instead of using custom scripts for initial and continuous data retrieval, it is now possible to configure everything in a declarative manner to get the data and be up and running.</p>
<h2 id="updates-in-dle-2-0">Updates in DLE 2.0</h2>
<ul>
<li>Automated data retrieval: specify the source and the method of initializing the data directory and how it is to be updated</li>
<li>Both physical (pg_basebackup, WAL-G, more) and logical methods (dump/restore, Amazon RDS, Heroku Postgres, more) are supported (see the guide <a href="https://postgres.ai/docs/guides/data">Database Lab Engine data sources</a>)</li>
<li>Any managed cloud PostgreSQL offering is now supported, with additional features for Amazon RDS (see <a href="https://postgres.ai/docs/tutorials/database-lab-tutorial-amazon-rds">DLE tutorial for Amazon RDS</a> and the guide <a href="https://postgres.ai/docs/guides/data/rds">Data source: AWS RDS</a>)</li>
<li>For continuously updated physically initialized data directory (which effectively makes your DLE a specialized replica), snapshot management is fully automated: snapshots are created and destroyed based on the schedule defined in the configuration file (see the reference <a href="https://postgres.ai/docs/database-lab/config-reference#job-physicalsnapshot">Job physicalSnapshot</a>)</li>
<li>Basic data transformation and masking supported: specify any custom script that will be applied each time a new snapshot is prepared (option <code>preprocessingScript</code> in both <code>logicalSnapshot</code> and <code>physicalSnapshot</code> jobs, see the <a href="https://postgres.ai/docs/database-lab/config-reference">Configuration reference</a>)</li>
<li>License changed to <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html">AGPLv3</a></li>
<li>The documentation is significantly extended: 3 tutorials, 26 user guides, 6 references, and counting: <a href="https://postgres.ai/docs">http://postgres.ai/docs</a></li>

November 21, 2020 | https://vpnintel.com/insights/one-month-of-speedtest-data-shows-wireguard-is-2.5x-faster-than-openvpn | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://vpnintel.com/insights/one-month-of-speedtest-data-shows-wireguard-is-2.5x-faster-than-openvpn">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div>
      

      <p>
        WireGuard has gained traction over the past few years due, in part, to its high performance. We wondered how fast it really is, and realized that since we're already tracking VPN performance metrics for our <a href="https://vpnintel.com/unit-prices">VPN unit price index</a>, we could use the same data to answer the question, <strong>"how much faster is WireGuard than OpenVPN?"</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        We focused on Windscribe, Mullvad, and NordVPN, three providers that support both WireGuard and OpenVPN, and built a <a href="https://vpnintel.com/wireguard-vs-openvpn">dashboard</a> to visualize their comparative download speeds. We've embedded the charts for the week ending November 20, 2020 below along with some commentary.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that all data on this page represent speedtests between U.S.-based speedtest servers and VPNs. Our methodology section below has more on this.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      <h2>Windscribe</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
      For the week ending November 20, 2020, Windscribe's average download speed over OpenVPN was <span>134 Mbps</span> and its average download speed over WireGuard was <span>363 Mbps</span>. This means that by simply toggling the WireGuard option, Windscribe users can get a free 2.7x speed boost!
    </p>
    <p><img src="https://vpnintel.com/assets/news-dfd25285653d0eb57e648315d449e97092408746e1412f7bc9b4ed13395df2ab.svg">
       As of November 24, 2020, our 7-day Windscribe averages are 341 Mbps for WireGuard and 145 Mbps for OpenVPN.
    </p>

    
    <p>
        Windscribe's Wireguard speeds are almost always in the 300-400 Mbps ranges. Dig deeper into performance and pricing info on our dedicated pages for <a href="https://vpnintel.com/windscribe-wireguard">Windscribe WireGuard</a> and <a href="https://vpnintel.com/windscribe">Windscribe OpenVPN</a>.
      </p>

    <p>
      <h2>Mullvad</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
      Mullvad was one of WireGuard's earliest commercial supporters. For the week ending November 20, 2020, Mullvad's average download speed over OpenVPN was <span>258 Mbps</span> and its average download speed over WireGuard was <span>672 Mbps</span> – a free 2.6x performance boost for Mullvad's WireGuard users!
    </p>
    <p><img src="https://vpnintel.com/assets/news-dfd25285653d0eb57e648315d449e97092408746e1412f7bc9b4ed13395df2ab.svg">
       As of November 24, 2020, our 7-day Mullvad averages are 676 Mbps for WireGuard and 275 Mbps for OpenVPN.
    </p>

    
    <p>
        Mullvad's WireGuard speeds consistently land in the 600-700 Mbps range. Take a closer look at the pricing and performance data on our dedicated pages for <a href="https://vpnintel.com/mullvad">Mullvad WireGuard</a> and <a href="https://vpnintel.com/mullvad-openvpn">Mullvad OpenVPN</a>.
      </p>

    <p>
      <h2>NordVPN</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
        NordVPN launched support for WireGuard via its NordLynx product in Spring 2020. For the week ending November 20, 2020, Mullvad's average download speed over OpenVPN was <span>395 Mbps</span>. If the only number you remember from this page is NordVPN's average WireGuard download speed, you'll have the idea: a ridiculously fast <span>777 Mbps</span>, a 1.9x boost over its OpenVPN service.
      </p>
    <p><img src="https://vpnintel.com/assets/news-dfd25285653d0eb57e648315d449e97092408746e1412f7bc9b4ed13395df2ab.svg">
       As of November 24, 2020, our 7-day NordVPN averages are 780 Mbps for WireGuard and 419 Mbps for OpenVPN.
    </p>

    
    <p>
        You can see that NordVPN actually exceeds gigabit speeds on occasion. Its WireGuard speeds have a bit more variance than the other providers, but is uniformly well above 500 Mbps. For a deeper dive into NordLynx pricing and performance, check out our dedicated pages for <a href="https://vpnintel.com/nordvpn-wireguard">NordVPN WireGuard/NordLynx</a> and <a href="https://vpnintel.com/nordvpn">NordVPN OpenVPN</a>.
      </p>

    <p>
      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
    </p>
    <div>
      <p>
        For the week ending November 20, 2020, our global average download speed over OpenVPN was <span>251 Mbps</span> and <span>583 Mbps</span> over WireGuard – WireGuard outperformed OpenVPN by an incredible 230%!
      </p>
      <p>
        All the more incredible is that customers of these services get this speed boost for free simply by selecting the WireGuard option.
      </p>
      <p>
        NordVPN's 1.9x ratio is a little lower than the other providers', but it still has a massive raw speed advantage. If NordVPN can get its WireGuard speeds up to the 2.5x+ ratios held by Windscribe and Mullvad, then it will be consistently serving gigabit speeds.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's it for now! We think this stuff is interesting, so we'll probably make this a monthly or quarterly report. If you'd like to know when we launch new tools and publish reports like this, please join our newsletter:

       As of November 24, 2020, WireGuard clocks in at 598 Mbps to OpenVPN's 289 Mbps, a 2.1x speed boost.
    </p>

    <div>
      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>
        Our system is fully automated which lets us take thousands of readings a day. The data on this page represents speedtests conducted between servers based in the U.S. and VPN servers also based in the U.S. – the speeds shown here are likely to be faster than what you would experience at home.
      </p>

      <p>
        All speedtests are done over UDP with the native OpenVPN and WireGuard Linux clients except for NordVPN's NordLynx/WireGuard service which uses the NordVPN Linux client since NordVPN does not provide WireGuard configuration files.
      </p>

      <p>
        At least as of November 20, 2020, you'll see some lumps shared across the three charts which may reflect resource usage patterns for our own hosting provider. We will report back on this.

          <p>Throughout my career, I’ve developed some <em>opinions</em>. Some have worn particularly deep ruts,
reinforced by years of experience. I tried to figure out what these
had in common, and it’s
the idea that <strong>code in production is the only code that matters</strong>. Staging doesn’t
matter, code on your laptop doesn’t matter, QA doesn’t matter,
only production matters. Everything else is debt.</p>

<p>This perspective probably comes from years sitting in between
operations and product development. I strongly
believe that teams should optimize for getting code to production as quickly as
possible as well as responding to incidents in production.</p>

<p>This idea, and a lot of the practices it implies, can be
counter-intuitive or controversial, so I want to dive into them a little
further. What follows is a set of practices and principles I believe are true,
considering my underlying belief that code working in production is the only
code that matters.</p>

<h2 id="engineers-should-operate-their-code">1. Engineers should operate their code.</h2>

<p><strong>Engineers are the subject matter experts for the code they write and should be
responsible for operating it in production</strong>. In this context, “operating” means
deploying, instrumenting, and monitoring code as well as helping to resolve
incidents related to or impacting that code. The responsibility of operating
code aligns incentives - it encourages engineers to write code that is
observable and easy to debug, and connects them to what customers really care
about. It encourages them to be curious about how their code is performing in
production. Importantly, engineers should be on-call for their code - being
on-call creates a positive feedback loop and makes it easier to know if their
efforts in writing production-ready code are paying off. I’ve heard people
complain about the prospect of being on-call, so I’ll just ask this: if you’re
not on-call for your code, who is?</p>

<p>If you’re not currently on-call for your code but want to be, and can help
influence this decision, there are some things you can do. Set up PagerDuty (or
similar) schedules for each group of engineers responsible for specific
services or parts of your code. A good schedule has 6–8 engineers. There are
plenty of variations, but a typical template is to have one-week rotations,
where you’ll be on-call for secondary for a week and then primary for a week.
Configuring alerts is a separate topic, which probably deserves it’s own blog
post entirely, but focus on things that impact your customers (see:
Symptom-based alerting) and remember that you’re ultimately responsible for how
you respond to alerts, which means you can change them.</p>

<p>There are two talks I’d recommend watching that touch on the topic of
configuring alerts: Liz Fong-Jones talks about SLOs in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT4jbUzEVL0">Cultivating Production Excellence</a> and Aditya Mukerjee does a great job talking about techniques for
managing alerts in <a href="https://vimeo.com/274820572">Warning: This Talk Contains Content Known to the State of California to Reduce Alert Fatigue</a>.</p>

<h2 id="buy-almost-always-beatsbuild">2. Buy Almost Always Beats&nbsp;Build</h2>

<p><strong>If you can avoid building something, you should.</strong> Code is the most expensive
way to solve a problem that isn’t addressing a core area of your business. For
most small to mid-sized companies, there are open source or better yet, hosted
solutions that solve a wide range of common problems. I mean things like git
repository hosting (Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, etc), observability tooling
(Honeycomb, Lightstep, etc), managed databases (Amazon RDS, Confluent Kafka,
etc), alerting (PagerDuty, OpsGenie, etc) and a whole host of other commodity
technologies. This even applies to your infrastructure - if you can help
it, don’t roll your own Kubernetes clusters (side note: do you even need to use
Kubernetes?), don’t roll your own load balancers if you can use Amazon ELB or
ALBs.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here">NIH</a> syndrome is very real and some companies get burned badly by
this. I’ve seen teams light time and money on fire reinventing components when
better, more battle-tested alternatives exist in the market. Those same teams
almost always end up spending years contending with the resulting technical
debt. If you’re on such a team and have the will and ability to impact change,
start rolling back these decisions one by one. Migrate your databases to a
managed provider, migrate your feature flagging system to a SaaS tool (i.e.
LaunchDarkly). Keep going until the only software you maintain yourselves is
the software that delivers value to your customers. You’ll be much, much better
off for it.</p>

<h2 id="make-deployseasy">3. Make Deploys&nbsp;Easy</h2>

<p>Deploying should be a frequent and unexciting activity. <strong>Engineers should be
able to deploy with minimal manual steps and it should be easy to see if the
deploy is successful</strong> (this requires instrumenting your code for observability,
which - tada - is covered above), and it should be easy to roll back a deploy
if something doesn’t go well. Deploying frequently implies that
deploys are smaller, and smaller deploys are generally easier, faster and
safer.</p>

<p>Many teams implement periods where deploys are forbidden - these can be
referred to as code freezes, or deploy policies like “Don’t deploy on Fridays”.
Having such blackout periods can lead to a pile-up of changes, which increases
the overall risk of something going very wrong.</p>

<p>If you’re on a team that fears deploys, dedicate a percentage of your
engineering time to improvements in your deployment pipeline until the fear is
gone. On a recent team I worked with, we were able to improve deploy times from
3 hours to 30 minutes, which drastically improved the teams’ confidence in the
deploy process. A natural side effect of this was that engineers started
deploying much more frequently instead of waiting for changes to pile up enough
to warrant a “release” (which was synonymous with a deploy).</p>

<p>The book
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339">Accelerate</a>
has been getting a lot of attention. If you haven’t read it, I’d recommend it.
The team behind it also publishes the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/devops/">State of DevOps</a>
reports, which are full of well-researched information about what various
companies in the industry are doing. It’s not a coincidence that two of the
four key metrics that the book focuses on are directly related to this (Deploy
Frequency, Change Lead Time). Shipping is <a href="https://www.heavybit.com/library/podcasts/o11ycast/ep-12-speed-of-deployment-with-rich-archbold-of-intercom/">your company’s heartbeat</a>.</p>

<h2 id="trust-the-people-closest-to-theknives">4. Trust the People Closest to the&nbsp;Knives</h2>

<p><strong>The people who work with a system are the ones who understand it best.</strong> This
applies to any part of the socio-technical systems within which we all work. In
the case of software systems, the engineers who deploy every day and are
on-call for critical services understand the level of risk they operate in. A
sad trend is that managers tend to overestimate their teams’ progress on
certain transitions - i.e. cloud-native, DevOps, etc. The higher up the
management chain, the larger this overestimation tends to be. Engineers who
deploy and get paged when things break know where the bodies are buried and
they know what needs the most work. They should, therefore, be the primary
stakeholders responsible for prioritizing technical work.</p>

<p>Another manifestation of this principle applies to platform or services teams.
If you’re responsible for building some shared component that’s used within
your organization (i.e. a messaging system, ci/cd infrastructure, shared
libraries or services) there’s an uncomfortable truth lurking for you: the
people who use your work know more about it than you do in many cases. They
understand implicitly how it serves customers and they know what contortions or
hoops they have to jump through to get it to work. Listen to them for
clues on how to improve the UX of your services and tools.</p>

<h2 id="qa-gates-make-qualityworse">5. QA Gates Make Quality&nbsp;Worse</h2>

<p>Many teams have a manual QA step that gets performed before deploys. The idea,
I guess, is to have someone run automated or manual tests to verify that a set
of changes are ready to be released. This sounds like a comforting
idea - having a human being (or team of human beings) “verify” a release before
it goes out - <strong>but it falls victim to several false assumptions and creates
some misalignments that do more harm than good.</strong></p>

<p>First of all, if there’s manual work that needs to be done before a deploy can
go out, that creates a bottleneck - if you’re making deploys easy, and
deploying small changes frequently, no QA team is going to be able to keep up
testing every deploy, and will inevitably block teams from deploying. That’s no
good. If you have manual tests, automate them and build them into your CI
pipeline (if they do deliver value).</p>

<p>Secondly, the teams doing QA often lack context and are under time pressure.
They may end up testing “effects” instead of “intents”. For example, I’ve seen
QA teams burn time testing that when something happens in a UI, something
related happens in a database. What happens when an engineer refactors that UI
component and changes the underlying data model? The functionality works, but
the test breaks. Because two teams are involved, this takes coordination and
time to fix. Similarly, I’ve seen QA teams block deploys because of failing
tests when caching was introduced at the CDN layer - a TTL of 5 seconds on an
activity feed may not ever be noticed by a user but it might break QA tests
causing unnecessary conflicts between product and QA engineers.</p>

<p>Luckily, solving this one is easy. Instead of having a dedicated QA team work
on creating manual and automated test cases that run in a fictitious QA
environment, reassign that team to work on continuous testing in production.
Instead of being a gate for deploys, a QA team could continuously verify that
production is working as expected. QA teams are also well situated to lead
Chaos Engineering initiatives, where faults are intentionally injected in
production. QA engineers could also work on making the CI/CD pipeline more
reliable, so that deploys are no longer a nightmare.</p>

<section id="mc_embed_signup">

</section>
<p>I was reading another engineer’s story this week about <a href="https://www.philosophicalhacker.com/post/data-point-for-job-seeking-devs">his 65-day job hunt</a>. I’ve avoided traditional job applications and interviews since I graduated from college, but a few things struck me from this post:</p>
<ol>
<li>Instead of targeting <em>every</em> job, Matt Dupree selectively applied at <strong>only 16 companies</strong> and withdrew applications when he thought the company was a bad fit. I love this advice.</li>
<li>Matt has built side projects, spoken at conferences, and blogged consistently for years. <strong>He walked into interviews with a trust level much higher than random applicants.</strong> I have said this before: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/code-notenough-karl-l-hughes/">coding skills are not enough to build a resilient career</a>.</li>
<li>Technical interviews still tell employers very little about an engineer’s ability (that’s a <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/hiring-process">whole other blog post</a>).</li>
</ol>
<p>Not everyone has the luxury of choice when it comes to choosing their next job, but if you’re a software engineer, you should be able to get there. There’s more demand for our skillset than there is supply, but you have to be intentional if you want to build a resilient career.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-resilient-career">What is a “resilient career”?</h2>
<p>People with resilient careers don’t fear an economic downturn because they have been able to put a little money aside. They don’t fear losing their job because they probably have half a dozen offers they’ve declined in the past year. They don’t stress about financial concerns because they likely have one or two side hustles bringing in a little extra cash flow.</p>
<p>I mentioned at the top that I’ve haven’t applied for a job since college. Skipping this step in the job search has been possible because I’ve approached my career very differently from most software engineers. Here are my rules for creating a resilient career:</p>
<h3 id="1-only-work-for-companies-that-need-and-trust-you">1. Only work for companies that need and trust you</h3>
<p>I skipped the job application process with all three of my jobs since college by doing the work that companies wanted before I officially started working for them.</p>
<p>No, I don’t mean you should work for free. Here’s how it played out for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uloop hired me to start their blog because I spent my free time in college building a blog, recruiting writers, and learning to code. I worked as a contractor for Uloop while I finished college, and when I graduated, bringing me on full-time just meant signing a W2.</li>
<li>Packback hired me because I stayed in touch with the founder for about nine months before they had any funding. When they were looking to hire a full-time engineer, they gave me a project from their roadmap. I did it as a freelancer, then joined full-time after I turned it in.</li>
<li>The Graide Network brought me on months after I started building a relationship with their founder. Instead of interviewing, I began as a consultant a couple of nights per week before they had the funding to bring me on.</li>
</ul>
<p>During each of these test periods, I got to see how much the company needed someone with my skill set, build trust with them, and get a trial run of the day-to-day. If I ever look for a job again, I’ll keep using the same approach because it works well.</p>
<h3 id="2-your-network-is-your-biggest-asset">2. Your network is your biggest asset</h3>
<p>You might also notice that two of my three of these career moves involved knowing my boss for months before joining. Notice that I didn’t run into them at a Meetup one night and get hired the next day.</p>
<p>For some reason, Engineers hear “you should network more,” and think that means they should go out and meet new people. That’s not how it works. Relationships take months or years to cultivate. You <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/the-key-to-networking-keeping-in-touch">have to stay in touch</a> if you ever want them to pay off.</p>
<p>Spend maybe 25% of your time meeting new people and 75% of your time staying in touch with people who you genuinely like. Personal relationships are founded on common interests, goals, or experiences, so find a mix of people who are both ahead of and behind you in your journey.</p>
<h3 id="3-cultivate-a-variety-of-interests-and-potential-revenue-generators">3. Cultivate a variety of interests and potential revenue generators</h3>
<p>I have always had a side project or two - mostly learning opportunities - but in the past three years, I’ve realized that you can generate revenue and build a network from them. Over the years, my side projects have led to consulting gigs, job offers, freelance opportunities, and a lot of high-quality connections around the world.</p>
<p>For example, CFP Land makes <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/cfp-land">a couple hundred dollars per month in profit</a>, which is fine, but the connections I’ve made from running it are worth orders of magnitude more. My previous side project, <a href="https://github.com/jobapis">Job APIs</a>, brings me multiple consulting offers per month (99% of them aren’t worth doing, but still, it’s nice to know they’re there).</p>
<p>My point is, anything I do in my free time is an investment in making my career more resilient.</p>
<h3 id="4-learn-on-your-employers-dime">4. Learn on your employer’s dime</h3>
<p>I was talking to a friend recently about his job search. He was lamenting that after five years of working hard for his employer and being let go, he was struggling to find another company that used the same tech stack.</p>
<p>“How much time did you spend learning new tools, libraries, or frameworks each week while you were at your prior job?” I asked.</p>
<p>“There wasn’t time for that,” he lamented, “We were always pushing to the max to get stuff done on time.”</p>
<p>It’s no surprise that my friend’s employer let him go. He wasn’t growing and when the company needed fewer resources in his engineering realm, he was too specialized to move into another area. He was seen as a resource that had to be let go. I used to think you could <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/be-indispensable">be indispensible</a> by being the best at one thing, but I’m starting to move away from that belief.</p>
<p>Any employer I work for gets me working ~35 hours per week on the projects we plan and ~5 hours per week learning new things. My value to my employer only increases as I become a more well-rounded engineer, so learning is non-negotiable. Now I bake this into my team’s weekly retrospectives - we share what we’re learning with each other - so we can hold each other accountable for learning new things.</p>
<h2 id="make-the-journey-your-own">Make the journey your own</h2>
<p>Finally, what works for me won’t necessarily work for you. My journey has involved working for early-stage startups - which you might hate - and being a software development generalist. Still, I think the fundamental goal should be the same: to build a resilient career.</p>

<p>This post is hard to write, both in the emotional sense but also in the “I would
have written a shorter letter, but I didn’t have the time” sense. Hence, please
assume the best of intentions when reading it—it is not my intention to make
anyone feel bad about their contributions, but rather to provide some insight
into why my frustration level ultimately exceeded the threshold.</p>

<p>Debian has been in my life for well over 10 years at this point.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I have visited some old friends at the Zürich Debian meetup
after a multi-year period of absence. On my bike ride home, it occurred to me
that the topics of our discussions had remarkable overlap with my last visit. We
had a discussion about the merits of systemd, which took a detour to respect in
open source communities, returned to processes in Debian and eventually
culminated in democracies and their theoretical/practical failings. Admittedly,
that last one might be a Swiss thing.</p>

<p>I say this not to knock on the Debian meetup, but because it prompted me to
reflect on what feelings Debian is invoking lately and whether it’s still a good
fit for me.</p>

<p>So I’m finally making a decision that I should have made a long time ago: I am
winding down my involvement in Debian to a minimum.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-this-mean">What does this mean?</h2>

<p>Over the coming weeks, I will:</p>

<ul>
<li>transition packages to be team-maintained where it makes sense</li>
<li>remove myself from the <code>Uploaders</code> field on packages with other maintainers</li>
<li>orphan packages where I am the sole maintainer</li>
</ul>

<p>I will try to keep up best-effort maintenance of the
<a href="https://manpages.debian.org/">manpages.debian.org</a> service and the
<a href="https://codesearch.debian.net/">codesearch.debian.net</a> service, but any help
would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>For all intents and purposes, please treat me as permanently on vacation. I will
try to be around for administrative issues (e.g. permission transfers) and
questions addressed directly to me, permitted they are easy enough to answer.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>When I joined Debian, I was still studying, i.e. I had luxurious amounts of
spare time. Now, over 5 years of full time work later, my day job taught me a
lot, both about what works in large software engineering projects and how I
personally like my computer systems. I am very conscious of how I spend the
little spare time that I have these days.</p>

<p>The following sections each deal with what I consider a major pain point, in no
particular order. Some of them influence each other—for example, if changes
worked better, we could have a chance at transitioning packages to be more
easily machine readable.</p>

<h3 id="change-process-in-debian">Change process in Debian</h3>

<p>The last few years, my current team at work conducted various smaller and larger
refactorings across the entire code base (touching thousands of projects), so we
have learnt a lot of valuable lessons about how to effectively do these
changes. It irks me that Debian works almost the opposite way in every regard. I
appreciate that every organization is different, but I think a lot of my points
do actually apply to Debian.</p>

<p>In Debian, packages are nudged in the right direction by a document called the
<a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/">Debian Policy</a>, or its programmatic
embodiment, lintian.</p>

<p>While it is great to have a lint tool (for quick, local/offline feedback), it is
even better to not require a lint tool at all. The team conducting the change
(e.g. the C++ team introduces a new hardening flag for all packages) should be
able to do their work transparent to me.</p>

<p>Instead, currently, all packages become lint-unclean, all maintainers need to
read up on what the new thing is, how it might break, whether/how it affects
them, manually run some tests, and finally decide to opt in. This causes a lot
of overhead and manually executed mechanical changes across packages.</p>

<p>Notably, the <strong>cost of each change</strong> is distributed onto the package maintainers in
the Debian model. At work, we have found that the opposite works better: if the
team behind the change is put in power to do the change for as many users as
possible, they can be significantly more efficient at it, which reduces the
total cost and time a lot. Of course, exceptions (e.g. a large project abusing a
language feature) should still be taken care of by the respective owners, but
the important bit is that the default should be the other way around.</p>

<p>Debian is <strong>lacking tooling for large changes</strong>: it is hard to programmatically
deal with packages and repositories (see the section below). The closest to
“sending out a change for review” is to open a bug report with an attached
patch. I thought the workflow for accepting a change from a bug report was too
complicated and started <a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2016-07-17-mergebot/">mergebot</a>, but only Guido
ever signaled interest in the project.</p>

<p>Culturally, reviews and reactions are slow. There are no deadlines. I literally
sometimes get emails notifying me that a patch I sent out a few years ago (!!)
is now merged. This turns projects from a small number of weeks into many years,
which is a huge demotivator for me.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, you can see artifacts of the slow online activity manifest
itself in the offline culture as well: I don’t want to be discussing systemd’s
merits 10 years after I first heard about it.</p>

<p>Lastly, changes can easily be slowed down significantly by holdouts who refuse
to collaborate. My canonical example for this is rsync, whose maintainer refused
my patches to make the package use debhelper purely out of personal preference.</p>

<p>Granting so much personal freedom to individual maintainers prevents us as a
project from raising the abstraction level for building Debian packages, which
in turn makes tooling harder.</p>

<p>How would things look like in a better world?</p>

<ol>
<li>As a project, we should strive towards more unification. Uniformity still
does not rule out experimentation, it just changes the trade-off from easier
experimentation and harder automation to harder experimentation and easier
automation.</li>
<li>Our culture needs to shift from “this package is my domain, how dare you
touch it” to a shared sense of ownership, where anyone in the project can
easily contribute (reviewed) changes without necessarily even involving
individual maintainers.</li>
</ol>

<p>To learn more about how successful large changes can look like, I recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrC6ROeV4GI">my
colleague Hyrum Wright’s talk “Large-Scale Changes at Google: Lessons Learned
From 5 Yrs of Mass Migrations”</a>.</p>

<h3 id="fragmented-workflow-and-infrastructure">Fragmented workflow and infrastructure</h3>

<p>Debian generally seems to prefer decentralized approaches over centralized
ones. For example, individual packages are maintained in separate repositories
(as opposed to in one repository), each repository can use any SCM (git and svn
are common ones) or no SCM at all, and each repository can be hosted on a
different site. Of course, what you do in such a repository also varies subtly
from team to team, and even within teams.</p>

<p>In practice, non-standard hosting options are used rarely enough to not justify
their cost, but frequently enough to be a huge pain when trying to automate
changes to packages. Instead of using GitLab’s API to create a merge request,
you have to design an entirely different, more complex system, which deals with
intermittently (or permanently!) unreachable repositories and abstracts away
differences in patch delivery (bug reports, merge requests, pull requests,
email, …).</p>

<p>Wildly diverging workflows is not just a temporary problem either. I
participated in long discussions about different git workflows during DebConf
13, and gather that there were similar discussions in the meantime.</p>

<p>Personally, I cannot keep enough details of the different workflows in my
head. Every time I touch a package that works differently than mine, it
frustrates me immensely to re-learn aspects of my day-to-day.</p>

<p>After noticing workflow fragmentation in the Go packaging team (which I
started), I tried fixing this with the <a href="https://go-team.pages.debian.net/workflow-changes.html">workflow changes
proposal</a>, but did not
succeed in implementing it. The lack of effective automation and slow pace of
changes in the surrounding tooling despite my willingness to contribute time and
energy killed any motivation I had.</p>

<h3 id="old-infrastructure-package-uploads">Old infrastructure: package uploads</h3>

<p>When you want to make a package available in Debian, you upload GPG-signed files
via anonymous FTP. There are several batch jobs (the queue daemon, <code>unchecked</code>,
<code>dinstall</code>, possibly others) which run on fixed schedules (e.g. <code>dinstall</code> runs
at 01:52 UTC, 07:52 UTC, 13:52 UTC and 19:52 UTC).</p>

<p>Depending on timing, I estimated that you might wait for over 7 hours (!!)
before your package is actually installable.</p>

<p>What’s worse for me is that feedback to your upload is asynchronous. I like to
do one thing, be done with it, move to the next thing. The current setup
requires a many-minute wait and costly task switch for no good technical
reason. You might think a few minutes aren’t a big deal, but when all the time I

                    <!-- Main content -->
                    <p>As I talked about in my post <a href="https://retrylife.ca/blog/2020/10/24/corepack-development">about Minecraft modpack development</a>, I got back in to playing Minecraft earlier this year. I primairly play on a server full of friends, where the server owner has <a href="https://github.com/webbukkit/dynmap">dynmap</a> installed. Dynmap is a handy tool that provides a near-real-time overview of the minecraft world in the form of a webapp. I always keep Dynmap open on my laptop so I can chat with whoever is online, and see whats being worked on.</p>

<p>While dynmap has a built-in chat log, and the ability to send chats, the incoming chat messages do not persist, and the outgoing chat messages don’t always show your in-game username (but instead, your public IP address). Since I always have an IRC client open, I figured that making use of my IRC client to generate a persistent chat log in the background would be a good solution. Unfortunately, I could not find anyone who has ever built a <code>Minecraft &lt;-&gt; IRC</code> bridge. Thus my project, <a href="https://github.com/Ewpratten/chatster">chatster</a>, was born.</p>

<p>The most basic IRC server consists of a TCP socket, and only 7 message handlers:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Message Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>NICK</code></td>
      <td>Handles a user setting their nickname</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>USER</code></td>
      <td>Handles a user setting their identity / username</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>PASS</code></td>
      <td>Handles a user authenticating with the server</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>PING</code></td>
      <td>A simple ping-pong system</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>JOIN</code></td>
      <td>Handles a user joining a channel</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>QUIT</code></td>
      <td>Handles a user leaving a channel</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>PRIVMSG</code></td>
      <td>Handles a user sending a message</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>On the Minecraft side, the following subset of the <a href="https://wiki.vg/Protocol">in-game protocol</a> must be implemented (I just used the <a href="https://github.com/ammaraskar/pyCraft"><code>pyCraft</code></a> library for this):</p>

<ul>
  <li>User authentication</li>
  <li>Receiving <a href="https://wiki.vg/Protocol#Chat_Message_.28clientbound.29"><code>clientbound.play.ChatMessage</code></a> packets</li>
  <li>Sending <a href="https://wiki.vg/Protocol#Chat_Message_.28serverbound.29"><code>serverbound.play.ChatMessage</code></a> packets</li>
</ul>

<p>The whole idea of chatster is that a user connects to the IRC server using their <a href="https://account.mojang.com/">Mojang account</a> email and password at their IRC nickname, and server password. The server temporarily stores these values in memory.</p>

<p>Connecting to a server is done via specific IRC channel names. If you wanted to connect to <code>mc.example.com</code> on port <code>12345</code>, you would issue the following IRC command:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>/JOIN #mc.example.com:12345
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Upon channel join, the server opens a socket to the specified Minecraft server, and relays chat messages (along with their sender) to both Minecraft and IRC. This means that ingame users show up in your IRC user list, and you can send commands and chats to the game.</p>

<p>The positive response to my post about <a href="https://blog.ceos.io/2020/11/14/why-i-teach-vim/">“Why I Teach vim”</a> has been extremely appreciated and the most common question I have received is “OK, but <em>how </em>do you teach vim? This is a much more difficult question to answer in a blog post as I have repeatedly found trying to explain teaching methods in writing is difficult. With that said, sometimes perfect is the enemy of good enough and let me see if I can take a shot at it. </p>



<p>I will even complicate things further and try to simultaneously teach teachers to teach vim as well as perhaps help a few programmers who want to take vim for a spin (maybe even who have been previously frustrated by it).</p>



<div><p>I must begin with a bit of <a href="https://twobithistory.org/2018/08/05/where-vim-came-from.html">historical context</a>. vi (the father of vim) was <a href="http://www.linfo.org/vi/history.html">invented</a> in 1976 by Bill Joy at the University of California, Berkeley. The potential user of vim needs to be aware that in 1976 many people used not monitors but printers to interact with a computer. As such, the most common way to edit text was with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_editor">line editor</a> which, as you might guess by the name, edited text one line at a time. vi was different than a line editor, vi was a visual editor and, ultimately, the name vi came from VIsual.</p><p>By 1976, people (really companies) were starting to be able to afford more <a href="https://www.tpub.com/incs/6.htm">CRT terminals</a>, think your parent’s (or grandparent’s) old style TVs. There were no mice, except in prototype computers at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company)">Xerox PARC</a>, and the programmer had only the keyboard to interact with their text editor. CRT terminals were a huge advantage for programmers used to line editors and literally reams of printer paper to do their work and it was time for a visual editor to take advantage of these wonderful CRT terminals allowing people to edit an entire screen of text at the same time!</p></div>



<div><p>Let me digress for a second on the assumption most 2020 humans make about using a text editor. Modern text editors (and word processors) are all, of course, visual, but are also called modeless. The computer figures out what you want to do by the way you interact. Start typing? The computer assumes you want to insert text. Click somewhere in the text? The computer assumes you want to move the location of insertion. Menus give you all sorts of commands and the computer knows by the nature of your mouse (or trackpad, if you prefer) actions and movements what you want to do and when you want to do it.</p><p>But Bill Joy’s computer did not have a mouse. His great insight was to recognize that the computer with visual interaction couldn’t automatically recognize all these modes (remember, no mouse) and rather had to be instructed through the keyboard as to which mode needs to be used at what time and thus the modal editor called vi (originally the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi">visual part of the line editor ex</a>) was born.</p><p>It is important to note that as frustrating as modern modeless text editors find the modal aspect of vi, this was such a huge leap beyond line editors that people flocked to it with glee. Those interested in context, and I don’t do this with my students, should consider playing a bit with <a href="https://www.howtoforge.com/linux-ed-command/">ed</a> on their favorite Linux or UNIX system. Then imagine doing this with a line printer. You can even get somewhat of a feel for both line editing and a printer terminal on old school UNIX with this <a href="http://aiju.de/code/pdp11/">web based PDP-11 emulator</a>.</p><p>Please note this historical context is vitally important as students rarely think about how their modeless editors work and throwing them into a modal editor without knowing about modes is one of the primary reasons so many students find vim so impenetrable. All the commands in the world won’t help if you do not understand <em>why</em> there are modes. This is even more further compounded by the fact that switching modes is something that is almost entirely unseen when a teacher is using vim in front of students. As both an undergraduate and graduate student, I have had the experience of watching a teacher just start using vi or vim and explicitly or implicitly telling students to figure it out. This. Rarely. Works. In fact, as the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25097788">discussion on my original post</a> points out, this can be recipe for bias against students who lack outside resources. vim is not difficult, but it does have to be explicitly taught.</p><p>At this point, I will go into a bit of how I teach the mechanics of vim. I am assuming the student can ssh into a command line machine now (or open up a command prompt on their machine). I am also assuming they can change their password (passwd), make a directory (mkdir),  and change into that directory (cd). I then ask them to type:</p></div>



<pre><code>vi hello.txt</code></pre>



<p>vi is almost always mapped to vim. If you end up with vi, which is easy enough to tell because vi doesn’t do syntax coloring of your favorite programming language and vim does, you may need to install vim on your particular system. Happily, if you only have vi, besides the color syntax, this guide will work just fine. Certainly consider reading more about the <a href="https://twobithistory.org/2018/08/05/where-vim-came-from.html">history of vi and vim</a>, if you are interested.</p>



<p>At this point, <em>you are in command mode</em>.</p>

<p>And here is where we get into the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/25x8bm/finally_found_a_vim_joke/">running joke</a> about how impossible it is to exit vim. Students must understand they are in <em>command mode</em>. Absolutely nothing interesting (yet) can happen in command mode, so we have to give it a command. The first command we will learn is i. Yes, just the letter i. This puts us in <em>insert</em> <em>mode.</em></p>

<div><p>The obvious question is, of course, how do we now save it? This is a perfect time to remind students that vim is <em>modal</em> and that we are in insert mode right now. If we using a modeless text editor, we could click on maybe the file menu and choose save. What ever shall we do?</p><p>Why, switch modes, of course! To exit insert mode and reenter command mode we simply type the esc key (be careful, students will sometimes literally type e… s… c…). Notice that by pressing the esc key we lose the — INSERT — in the lower right hand corner and move back into command mode.</p></div>

<p>At this point, I explain that in lieu of menus we use the : character (and not the ; character, English teachers all over the world will thank you for explaining that there is, indeed, a big difference and, for my young students, I always make a point of encouraging them to ask their English teacher what the difference is).</p>

<p>This now allows us to choose commands. I always start with the w command (for write file… s for save would have made life more easy for future people teaching vim, but s is used for <a href="https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Search_and_replace">substitute</a> – not covered in this guide). I then have students type w and then hit enter/return.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="163" data-permalink="https://blog.ceos.io/vim-saved/" data-orig-file="https://blogceosio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/vim-saved.png" data-orig-size="1045,554" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="vim-saved" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://blogceosio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/vim-saved.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://blogceosio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/vim-saved.png?w=750" src="https://blogceosio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/vim-saved.png?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://blogceosio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/vim-saved.png?w=1024 1024w, https://blogceosio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/vim-saved.png?w=150 150w, https://blogceosio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/vim-saved.png?w=300 300w, https://blogceosio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/vim-saved.png?w=768 768w, https://blogceosio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/vim-saved.png 1045w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>A new file is born!</figcaption></figure>



<p>I then have them repeat the sequence esc, :, followed by q (to quit) and return/enter. Experienced vim users will point out the esc is unnecessary (we are already in command mode), but an extra esc here or there to reinforce this idea of command mode seems to be very helpful to students new to vim. Experienced vim users will also point out you can chain commands i.e. esc followed by :wq. I do share this later on, but prefer to associate each command with the equivalent menu selection for beginners. This ability to chain commands is one of most important reasons why people like vim, though, and is something I definitely cover in the long run. Who wants to do File-&gt;Save, File-&gt;Quit with the mouse when you can do esc, :wq return?!</p>



<p>At this point I teach the students the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cat-command-in-linux-with-examples/">cat</a> command and ask them to type to see the fruits of their labor:</p>



<pre><code>cat hello.txt</code></pre>



<p>Finally, to reinfornce everything we have done so far, I ask them to type:</p>



<pre><code>vi hello.txt</code></pre>



<p>and then change the Hello, World! text to something of their own creation by first going into insert mode (i) and then saving (writing, if you prefer) it (esc, :w, return – remember that the esc moves you to command mode!), and then quitting (esc, :q, return). Students are then asked to cat their new hello.txt to be sure they saved what they wrote.</p>



<div><p>Repetition is the key to learning all this and I quickly follow up by giving them a C hello world program and asking them to vi hello.c and input it. <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/">clang</a> will quickly tell them if they have made any typical mistakes!</p><p>More about why and how I teach C at a later date, but the key trick here is to give them a very text intensive first programming assignment. I often have students write a program that prints out their class schedule. The secret here is that the goal isn’t so much printf in C but rather practicing vim to the point of reasonable automaticity. </p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was doing some research at work for tracing and observability for microservices, when I came across <a href="https://pixielabs.ai/">Pixielabs</a>. This tool advertises that you can instantly troubleshoot applications without any instrumentation or special code inside the apps, which sounded ✨magical✨ to me. So naturally I wanted to know a little more about what enables this technology to work, and after scrolling through the site, under the “No Instrumentation” section was this acronym <strong>eBPF</strong>.</p><p>After some further digging on the internet, reading the <a href="https://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.pdf">design papers</a> and watching several videos, it was safe to say this technology caught my attention, so I wanted to write some notes on it and I hope this post will spark some further interest in you as well.</p><h2 id="so-what-is-ebpf-exactly">So what is eBPF exactly?</h2><p>The TL;DR version is that this technology enables sandboxed user space applications to run in the Linux kernel itself. In a way it makes the kernel <em>programmable</em> which unlocks tremendous possibilities.</p><p>You can pick <strong>any function</strong> from the kernel and execute the program every time that function runs. Running a program that “attaches” to network sockets, tracepoints and perf events can be extremely useful. Developers can debug the kernel without having to re-compile it. There are plenty of use cases such as:</p><ul><li>Application performance &amp; troubleshooting</li><li>Networking &amp; security</li><li>Runtime security</li><li>Application tracing</li><li>Observability</li></ul><p>That’s what enables tools like Pixie to do blackbox analysis, without requiring any tinkering inside the applications that we’re trying to debug.</p><p>Originally BPF was <a href="https://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.pdf">designed</a> for capturing and filtering network packets that matched specific rules, discarding any unwanted packets. That’s why it was called the “Berkeley Packet Filter”. If you’ve ever used <strong>tcpdump</strong> you’ve probably already used it. Nowadays eBPF can be used for many different things and not just packet filtering but the name stuck for some reason.</p><p>This architecture of network monitoring was vastly superior to the current existing packet capture technologies in terms of performance, mainly because the filtering was done in the kernel instead of copying all of the packets in user space and doing
the calculations there. But with the advancement of processors it didn’t hold up so well with it’s initial design. That’s why the <strong>extended BPF</strong> (eBPF) design was introduced, to take advantage of the modern processing power.</p><p>Initially eBPF was to be also used as a network packet filtering solution, but the ability to run user-space programs inside the kernel proved to be very powerful. The new design extended what the BPF virtual machine could do, which was to allow it to run on all kinds of events, not just packets, and also do certain actions instead of just the ability to filter things.</p><h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2><p>An eBPF program is just a sequence of 64-bit instructions. The virtual machine’s instruction set is fairly limited and it has two goals in mind:</p><ol><li>The code needs to be executed as fast as possible.</li><li>All BPF instructions must be verifiable at load time to ensure the safety of the kernel.</li></ol><p>Okay so, eBPF code is run in a safe virtual machine inside the kernel. Writing these programs is done with the help of some frameworks (like <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc">bcc</a> and <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace">bpftrace</a>) and the program bytecode is then loaded via the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bpf.2.html"><code>bpf</code></a> system call.</p><p>To nullify the security and stability risks when running a user space program inside the kernel, several checks are performed
to ensure that the code we run is safe and that it terminates so our computer won’t freeze up.</p><p>Firstly, to even be able to run a user program which loads eBPF code, it needs root privileges to do so, unless unprivileged eBPF is enabled, in which case the process can load a program with a reduced functionality. Secondly, there’s the eBPF verifier which all eBPF programs must go through before they can be executed.</p><p>The verifier runs several checks on the code that safeguards the kernel. The first check ensures that any unbounded
loops which could freeze up the kernel are prohibited. The second check, which is more extensive, simulates the execution of the code making sure that all paths of the code run to completion, no out of bounds memory is accessed and overall the state of the virtual machine is valid.</p><p>The last step of the verification process involves restricting the eBPF program abilities, which kernel functions are callable and which data it can access. The verifier knows how to apply those restrictions because of the <strong>program type</strong>. The program type is determined when we associate the program with a certain event.</p><p>After the verification process is done, the BPF bytecode is then interpreted, or compiled by a JIT compiler, into native instructions that run efficiently whenever an event happens in the kernel.</p><h2 id="kprobes--uprobes">kprobes &amp; uprobes</h2><p>We can create and insert kernel probes or kprobes for short to virtually any function in the kernel, and attach an eBPF program so that it executes each time that function is invoked.</p><p>Here’s a simple hello world example from the <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/tree/master/examples">bcc</a> repository:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> bcc <span>import</span> BPF

</code></pre></div><p>The eBPF program is written in a pseudo-C code and it’s placed in the variable <code>prog</code> as a string. The bcc framework does all the heavy lifting of generating the bytecode, loading the programs and all that stuff, which makes writing these programs a bit easier.</p><p>In this example, the hello function invokes a bpf helper function called <code>bpf_trace_printk</code> which outputs a “Hello, World!” trace. Then we load the program and we attach a kernel probe for the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html"><code>clone</code></a> event, basically saying that we want to call the <code>hello</code> program each time <code>clone</code> is called.</p><p>After that the script waits for new traces to arrive, fetches the fields and prints the values to the screen.</p><p>Let’s try running it:</p><pre><code>$ sudo python3 hello-ebpf.py
TIME(s)            COMM             PID    MESSAGE

<p>
I don’t usually talk about money, but a friend asked me what it was like to get rich, and he wanted to know specifics, so I told him my story.
</p><p>
I had <a href="https://sive.rs/xn">a day job</a> in midtown Manhattan paying $20K per year — about minimum wage.
On weekends I would earn $150 per day performing circus shows for kids, though I’d spend about $50 in bus fare to get to the gigs.
I was sharing a three-bedroom apartment with two other roommates in Queens, so our rent was $333 per month each.
I made peanut butter sandwiches for three meals a day, and at night maybe some eggs.
I never ate out, and never took a taxi.
<strong>
My cost of living was about $1000/month, and I was earning $1800/month.
I did this for two years, and saved up $12,000.
</strong>
I was 22 years old.
</p><p>
Once I had $12,000 I could quit my job and become a full-time musician.
I knew I could get a few gigs per month to pay my cost of living.
So I was free.
<a href="https://sive.rs/nq">I quit my job</a> a month later, and never had a job again.
</p><p>
When I finished telling my friend this story, he asked for more.
I said no, that was it.
He said, “No, what about when you sold your company?”
</p><p>
I said no, that didn’t make a big difference in my life.
That was just more money in the bank.
The difference happened when I was 22.
</p><p>
It’s not how much you have.
<strong>
It’s the difference between what you have and what you spend.
</strong>
If you have more than you spend, you’re rich.
If you spend more than you have, you’re not.
If you live cheaply, it’s easy to be free.
</p><p>
Magicians wave one hand around to get your attention, while the other hand does the trick.
To be smart, watch the other hand.

November 21, 2020 | https://blog.tawhidhannan.co.uk/meta/pagination-in-zola/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.tawhidhannan.co.uk/meta/pagination-in-zola/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>I've been experimenting with Zola, a static site generator. The documentation for pagination is pretty good from an anatomical perspective, but I thought there was room for something a little more 'recipe' like. So, this is how I personally implemented pagination on my Zola site, aiming to demonstrate the nuts and bolts in action. This demonstration will be correct for zola binaries compatible with 0.12.0.</p>
<h2 id="the-goal">The Goal<a href="#the-goal" aria-label="Anchor Link For: the-goal">
    
</a></h2>
<p>Imagine a homepage, much like the one <a href="https://blog.tawhidhannan.co.uk/">for this site</a>. Let's assume there's 15 posts, sorted by most recent posts first, but we don't want to overwhelm the user or have them scroll forever, so we'd like to display a maximum of five posts at once. We need to be able to click on the posts themselves to get to the articles, but also we want to make it possible to see beyond the most recent five posts.</p>
<h2 id="configuring-the-index-page">Configuring the index page<a href="#configuring-the-index-page" aria-label="Anchor Link For: configuring-the-index-page">
    
</a></h2>
<p>These index pages are configured by markdown frontmatter. So at the root of your content directory, you'll want a file, <code>_index.md</code>, who's sole purpose is to configure how to render a particular section. Now by creating this file at the root of the entire content directory, the 'section' is essentially all of the content in the site - perfect for a homepage.</p>
<p>The frontmatter of this markdown page, is a set of attributes that must come at the start of every markdown file that Zola renders. These attributes are specified between two rows of three <code>+</code> characters, which Zola uses as the bookends for the frontmatter.</p>
<pre><code><span>+++
(ATTRIBUTES GO HERE)
+++
</span></code></pre>
<p>One attribute available to use is the <code>paginate_by</code> attribute, enabling us to specify how many posts per page should be rendered. In accordance with the goals set, we can make that 5.</p>
<pre><code><span>+++
paginate_by = 5
+++
</span></code></pre>
<p>To ensure the pages are sorted by date, we can also specify how to sort these pages. Let's do that.</p>
<pre><code><span>+++
sort_by = date
paginate_by = 5
+++
</span></code></pre>
<p>According to the documentation, the semantics of specifying the <code>sort_by</code> attribute to <code>date</code> are <a href="https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/section/#date">as follows</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This will sort all pages by their date field, from the most recent (at the top of the list) to the oldest (at the bottom of the list). Each page will get page.earlier and page.later variables that contain the pages with earlier and later dates, respectively.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point, all the configuration is in place to leverage pagination. However, before pagination actually works, we need to render this list of posts in a template. Now, we can specify the template in the frontmatter, but by default, for the root <code>_index.md</code> file, this will resolve to the root <code>index.html</code> file.</p>
<h2 id="rendering">Rendering<a href="#rendering" aria-label="Anchor Link For: rendering">
    
</a></h2>
<p>As a foundation, we'll build up the following template.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;!</span><span>DOCTYPE </span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
&lt;</span><span>html </span><span>lang</span><span>=</span><span>"en"</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
    &lt;</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
    &lt;/</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;/</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
&lt;/</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>Note that this is an incredibly simplified template, with the goal of illustrating pagination. Your template probably will look different.</p>
<p>Zola makes certain variables available to each html template file. The variables we're concerned with are <a href="https://www.getzola.org/documentation/templates/pagination/">variables within the <code>paginator</code> namespace</a>. Now, the paginator namespace isn't guaranteed to be available to the template - if the <code>_index.md</code> file the template is rendering doesn't have any pagination settings enabled, the namespace won't exist.</p>
<h3 id="safety-measures">Safety measures<a href="#safety-measures" aria-label="Anchor Link For: safety-measures">
    
</a></h3>
<p>As a precautionary measure, we can check if it exists before trying to do anything with it. In Zola, we can run any templating logic between curly braces with percentage symbols inside, like so:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;!</span><span>DOCTYPE </span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
&lt;</span><span>html </span><span>lang</span><span>=</span><span>"en"</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
    &lt;</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
      {% if paginator %}
      {% endif %}
    &lt;/</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;/</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
&lt;/</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre><h3 id="listing-pages">Listing Pages<a href="#listing-pages" aria-label="Anchor Link For: listing-pages">
    
</a></h3>
<p>We can now write any and all logic related to pagination between these two added lines, and safely interact with the paginator namespace. There exists a variable on the paginator, <code>pages</code>, which corresponds to an array of pages. We can list these pages out 'iterator' style - let's just list out some basic links with the corresponding dates. It should look like the code below:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;!</span><span>DOCTYPE </span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
&lt;</span><span>html </span><span>lang</span><span>=</span><span>"en"</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
    &lt;</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
      {% if paginator %}
      &lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
        {% for post in paginator.pages %}
        &lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
          &lt;</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;{{post.date}}&lt;/</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;
          &lt;</span><span>a </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"{{ post.permalink }}"</span><span>&gt;{{ post.title }}&lt;/</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;
        &lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
        {% endfor %}
      &lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
      {% endif %}
    &lt;/</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;/</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
&lt;/</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>At this point, the homepage renders up to 5 posts at once, with the most recent posts first. Great start, but we need to enable users to get to the older pages should they so desire - this is the actual pagination part!</p>

<p>The <code>paginator</code> namespace exposes pretty much all the variables we need for this. It would be good to display the current page, and some links to the next and previous pages if there are any. If there aren't, we can either leave off the buttons entirely or go with disabling them - I'm going to render disabled buttons. To achieve all this, we're going to need three variables from the <code>paginator</code> namespace - <code>previous</code>, <code>next</code> and <code>current_index</code>.</p>
<p>Let's get these done in order.</p>
<h4 id="previous-page">Previous Page<a href="#previous-page" aria-label="Anchor Link For: previous-page">
    
</a></h4>
<p>The <code>paginator.previous</code> variable corresponds to a link to the previous page, if such a page exists - so we'll check if it exists, and if it exists, render a link to the page with the text 'previous', and if it doesn't exist, display a disabled version of the same link. For the disabled version, instead of linking to the page,</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;!</span><span>DOCTYPE </span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
&lt;</span><span>html </span><span>lang</span><span>=</span><span>"en"</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
    &lt;</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
      {% if paginator %}
      &lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
        {% for post in paginator.pages %}
        &lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
          &lt;</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;{{post.date}}&lt;/</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;
          &lt;</span><span>a </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"{{ post.permalink }}"</span><span>&gt;{{ post.title }}&lt;/</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;
        &lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
        {% endfor %}
      &lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
      {% endif %}
      {% if paginator.previous %}
        &lt;</span><span>a </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"{{ paginator.previous }}"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&amp;lt;</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;
      {% else %}
        </span><span>&amp;lt;
</span><span>      {% endif %}
    &lt;/</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;/</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
&lt;/</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre><h4 id="current-page">Current Page<a href="#current-page" aria-label="Anchor Link For: current-page">
    
</a></h4>
<p>This is pretty easy - we pretty much just render <code>paginator.current_index</code> into the page.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;!</span><span>DOCTYPE </span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
&lt;</span><span>html </span><span>lang</span><span>=</span><span>"en"</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
    &lt;</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
      {% if paginator %}
      &lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
        {% for post in paginator.pages %}
        &lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
          &lt;</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;{{post.date}}&lt;/</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;
          &lt;</span><span>a </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"{{ post.permalink }}"</span><span>&gt;{{ post.title }}&lt;/</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;
        &lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
        {% endfor %}
      &lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
      {% endif %}
      {% if paginator.previous %}
        &lt;</span><span>a </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"{{ paginator.previous }}"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&amp;lt;</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;
      {% else %}
        </span><span>&amp;lt;
</span><span>      {% endif %}
      &lt;</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;{{ paginator.current_index }}&lt;/</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;
    &lt;/</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;/</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
&lt;/</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre><h4 id="next-page">Next Page<a href="#next-page" aria-label="Anchor Link For: next-page">
    
</a></h4>
<p>Here, we can pretty much do what we did with the 'previous' page example.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;!</span><span>DOCTYPE </span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
&lt;</span><span>html </span><span>lang</span><span>=</span><span>"en"</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
    &lt;</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
      {% if paginator %}
      &lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
        {% for post in paginator.pages %}
        &lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
          &lt;</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;{{post.date}}&lt;/</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;
          &lt;</span><span>a </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"{{ post.permalink }}"</span><span>&gt;{{ post.title }}&lt;/</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;
        &lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
        {% endfor %}
      &lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
      {% endif %}
      {% if paginator.previous %}
        &lt;</span><span>a </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"{{ paginator.previous }}"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&amp;lt;</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;
      {% else %}
        </span><span>&amp;lt;
</span><span>      {% endif %}
      &lt;</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;{{ paginator.current_index }}&lt;/</span><span>span</span><span>&gt;
      {% if paginator.next %}
        &lt;</span><span>a </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"{{ paginator.next }}"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&amp;gt;</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;
      {% else %}
        </span><span>&amp;gt;
</span><span>      {% endif %}
    &lt;/</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;/</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
&lt;/</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre><h2 id="calling-it">Calling It<a href="#calling-it" aria-label="Anchor Link For: calling-it">
    
</a></h2>
<p>This is a minimal implementation for a homepage that renders up to five pages, and allows clicking through to view other pages, using Zola. This should be sufficient as a starting point for expanding on, customising and styling. I'm looking to move this blog to something Zola flavored, and I'll talk about why in the future - suffice to say, I'm pleased with how easy pagination is to roll out.</p>

the websites that it links to.</p><p>This is a bit of an oversimplification, but let's take a look at a concrete example.</p><p>Think about how many articles have been written on the topic of "ReactJS Tutorial". </p><p><img src="https://bloggingfordevs.com/images/blog/link-building/reactjs-tutorial-query-results.jpg" alt="ReactJS tutorial search results analysis"></p><p>Google has over 7 million articles indexed on the topic.</p><p>How does it decide which articles are worthy of being on the first page of the search results, much less
which deserves to be number one?</p><p>Backlinks are part of the answer.</p><h2>How Google chooses which articles to rank (as far as we know)</h2><p>Google uses <a href="https://backlinko.com/google-ranking-factors" target="_blank">over 200 ranking factors</a> to
determine which article gets the top spot.</p><p>These include things like the presence of the keyword in the title
tag and H1 tag, site speed, freshness (how recently the content was published or updated), and many other factors.</p><p>But not all factors are equally weighted.</p><p>However, time and again we observe that backlinks (especially backlinks from different domains) strongly correlate with higher rankings in Google.
They may not be <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-links-not-most-important-google-ranking-factor-29868.html" target="_blank">the most important factor</a>, but they are important <!-- -->—<!-- --> and the data shows that.</p><p>One <a href="https://backlinko.com/search-engine-ranking" target="_blank">study</a> of 11.8 million search results found this:</p><p><img src="https://bloggingfordevs.com/images/blog/link-building/backlink-position-correlation.png" alt="Backlink position correlation graph"></p><blockquote><p>Pages with lots of backlinks rank above pages that don’t have as many backlinks. In fact, the #1 result in Google has an average of 3.8x more backlinks than positions #2-#10. (<a href="https://backlinko.com/search-engine-ranking" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p></blockquote><p>Here are three reasons why links can be an effective way for Google to determine which article
among millions is the best:</p><ul><li><strong>They're hard to get.</strong> Quality backlinks from authoritative websites are difficult to obtain (meaning, difficult to manipulate). You can't just email the New York Times and ask for a link to your blog.</li><li><strong>They pass along useful context.</strong> If I run a website about web development, a backlink from CSS Tricks or Mozilla Developer Network reinforces to Google that my site is about web development.</li><li><strong>Natural links represent a human's opinion.</strong> If someone links to an article just because they find it handy, that represents to Google that it probably contains quality information.</li></ul><p>Let's look at the backlinks for the top-ranking articles for "ReactJS Tutorial":</p><p><img src="https://bloggingfordevs.com/images/blog/link-building/reactjs-tutorial-backlinks.jpg" alt="Backlinks to articles ranking for ReactJS tutorial"></p><p>You can see that the #1 article is on the official ReactJS website and has over 9,000 backlinks from 2,000+ different domains.</p><p>This makes perfect sense: it's the official documentation, making it naturally the most relevant, authoritative, and linked-to
article about "reactjs tutorial".</p><p>But what about topics that don't have a clear entity behind them?</p><p>Let's look at the kinds of queries you might pop into Google on a regular basis: CSS properties.</p><p>Have you ever wondered why W3 Schools would <em>ever</em> show up above MDN when you google for these?</p><p><img src="https://bloggingfordevs.com/images/blog/link-building/w3schools-vs-mdn.jpg" alt="W3 Schools vs MDN by backlinks"></p><p>Here's one possible explanation for you.</p><p>For fun, let's look at one last example: Toptal's article about PHP hiring.</p><p><img src="https://bloggingfordevs.com/images/blog/link-building/hiring-php-developers-rankings.jpg" alt="Rankings for search term 'hiring php developers'"></p><p>They have clearly been building links to this page, and are able to rank higher than sites
like Indeed and Upwork for this search query.</p><p>Ignoring any on-site factors, it could be hard for the other sites to outrank
Toptal without building more links themselves for "hiring php developers".</p><p><strong>In effect: Backlinks have likely helped Toptal obtain their ranking for this query.</strong></p><p>You can also imagine that the people searching for "hiring php developers" are exactly
the type of people Toptal would like to convert into clients. It makes sense.</p><p>Notably, they don't rank #1 for relevant search terms with higher volume like "php developer",
but I'm sure they're working on it ;)</p><p>Now the question is <!-- -->—<!-- --> how can we boost <em>ourselves</em> to the top of the search results for terms
that will bring readers or clients to our website, at least in part through backlinks?</p><h2>The most important SEO tactic that most developers have never heard of before</h2><p>It's not adding a ton of obscure meta tags or making your website load faster (believe it or not, neither schema nor pagespeed appear to <a href="https://backlinko.com/search-engine-ranking" target="_blank">correlate</a> with higher rankings).</p><p>It's <strong>link building</strong>. What is that exactly?</p><blockquote><p>Link building is the deliberate effort to gain external links to your website, usually
through content marketing, outreach, PR campaigns, and creating "link-worthy" articles, graphics, and tools.</p></blockquote><p>Toptal's email to me is an (unsuccessful) attempt at link building.</p><p>They wrote me an outreach email, asking me to edit one of my existing articles to include
a link to their website.</p><p>While the official word from Google is that you should just "create great content" and
links will come, most of us are in agreement <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/marketers-say-most-of-googles-public-statements-are-false-or-misleading/" target="_blank">that's not how it works</a> in the real world, especially for new websites.</p><p>It takes a concerted effort to get links.</p><p>I'll be honest: it's a lot of work.</p><p>But think about it like this: Imagine you could write an article and feel <em>pretty confident</em>
it would drive revenue for your indie product, clients for your freelancing business,
or bring you readers that will subscribe to your newsletter, follow you on Twitter, or even offer you a job...</p><p><strong>All without you paying for ads or relying on a massive social media following.</strong></p><p>That's why SEO in general, and link building in particular, is so powerful and important.</p><p>And while I'm the first to bemoan the fact that <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/the-dirty-secret-to-ranking-1-on-google-part-1-of-3/" target="_blank">Google is making our lives harder</a>  when it comes to visibility in search, it's still
one of the most cost-effective and scalable ways to drive traffic to a website.</p><p>And to do that, there are specific strategies you can use to get links from great websites.</p><p>Links that will, in turn, signal to Google that your content is excellent and worth showing
to searchers.</p><p>I'll get to those specific strategies shortly, but first it's important to give you
a few <strong>techniques for determining whether a backlink from a website will be valuable for you</strong>.</p><p>That way you don't waste your time chasing links that won't move the needle.</p><h2>Why all backlinks are not created equal</h2><p>Imagine that Google treated the internet like a democracy: every link from every website has one, equal vote.</p><p>If you wanted a bunch of links to your website, you could just go create a repo on GitHub with
a markdown file and "send backlinks" to each page on your website you want to rank.</p><p>You could create dozens or even hundreds of repos to boost your rankings.</p><p>Or, hundreds of Tumblr pages, Twitter profiles, blogspot websites, you get the idea.</p><p>That doesn't make sense, does it? We both know you could probably code a script to automate that in less than a day (which is basically what people did).</p><p>This is similar to how Google's original <a href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/pagerank/" target="_blank">PageRank algorithm</a> used to work.</p><p>Instead of just looking at the content of your website, it also looked at how
many external links pointed to the website or web page (and how many links
pointed to those web pages, and so forth).
How many, but not necessarily the quality of the referring website.</p><p><strong>What it meant is that it was easy to build links (and rank your website) through spam</strong>: spam comments on blogs,
on forums, low quality sites created as so-called "link farms".</p><p>That's why Google introduced measures to rank based on the <strong>quality of links</strong>, starting with
the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Penguin" target="_blank">Penguin Update</a> in 2012.</p><p>Today, if you want links that are likely to improve your website's rankings, you should look at
a few factors first.</p><h2>How to tell if a backlink is useful for your website (or a waste of your time)</h2><p>Since I told you that building links is a lot of work, I want to make sure you're spending your time
efficiently and getting the most out of your effort.</p><p>We're going to look at backlink strategies, but it's important that for each strategy you apply, you <strong>look at the specific
website</strong> you'd be earning the link from and evaluate it.</p><p>Here are some of the most important factors to consider when deciding to pursue a backlink opportunity.</p><p>Some confirmed by Google, some denied (but that <a href="https://twitter.com/randfish/status/1288982615110725632" target="_blank">doesn't necessarily mean</a> they aren't accurate). </p><ul><li><strong>Relevance</strong> <!-- -->—<!-- --> Is the website covering the same topic as yours? Again, a link from CSS Tricks to my article
about "CSS Grid" would probably be more valuable than a link from, say, a link from Webflow. But both are
more relevant than a link from, say, the Financial Times, even if the latter is highly reputable (of course, don't turn down a link from the FT either).</li><li><strong>Domain-level Authority</strong> <!-- -->—<!-- --> Does the website linking to you have a lot of backlinks themselves? And if so, what's the
quality of those backlinks? One useful metric for estimating this is <a href="https://ahrefs.com/website-authority-checker" target="_blank">Ahrefs Domain Rating (DR)</a> (bearing in mind, this is a third-party metric
not actually included in Google's algorithm).</li><li><strong>Page-level …</strong></li></ul></div></div>

                        <p>Symmetric encryption with a default key on Ubiquiti’s UniFi network devices combined with remotely-hosted UniFi Controllers leads to risk of undetectable observation of network configuration and usage data.</p>
<h2 id="overview-of-unifis-inform-protocol">Overview of UniFi’s “inform” protocol</h2>
<p>Ubiquiti’s UniFi product line consists of routers, switches, and WiFi access points.</p>
<p>These devices do not have any local management, instead relying on controller software<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> running locally or hosted remotely.</p>
<p>Devices discover their controller<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> through a combination of broadcast traffic on the local network, DHCP option 43, and trying to resolve the hostname <code>unifi</code>.
In the case of option 43 or resolution of the <code>unifi</code> hostname, the device will attempt to communicate with the controller by sending a HTTP POST request to <code>[ADDR]:8080/inform</code>.</p>
<p>This POST request contains a JSON payload<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> and is repeated every 30 seconds. Controllers respond with a JSON payload containing configuration data, commands, or instructions to check in at a later time.</p>

<p>When sending JSON-encoded data to an API endpoint, one might expect to see a MIME type of <code>application/json</code> combined with HTTP over TLS. This is not the case.</p>
<p>Instead, the JSON payload is encrypted with AES in GCM or CBC mode depending on the combination of device and firmware version, wrapped with a bespoke binary protocol<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> and transferred without benefit of TLS<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The encryption key used prior to adoption by a controller is the md5sum of <code>ubnt</code><sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.</p>
<p>During the adoption process, the controller generates a new key and sends it to the device as a inform response along with any other initial configuration data. Consequently, anyone observing network traffic during the adoption process can observe any future traffic between the device and controller.</p>
<p>Operators have been questioning<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> Ubiquiti’s decision to not utilize TLS by default for several years. Eventually Ubiquiti removed<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> the ability for operators to force usage of TLS for inform traffic.</p>

<p>Network configuration data by itself can be considered sensitive but does not directly impact user privacy.
Unfortunately, inform traffic also contains data that can identify specific devices in place and time. With a UniFi router, it can associate browsing activity with a device’s mac and IP addresses.</p>
<h2 id="switches">Switches</h2>
<p>Switch tables contain MAC addresses of user devices and can be used to associate a user with a location.</p>
<p>See: <a href="https://jade.wtf/words/unifi-l3inform-crypto/inform-switch.json">example inform</a> from a USW-PRO-24 running firmware 4.0.64.10823.</p>
<h2 id="wifi-access-points">WiFi Access Points</h2>
<p>MAC addresses of users, data on neighboring WiFi AP signal strength provides sufficient information to geolocate the AP<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> using commonly available services.</p>
<p>See: <a href="https://jade.wtf/words/unifi-l3inform-crypto/inform-ap.json">example inform</a> from a UAP Flex HD running firmware 4.0.42.10433.</p>
<h2 id="routers-unifi-security-gateway">Routers (UniFi Security Gateway)</h2>
<p>Router inform contains DPI, DHCP, and ARP tables that can be used to associate a device with usage of specific applications such as Facebook and Spotify.</p>
<p>Exerpt showing DPI update for a host (<code>app</code> and <code>cat</code> correspond to application and category identifiers used in the controller dashboard):</p>

          <span>}</span>
     <span>]</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Reliance on symmetric encryption means that anyone that possesses the key can observe inform traffic. This traffic contains information that, if disclosed, could have an adverse effect on users of the network.</p>
<h2 id="surveillance-and-targeting">Surveillance and targeting</h2>
<p>An aid worker installs a UniFi switch in a refugee camp. They use a UniFi controller hosted in a cloud VM for remote monitoring and management.
It’s easy for an adversary to monitor<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> these internet connection. The adversary gathers end-user device MAC addresses<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> from the switch table data contained in the inform message. How parties to a conflict could use such data is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>
<h2 id="location-discovery-via-passive-observation-or-dns-hijacking">Location discovery via passive observation or DNS hijacking</h2>
<p>Someone acquires a UniFi WiFi access point (AP) and installs it on their home network. They didn’t realize that a controller was required and order a UniFi cloud key controller, but did not unplug the AP while waiting for the controller to arrive.</p>
<p>Their internet provider uses wildcard DNS monetization<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> to show ads on domain names that do not exist. This leads to the <code>unifi</code> hostname resolving to the monetization provider’s server. Because of privacy regulations the ISP is prohibited from giving detailed information (such as physical location) to the ad provider, so the ad provider is incentivized to find ways to geolocate clients to deliver more targeted ads.</p>
<p>The neighboring networks / interference avoidance data included in the AP’s inform message contains sufficient information to utilize WiFi-based geolocation to associate the IP address with a physical address.</p>

<p>To demonstrate the feasibility of information extraction, I built a tool to automate information extraction from Unifi inform packets: <a href="https://github.com/jda/pixiedust">pixiedust</a>.</p>
<p>In key extraction mode, pixiedust follows inform traffic and learns keys as devices are provisioned or reconfigured.</p>

</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="short-term">Short-term</h2>
<p>Operators should ensure that traffic between UniFi devices and controllers is protected by a site-to-site VPN when traversing untrusted networks.</p>
<h2 id="long-term">Long-term</h2>
<p>Use TLS. Even self-signed certificates are better than the current state because you can log certificate IDs to detect MITM.</p>
<p>Inform messages should contain the minimum information necessary for adoption until after the device has been paired with a controller to prevent inadvertent disclosure of network configuration and personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>All UniFi devices to date are affected, except for the UniFi Dream Machine (UDM) product line (including UDM Pro).
The UDM series are not affected because they run a local instance of the controller software and cannot use a remotely hosted controller,
so there is no opportunity for an attacker to eavesdrop on UDM🡘controller communication.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Sensitive files can be secured using different methods. It is important to understand the pros and cons of each in order to pick the best tool for your needs.</p>

<p>Most archival software has the capability to add a pass phrase for archive protection. Different tools use different encryption algorithms. It is important to also look for authenticated encryption or AEAD. It provides extra integrity verification that ensures the archive hasn’t been tampered with. Some of the tools that support archival encryption are:</p>
<ul>
<li>7-zip</li>
<li>WinZip</li>
<li>WinRaR</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to use</li>
<li>Widely available</li>
<li>Difficult to manage pass phrases for many different archives</li>
<li>Most archival software doesn’t support authenticated encryption</li>
<li>Can be slow to add new files to an existing large archive</li>
</ul>

<p>Basic encryption tools don’t provide archival capabilities. Their main purpose is to encrypt a file. Each file is encrypted with its own pass phrase or your public key. There is support for file compression. Some of them are cross-platform and run on most operating system.</p>
<ul>
<li>PGP</li>
<li>AxCrypt (not open source)</li>
<li>AES Crypt</li>
<li>openssl (for advanced users)</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.secure-monkey.com/the-future-of-file-utilities-encryption-hashing-and-compression-in-the-browser/">Open Source File Encryption Tools in the Browser</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to install and use</li>
<li>Difficult to manage different pass phrases for each file</li>
<li>PGP is complex and requires careful understanding of its configuration</li>
<li>Some of the tools in this category don’t support authenticated encryption</li>
</ul>

<p>Some applications provide their own file protection as part of their interface. The protection mechanisms vary between different applications. In the past various applications were having issues protecting files. For example the encryption of Word documents before Office 2003&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office_password_protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc noreferrer">was insecure</a>. Examples of application specific encryption:</p>
<ul>
<li>Password protected Word, Excel, PowerPoint files</li>
<li>Password protected PDFs</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>These applications already support encryption so it is convenient to use it out of the box</li>
<li>It is hard to manage passwords for different files</li>
<li>Some applications provide very weak security by using old and vulnerable algorithms
<ul>
<li><strong>NOTE:</strong> The encryption of Word documents before Office 2003 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office_password_protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc noreferrer">is insecure</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There can be version mismatch where a file is encrypted with different version of the software and can’t be opened</li>
</ul>

<p>Encrypted volumes are much easier to work with. The volume is just a flat file on your disk so you can move it anywhere. When mounted the volume appears as a regular drive on your operating system. You can add/delete/edit files with ease. The user needs a single pass phrase to mount the volume and this applies to all added files. Volumes can be mounted and umounted at any time.</p>
<ul>
<li>VeraCrypt</li>
<li>TrueCrypt (deprecated)</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using a single password to open the volume can simplify working with many encrypted files</li>
<li>Easy to use</li>
<li>Fixed size of each volume that can’t grow dynamically can be frustrating</li>
<li>Not optimized for cloud storage – if a single file changes then the whole contents of the volume needs to be synced to the cloud</li>
</ul>

<p>Full Drive Encryption is great for preventing a stolen drive or laptop from being accessed without the passphrase. It depends what drive is encrypted. If it is the boot drive then as soon as the drive is booted into the operating system it is no longer protected as a logged-in user has complete access to all the files. The only way to protect your encrypted boot drive is to shutdown your computer. If a partition is encrypted then once it is “mounted” it appears as a drive on your OS. Most modern operating systems already have support for FDE and it is fairly simple to turn on. It does add a pace of mind that your data is protected if you lose your laptop. Some tools allow for hidden partitions that can add additional security to your files.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bit Locker (Windows)</li>
<li>Veracrypt (Cross-Platform)</li>
<li>File Vault (Mac OS X)</li>
<li>dm-crypt (Linux)</li>
<li>PGP Full Disk Encryption</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to use</li>
<li>Doesn’t protect files that are copied out of the encrypted disk</li>
<li>Doesn’t protect files on mounted volumes for the logged-in user</li>
<li>Not applicable to cloud storage as it only works on the physical disk or partition</li>
</ul>

<p>Encryption tools that are optimized for the cloud provide many additional benefits over the previously discussed tools. First, they are optimized for synchronization to cloud storage. Only the changed parts of the encrypted files are uploaded to the cloud. Second, they are using modern security algorithms such as authenticated encryption and public key cryptography. They allow managing and sharing encrypted files with ease. They work with different cloud storage providers so you’re not locked into one of them. They also provide local file protection.</p>
<ul>
<li>SecureMyFiles – <a href="http://www.secure-monkey.com/">www.secure-monkey.com</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>BoxCryptor</li>
<li>Cryptomator</li>
<li>GoCryptFs</li>
<li>KeybaseFS</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>State of the art encryption</li>
<li>Cloud integration</li>
<li>Efficient network synchronization</li>
<li>Easy to use</li>
<li>Can support large files</li>
<li>Allow easy password management and file sharing using public key encryption</li>
<li>Protect local and cloud files</li>
</ul>

<p>Secure Cloud Providers can offer various encryption mechanisms. The best ones use client-side encryption that protects your files before they are uploaded to the cloud. But the files are not encrypted on the client computer but rather only when uploaded to the cloud provider. Once the files are on the cloud server they stays encrypted at rest.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sync.com</li>
<li>pCloud</li>
<li>Tresorit</li>
<li>ShareFile</li>
<li>NextCloud</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide backup capabilities as well as encryption</li>
<li>Can be used to share files securely</li>
<li>Can be used to synchronize files across multiple devices</li>
<li>Requires a separate account</li>
<li>Doesn’t work with existing cloud providers such as Dropbox or Google Drive</li>
<li>Force you to purchase secure file storage from them</li>
<li>Don’t encrypt the files on the client computer</li>
</ul>

<p>Secure File Sharing can take the form of a secure cloud storage provider or as a specialized tool aimed directly at file sharing. Different tools provide different capabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Firefox Send (depricated)</li>
<li>Citrix ShareFile</li>
<li>Signal</li>
<li>Wire</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can be used to easily and securely send files to other users</li>
<li>Some of them have size limitations</li>
<li>Additional complexity in managing users</li>
<li>Don’t provide encryption at rest</li>
</ul>

<p>Securing email is hard. It is an old protocol that doesn’t natively support encryption. The best way to secure your emails is to use an extra mail plugin that runs in Outlook or Thunderbird or use a secure email provider. Nowadays secure email providers provide much better user experience with many options to secure your messages.</p>
<ul>
<li>ProtonMail</li>
<li>PGP plugin for Outlook/Thunderbird</li>
<li>Hushmail</li>
<li>Mailfence</li>
<li>Tutanota</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S/MIME" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc noreferrer">S/MIME</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Popular mean for sharing files</li>
<li>Can encrypt the body and attachments of emails</li>
<li>The password for decrypting the file has to be communicated using another method (out of band)</li>
<li>The user needs to have the same tools in order to decrypt the message</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to realize that we have the ability to manufacture our own fate when we want to. We can… proceed when things look bad, or we can find plenty of reasons to quit if we don’t want to go forward.</p>
<p><br>– Eric Haney, Inside Delta Force</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>This post was inspired by&nbsp;<a href="https://amzn.to/3jS2BK6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Inside Delta Force</a>, written by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_L._Haney" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eric Haney</a>.&nbsp;Detailed notes and quotes can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.butwhatfor.com/inside-delta-force-haney/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. Unattributed quotes below are from Haney’s writing.</em></p>
<p>After numerous terrorism incidents in the 1970s, the United States realized its armed forces had a blind spot when it came to counterterrorism. Green Beret <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Alvin_Beckwith" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Colonel Charlie Beckwith</a>, who had served alongside the British Army’s counter-terrorism unit the Special Air Service (also known as “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Air_Service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SAS</a>“) in Malaysia, had been pushing for such a group since the 1960s. Now that the opportunity to be proactive had passed, the U.S. Army decided it was a good time to commission its own SAS-like force – namely, <a href="https://www.wearethemighty.com/articles/this-long-forgotten-unit-was-the-direct-predecessor-to-delta-force#:~:text=The%20US%20Army's%20highly%20secretive,American%20counterterrorist%20force%20in%20existence." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Delta Force</a>.</p>
<p>That brings us to Eric Haney. Haney had a successful start to his career, joining the army straight out of high school and progressing to platoon sergeant in the Army Rangers. In 1977, he was fretting that he would wind up as an instructor given his combat experience could be put to use training subsequent Ranger generations. After jumping out of an airplane as part of a drill, he stumbled into the opportunity to try out for one of the first Delta Force squadrons.</p>
<p>These tryouts are a continuous string of examples showcasing the often-said-not-often-followed truism that hard work and persistence are the bare minimum qualities required to achieve anything meaningful. There were run-of-the-mill running tests, an 18-mile hike with 40 pounds on your back, solo navigation drills across mountains and valleys ad nauseum, and it all culminated with a 40-mile mountain hike starting at 2am. And to top it all off, the testing officers were constantly encouraging the soldiers to quit along the way while never telling you how close to the finish line you were.</p>
<p>And what a beautiful metaphor for life that is. Your destination is never truly known, it requires unending effort to achieve things worth achieving and along the way you can easily find sources of negativity telling you to voluntarily remove yourself from the challenge.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What was the lesson here? Simple. Don’t quit. Never quit no matter what. Keep going until someone tells you to sit down. Keep going as long as you’re able to move, no matter how poorly you think you may be doing. Just don’t quit.</p>

<p>– Eric Haney, Inside Delta Force</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, how did Haney do? He succeeded by focusing on the task at hand and ignoring the things around him that didn’t matter. Everytime he was close to quitting, he would push himself a little further, get his second wind and keep on trucking. He would “just keep [his] mouth shut, [his] eyes and ears open, and respond to whatever came up. It’s the system [he’d] always used in new situations, and so far it had served [him] well.”</p>
<p>Additionally, as he attacked what was in front of him he pushed away the temptation to look around and worry about comparing himself to other applicants. Some were faster. Some were stronger. Some seemed to mind the pain less than he did. But, to Haney, “the men in the other group weren’t my concern, and as for me, I’d know the destination when I got there.” And he got to the destination while many others did not.</p>
<p>And as you think through how impossible these challenges sound, you are are met with the realization of how quickly you would fail participating in the same. But then you have to be honest with yourself – you wouldn’t just fail, you would, in fact, die. You would get lost in the mountains. You would fall off a cliff. You would try to make the 40-miles and breakdown before you ever got to the end.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And this highlights another useful truth – unending resolve is not enough to ensure success. You must also be competent. All the perseverance you can muster today won’t do anything for you if you haven’t lived a life up to today that has prepared you for the task at hand – <a href="https://www.butwhatfor.com/habits-maketh-the-man-and-un-maketh-him-too/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who you are today is a lagging indicator of your</a><a href="https://www.butwhatfor.com/habits-maketh-the-man-and-un-maketh-him-too/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> habits </a>.</p>
<p>This means that success can only come after persistent preparation. The 163 men selected for the tryouts had lived lives that prepared them to take the unique, once-in-a-lifetime Delta Force opportunity and try. Without preparation, they could not even hope to try.</p>
<p>This is not unique to the military – <a href="https://www.butwhatfor.com/invert-always-invert-avoid-failure-to-succeed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charlie Munger</a> consistently shares the idea that there are only a few opportunities in life that define you. To take advantage of them, you prepare so that “step by step you get ahead, but not necessarily in fast spurts.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/27/charlie-mungers-career-advice-for-young-people.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">But you build discipline by preparing for fast spurts</a>.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up. Discharge your duties faithfully and well. Step by step you get ahead, but not necessarily in fast spurts. But you build discipline by preparing for fast spurts.</p>

<p>– Charlie Munger</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, even with preparation you will make mistakes. Haney did just that on the final 40-mile hike. He got lost. He went 7 miles off course in the wrong direction. And had to backtrack. And then keep going. He turned a 40-mile hike into more than a 50-mile hike, but he finished. After 18 hours of hiking, he made it to the finish line despite the setback.</p>
<p>This is another lesson – it is rare that failure is a permanent state. After failure, you have the option to keep going. You can treat failure as only a stop on your journey. You don’t have to let it be the destination. Many people treat getting knocked down as a reason to stay down. Like Haney, we don’t have to.</p>
<p>And it is important in life that you don’t define failure as failure to achieve only one specific goal. You can show up prepared and still not cross a specific finish line. 163 men participated in the Delta Force trials, but only 12 were ultimately accepted into the program. Those 151 men were not failures – not even close. They just had to accept that this Delta Force finish line wasn’t one they were going to cross and instead start progressing towards the next.</p>

<![CDATA[Interpretation of confidence intervals and Bayesian credible intervals]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>This post was prompted by a tweet by Frank Harrell yesterday asking:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In this post I'll say a little bit about trying to answer Frank's question, and then a little bit about an alternative question which I posed in response, namely, how does the interpretation change if the interval is a Bayesian credible interval, rather than a frequentist confidence interval.</p>



<h2>Frequentist confidence intervals</h2>



<p>A frequentist 95% confidence interval is constructed such that if the model assumptions are correct, if you were to (hypothetically) repeat the experiment or sampling many many times, 95% of the intervals constructed would contain the true value of the parameter. I made a short video last year which performs a simulation in R to demonstrate this definition/idea:</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="1125" height="633" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IGXg6L98lJM?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span>
</p></figure>



<p>Frank asked how one interprets a particular realised confidence interval (0.72,0.91). The difficulty (as he is well aware!) is that all a frequentist can say is that this particular realised interval either does or does not contain the true parameter value, and they cannot tell you if it does or doesn't. All they can say is that if modelling assumptions are correct, in hypothetical repetitions 95% of the intervals constructed using this procedure contain the true value.</p>



<h2>Bayesian credible intervals</h2>



<p>Let’s now suppose that we’ve done a Bayesian analysis. We’ve specified a prior distribution for the parameter, based on prior evidence, our subjective beliefs about the value of the parameter, or perhaps we used a default ‘non-informative’ prior built into our software package. We use the same model as before, and Bayes theorem gives us the posterior distribution. A Bayesian posterior credible interval is constructed, and suppose it gives us some values. For the sake of simplicity, I’ll assume the interval is again 0.72 to 0.91, but this is not done to suggest a Bayesian analysis credible interval will generally be identical to the frequentist's confidence interval.</p>



<p>How should we interpret this credible interval? A Bayesian would I think say say something like it is an interval for which there is a 95% chance or probability the true parameter lies. At this point we must ask, what do they mean by 95% probability?</p>



<p>We could interpret it as a classical long run frequentist probability, but this means interpreting it like a confidence interval. In fact Bayesian procedures often have good frequentist properties. For example see <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/343/2013/03/large-sample.pdf" target="_blank">Wang and Robins 1998</a> for an analysis of the frequentist properties of multiple imputation for missing data, or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0962280216667764" target="_blank">Bartlett and Keogh 2018</a> for a simulation investigation of the frequentist properties of Bayesian approaches for handling covariate measurement error. In fact, under certain conditions, Bayesian procedures achieve the same frequentist properties of maximum likelihood methods when the sample size gets large - see Chapter 4 of Gelman <em>et al</em>'s excellent<a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Bayesian Data Analysis book</a>.</p>



<p>But conceptually we do not choose to do a Bayesian analysis simply as a means to performing frequentist inference. We choose it because it (hopefully) answers more directly what we are interested in (see Frank Harrell's '<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fharrell.com/post/journey/" target="_blank">My Journey From Frequentist to Bayesian Statistics</a>' post). Namely, it enables us to make probability statements about the unknown parameter given our model, the prior, and the data we have observed. So what is the interpretation of the 95% chance or probability for a credible interval? </p>



<p>I don't know the no doubt large literature on this topic well at all, but the Bayesian's interpretation or definition of probability isn't that clear to me. The Wikipedia entry on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability" target="_blank">Bayesian probability</a> says:</p>



<blockquote><p>Broadly speaking, there are two interpretations of Bayesian probability. For objectivists, who interpret probability as an extension of logic, probability quantifies the reasonable expectation that everyone (even a "robot") who shares the same knowledge should share in accordance with the rules of Bayesian statistics, which can be justified by Cox's theorem.[2][8] For subjectivists, probability corresponds to a personal belief.[3] Rationality and coherence allow for substantial variation within the constraints they pose; the constraints are justified by the Dutch book argument or by decision theory and de Finetti's theorem.[3] The objective and subjective variants of Bayesian probability differ mainly in their interpretation and construction of the prior probability.</p><cite>Wikipedia entry on Bayesian probability</cite></blockquote>



<p>Section 1.5 'Probability as a measure of uncertainty' of <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bayesian Data Analysis</a> talks about the way Bayesian analysis uses probability as a measure of uncertainty, but to my mind it doesn't really define the concept. This is not a criticism. As Gelman et al say earlier in their book:</p>



<blockquote><p>Rather than argue the foundations of statistics—see the bibliographic note at the end of this chapter for references to foundational debates—we prefer to concentrate on the pragmatic advantages of the Bayesian framework, whose flexibility and generality allow it to cope with complex problems.</p></blockquote>



<p>If part of the appeal of Bayesian inference is that it answers the question we really want (i.e. conditional on what we've seen, what do we know / believe about the parameter(s)), it seems to me that the interpretation or definition of prior/posterior probabilities should be relatively straightforward and clear to us. But for me at least, it isn't. I am quite confident (whatever I mean by that!) that this reflects my ignorance on the topic. Part of my motivation for writing this post is the hope that people will help me understand better how to unambiguously define what is meant by a Bayesian prior/posterior probability. Please write a comment if you can help in this regard.</p>



<p>The above does not mean I don't like Bayesian methods. Indeed much of the last 10 years I have been working with and using methods like multiple imputation for missing data whose development take place in the Bayesian paradigm. For me this is fine because I know that methods like multiple imputation have good frequentist properties, and while there are definitely interpretational issues with things confidence intervals, I at least think I understand what they claim to do/be.</p>



<h2>22nd November 2022 postscript</h2>



<p>This evening there was further discussion of this topic on Twitter. As part of this Frank Harrell offered an interpretation for the Bayesian credible interval as follows:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Under data model F and prior P, [0.72, 0.91] is the shortest interval such that the probability the unknown OR generating our data is in that interval is 0.95 (highest posterior density interval).</p>— Frank Harrell (@f2harrell) <a href="https://twitter.com/f2harrell/status/1330633833713111040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 22, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>I followed up with him as to the nature of the probability being referred to here, since it is clear that the probability notion being invoked is broader or distinct than the relative frequency notion of probability. Frank helpfully pointed me in the direction of the entry for 'probability' in his course glossary of terms, which can be <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hbiostat.org/doc/glossary.pdf" target="_blank">accessed here</a>. Part of this entry says:</p>



<blockquote><p>The&nbsp;meaning&nbsp;attached to the metric known as a probability is up to the user; it can represent long-run relative frequency of repeatable observations, a degree of belief, or a measure of veracity or plausibility.</p><cite>https://hbiostat.org/doc/glossary.pdf</cite></blockquote>



<p>and</p>



<blockquote><p>There are other schools of probability that do not require the notion of replication at all. For example, the school of&nbsp;subjective&nbsp;probability (associated with the&nbsp;Bayesian&nbsp;school) “considers probability as a measure of the degree of belief of a given subject in the occurrence of an event or, more generally, in the veracity of a given assertion” (see P. 55 of5). de Finetti defined subjective probability in terms of wagers and odds in betting. A risk-neutral individual would be willing to wager $P&nbsp;that an event will occur when the payoff is $1 and her subjective probability is&nbsp;P&nbsp;for the event.</p><cite>https://hbiostat.org/doc/glossary.pdf</cite></blockquote>



<p>As I wrote in the original post, I do not know the extensive literature on this topic well at all. But what Frank has summarised here is really useful in aiding my understanding of what the interpretation should be of the 95% probability statement attached to a 95% credible interval. It seems to me the notion of probability being invoked when interpreting a 95% credible interval has to be the subjective probability / degree of belief one described in the previous quote. Whether this definition/interpretation meets the criterion of being 'exact', as required by Frank in his tweet at the top of this post when asking for the exact interpretation of a particular realised frequentist confidence interval, I leave readers to decide.</p>

	<h2><strong>Social Media = Public Square</strong></h2>
<p>Presenting ourselves to the world comes with inherent risk. With every piece of ourselves we share online, we risk compromising our personal privacy and security. We show our faces, share our feelings, and sometimes engage in difficult discussions. The beauty of social media is that the global community can, for the first time in history, engage in the same discussion all at once. The new connections we make and old ones we maintain through social media more often than not outweigh the risk.</p>
<p>Yet, scrutiny and periodic reevaluation of the platforms we use to share our lives is vital to maintaining an open and trusted medium of communication. If the last decade has taught us anything, it’s that social media platforms of yore are no longer providing a beneficial service that outweighs the immense damage they’ve caused to our privacy.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-tracy-le-blanc-607812.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="853" srcset="https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-tracy-le-blanc-607812.jpg 1280w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-tracy-le-blanc-607812-300x200.jpg 300w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-tracy-le-blanc-607812-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-tracy-le-blanc-607812-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>The primary cause of the harm associated with social media is related to the centralized nature of current platforms. When a platform is centralized, it means all the content on said platform is controlled by a single party. Users of a centralized platform are subject to the actions taken by the single party controlling the platform. These centralized social media platforms generate revenue through the exploitative collection and sale of user data.</p>
<p>With a revenue model dependent on the sale of ads, centralized platforms are incentivized to maximize the value of the data sold by manipulating and censoring user content.</p>
<p>To illustrate the downsides of centralized social media platforms, I will focus on three of the biggest: Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.</p>
<h3>Data Collection</h3>
<p>Data collection is the engine that drives the revenue train for centralized platforms. Every user interaction is recorded and sold to target ads at very distinct groups of people.</p>
<p>Facebook’s privacy record leaves much to be desired. In my opinion, Facebook is no longer a social media platform and instead has become an efficient data mining operation. Facebook’s collection activities occur both inside and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/01/28/off-facebook-activity-page/">outside the application </a>itself. As recently as July 10th of this year, apps with Facebook integration through Facebook’s software development kit, or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21319784/ios-apps-crashing-spotify-tiktok-pinterest-tinder-facebook-sdk-certification-issue">SDK</a>, were shut down due to bugs within the development kit.</p>
<p>Facebook’s SDK is a part of their data mining operations. Every time an app integrates Facebook’s SDK, it pings Facebook’s servers any time a user logs into that application through their <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/03/27/zoom-ios-update-removes-feature-that-sent-user-data-to-facebook">Facebook account</a>. Through this SDK, Facebook collects user data from apps with said SDK integration.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pexels-freestocksorg-744464.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="853" srcset="https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pexels-freestocksorg-744464.jpg 1280w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pexels-freestocksorg-744464-300x200.jpg 300w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pexels-freestocksorg-744464-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pexels-freestocksorg-744464-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>With their major acquisitions of Instagram, WhatsApp, and more recently Giphy, Facebook’s native data collection net is wider than ever. The intrusive collection of user data has reached a point of negative return versus the social interactions made through their services. Facebook data collection policy is by no means unique. However, it presents the most poignant example of the lengths to which centralized social media platforms will go to harvest as much data as possible.</p>
<h3>Revenue Model</h3>
<p>The principal purpose centralized platforms like Facebook and Twitter collect user information is to sell that information to advertisers. Revenue generated by these sites is directly proportional to the correlation between data harvested and user engagement. The detrimental effects of a social media platform with an engagement driven revenue model can be seen clearly on Twitter and Facebook through the ads and content promoted by the platform, often through the use of algorithms. Twitter’s engagement algorithm has been accused of spurring <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/22/tech/twitter-algorithm-political-rhetoric/index.html">extreme political rhetoric</a> as recently as 2019.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-kaboompics-com-6335.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="853" srcset="https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-kaboompics-com-6335.jpg 1280w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-kaboompics-com-6335-300x200.jpg 300w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-kaboompics-com-6335-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-kaboompics-com-6335-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>The most concerning aspect of Twitter’s algorithm is how easily it can be manipulated by bots. Bots are computer-run accounts that automatically generate content through links and standard phrases on Twitter. With a deluge of content generated by these bots, Twitter’s algorithm is often manipulated to promote content often categorized as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldurkheimer/2018/04/16/on-the-internet-bots-have-already-overrun-humans-what-do-they-want/#1e48831776f8">propaganda and fake news</a>.</p>
<p>Yet, for all of Twitter’s shortcomings, Facebook retains the title of most reckless, through its egregious, and often times dangerous, algorithmic content manipulation. Facebook’s algorithm has promoted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/opinion/facebook-cancer-ads.html?searchResultPosition=9">fake treatments </a>to cancer patients, has been accused of <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/04/03/facebook-ad-algorithm-race-gender/">discriminatory</a> ad delivery practices, and stoking <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-political-ad-system-designed-polarize/">political partisanship</a>. I’m sure almost everyone has a story about a creepily specific ad showing up on their timeline. Creepy is precisely what Facebook’s proprietary, and therefore secret, algorithm is.</p>
<h3>Censorship</h3>
<p>Censorship across centralized social media platforms is rampant and affects all ideologies across every platform. To discuss censorship I will focus primarily on YouTube and how its approach exemplifies the problematic nature of centralized platform content moderation. Since its acquisition by Google in 2006, YouTube has become one of the most visited sites on the internet. This centralized platform houses mainstream and niche content, with one set of rules governing it.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-markus-spiske-2990644-1024x682.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-markus-spiske-2990644-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-markus-spiske-2990644-300x200.jpg 300w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-markus-spiske-2990644-768x512.jpg 768w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-markus-spiske-2990644.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>
<p>All centralized social media platforms have a fundamental problem with content moderation. Effective content moderation requires a “scalpel”, not a “hammer”. With large centralized platforms like YouTube, there is no way to perform nuanced moderation. As a result, YouTube uses the hammer approach through automated content moderation tools. What results from the hammer approach to content moderation is the censorship of certain groups on the platform who follow the rules set forth by YouTube themselves. For example, LGBTQ YouTube creators’ videos were flagged and demonetized by <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/10/10/20893258/youtube-lgbtq-censorship-demonetization-nerd-city-algorithm-report">YouTube’s algorithm</a> because of the algorithm’s inability to distinguish non-sexual queer content from sexually explicit “mature” content. Where large centralized social media platforms are fighting against misinformation on their platforms, a “hammer” approach to censorship is both ineffective and potentially dangerous.</p>
<h3>Decentralized Social Media</h3>
<p>The issues of data collection, revenue models, and censorship in social media are related to the centralized nature of these platforms. Fortunately, decentralized and open source alternatives are available. Three examples of decentralized social media platforms are <strong>Mastodon</strong>, <strong>Pixelfed</strong>, and <strong>Peertube</strong>.</p>
<p>Decentralized social media platforms operate differently from centralized platforms. For example, if you wanted to communicate with anyone on Facebook, you must have an account on the Facebook server (i.e. have a Facebook account). However, with a decentralized platform like Mastodon, there is no central “Mastodon server” like Facebook. There are multiple servers (called <em>instances</em>) all running Mastodon separately. Now, if you wanted to communicate with someone on Mastodon, you just need an account on any instance running Mastodon. Anyone can run an instance and each instance is then administrated and moderated by whoever hosts the instance. This instanced approach allows for the “scalpel” approach to content moderation that centralized platforms are incapable of implementing. With volunteer moderators managing the content on specific instances, and migration from one instance to another made easy, users can find or even create an instance that caters to the specific moderation practices they desire.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/activitypub.png" alt="" width="474" height="291" srcset="https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/activitypub.png 1012w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/activitypub-300x184.png 300w, https://hfet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/activitypub-768x471.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px"></p>
<p>Instances “speak” to each other through protocols like <a href="https://activitypub.rocks/">ActivityPub</a>. Through ActivityPub, users on one instance can talk to users on another instance, creating a social media network that is both open and closed. Posts from users on other instances are visible on ones feed, but those posts can be separated from posts from users on their local instance.</p>
<p>Mastodon, Pixelfed, and Peertube are open source, meaning anyone can examine the code and run an instance themselves. With no centralization, there is no dragnet collection and sale of user data. Instances may have a Patreon or other monetary support system in place to help finance the upkeep of an instance.</p>
<p>Decentralized social media is supported by the community, for the community, and as such there are no ads or algorithms. Social Media feeds are in chronological order, and “likes” and “favorites” are not recorded and used to push intensely personal ads. Building communities and sharing our lives on these decentralized social media platforms brings the value of connection through online platforms back to reasonable and appropriate levels.</p>
<p>As you may have noticed, the biggest player in the centralized social media space is also the most exploitative. I strongly believe deleting ones Facebook account is the biggest and most effective step one can take in reclaiming their privacy. Untangling oneself from Facebook’s many arms is difficult, but starting with the base app is the best place to start. Mastodon and Pixelfed provide great platforms to begin building an online community anew, one friend at a time.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3><p>When creating an implant what language first comes to mind? Of course, the answer is it depends;
however, typically it is one of the following languages: C, C++, C#, Rust, Go, maybe even Python.
While those languages are all dandy, they are not the only programming languages that exist.
Throughout this series, I will be exploring different languages and seeing what
they bring to the table for implant &amp; offensive tool development.
The first language that will be examined is <a href="https://nim-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nim</a>.</p><h3 id="what-is-nim">What is Nim</h3><p>If we visit <a href="https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nim’s Github page</a> there is a concise definition of what Nim is,
“Nim is a statically typed compiled systems programming language. It combines successful concepts from mature languages like Python, Ada and Modula.”
Some of the “big” benefits of Nim are:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>* Cross-Platform: Generated executables support Windows, Linux, BSD, and macOS.</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>* Nim can compile to C, C++, Objective-C, and JavaScript.</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>* Nim binaries are small and the compiler toolchain allows for a lot of optimizations</span></p><p><span>4</span><span>* Nim can interface with other languages through Nim's foreign function interface (FFI) [1]</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>* Nim syntax is very quick to pick up and is reminiscent of Python.</span></p></pre></div><p>[1]<!-- -->: <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/backends.html#interfacing-nim-code-calling-the-backend" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://nim-lang.org/docs/backends.html#interfacing-nim-code-calling-the-backend</a></p><p>Of course, these aren’t the only benefits of the language, more will reveal themself as time goes on.</p><h3 id="a-simple-injector">A Simple Injector</h3><p>Let’s get hands-on with Nim and see how to develop a simple injector.
Below is an implementation of a typical CreateRemoteThread injector:
Instead of having to manually interop with the Windows API via the FFI there
are <a href="https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nimble</a> packages that contain some Windows API
definitions. The one I tend to use is <a href="https://github.com/khchen/winim" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Winim</a>.
Winim can also <a href="https://khchen.github.io/winim/com.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">interop with COM</a>.</p><p><img src="https://secbytes.net/static/c9d6d68b96f6495705555553bc886dba/fa827/crt_injector.png" alt="crt_injector"></p>
      
    <p>Let’s compile, run the program:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>nim c --run crtinjection.nim</span></p></pre></div><p>and make sure everything works. By default when you compile Nim code it generates
C code. In the latter section “Integrating into Existing Tooling” verification shall
ensue.</p><p>As an aside, if you do not want to use 3rd party packages that is fine if you examine
what Winim does under the hood for example when <a href="https://github.com/khchen/winim/blob/d300192c588f73dddef26e3c317f148aa23465c3/winim/inc/winbase.nim#L1942" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">calling CreateRemoteThread</a>.
It is simply importing the function for us as denoted by the <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#foreign-function-interface-importc-pragma" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">importc pragma</a>
as that allows us to import a proc or a variable from C. Also, available for importing
from foreign languages are: <code>.importcpp</code>, <code>.importobjc</code>, and <code>importjs</code>.</p><p>CreateRemoteThread proc:</p><p><code>proc CreateRemoteThread*(hProcess: HANDLE, lpThreadAttributes: LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES, dwStackSize: SIZE_T, lpStartAddress: LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE, lpParameter: LPVOID, dwCreationFlags: DWORD, lpThreadId: LPDWORD): HANDLE {.winapi, stdcall, dynlib: "kernel32", importc.}</code></p><h3 id="peeking-under-the-hood">Peeking Under the Hood</h3><p>What is going on under the hood is quite interesting. If we inspect the executable’s IAT we see
there are no static imports for OpenProcess, VirualAllocEx, WriteProcessMemory, and CreateRemoteThread.
That is because Nim is dynamically loading the required libraries with LoadLibraryA and GetProcAddress.
Furthermore, when compiled Nim will place the source code of the language you are targeting in a folder
called nimcache. You can also specify the nimcache path for generated files with the compiler flag
<code>--nimcache:PATH</code>.</p><p>Below is a snippet of generated code for inject.nim
To make this easier to read I have compiled the program with an additional flag <code>--embedsrc:on</code> this flag tells the Nim compiler
to embed the source code as comments in the generated output. For compilation:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>nim c --run --hints:on --d:release --embedsrc:on inject.nim</span></p></pre></div><p>A snippet of generated C source code that performs injection:</p><p><img src="https://secbytes.net/static/f871bb711a469344dbd19d321401823a/9a8de/snippet_inject.png" alt="Inject_Snippet"></p>
      
    <p>Here we can inspect what our function calls are doing under the hood, the
Windows API calls done by winim rely on the <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/dynlib.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">dynlib module</a> to dynamically
invoke calls. If we inspect that source code we can see
the LoadLibraryA and GetProcAddress combination.</p><p><img src="https://secbytes.net/static/8c2d1836e5e394c3d66dd878af26a70f/e3d9b/dynlib_code.png" alt="dynlib_code"></p>
      
    <h3 id="nim-and-donut">Nim and Donut</h3><p>Coming from C# one of my favorite tools for crafting payloads is <a href="https://github.com/theWover/Donut" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Donut</a>.
One of the great features with Donut is that it not only works with .NET assemblies but also with native DLLs
and executables. Since Nim can generate both C and C++ source code and link it to a native executable or DLL
Donut is an amazing utility that can transform our output to shellcode.
Since shellcode is language-agnostic we can easily integrate it into other tooling.</p><h3 id="integrating-into-existing-tooling">Integrating into Existing Tooling</h3><p>With shellcode you can easily integrate it into your own custom injectors in the language of your choice.
Of course since these are native executables and DLL’s we can also perform manually mapping and load them into memory.
Coming from C# my goto tools to perform the manual mapping are <a href="https://github.com/Dewera/Lunar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Lunar</a>
and the <a href="https://github.com/cobbr/SharpSploit/tree/master/SharpSploit/Execution/DynamicInvoke" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">D/Invoke tooling in SharpSploit</a>.</p><p>Let’s compile the injector code as a DLL and export an inject function.
To export the function we need to tell Nim to export it by adding the
following pragmas: <code>exportc, dynlib, and cdecl. or stdcall.</code>
The resulting inject proc is as follows:
<code>proc inject(pid: int): bool {.stdcall, exportc, dynlib.} = </code> <br>
Let’s compile the DLL as follows:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>nim c --d:release --app:lib --opt:size --inject.nim</span></p></pre></div><p>With the DLL let’s manually map it using SharpSploit’s D/Invoke tooling.
If you specifically just want the D/Invoke part you can also use the <a href="https://github.com/TheWover/DInvoke" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">repository</a>
or <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/DInvoke/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">nuget package</a> for solely D/Invoke.</p><p>Manual Map Code:</p><p><img src="https://secbytes.net/static/f19f9f651aaf612e5aedd6cb03cebbdd/77a0f/dinvoke_nimmanualmapcode.png" alt="dinvokemanmapcode"></p>
      
    <p>Let’s run it and make sure our crt injector proc is executed properly.</p><p><img src="https://secbytes.net/static/66af0e3621b0f60c4d539a0403723250/ff8d2/manmapdemo.png" alt="manmepdemo"></p>
      
    <h3 id="embedding-nimscript-with-nimscripter">Embedding NimScript with Nimscripter</h3><p>Within Nim, there is an evolving scripting language known as NimScript.
In the NimScript <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/nims.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">documentation</a> it is defined as,
“the subset of Nim that can be evaluated by Nim’s built-in virtual machine (VM).”
NimScript is typically used as a configuration language in a devops role for example to run tests and build projects.
However, one of the biggest caveats with NimScript as stated within the documentation,
Nim’s <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/backends.html#interfacing-nim-code-calling-the-backend" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">FFI (foreign function interface)</a> is not available in NimScript.
This means that any stdlib module which relies on importc cannot be used in the VM.”
Nim’s FFI is how Nim can call other functions written in other programming languages, which is basically
Nim’s cross-platform version <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/native-interop/pinvoke" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">P/Invoke</a>.
A possible solution is to write the FFI functionality in Nim and expose to NimScript.</p><p>Does that mean NimScript is not viable? Absolutely not,
especially with the slow shift in which especially for implant development
it’s not always ideal to statically embed everything. Instead leaning towards a lightweight
implant that can dynamically resolve commands within memory so even if an analyst
obtains the binary, not everything is revealed.</p><p>There are already a couple open source projects: (<a href="https://github.com/komerdoor/nim-embedded-nimscript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/komerdoor/nim-embedded-nimscript</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/Serenitor/embeddedNimscript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/Serenitor/embeddedNimscript</a>) that show how to use
NimScript as an embedded scripting language.</p><p>However, those repositories while noble do not easily allow the user to expose Nim code to NimScript and
is are simplistic.
Luckily, a new repository known as <a href="https://github.com/beef331/nimscripter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nimscripter</a> allows for easy interoperability between Nim and NimScript.</p><p>Below is an example in which the FFI specific code to call <code>MessageBoxA</code> is exposed to NimScript allowing
us to pass in a string of NimScript to invoke the Nim proc.</p><p><img src="https://secbytes.net/static/a0329212717d301eda283a791eda6fc5/fa827/nimscript_embeddedmessage.png" alt="nimscript_embeddedmessage"></p>
      
    <p>In a nutshell, what is happening under the hood is the
<a href="https://github.com/beef331/nimscripter/blob/master/src/nimscripter.nim#L140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">script is loaded</a> and the main body is evaluated which allows us to access symbols it exposes.
A small caveat is that you need to include Nim’s stdlib as an external folder; luckily, depending on what modules
you are you using from stdlib you may be able to remove some if unused.
If you would like to read more about embedding NimScript as well as just learn more about NimScript, I encourage you to check out this wonderful series:
<a href="https://peterme.net/using-nimscript-as-a-configuration-language-embedding-nimscript-pt-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://peterme.net/using-nimscript-as-a-configuration-language-embedding-nimscript-pt-1.html</a>.</p><h3 id="putting-the-pieces-together">Putting the Pieces Together</h3><p>While a simple injector is cool let’s see how hard it is to develop an implant
in Nim. Luckily, just within Nim’s cross-platform <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/lib.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">stdlib</a> is everything needed to create a basic implant
from the FFI for API calls, httpclient for http requests, and stellar json support as a medium for data. The C2 I chose to develop the implant for is <a href="https://github.com/its-a-feature/Mythic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Mythic</a>, Mythic
is very sophisticated and well structured. Furthermore, implants are essentially plug and play as everything is
dockerized and your agent just needs to communicate back and forth via certain rest api endpoints.</p><p>Sprouting a few weeks later <a href="https://github.com/MythicAgents/Nimplant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nimplant</a> is born.</p><p><img src="https://secbytes.net/static/3125a933e063ab22da800b151f09b486/a048d/nimplant_logo.png" alt="nimplant_logo"></p>
      
    <p>Nimplant is a cross-platform Linux and Windows implant for Mythic C2 that is fully asynchronous
with the agent able to generate both C and C++ source code. Currently it just has basic functionality; however, it will be updated
overtime and become much more sophisticated. If you would like to read more about Nimplant
feel free to read the <a href="https://github.com/MythicAgents/Nimplant/tree/master/documentation-payload/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">project’s documentation</a>.</p><p>Example Nimplant checkin:</p><p><img src="https://secbytes.net/static/5ae0ab5e6ae6720c5cd26a95d1d8122b/a6ea6/nimplant_demo.png" alt="nimplant_demo"></p>
      
    <h3 id="obfuscation">Obfuscation</h3><p>With Nim, there are ample opportunities throughout the development cycle to introduce obfuscation.
Three key areas that I will highlight are:</p><p><strong>Note: Of course these aren’t the only forms of obfuscation you can do just a small subset.</strong></p><p><h4>1. Code Obfuscation</h4></p><p>With Nim opportunities for code obfuscation are ripe, two quick and easy nimble packages
you can utilize are: <a href="https://github.com/Yardanico/nim-strenc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">nim-strenc</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Yardanico/nuglifier" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">nuglifier</a>.
Let’s just apply nim-strenc to the string literal and view the resulting C file in
our Nimcache.</p><p>Before:</p><p><img src="https://secbytes.net/static/6b91405cb049764789b3dcaa914603d8/e4370/hello_world_basic.png" alt="beforenimhello"></p>
      
    <p>After:</p><p><img src="https://secbytes.net/static/c282e87fe02cf7ca70c23d2ec7127c68/e4370/strenc_hello_world.png" alt="afternimhellostrenc"></p>
      
    <p>When compiling the creator of strenc recommends turning hints off and stripping the binary so we shall do that.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>nim c --run --hints:off --d:release --passL:-s</span></p></pre></div><p><code>--passL</code> will pass an option to the linker and we are passing <code>-s</code> to the GCC linker to perform stripping.
Within the Nimcache folder, go to hello_r and view the file <code>@mhello.nim.c</code>.
Inside that file we can see both string literals after they have been xor encrypted:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>STRING_LITERAL</span><span>(</span><span>TM__xLHv575t3PG1lB5wK05Xqg_3</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"\207\251\241\236\234\320\246\231\205\230\221\333"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>12</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span><span>STRING_LITERAL</span><span>(</span><span>TM__xLHv575t3PG1lB5wK05Xqg_4</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"\360\275\246"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div><p>With nim-strenc if you look at the codebase it’s less than 30 lines.
It’s applying a …</p></div></article></div>

Doing this is tricky in a React app that uses server side rendering (SSR) because client and server rendering work quite differently: Client render is async so data can be loaded inside components when they render, but server render is completely synchronous - the data must be loaded before render happens.</p><p data-reactid="57">Data loading is, of course, async. The client component-centric data loading pattern is nice, but it's incompatible with synchronous server render. React simply has no mechanism to wait for data to load when components render on SSR. There's a further problem too: React also provides no built-in way to hydrate data loaded during SSR into client state on first render. This is also up to you to implement.</p><p data-reactid="58">So, full stack data loading in React is a tricky problem. A couple of solutions have emerged:</p><ol data-reactid="59"><li data-reactid="60"><p data-reactid="61">Load data at the route level, instead of the component level, then pass data to all components under the route. Works on SSR since the route is known in the request, so data can be loaded before render begins. Can be implemented by piecing together router and state manager libraries.</p></li><li data-reactid="62"><p data-reactid="63">Use a framework that wraps React and abstracts the problem away, perhaps by providing a framework-specific async data loading function for components that works on SSR, and also takes care of hydrating state on the client.</p></li></ol><p data-reactid="64">React Frontload aims to provide a third way - the component-centric data loading pattern available full stack, but without having to buy into a whole framework just to get this feature. It's just a small library that solves this one problem, and can be used in any React stack.</p><p data-reactid="68">Here's an example of loading data into a component with React Frontload</p><p><span>const</span> <span>Component</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

  Intro
  <a href="#intro">#</a>
</h2>
<p>TorchScript is one of the most important parts of the Pytorch ecosystem, allowing portable, efficient and nearly seamless deployment. With just a few lines of <code>torch.jit</code> code and some simple model changes you can export an asset that runs anywhere <code>libtorch</code> does. It’s an important toolset to master if you want to run your models outside the lab at high efficiency.</p>
<p>Good <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/Intro_to_TorchScript_tutorial.html">introductory material</a> is already available for starting to work with <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html">TorchScript</a> including <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_export.html">execution in the C++ <code>libtorch</code> runtime</a>, and <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit_language_reference.html">reference material</a> is also provided. This article is a collection of topics going beyond the basics of your first export.</p>
<h2 id="tracing-vs-scripting">
  Tracing vs Scripting
  <a href="#tracing-vs-scripting">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Pytorch provides two methods for generating TorchScript from your model code — tracing and scripting — but which should you use? Let’s recap how they work:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.jit.trace.html"><strong>Tracing.</strong></a> When using <code>torch.jit.trace</code> you’ll provide your model and sample input as arguments. The input will be fed through the model as in regular inference and the executed operations will be traced and recorded into TorchScript. Logical structure will be frozen into the path taken during this sample execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.jit.script.html"><strong>Scripting.</strong></a> When using <code>torch.jit.script</code> you’ll simply provide your model as an argument. TorchScript will be generated from the static inspection of the <code>nn.Module</code> contents (recursively).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not obvious from the tutorial documentation, but choosing which method to use is a fairly simple and fluid choice:</p>
<h3 id="use-scripting-by-default">
  Use Scripting by Default
  <a href="#use-scripting-by-default">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Because <code>torch.jit.script</code> captures both the operations and full conditional logic of your model, it’s a great place to start. If your model doesn’t need any <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit_unsupported.html">unsupported Pytorch functionality</a> and has logic restricted to the <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit_builtin_functions.html#python-built-in-functions">supported subset of Python functions</a> and <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit_python_reference.html">syntax</a>, then <code>torch.jit.script</code> should be all you need.</p>
<p>One major advantage of scripting over tracing is that an export is likely to either fail for a well-defined reason — implying a clear code modification — or succeed without warnings.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Unlike Python, TorchScript is Statically Typed</strong></p>
<p>You will need to be consistent about container element datatypes, and be wary of implicit function signatures. A useful practice is to use type hints in method signatures.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Despite TorchScript’s ability to capture conditional logic it does not allow you to run arbitrary Python within <code>libtorch</code> — a popular misconception.</p>
<h3 id="use-tracing-if-you-must">
  Use Tracing if You Must
  <a href="#use-tracing-if-you-must">#</a>
</h3>
<p>There are a few special cases in which <code>torch.jit.trace</code> may be useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are unable to modify the model code — because you do not have access or ownership — you may find scripting the model simply will not work because it uses unsupported Pytorch/Python functionality.</li>
<li>In pursuit of performance or to bake in architectural decisions the logic freezing behavior of tracing might be preferable — similar to inlining C/C++ code.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Pay Close Attention to Tracer Warnings</strong></p>
<p>Due to how tracing can simplify model behavior, each warning should be fully understood and only then ignored (or fixed). Also, be sure to trace in eval mode if you are exporting a model for production inference!</p>

</blockquote>

<h3 id="use-both-together">
  Use Both Together
  <a href="#use-both-together">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Scripted and traced code can be freely mixed, and this is often a great choice. See the existing <a href="https://pytorch.org/">pytorch.org</a> documentation for <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html#mixing-tracing-and-scripting">details</a> and <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/Intro_to_TorchScript_tutorial.html#mixing-scripting-and-tracing">examples</a>.</p>
<h2 id="device-pinning">
  Device Pinning
  <a href="#device-pinning">#</a>
</h2>
<p>If you find yourself using <code>torch.jit.trace</code> on some code, you’ll have to actively deal with some of the gotchas or face performance and portability consequences. Besides addressing any warnings Pytorch emits, you’ll also need to keep an eye out for device pinning. Just like <code>torch.jit.trace</code> records and freezes conditional logic, it will also trace and make constant the values resulting from this logic — this can include device constants.</p>
<p>Using this sample code:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>arange</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>.</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If we trace while executing on CPU or GPU we get this TorchScript (scroll to the right on mobile):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>:</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>:</span>
  <span>_0</span> <span>=</span> <span>ops</span><span>.</span><span>prim</span><span>.</span><span>NumToTensor</span><span>(</span><span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>))</span>
  <span>_1</span> <span>=</span> <span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>arange</span><span>(</span><span>annotate</span><span>(</span><span>number</span><span>,</span> <span>_0</span><span>),</span> <span>dtype</span><span>=</span><span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>layout</span><span>=</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>device</span><span>=</span><span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>device</span><span>(</span><span>"cpu"</span><span>),</span> <span>pin_memory</span><span>=</span><span>False</span><span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>_1</span></code></pre></div>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You can see that <code>torch.device("cpu")</code> has been inserted as a constant into the generated TorchScript. If we try to get clever with this code:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>arange</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>.</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>),</span> <span>device</span><span>=</span><span>X</span><span>.</span><span>device</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Tracing will now result in TorchScript that is pinned to the tracing device. When traced on GPU, we see this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span>
    <span>X</span><span>:</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>:</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>_1</span></code></pre></div>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tensors Created During Tracing Will Have Their Device Pinned</strong></p>
<p>This can be a significant performance and portability problem.</p>

</blockquote>

<h3 id="performance-and-portability">
  Performance and Portability
  <a href="#performance-and-portability">#</a>
</h3>
<p>If we later deserialize and run this TorchScript in <code>libtorch</code> the <code>arange</code> tensor will always be created on the device that is pinned — <code>torch.device("cpu")</code> or <code>torch.device("cuda:0")</code> in the examples above. If the rest of the model is running on a different device this can result in costly memory transfers and synchronization.</p>
<p>This device pinning issue extends to multi-GPU scenarios as well. If you have traced and exported a model on <code>cuda:0</code> and then run it on <code>cuda:1</code> you’ll see transfers and synchronization between the devices. Not good. Perhaps even worse, if such a model is run in an environment without any CUDA-capable device it will fail since <code>cuda:0</code> doesn’t exist.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Replace Tensors Created During Execution With Parameters</strong></p>
<p>Tensors created in the execution path while tracing will have their device pinned. Depending on model logic, these can often be turned into Parameters created during construction.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>An example of the problem looks like this in Nsight Systems:</p>

<p>Subscript-based masking and indexing will always pin the tracing device into generated TorchScript. :(</p>

<h2 id="direct-graph-modification">
  Direct Graph Modification
  <a href="#direct-graph-modification">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Once we’ve used <code>torch.jit.script</code> or <code>torch.jit.trace</code> to generate a ScriptModule or ScriptFunction we can use <code>.graph</code>, <code>.inlined_graph</code> or <code>.code</code> to understand exactly what TorchScript has been generated. Though it has an entirely undocumented interface it is possible (and fun) to access and modify the generated TorchScript AST directly via the <code>.graph</code> method.</p>
<p>The most useful parts of the API are defined in <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/torch/csrc/jit/python/python_ir.cpp">torch/csrc/jit/python/python_ir.cpp</a>. As you can see, all the basic functionality is present for finding and changing the graph nodes you want. If you change nodes or arguments and then persist the module your subsequent TorchScript load and inference will reflect your changes, though modules cannot be changed recursively in this way (<code>torch.jit.freeze</code> can be useful here).</p>
<p>An example of the kind of graph modification that is possible:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>undevice</span><span>(</span><span>tsc</span><span>):</span>
    <span># use ::to variant which does not hardcode device</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>to_node</span> <span>in</span> <span>tsc</span><span>.</span><span>graph</span><span>.</span><span>findAllNodes</span><span>(</span><span>'aten::to'</span><span>):</span>
        <span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>dtype</span><span>,</span> <span>layout</span><span>,</span> <span>device</span><span>,</span> <span>pin_mem</span><span>,</span> <span>non_blocking</span><span>,</span> <span>copy</span><span>,</span> <span>mem_format</span> <span>=</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>to_node</span><span>.</span><span>inputs</span><span>())</span>
        <span>to_node</span><span>.</span><span>removeAllInputs</span><span>()</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>a</span> <span>in</span> <span>[</span><span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>dtype</span><span>,</span> <span>non_blocking</span><span>,</span> <span>copy</span><span>,</span> <span>mem_format</span><span>]:</span>
            <span>to_node</span><span>.</span><span>addInput</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span>

    <span>for</span> <span>constant</span> <span>in</span> <span>tsc</span><span>.</span><span>graph</span><span>.</span><span>findAllNodes</span><span>(</span><span>'prim::Constant'</span><span>):</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>not</span> <span>constant</span><span>.</span><span>hasUses</span><span>():</span>
            <span>constant</span><span>.</span><span>destroy</span><span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The above code will modify a traced graph, changing <code>aten::to</code> to use an overload which doesn’t change memory location.</p>
<p>But what is this really useful for? As an undocumented API you’d be unwise to use this capability in a production pipeline unless you like maintenance coding. I would only recommend it for research, as in the above example which I used to understand and profile the transfer/synchronization behavior of tensor subscripting.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Don’t Bother With Direct Graph Modification</strong></p>
<p>For legitimate production use-cases you can almost always find a way to modify your model code to generate the TorchScript you want.</p>

  Rewrite for ONNX/TensorRT Export
  <a href="#rewrite-for-onnxtensorrt-export">#</a>
</h2>
<p>You can get some <a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-deepstream-pipeline/#stage-3-hacked-deepstream-mdash-80-tensorrt-20-torchscript">awesome results with TensorRT</a> but exporting a model from Pytorch to TensorRT is far from a sure thing. The export path to ONNX and then to TensorRT can fail due to missing or incompatible operations at either step and this can be frustrating.</p>
<p>After the obligatory Google search, I’ve found a reasonable hail-mary approach is to rewrite your tensor processing code to avoid unsupported operators. I can’t give general advice for this but let me show you an example of how this can be possible: <code>repeat_interleave</code>.</p>

<p>Doesn’t work:</p>

<p>The Last Super is<strong> brand new Super Nintendo (SNES) game</strong> created to celebrate the 30th birthday of the console!</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzQ1NzUyMDUuZ2lm/original/sd47O2.gif"><br></p>
<p>As the last SNES cartridge on Earth, you'll have to move and jump around in each of the 20 levels of the game so every SNES can play you! But don't let a SNES without cartridge for too long...</p>
<h2>SNES ROM or cartridge?</h2>
<p>The Last Super is an actual game for the Super Nintendo / SNES / Super Famicom console. If you want to play it on a real console, you can <a href="https://catskullelectronics.com/collections/games/products/the-last-super" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">buy a beautiful game cartridge</a> from Catskull Games. As an extra bonus, this cartridge also contains my previous SNES game <a href="https://drludos.itch.io/keeping-snes-alive" target="_blank">Keeping SNES Alive!</a><br></p>

<p>The cartridge is made from newly built elements<em> (PCB, shells, etc)</em> all designed and hand assembled in the US by Catskull himself. The cartridge is region-free. It has been tested and working on NTSC SNES, PAL SNES, JP SFC, and Analogue Super Nt.</p>
<p>If your prefer to play it on emulator, you can <a href="https://drludos.itch.io/the-last-super/purchase" target="_blank">download a ROM version of the game here</a>, and use it with any SNES emulator you like. Here are a few examples: </p>

<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzQ1ODEyMzIuanBn/original/sTHVSK.jpg"><br></p>
<h2>Behind the scenes</h2>
<p>The game was <strong>programmed in C</strong> using the wonderful <a href="https://github.com/alekmaul/pvsneslib" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">PVSNESlib</a> by Alekmaul.</p>
<p>The <strong>music was composed by </strong><a href="https://soundcloud.com/xracecar" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>XRACECAR</strong></a>. The two tracks are:</p>
<ul><li><em>"ayyy you know the man"</em> (under a Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-SA license)<br><a href="http://battleofthebits.org/arena/Entry/ayyy+you+know+the+man.xm/23747/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://battleofthebits.org/arena/Entry/ayyy+you+know+the+man.xm/23747/</a> <em><a href="http://battleofthebits.org/arena/Entry/7049+Bytes+of+Memories/25393/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><br></a></em></li><li><em><a href="http://battleofthebits.org/arena/Entry/7049+Bytes+of+Memories/25393/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"></a>"7049 Bytes of Memories"</em> (under a Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-SA license)<br><a href="http://battleofthebits.org/arena/Entry/7049+Bytes+of+Memories/25393/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://battleofthebits.org/arena/Entry/7049+Bytes+of+Memories/25393/</a></li></ul>
<p><strong>A fun fact about the audio</strong>: the <em>"shlack</em>" sound that you hear when the cartridge enters a console is an<strong> actual recording of the noise made by my SNES power button</strong> <em>(recorded directly from my childhood console, still alive and kicking after 30 years!)</em></p>
<p>Last but not the least, <a href="https://drludos.itch.io/the-last-super/purchase" target="_blank">the full source code is included</a>.<strong> I spent a lot of time cleaning up and commenting the code as thoroughly as I could</strong>, hoping it'll help and motivate you to start making new SNES games too!<br></p></div></div>]]>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Systemd targets are a special kind of unit, this is how I used
them to serialize the boot order of my server and how I am planning
on using them to shape the supervision tree of my system.</p>

<p>As a Linux user I have systemd installed on my devices but I usually tweak
somebody else unit or write a service unit to start a program at boot.</p>

<p>This has changed some time ago when I started looking more into other
unit types that are available for use.</p>

<p>I started with <em>timers</em> to automate recurring tasks such as renewing
certificates using certbot but there is little information about how to
use the rest of the unit types.</p>

<p>For this time we are going to look at a target unit because I see it
as the most useful to get out and I happened to be working on mine recently.</p>

<h3 id="targets">targets</h3>

<p>As I run more and more services on my server I find that there is
more need to divide them into layers looking at their common dependencies and
what they provide; some of them are there to provide an internal service and others
are there for displaying HTML to me.
E.g. most of my web services use the same postgresql cluster and they should all
be started when this becomes available.</p>

<p>Basically for this instance we are going to divide programs I run into two
categories, infrastructure and front-facing. For both groups we will make
a target unit to group them and impose a start order.</p>

<p>For this experiment we will make two targets, <strong>infra.target</strong> and <strong>front.target</strong>,
group the services to be started by their target and add everything to the
supervision tree.</p>

<span>After</span><span>=</span><span>infra.target</span>
<span>Wants</span><span>=</span><span>infra.target web-app.service</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now for a brief explanation, when starting <strong>infra.target</strong> we are also starting
the units <strong>postgresql.service</strong> and <strong>nginx.service</strong> as they are listed as <em>Wants</em>
and the same is true for starting <strong>front-end.target</strong> starting <strong>infra.target</strong> and
<strong>web-app.service</strong>.</p>

<p>With out dependencies out of the way we also have to ensure order of execution, starting
a web app before the database server is started is not what we want.</p>

<p>What we have to understand here is that we have expressed dependency but not ordering; to
express ordering of units startup we have to use the <em>After</em>, <em>Before</em> directives.</p>

<p>So going back to the previous example we want <strong>front.target</strong> to be started after <strong>infra.target</strong>
and all its dependencies have completed the start up sequence as this means that both
<strong>postgresql.service</strong> and <strong>nginx.service</strong> have been started.</p>

<p>We have taken our initial problem, ensuring some infrastructure will be started, and put a
time constraint on when our front end is started. But we are not done yet!</p>

<p>The startup sequence differs from unit type to unit type; e.g. a service unit has finished the
startup sequence when all <em>ExecStart*</em> directives have been issued, what about a target unit<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>?</p>

<p>This could become an issue with a long startup time, e.g. connection to a another machine to register
you have booted, but for things such as starting nginx or a small postgresql cluster things should be
fast enough.</p>



<p>The last step to take is to notice that we have a chain linking our
targets <strong>front-end.target</strong> -&gt; <strong>infra.target</strong> -&gt; <strong>multi-user.target</strong>
and we can then change the default target from <strong>default.target</strong> to
<strong>front-end.target</strong> and the boot sequence will still go through you previous setup.</p>

<p>So wrapping up we saw how you can use a target unit to wrap together part of your services and wait for
them to start all together, this will enable you to have layers of services and overall
abstract a little more over the server you are booting.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><h3 id="openmp-vs-posix-threads">OpenMP vs POSIX threads</h3>
<p>Both are APIs for shared-memory programming. In C, OpenMP is a relatively high-level extension, providing compiler directives for parallelizing many programs with ease while some low-level thread interactions may be difficult to program. Pthreads provide some low-level coordination constructs that are unavailable in OpenMP, making other programs easier to parallelize while requiring explicit specification of the behavior of each thread, which may virtually be any that is conceivable.</p>
<p>Pthreads programs can be used with <em>any</em> C compiler, provided the system has a Pthreads library. OpenMP requires compiler support for some operations, which <em>many</em> compilers provide.</p>
<h3 id="area-under-the-curve">Area Under the Curve</h3>
<p>The program we are about to develop is oftentimes called the 'Hello world!' of parallel programming. We will be using the following formula for <cite>arctan(1)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></cite> in approximating the value for π.</p>
<p><span><span><img src="https://hasithsen.github.io/tech/posts/parallelizing-pi-approx-openmp/Leibniz-formula-for-pi.png" alt="Leibniz-formula-for-pi.png"></span><span><span>Just as we learned a long time ago in Kindergarten, the value of the integral here is the area between the graph and the x-axis while x goes from 0 to 1.</span></span></span></p>
<p>Going through the serial version of the program in C, the value for above is calculated for each integer within range <strong>[1, N)</strong> and summed up within a loop. The resulting <strong>sum</strong> is them divided by <strong>N</strong> for getting an estimate of <strong>π / 4</strong>, before printing out the calculated <em>approximate</em> for π.</p>

<p>To compile above with <code>gcc</code>, use following.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">gcc -o &lt;outputname&gt; &lt;filename&gt;.c -f openmp -lm -Wall -g
</code></pre></div><h3 id="modifying-parallelized-code">Modifying Parallelized Code</h3>
<p>Before changing anything, it pays to understand whatever we want changed in the first-place. So, let us go through the above code. The function <code>omp_get_wtime()</code>, defined in <code>omp.h</code>, returns the amount of seconds since a previous <em>fixed</em> point in time (included for execution timing purposes). Setting the number of threads to spawn when running parallel code (code inside parallel scope, that is) done by <code>omp_set_num_threds</code>. Changing the <code>set</code> to <code>get</code> and calling from <em>within</em> a parallel section returns the number of threads in execution (<code>get</code> counterpart is available for most functions with <code>set</code>). However, due to resource constraints on the system, it is possible we ending up with a lower number of threads.</p>
<p>The directive <code>#pragma omp parallel</code> is for parallelizing the code–it is safe to assume if this is not present somewhere, the program will not be parallelized by OpenMP. The scope of code that needs to be executed in parallel may be defined the same way we do scoping in C, with <code>{}</code>, or without–whereas only immediately following code line will be considered in-scope. This is where new threads will be spawned and start running alongside the master thread, branching the execution.</p>
<p>Any variables created within the parallel scope are private for each thread (i.e. <code>sum_thread</code>), and will not contribute to race conditions. Therefore, the <code>for</code> loop incrementing <code>sum_thread</code> is divided among threads spawned. Please note the way threads divide the iterations among themselves can be handled up to some extent with specific directives, the default behavior is expected here by omitting them.</p>
<p>Critical sections may be scoped within <code>#pragma omp atomic</code> or <code>#pragma omp critical</code>. The former enables low level atomicity of execution (with higher performance) if available, and only accepts a single assignment statement (of an allowed form) within scope, while the latter can handle multiple statements. Both effectively serializes execution. If we end up with most of the code within the scope of either, our code is probably too poor for parallelization with OpenMP.</p>
<p>Outside the <code>#pragma omp parallel</code> scope, previously spawned threads will join the master thread, and it will continue executing similar to a serial program. It is worth mentioning that we may have as many parallel/serial sections as we please.</p>
<p>As should be apparent from above, OpenMP is designed to be easy to learn and can be used for parallelizing existing serial code with minimal modifications. What if we could further simplify the above code?</p>
<h3 id="reducing-the-parallel-code">Reducing the Parallel Code</h3>
<p>Modifying the <code>sum</code> variable at the end of the <code>for</code> loop in above code could be simplified with a reduction operation provided by OpenMP. That is, we can instruct OpenMP to synchronously add the <em>local sum</em> calculated by each thread (within loop) to the shared variable <code>sum</code> as shown in the parallel version below.</p>

<p>Here, we have a single statement <code>#pragma omp parallel for</code> that tells we want the immediately-following <code>for</code> loop parallelized, which is identical to having <code>#pragma omp for</code> immediately before a <code>for</code> loop <em>within</em> the scope of <code>#pragma omp parallel</code>. The <code>reduction(+:sum)</code> tells that we want the <code>sum</code> variable to contain the <em>sum</em> of each local sum calculated in each iteration only available locally to the thread that runs it. OpenMP does this by creating a private <em>sum</em> variable for each thread and initializing it to <strong>unit</strong> according to the operation (ex. <strong>0</strong> for <code>+</code>, <strong>1</strong> for <code>*</code>), this is how we use the <strong>reduction operator</strong> in OpenMP. The <code>shared(N)</code> tells that the <code>N</code> variable should be shared with all threads, this is fine since threads are only reading it–therefore no potential data races. Finally, the approximated values along with the time taken for calculations are printed.</p>
<p>Now that we went through the code, note that the  <code>omp_set_num_threads</code> is not mandatory when using OpenMP, the program defaults to spawning the maximum number of threads possible on the system at execution time.

		<p>The most exciting moment of the web application development is a deployment. Your app is going live! It can also be nerve-wracking moment. Unfortunately. There are many options, many variables and configurations. It is easy to miss something … In this article, I will show you how to pack Django and React application into containers and deploy them with <code>docker-compose</code>. The presented approach can be reused on any Cloud Provider (AWS, DigitalOcean, Linode, GCP, Heroku) - you just need a Virtual Private Server (VPS).</p>

<p>In this article:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We will create two <code>docker-compose</code> configuration files. One for development (easier version) and one for production (with SSL certificate from <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a>).</li>
  <li>The React static files will be served by <code>nginx</code>.</li>
  <li>The Django static files (from admin and DRF browsable API) will be served by <code>nginx</code>.</li>
  <li>The <code>nginx</code> will be reverse-proxy to the Django server (<code>gunicorn</code>).</li>
  <li>In the production, we will add <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/"><code>certbot</code></a> to renew the certificate. To issue a certificate we will use a bash script. You need to have a domain to issue the certificate .</li>
</ul>

<p>We will be using code from the previous article: <a href="https://saasitive.com/tutorial/crud-django-rest-framework-react/">CRUD in Django Rest Framework and React</a> (code with <a href="https://github.com/saasitive/django-react-boilerplate/tree/v6">tag v6</a>).</p>

<h2 id="create-dockerfile-for-django-and-nginx">Create Dockerfile for Django and Nginx</h2>

<p>Let’s start by adding a new directory <code>docker</code> in the main directory of the project. Your project structure should look like below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>.</span>
├── backend
├── docker
├── frontend
├── LICENSE
└── README.md
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the <code>docker</code> directory please add <code>backend</code> directory with two files:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>docker/backend/Dockerfile</code> - it will define how to build Django container,</li>
  <li><code>docker/backend/wsgi-entrypoint.sh</code> - it will be entrypoint for Django container. It will apply migrations, collect static files and run WSGI server with <a href="https://gunicorn.org/"><code>gunicorn</code></a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="django-dockerfile">Django Dockerfile</h3>

<p>The <code>Dockerfile</code> to build Django container:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># docker/backend/Dockerfile</span>

<span>FROM</span><span> python:3.8.3-alpine</span>

<span>WORKDIR</span><span> /app</span>
<span>ADD</span><span> ./backend/requirements.txt /app/backend/</span>


<span>RUN </span>pip <span>install</span> <span>--upgrade</span> pip
<span>RUN </span>pip <span>install </span>gunicorn
<span>RUN </span>pip <span>install</span> <span>-r</span> backend/requirements.txt

<span>ADD</span><span> ./docker /app/docker</span>
<span>ADD</span><span> ./backend /app/backend</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this <code>Dockerfile</code> the <code>python:3.8.3-alpine</code> is used as base image. Let’s decode this image name and tag. It contains python in version <code>3.8.3</code>, running in the Linux distribution <a href="https://alpinelinux.org/"><code>Alpine</code></a> which is lightweight. The purpose of using lightweight Linux is to have small image which will result in faster builds. You can of course use different base image. For purpose of this tutorial the <code>python:3.8.3-alpine</code> is sufficient.</p>

<p>We create <code>/app</code> directory in the container and copy <code>/backend/requirements.txt</code>. Then, <code>gunicorn</code> and all needed packages are installed. The backend source code is copied at the end of the container build. It is on purpose. It makes building faster. When you change something in the code (without changing the <code>requirements.txt</code> file), only the last line of the <code>Dockerfile</code> will be executed and the rest will be read from cache (of course if available).</p>

<p>The <code>Dockerfile</code> is not executing any command, we will use <code>wsgi-entrypoint.sh</code> script for this purpose.</p>

<h3 id="docker-entrypoint">Docker entrypoint</h3>

<p>Please add a new file <code>docker/backend/wsgi-entrypoint.sh</code> and add execute rights to the file (it is a bash script):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># add execute rights</span>
<span>chmod</span> +x docker/backend/wsgi-entrypoint.sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>docker/backend/wsgi-entrypoint.sh</code> file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/sh</span>

<span>until </span><span>cd</span> /app/backend/server
<span>do
    </span><span>echo</span> <span>"Waiting for server volume..."</span>
<span>done

until</span> ./manage.py migrate
<span>do
    </span><span>echo</span> <span>"Waiting for db to be ready..."</span>
    <span>sleep </span>2
<span>done</span>

./manage.py collectstatic <span>--noinput</span>

gunicorn server.wsgi <span>--bind</span> 0.0.0.0:8000 <span>--workers</span> 4 <span>--threads</span> 4

<span>#####################################################################################</span>
<span># Options to DEBUG Django server</span>
<span># Optional commands to replace abouve gunicorn command</span>

<span># Option 1:</span>
<span># run gunicorn with debug log level</span>
<span># gunicorn server.wsgi --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 --workers 1 --threads 1 --log-level debug</span>

<span># Option 2:</span>
<span># run development server</span>
<span># DEBUG=True ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above script is waiting till serever volume and database is ready. It runs migration on database and collect static files. It runs <code>gunicorn</code> server with IP address <code>0.0.0.0</code> and (docker default IP) and port <code>8000</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>gunicorn</code> is running <code>4</code> workers with <code>4</code> threads each. You can set different numbers here. It depends on your machine. There are some heuristic rules that set number of workers as <code>4 * CPU cores</code> (see the <a href="https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/settings.html#workers">gunicorn docs</a>). If you are deploying application to machine with 1 CPU core, then you can use <code>4</code> workers. (Remember, it is just heuristic not an exact rule). Then you can specify how many threads will be running in each worker. In our case, there are <code>4</code> threads (<a href="https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/settings.html#threads">gunicorn docs</a>). This means that we can process <code>4 * 4 = 16</code> concurrent requests.</p>

<p><strong>1st Note:</strong> We are using <a href="https://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> for our development - it doesn’t support concurrency. We will need to replace SQLite with advanced database engine like <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>. I will replace database at the end of this tutorial to make final deployment. I think it is good to deploy application. We will practice deployment and code updates in the production. That’s why we are here.</p>

<p><strong>2nd Note:</strong> One more thing, I added other options to run Django server in <code>wsgi-entrypoint.sh</code> which are commmented. Why? You might need them for debugging. The first option add logging to the console with debug level and run <code>gunicorn</code> with one worker and single thread. The second option runs Django development server with <code>DEBUG=True</code>. It needs setting environment variable and load it in <code>settings.py</code> with <a href="https://github.com/henriquebastos/python-decouple"><code>python-decouple</code></a> (for example), I will write about this in the future post.</p>

<h4 id="django-static-files">Django static files</h4>

<p>Before going further, let’s update <code>STATIC_URL</code> variable in the <code>backend/server/server/settings.py</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># backend/server/server/settings.py
</span>
<span>MEDIA_URL</span> <span>=</span> <span>'/media/'</span>
<span>STATIC_URL</span> <span>=</span> <span>'/django_static/'</span> 
<span>STATIC_ROOT</span> <span>=</span> <span>BASE_DIR</span> <span>/</span> <span>'django_static'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We overwrite <code>STATIC_URL</code> with a new value. All static files will be served with <code>/django_static/</code> in the URL. We add two new variables:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>MEDIA_URL</code> - it is URL for serving files uploaded to Django application, we will use it in future posts.</li>
  <li><code>STATIC_ROOT</code> - it is a directory where static files from Django application will be stored after running <code>collectstatic</code> command. The <code>nginx</code> will point to this path.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="nginx-dockerfile-and-configuration">Nginx Dockerfile and Configuration</h3>

<p>Please add <code>nginx</code> directory in the <code>docker</code> directory. There will be added three files:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>docker/nginx/Dockerfile</code> - the instructions how to build <code>nginx</code> container image,</li>
  <li><code>docker/nginx/development/default.conf</code> - the configuration file for <code>nginx</code> server used in the development,</li>
  <li><code>docker/nginx/production/default.conf</code> - the configuration file for the production.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>Dockerfile</code> for <code>nginx</code> container will use two stage build.</p>

<ul>
  <li>At first stage, we build the React static files.</li>
  <li>At second stage, the static files are copied and <code>nginx</code> server starts. We copy React static files into <code>/usr/share/nginx/html</code> directory.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>docker/nginx/Dockerfile</code> file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># The first stage</span>
<span># Build React static files</span>
<span>FROM</span><span> node:13.12.0-alpine as build</span>

<span>WORKDIR</span><span> /app/frontend</span>
<span>COPY</span><span> ./frontend/package.json ./</span>
<span>COPY</span><span> ./frontend/package-lock.json ./</span>
<span>RUN </span>npm ci <span>--silent</span>
<span>COPY</span><span> ./frontend/ ./</span>
<span>RUN </span>npm run build

<span># The second stage</span>
<span># Copy React static files and start nginx</span>
<span>FROM</span><span> nginx:stable-alpine</span>
<span>COPY</span><span> --from=build /app/frontend/build /usr/share/nginx/html</span>
<span>CMD</span><span> ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At the second stage, we copy only the final product of the first stage: static files. The <code>node_modules</code> (they can take a lot of space) with dependency files are not in the final image. Such two stage-build makes the size of the final image smaller.</p>

<p>Let’s add <code>nginx</code> configuration for development version of <code>docker-compose</code> (without SSL certificate):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>server</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>listen</span> <span>80</span><span>;</span>
    <span>server_name</span> <span>_</span><span>;</span>

    <span>client_max_body_size</span> <span>20M</span><span>;</span>

    <span>location</span> <span>/</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>root</span>   <span>/usr/share/nginx/html</span><span>;</span>
        <span>index</span>  <span>index.html</span> <span>index.htm</span><span>;</span>
        <span>try_files</span> <span>$uri</span> <span>$uri</span><span>/</span> <span>/index.html</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>location</span> <span>/api</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>try_files</span> <span>$uri</span> <span>@proxy_api</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>location</span> <span>/admin</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>try_files</span> <span>$uri</span> <span>@proxy_api</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>location</span> <span>@proxy_api</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>proxy_set_header</span> <span>X-Forwarded-For</span> <span>$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for</span><span>;</span>
        <span>proxy_set_header</span> <span>Host</span> <span>$http_host</span><span>;</span>
        <span>proxy_redirect</span> <span>off</span><span>;</span>
        <span>proxy_pass</span>   <span>http://backend:8000</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>location</span> <span>/django_static/</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>autoindex</span> <span>on</span><span>;</span>
        <span>alias</span> <span>/app/backend/server/django_static/</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>What do you feel when you see <code>nginx</code> configuration file?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No troubles! The <code>nginx</code> is here to help us. It will do what we will ask in the configuration.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>server</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>listen</span> <span>80</span><span>;</span>
    <span>server_name</span> <span>_</span><span>;</span>
    <span>server_tokens</span> <span>off</span><span>;</span>
    <span>client_max_body_size</span> <span>20M</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At the begining of the configuration we define a server (<code>server</code> keyword). It will listen on port <code>80</code> (it is a default <code>HTTP</code> port). There is no name assigned to the server (<code>server_name _;</code>). We switch off option to show server version on error pages (<code>server_token off;</code> <a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#server_tokens">see docs</a>). The last setting is to set maximum request size (<a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_max_body_size">see docs</a>) (<code>client_max_body_size 20M</code>). It means that requests larger than 20MB will result in error with HTTP 413 (Request Entity Too Large).</p>

<p>We have five <code>location</code> blocks (<a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#location">location docs</a>) in the config which specify configuration for each URL (routing for requests).</p>

<p>The first <code>location /</code> defines what to do if the request comes from <code>/</code> (main domain or IP). The <code>index.html</code> file from <code>/usr/share/nginx/html</code> will be served as a response. It is our React static <code>index.html</code> file.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>location</span> <span>/</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>root</span>   <span>/usr/share/nginx/html</span><span>;</span>
        <span>index</span>  <span>index.html</span> <span>index.htm</span><span>;</span>
        <span>try_files</span> <span>$uri</span> <span>$uri</span><span>/</span> <span>/index.html</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The second and third locations <code>location /api</code> and <code>location /admin</code> redirect requests to <code>location @proxy_api</code>. It is a reverse-proxy:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>location</span> <span>/api</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>try_files</span> <span>$uri</span> <span>@proxy_api</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>location</span> <span>/admin</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>try_files</span> <span>$uri</span> <span>@proxy_api</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What we have in fourth <code>location @proxy_api</code>? It is our Django application served with <code>gunicorn</code>. The <code>nginx</code> forwards all requests with <code>/api</code> and <code>/a…</code></p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>Regular 1-on-1 (often also written as 1:1) meetings are an important satisfaction factor for remote teams. For managers and companies, it's amazing to stay in the loop and resolve friction quickly. For employees, it's a rare chance to voice opinions and difficulties.</p>
<p>Especially in async environments and other remote teams where face-to-face time is sparse, this regularly scheduled personal time can be a&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's why 1-on-1s are extra important for remote teams, how they work best and why the greatest remote teams are so religious about them.</p>

<h2>What is a 1-on-1 meeting?</h2>
<p>As the name suggests, a 1-on-1 meeting is a discussion between two parties. 1-on-1s are traditionally conducted for things like <strong>performance reviews</strong> or <strong>confidential discussions</strong> between a manager and their direct report.</p>
<p>In remote teams, face-to-face time can be sparse. It's more difficult to catch someone during their coffee break and talk things out. More formally scheduled 1-on-1s can be the solution for that.</p>
<p>Other than what's traditional, it's not uncommon to have 1-on-1s <strong>outside the manager-report relationship</strong>, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>satisfaction survey between employee and HR</li>
<li>knowledge exchange between team leaders</li>
<li>pair review between peers, co-working</li>
</ul>
<p>But even the more traditional manger-report 1-on-1 meetings <strong>holds more weight</strong> in remote work: It's the one place where employees can voice concerns, talk about their growth, their goals or any friction that has come up.</p>

<h2>The benefits of 1-on-1s for remote employees and managers</h2>
<p>When it comes to remote employees, regularly scheduled 1-on-1 meetings are a miracle tool when it comes to retention and employee satisfaction. As mentioned, they are a welcome place to voice concerns early or talk about growth.</p>
<p>For ambitious employees that creates an atmosphere where friction can get moved out of the way quickly, where ears are always open for concerns and growth desires can be made explicit.</p>

<p><img src="https://nohq.co/media/undraw_Meeting_re_i53h.png" alt="" width="600" height="358"></p>

<p>That sounds like an amazing deal for any employee, but obviously, it also comes at a high cost for managers.</p>
<p>For a team with 8 direct reports, bi-weekly 1-on-1s at a duration of 30 minutes per meeting, that's a full workday of added meeting time every single month! What's in it for the managers?</p>
<p>The benefits for employees can be reversed and are just as important for them:</p>
<ul>
<li>get rid of friction early</li>
<li>know where reports want to be in their careers</li>
<li>stay in the loop about newest developments</li>
<li>better picture of morale and difficulties</li>
</ul>
<p>Given any actionable manager, this is definitely worth its time as actions can be taken that improve satisfaction and retention.</p>
<p>And indeed, <a href="https://www.leapsome.com/blog/meeting-with-purpose-the-unique-benefits-of-1-on-1-meetings">research shows</a> that while group meetings tend to lower employee satisfaction rates, 1-on-1 meetings actively improve that same metric!</p>

<h2>Productive 1-on-1 meetings methods</h2>
<p>1-on-1 meetings aren't hard to do right. As long as they are scheduled consistently and follows a common path – besides having a culture that allows for honest feedback – there's definitely a benefit to doing them.</p>
<p>As with so many things, some people have taken it a step further and created detailed methods and best practises to running 1-on-1 meetings.</p>

<h3>The traffic light check-in</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.connorswenson.com/blog/red-yellow-green-the-traffic-light-that-can-transform-your-meetings">traffic light check-in</a>, also called "Red Yellow Green" check-in is one of the meeting methods that has brought success to companies like Google, Etsy and many startups. So much, in fact, it's being taught by executive and management coaches around the world.</p>

<p><img src="https://nohq.co/media/eliobed-suarez-PN-YnI5stdQ-unsplash.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400"></p>

<p>The concept is quite simple: If we take a traffic light as a model, your 1-on-1 partner describes their mood as one of the colors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Green</strong> means everything is OK, nothing that dampens the mood or blocks you from being near your peak. Let's talk.</li>
<li><strong>Yellow</strong> means so-so. Maybe things are stressful or there's an upcoming blocker. Let's discuss.</li>
<li><strong>Red</strong> is bad! The person is overwhelmed, blocked or is feeling terrible. Let's solve this.</li>
</ul>
<p>An alternative form of this is to collect topics and assign them to each of the colors, for example, <strong>green</strong> describes all the things that were great,&nbsp;<strong>yellow</strong> includes discussion topics that could have gone better and&nbsp;<strong>red</strong> are priority discussion points about things that failed.</p>

<h3>Skip-level meetings</h3>
<p>A skip-level meeting "skips" one layer of responsibility and is usually conducted with the person's manager's manager or even a head of department or CEO.</p>
<p>For remote teams, this can be a great irregular thing to schedule. On one side, employees have the possibility to discuss wider changes and bring up interesting ideas, while managers and executives have a more direct line to the culture and issues of their sub-reports.</p>
<p>Skip-level meetings are usually not done more than once per year per 1-on-1 combination, for leaders, however, it can be a good idea to schedule these monthly or even bi-weekly to have a deeper look into different teams.</p>

<h3>Goal and growth conversations</h3>
<p>A growth (or goal) conversation is different from the regular 1-on-1 check-ins as that it's designed to be a more formal evaluation and discussion. Other than the more traditional performance evaluation, it's a discussion around goals, current progress and growth.</p>
<p>As such, it doesn't have much influence on things like salaries or promotions but instead can help to improve employee satisfaction. In fact, <a href="https://www.intechopen.com/books/career-development-and-job-satisfaction/career-development-an-enabler-for-job-satisfaction">research shows</a> that the major reason for employee satisfaction boils down to career development, so it's something that shouldn't be dismissed.</p>
<p>Growth conversations happen more often than traditional evaluations – usually every quarter up to once per month – and help answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is my short-term goal?</li>
<li>Did I reach my goal last time?</li>
<li>What stopped/enabled me to reach my goal?</li>
<li>What is my big goal for the next year?</li>
<li>What is my progress in reaching that?</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the situation, these conversations can be difficult. For ambitious employees, however, they could be the main driver in motivation, engagement, loyalty and retention.</p>

<h2>7 Tips for better 1-on-1 meetings</h2>
<p>When it comes to 1-on-1 meetings, learning by doing is the keyword. Even if you don't have a plan for them, to start today is to begin the investment in retention and loyalty.</p>
<p>Before you go, though, we hope that these practical tips can help you get started with better 1-on-1 meetings.</p>

<h3>1. Start with an agenda</h3>
<p>It's good practice to set up a way for you and your meeting partner to build an <a href="https://nohq.co/blog/remote-meeting-best-practices/">agenda before the call</a>. Some popular methods to do so are Google Docs and <a href="https://nohq.co/tools/todoist/">Todoist</a>, where projects can be shared between two people.</p>
<p>The great part – simple to solve questions can be solved in writing even before the meeting and when it comes to harder discussions, your meeting partner can prepare for those beforehand. It also helps to keep meetings running smoothly and ending on time.</p>

<h3>2. Stick to a type of meeting</h3>
<p>A little earlier in this post, we described a few popular meeting techniques. While you can tweak meetings and even switch them around, it's usually good to stick to a certain interval and meeting form for a while, to make sure it works out.</p>
<p>Sticking to something for a while helps both of you to settle into a certain flow and helps with evaluating how good something works.</p>

<h3>3. Keep async stuff away</h3>
<p>In the first point, we talked about getting simple questions out of the way early through your agenda. Your agenda items should be evaluated whether they <a href="https://nohq.co/blog/making-asynchronous-communication-work/">should have been an email</a> – or a message – instead.</p>
<p>For example, it feels natural to give a status update during these meetings and checking in whether everything is on track. However, it's a better practice to write this down somewhere and have it recorded – so it can be crossed away from the meeting agenda.</p>
<p>Instead, the meeting should include socialization, talking about emotional topics and hashing out difficult discussions.</p>

<h3>4. Stay consistent</h3>
<p>As with anything, consistency is key! As you go into this new form of collaboration, give yourself the challenge to keep up with it for a few months or even a year.</p>
<p>It's important to keep each other accountable, so pick a specific timeslot, reserve a calendar block and don't make these optional. While some of them can be skipped, it shouldn't become the norm.</p>

<h3>5. Take notes</h3>
<p>Taking notes during the discussion can help you recall information, go back to previous meetings and find patterns and also help you to digest the information on the next day.</p>
<p>Hopefully, good notes can help you read between the lines and see recurring themes that are being discussed again and again.</p>

<h3>6. Build action items</h3>
<p>We all love homework, don't we! For 1-on-1 meetings, however, it could be a good idea to set agenda items and to-dos for the next meeting already, so-called action items.</p>
<p>These action items are usually not about the core work, but instead about the topics that were discussed – specific thoughts about growths or an issue that has been cumbersome for a few weeks.</p>

<h3>7. Run regular retrospectives</h3>
<p>1-on-1s are never set in stone! The great part about running these small meetings is that changes can happen quickly and easily – so, if anything doesn't work for you about these 1-on-1 meetings, change it! Be it timing, frequency, agenda or format, let none of it undiscovered!</p>

<p>A week ago, I was looking for something to tinker with over the weekend. I ended up switching my site hosting from GitHub Pages to Netlify.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.netlify.com/github-pages-vs-netlify/">comparison was compelling</a>. I was appealed by the 1-click rollbacks, ability to use more Jekyll plug-ins, and A/B testing my site (fun!).</p>
<p>However, I switched back to GitHub Pages today. Why?</p>
<h2 id="my-mx-records-werent-migrated-automatically">My MX records werenâ€™t migrated automatically</h2>
<p>(MX records are DNS records for delivery email to your address.)</p>
<p>When I switched my DNS servers to Netlify, it was pretty painless: Update the DNS name servers, provision the cert, and weâ€™re good to go.</p>
<p>However, I didnâ€™t realize that my MX records werenâ€™t automatically migrated as well. (When I previously moved to Cloudflare, this was taken care of).</p>
<p>As a result, emails to my domain bounced for a few days before I noticed. Thankfully, people reached out via other channels to inform me of it.</p>
<h2 id="adding-mx-records-on-the-dns-provider-was-a-pain">Adding MX records on the DNS provider was a pain</h2>
<p>Trying to add the MX records with the DNS provider, NS1, was a pain.</p>
<p>I had to create an account with NS1 and provide them with credit card details. (Update: Was charged $2 within a day; will enquire why).</p>
<p>Then, I had to set up a â€œZoneâ€� to attach the MX records. However, when I tried setting up the zone for my domain, it was not allowed as the domain already exists. Probably from the Netlify integration.</p>
<p>I spent some time trying to figure this out. I also asked some Netlify folks. Turns out that while they use Netlify to host their site, they use other DNS providers (instead of NS1).</p>
<h2 id="adding-the-custom-certificate-didnt-work">Adding the custom certificate didnâ€™t work</h2>
<p>By now, Iâ€™ve switched my DNS provider back to Cloudflare, and added the Cloudflare Origin cert to my Netlify app. (I really wanted to continue using Netlify.)</p>
<p>However, I soon got complaints that people couldnâ€™t access my site due to the error: â€œPeerâ€™s Certificate issuer is not recognized.â€�. I faced the same issue too. Iâ€™m not sure where the issue lies (cert or host) but I had lost patience by now.</p>
<h2 id="another-gotcha-300-build-minutes-monthly">Another gotcha: 300 build minutes monthly</h2>
<p>While the <a href="https://www.netlify.com/github-pages-vs-netlify/">GitHub Pages vs Netlify comparison</a> indicates that both are free, with Netlify being superior at 3 builds a minute, it leaves out one major gotcha: On the free tier, Netlify only provides 300 minutes of build time monthly. AFAIK, GitHub Pages has no limitations.</p>
<p>For someone who frequently adds and tweaks content, and mucks around with the CSS and whatnot, 300 minutes didnâ€™t last long.</p>
<p>On its own, this limitation would have been bearableâ€”I figured I would try to be more frugal. But the DNS issues broke the camelâ€™s back.</p>
<h2 id="back-to-github-pages">Back to GitHub Pages</h2>
<p>Now, Iâ€™m back to hosting on GitHub Pages and merrily pushing updates as inspiration strikes. Previously, I was checking the build minutes remaining ever so often.</p>
<p>I guess Iâ€™ll have to do without the fancy Jekyll plug-ins, 3 builds/min, and A/B testing for now. In return, I get peace of mind.</p>

<p><em>Edit: Thank you to the 80k people who have read this piece. It looks like many people are struggling with the concept of "greatness". Let's continue to support one another on the journey there. </em></p><p>Over the years, we’ve all encountered our fair share of successes and failures. As I’ve acquired more of both under my name, I’ve started to contemplate which experiences were truly “great” and why.</p><p>Interestingly enough, I realized that it was not the sporadic highs that were exceptional, but instead the long hauls; the sequences of events that seemed minimal at each juncture, but compounded into major gains. This led me to think further about what <em>greatness</em> truly means. I’ve come to learn that it’s not about overnight successes or flashes of excellence, but periods of repeatable habits.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Perhaps “great’, is just “good”, but repeatable. </strong></em></blockquote><h2 id="consider-this">Consider This</h2><p>Before stepping into the bulk of this article, I want to clarify two things:</p><ul><li>Greatness is not instantaneous</li><li>Greatness is earned</li></ul><p>The first step in becoming great is recognizing that you’re likely not already great. In fact, it comes from recognizing that there is no such thing as greatness at a specific instance in time. Greatness is instead a reflection of a period of effort, since greatness in a single instance can be reduced to luck. </p><p>Moreover, being “great” is not about being better than someone else. It is about being dependable and disciplined, and ultimately it is earned. </p><p>Many people, in theory, want to be “great”. In fact, each month 1000 people search “how to be great”, 260 people search “how to become perfect”, and 2400 people search “how to be the best”, looking for discrete answers on how to get from 0 to 1. Yet, many people in life realistically do not want to put in the effort over a sustained period of time to actually get to 1. They are looking for the “secrets to success” that in many ways, do not exist. You know what brings success? Hard work brings success. </p><p>So before proceeding forward in this article, I implore each of you to consider that if greatness truly is a reflection of non-instantaneous, earned effort, ask yourself if that’s the life you’d like to live. Ask yourself whether you’d like to spend your days, weeks, months, and years in a constant uphill battle. </p><p>If you ultimately find that you don’t want to do that, that’s fine! It doesn’t make you less of a person. At least you’ve broken from the holding pattern of thinking you want to do X but not understanding why you haven’t gotten there yet. And if that’s the case, go enjoy your Netflix and chill completely guilt-free.</p><p>With that in mind, let’s dive into what truly makes someone “great’. </p><h2 id="it-s-hard-to-be-consistent">It’s Hard to be Consistent</h2><p>There’s a false impression that success or notoriety comes with being flashy. This notion comes from the media focusing on outliers, whether it be events or personalities which diverge from the norm. Not only can this encourage people to aim for notoriety just for the sake of it (think Elizabeth Holmes), but it makes the rest of us believe that correlation (of those outliers) is causation; in other words, success of those individuals is due to their offbeat ways. But here’s another storyline: the most sure and therefore the <em>best</em> way to “success” is through consistency.</p><blockquote><em>“Until you work as hard as those you admire, don’t explain away their success as luck.”</em> - James Clear, <a href="https://amzn.to/31t6vQZ">Atomic Habits</a></blockquote><p>To be clear, consistency isn’t necessarily the easiest way to success, but one that can be achieved with a higher level of certainty, rather than hoping for a lottery win or someone to “discover” you. Continuous effort is a more thoughtful approach that leads to greatness when the following statements are true:</p><ol><li>Inputs are consistent over time</li><li>Intentional inputs lead to expected outputs</li></ol><h3 id="consistency">Consistency<br></h3><blockquote><em>“No one who can rise before dawn three hundred sixty days a year fails to make his family rich”</em> - <a href="https://amzn.to/2Fcnn4K">Outliers</a></blockquote><p>There is a famous saying from Napolean Hill which says, <em>“If you cannot do great things, do small things in a great way”</em>. I would actually argue the quote should be, <em>“If you cannot do great things, do small things a great number of times”.</em></p><p>If you don’t have the opportunity to “do great things”, focus on consistently achieving small wins. These small things in fact do not need to be done in a great way, but a good way, repeatably. In fact, I would advise not to focus on perfection, as it is often the enemy of the successful. </p><p>There’s glimmer and hoopla around unpredictability, but in reality, it’s much more difficult and therefore impressive, to be predictably good. For example:</p><ul><li>It’s easy to wake up whenever you “feel like it”. </li><li>It’s hard to stick to a routine of getting up at 6AM.</li><li>It’s easy to pivot from side project to side project, focusing on the new shiny object of the month.</li><li>It’s hard to stick with a side project for years, many of which may not be profitable for a long while. </li><li>It’s easy to give up on someone when you hit a roadblock or the next potential partner becomes available. </li><li>It’s hard to be faithful and invest in a relationship for decades.</li></ul><p>We normally set out in life with good intentions. We <em>intend</em> to set a morning routine or work on a business until it's profitable or to “love someone forever”. We imagine that as we invest in something, we will naturally continue to move in the right direction. If anything, things will get easier, right?</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/NQV_7RXfM2ZYDJsT4E4JAaAW2i9KphrB7-fE8XveJlrW-Msf1aIot9ayls-wSCWIroq155Fzdz6vE3d8br71E6Tc5sTQRyhnT0Zb6EJCUoV41B5EoZSczjtWcHo9KV-T9c6s16Cb"></figure><p>The described trajectory is what we perceive on the left. Predictable, linear, and a direct reflection of effort put in. </p><p><strong>Rarely does success in anything look like that.</strong> Life is a series of tiny nodes that tend to look more like the right hand side. There two key elements worth calling out in the more realistic graph on the right:</p><ul><li>Compounding is always present. The earlier steps in any process will be more strenuous, yet it’s difficult to imagine the potential compounding that comes later on. </li><li>With the ups, there are always downs. This seems obvious, but we often forget this when we are in periods of down. We quit at these local minimums (the highlighted sections in red above), because we cannot see the next peak right around the corner. </li></ul><figure><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>a friend just emailed me this note in response to my 'burn out' video. wanted to share;</p><p>'the addiction to having success is what makes you feel unsuccessful at the times when you're not feeling the immediate dopamine hit of your work 'succeeding' at that precise moment.'</p></div>— Casey Neistat (@Casey) <a href="https://twitter.com/Casey/status/1093520669286064133?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 7, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We have lost our ability to appreciate delayed gratification and, some of us who struggle with perfectionism, can either create repeatedly until we ‘get it right’ never truly feeling fulfilled with our work, or, we avoid creating all together in fear of failing.</p>— Marcio Novelli (@MarcioNovelli) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarcioNovelli/status/1093522120536150017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 7, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>The local minima are especially psychologically taxing due to something called the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill">Hedonic treadmill</a> or hedonic adaptation. Essentially, as someone achieves new successes in various aspects of their lives, their baseline shifts to reflect that new level and therefore, their expectations and desires are re-established as well. There is no net gain in happiness and thus, it becomes even more difficult to stay “level-headed” during these down moments. </p><p>That is exactly why a specific search for success can be problematic and instead of looking for unsustainable shortcuts in life, it’s much more effective (and healthy) to aim for continuous habits that bring you success as a byproduct, not as the end goal.</p><blockquote><em>“The only way to become excellent is to be endlessly fascinated by doing the same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with boredom.” - <a href="https://amzn.to/31t6vQZ">Atomic Habits</a>, James Clear</em></blockquote><p>On your journey to greatness, you need to fall in love with the process which includes many local minima and maxima. Staying consistent and pushing through both of these continuously is what will truly differentiate you from those that are simply “good” and isolate you as one of the few that are “great’.</p><h3 id="inputs-outputs">Inputs → Outputs</h3><p>The second important aspect of achieving greatness is acting with intention. Your actions and results will not always reflect your intentions, but as you move towards “greatness”, you should have a better idea of what inputs actually deliver output. You’ll still make mistakes﹣as we all do﹣but you’ll have a better grasp on what is more likely to work out. For example, your success rate may be 30%, versus someone flying blind with a 5% success rate. </p><p>Let’s look at a simple example:</p><p>Imagine company X has two sales people. Salesperson A happens to land a $1M deal in his first week. However, he struggles to land anything substantial for the next 6 months. Meanwhile, salesperson B manages to develop a process over the first month, bringing in only $100k which he’s able to scale up and double month over month.</p><p>After six months, this will be the revenue generated by each party.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.stephsmith.io/content/images/2019/05/image-5.png"></figure><p>You’re probably thinking… "So what? That’s just a classic example of compounding." </p><p>Yes! That’s exactly the point. The best things in life often aren’t miracles, but well-thought out approaches that are sustainable. The same thing is true with businesses, marriages, and just about anything with repeatable elements. If you invest time into solving for what leads to success continuously, you will reap those benefits for years to come. <em>So even in the least quantifiable situations, reflect back on what could’ve made a previous loss a future win. </em></p><p>Consider the best companies over time. None of them emerged overnight, nor was there a single inflection point that determined the success or notoriety of these companies. The line of separation between the “great” companies of all time and the “not so great”, is their ability to stand the test of time. </p><p>Would you rather be Juicero that <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/juicero">raised $100M</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/01/rip-juicero-the-400-venture-backed-juice-machine/">went bankrupt</a> within a year of its Series C, or Zoom, which <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zoom-video-communications/funding_rounds/funding_rounds_list#section-funding-rounds">took almost 8 years to take on more funding than $30M</a> and is now one of the most profitable and highly sought after “unicorns” in the valley?</p><p>On top of consistency, greatness comes from asking the right questions and iterating to learn what …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

    <p>To capture your ideas and turn them into tangible products, mind mapping software is a must. During the brainstorming process, ideas happen quickly, and if not appropriately tracked, can become overwhelming.
There are many reasons that mind mapping software is the best solution for this. To fully understand the benefit it can provide to your organization, it’s best to explore the concept of mind mapping and how it helps bring projects to life.</p>

<h2>The concept of mind mapping</h2>
<p>The concept of mind mapping stems from extracting useful ideas and developing links between them. During the brainstorming process ideas flow freely, but sometimes connections are not immediately noticeable. This makes the process of putting these ideas together and creating plan for an entire project extremely difficult. This is where mind mapping plays a critical role.</p>
<p>The best way to describe a mind map is a hierarchical tree is it shows a natural progression between ideas. A mind map separates a project into modular components and then breaks those down into even more specific tasks.</p>
<h2>What is mind mapping software?</h2>
<p>Although mind-mapping is possible by hand, utilizing mind mapping software is a modern and more refined way to get the job done. Utilizing these mind mapping tools enables a project leader to visualize and build out their projects. Generating a mind map by hand can take quite a bit of time, so specialized mind mapping apps condense the process and streamline delivery.</p>
<h2>Best mind mapping software to improve your productivity</h2>
<p>Within the software world, many mind mapping solutions exist. It isn’t difficult to find software for any platform, including the cloud.

<h2>How to pick a mind map tool</h2>
<p>To pick the best mind mapping tool for your unique situation, there are a few factors that should be considered. Depending on your individual needs, you may find that some software lacks a few essential items that are critical for your purposes.
Here are the major factors that should play into your decision.</p>
<div>
    <h3>Team access</h3>
    <p>If you are working on a project that requires multiple team members to access mind maps and edit them simultaneously, you’ll need to consider this. Some mind mapping software does not allow for real-time editing, although it’s supported in most. If you need this feature, then consider Miro or Coggle.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>More than mind maps</h3>
    <p>If you plan on doing more than just mind-mapping for your project, you’ll need to keep this in mind when picking a mind mapping software. While all of the aforementioned software is excellent for mind mapping, some options stand out and are exemplary for other tasks and different diagram types. Mind Meister and Coggle allow for unparalleled customization of charts.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Integrations</h3>
    <p>If you intend to integrate your mind maps into social media or utilize existing technologies—such as Google Drive or Microsoft 365—you’ll need to make sure it’s supported with the mind mapping software you choose. Two excellent options for this are Mindmup and Miro.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Supported platforms</h3>
    <p>You’ll also need to consider which platforms are supported by each type of mind mapping software. If your organization is primarily Apple-based, you’ll need to select mind mapping software compatible with Mac. Your best bet is to choose an option that is cloud-based so it works across all platforms and devices.</p>
</div>

    <h3>Budget</h3>
    <p>Your last consideration will be your budget for mind mapping software. If you have a complex set of projects that need many detailed diagrams, you’ll need to make sure that you select a software option that fits with your budget and allows you the mind maps you need.</p>
</div>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, there are many different types of mind mapping software available that fit a variety of needs. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, so it’s best to make a list of your needs, and then start shopping to find the mind mapping software for you.
A great place to start would be to select a few of the options that offer free plans, and start creating a mind map focused on selecting the best mind mapping software. This will give you a real-world view of the features so you can select the software solution that’s right for you.</p>

<p>by Sven Nilsen, 2020</p>

<p><a href="https://crates.io/crates/poi">Poi 0.18</a> is released!</p>

<p>In this blog post I will discuss the new Levenshtein heuristic used in Poi.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/advancedresearch/advancedresearch.github.io/master/images/lev.png" alt="Levenshtein distance"></p>

<p><em>The Levenshtein distance measures minimum single-character changes between two strings.<br>
It is named after Vladimir Levenshtein, which considered this distance in 1965 (Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">Wikipedia</a>)</em></p>

<h3 id="why-automated-theorem-proving-is-hard">Why automated theorem proving is hard</h3>

<p>Automated theorem proving is hard for the same reason the boardgame chess is hard.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_number">The Shannon number</a> is a conservative lower bound
of the game-tree complexity of chess: 10^120.
This is more than the number of atoms in the observable universe.</p>

<p>However, in automated theorem proving, the complexity is sometimes countable infinity.
With other words, if one tries to search the whole space of possible proofs, the program will run forever.</p>

<h3 id="heuristic-measurements">Heuristic measurements</h3>

<p>In order to prioritize search of possible proofs, one needs a heuristic.</p>

<p>Here, the word “heuristic” means the same as e.g. using utility to optimize course of action for AI agents.
In fact, an automated theorem prover is very much alike an AI agent, except there are no interactions with an environment.
The automated theorem prover usually lives in a world with “perfect information”, aka chess.
However, there is no opponent. Instead, the “opponent” is the complexity of math itself.</p>

<p>The following properties was desirable when choosing a heuristic measurement for Poi:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reaches minimum value when reaching goal</li>
  <li>Smooth gradient when getting closer to the goal</li>
  <li>Rule agnostic</li>
  <li>Easy to maintain</li>
</ul>

<p>My first idea of how this heuristic should look like,
was something that used sub-expressions matching with the goal.</p>

<p>I was thinking about how difficult this would be to code.</p>

<p>Then, I realized that I was thinking too complicated: Why not use strings instead of expressions?</p>

<h3 id="levenshtein-distance">Levenshtein distance</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">The Levenshtein distance</a> is the minimum number of
single-character edits required to transform one string into another string.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>lev("a + b", "c + d") = 2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is because you only need to replace <code>a</code> with <code>c</code> and <code>b</code> with <code>d</code> in the first string to get the second string.</p>

<p>The Levenshtein distance also allows adding and removing characters, but not swapping them.</p>

<p>At first sight, it might seem a bit hacky to use strings this way,
when we are talking about a theorem prover which uses complex expressions behind the scenes.</p>

<p>However: It satisfies all the properties I mentioned above!</p>

<p>For example, an alternative could be to use machine learning,
which would become gradually better at assisting the theorem prover over time.
In this case, you would probably use strings, bytes or numbers to feed the neural network.
Would you consider this to be a hacky solution too?</p>

<p>I am interested in hearing what people think about what they consider a hacky heuristic versus a more robust heuristic.</p>

<p>So, why not just use a simple string algorithm?
After thinking about this, I decided to go for it, because I could not figure out any rational reason to not do it.</p>

<h3 id="try-first-learn-afterwards">Try first, learn afterwards</h3>

<p>How did I figure out whether Levenshtein distance was the right heuristic to use?</p>

<p>I simply added <a href="https://crates.io/crates/levenshtein">levenshtein</a> to the Cargo.toml
and coded for a few hours: Turned out that it works pretty well.</p>

<p>It took a couple iterations to get it right.
At first, the algorithm just picked the minimum Levenshtein distance from unreduced equivalences.
This worked surprisingly well, but more testing revealed that this algorithm was not sound.</p>

<p>I ended up with using <code>std::collections::{BinaryHeap, HashSet}</code> instead,
picking the minimum Levenshtein distance across all sub-proofs found so far.
This algorithm fixes the soundness problem, but uses a lot of memory.</p>

<p>Only after getting it working, I learned more about the theory behind Levenshtein distance in detail.</p>

<h3 id="thoughts-about-the-design">Thoughts about the design</h3>

<p>Since Levenshtein is not very good at strings where substrings are swapped,
I believe it will perform less well on commutative operators.</p>

<p>However, I believe that using the normal exhaustive search up to some depth,
will resolve some of the issues with commutativity.</p>

<p>The problem is how to deal with large expressions and lots of commutative operators, e.g. addition.
In this case, increasing the depth of exhaustive search will lead to significant slowdown.</p>

<p>One approach to solving this problem, is to assist the automated theorem prover by designing proper utility rules.</p>

<p>This is something I am testing now, by designing worst-case proofs and doing some experiments.</p>

<h3 id="utility-rules">Utility rules</h3>

<p>Utility rules are rules that can be proved from existing rules, e.g.:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>x0 + x1 + x2 + x3 &lt;=&gt; x0 + x3 + x2 + x1;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The expression <code>x0 + x1 + x2 + x3</code> is constructed similarly to a linked list (sort of).</p>

<p>The left-most term <code>x0</code> functions as a “tail” that pattern matches anywhere in the expression.
Keeping the left-most term fixed on both sides makes it possible to manipulate the expression at any depth,
instead of manipulating only at the leafs.</p>

<p>This is important when there are long chains of commutative operators,
because it avoids transformations via tree-like structures, which requires many more steps.</p>

<p>Although you can in principle prove the same using <code>a + b &lt;=&gt; b + a</code> only,
the automated theorem prover can not look that many steps ahead to make a realistic estimate using the Levenshtein distance.</p>

<h3 id="future-improvements">Future improvements</h3>

<p>In one test run I am running while writing this blog post, Poi uses 500 MiB of memory.</p>

<p>I might replace <code>HashSet</code> with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuckoo_filter">Cuckoo filter</a> (an improved Bloom filter) in the future,
in order to lower memory usage.</p>

<p>Also, I would like a replacement for <code>BinaryHeap</code> which uses less memory.</p>

<p>Thinking a bit about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie">Trie</a> or finite state machines, as in the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/fst">fst</a> crate.</p>

<p>The problem is, I need to pop the minimum sorted by some numeric key.</p>

<p>Basically, I want something behaving like <code>BinaryHeap</code>, but more efficient for strings.</p>

<p>A minor improvement in performance could be to reuse the cache used in the Levenshtein algorithm.</p>

<p>At this stage, I am mostly focusing on testing that things work,
but in the future I might be focusing to how long time it takes to complete the proof search.
I have not decided yet whether the REPL should have built-in benchmarks or whether the REPL code should be refactored for running external benchmarks.</p>

<p>Allegedly “Kernel Text Readonly Region”.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>This post tries to detail the mechanism used in Apple’s A10 chips and later to prevent modification of an iOS kernel at runtime.<br>
Older chips attempt to do this via a monitor program loaded in EL3, which is inherently flawed and bypassable though as detailed in <a href="https://xerub.github.io/ios/kpp/2017/04/13/tick-tock.html">“Tick Tock” by xerub</a>.</p>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<p>On some sites you’ll see the term “memory-mapped registers” being thrown around. To avoid confusion I will not use that term, but instead:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“Register” to mean actual registers such as those accessed by the arm64 <code>msr</code> instruction. Each CPU core has its own copy of such registers, and the values held by them will be lost when the core goes to sleep.</li>
  <li>“MMIO” (memory-mapped I/O) to mean a portion of the physical address that can be used to interact with a device on the SoC. Like regular RAM, this is global to the entire SoC and does not lose its values when any core goes to sleep, as it is a separate device.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also note that code shown here will often have been shortened, expanding or removing macros that are assumed to be defined (<code>KERNEL_INTEGRITY_KTRR</code>, <code>MACH_BSD</code>, <code>__arm64__</code>) or not (<code>DEVELOPMENT</code>, <code>DEBUG</code>).</p>

<h3 id="primitives">Primitives</h3>

<p>Besides abandoning EL3 altogether (leaving only EL1 and EL0), A10 chips introduce two new hardware features that serve as the corner stones for KTRR:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“RoRgn”<br>
A piece of MMIO consisting of a “start”, “end” and “lock” fields. The “lock” field, when   written to, will lock down all three fields, i.e. prevent any modification of them. The start and end fields hold numbers of pages in DRAM, spanning up the RoRgn. Inside this region, the memory controller will reject any and all attempted writes.<br>
XNU has three macros to refer to them:
    <div><div><pre><code><span>#define rRORGNBASEADDR (*(volatile uint32_t *) (amcc_base + 0x7e4))
#define rRORGNENDADDR  (*(volatile uint32_t *) (amcc_base + 0x7e8))
#define rRORGNLOCK     (*(volatile uint32_t *) (amcc_base + 0x7ec))
</span></code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>“KTRR registers”<br>
A set of three registers added to every CPU core, holding “low”, “high” and “lock” values respectively. The lock register, again, locks all three down. The low and high registers hold physical addresses, spanning up the executable range. If the CPU is at EL1 and the MMU is turned on, then any instruction fetch (i.e. trying to execute memory) outside of that range will fail, even if it is marked as executable in the page table. If the CPU is at EL0 or if the MMU is turned off, this range has no effect.<br>
For those too, XNU has macros:
    <div><div><pre><code><span>#define ARM64_REG_KTRR_LOWER_EL1                        S3_4_c15_c2_3
#define ARM64_REG_KTRR_UPPER_EL1                        S3_4_c15_c2_4
#define ARM64_REG_KTRR_LOCK_EL1                         S3_4_c15_c2_2
</span></code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Also it is worth mentioning another feature that was present in past chips already, but is set up differently now:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>“IORVBAR”<br>
A piece of MMIO holding one field for every CPU, designating the physical address at which it will start executing on “reset” (basically when waking from sleep). This too has a locking mechanism, which is activated by writing to it a value that as its least significant bit set to 1.<br>
On A9 CPUs and earlier this was set to a physical address inside TrustZone, where WatchTower (KPP) resides. Since A10, this is set to <code>LowResetVectorBase</code> as found in XNU, which iBoot calculates from the kernel’s entry point as outlined by this comment:</p>

    <div><div><pre><code><span>/*
 * __start trampoline is located at a position relative to LowResetVectorBase
 * so that iBoot can compute the reset vector position to set IORVBAR using
 * only the kernel entry point.  Reset vector = (__start &amp; ~0xfff)
 */</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="in-theory">In theory</h3>

<p>The above primitives are virtually unbreakable due to their locking mechanism, but do by themselves not protect a running kernel. In order to look at what else is needed, we have to look a potential attacks:</p>

<ol>
  <li>(Asserted:) The primitives need to actually uphold what they promise.</li>
  <li>It must be impossible for an attacker to disable any protections or choose to not enable them, thus they must be set up and locked down before the attacker can gain code execution.</li>
  <li>It must be impossible for an attacker to patch any data you consider critical, so all of it needs to be inside the RoRgn. This sounds obvious in theory, but in practise a bunch of critical things are easily overlooked.</li>
  <li>It must be impossible for an attacker to patch page tables that are used to map memory from the RoRgn, otherwise they can copy said memory to a writeable location and patch page tables to point there instead. Such page tables must thus be inside the RoRgn themselves.</li>
  <li>It must be impossible for an attacker to employ a custom page table hierarchy, so the translation table base register that maps the kernel’s half of the address space (<code>ttbr1_el1</code> in this case) must be unchangeable.</li>
  <li>It must be impossible for an attacker to patch or inject any executable memory, otherwise they could add the instruction <code>msr ttbr1_el1, x0</code> and gain the ability to change <code>ttbr1_el1</code>. Therefore the “executable range” must be a strict subset of the RoRgn.</li>
  <li>It must be impossible for an attacker to turn off the MMU, since when the MMU is off all pages are considered executable and an attacker could again inject <code>msr ttbr1_el1, x0</code>. The MMU status is controlled by the least significant bit of the register <code>sctlr_el1</code>, so said register must to be unchangeable as well during normal operation.</li>
  <li>It must be impossible for an attacker to gain code execution before the MMU is turned on (for afore mentioned reasons). Since a CPU starts out with the MMU turned off when it wakes from sleep, this means IORVBAR must point to memory within the RoRgn, and any code executed before the MMU is turned on must not have its control flow controlled by data outside the RoRgn.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="in-practice">In practice</h3>

<p>So let’s examine how iOS implements all of the above:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>IORVBAR is the first primitive to be fully set up, done so by iBoot before it jumps to the kernel’s entry point. Loaded and locked down all in one go.<br>
RoRgn gets its start and end values set by iBoot as well, but is not locked down yet. This is necessary because a lot of the data that is later readonly actually needs one-time initialisation, which is done by the kernel itself. I’ll skip over most kernel bootstrapping here, but after setting up virtual memory and all const data including kexts, we arrive at <code>kernel_bootstrap_thread</code>, part of which reads:</p>

    <div><div><pre><code><span>machine_lockdown_preflight</span><span>();</span>

    <p>The first thing we’re interested in is <code>machine_lockdown_preflight</code>, which is just a wrapper around <code>rorgn_stash_range</code> that grabs the values computed by iBoot, translates them to physical addresses and stahes them in RoRgn memory for later:</p>

    <p>Next, <code>arm_vm_prot_finalize</code> patches page tables for the main kernel binary one last time before they become readonly, removing the writeable flag from all const and code regions.<br>
And then, right before <code>bsd_init</code> there is a call to <code>machine_lockdown</code>, which is a wrapper around <code>rorgn_lockdown</code>. This call seems to have been <code>#ifdef</code>‘ed out of public sources, but if we compare a few functions to some disassembly, it’s evident a call to <code>machine_lockdown</code> was inlined there:</p>

                                <p>An overview of the ECS system scheduling problem, the constraints a
prospective solution should consider, and a pair of algorithm examples.</p>
<p><em>This article is written within the context of Rust language ecosystem and
describes concepts mostly relevant to ECS (entity-component-system).
However, no knowledge of the ECS paradigm, Rust's ecosystem, or even Rust
language is necessary for understanding its ideas and conclusions.</em></p>

<p>Behavior of an ECS program is described by one or several "systems" -
the "S" part of ECS - functions that operate on the shared data contained within
the "EC" part.
ECS paradigm is used almost exclusively in the context of game and engine
programming, with some set of systems the program contains normally running
every "frame" - a pre-determined time interval, not necessarily tied to the
video frame rate.
The amount of time required for all systems in a set to finish their work for
the frame can be referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makespan">makespan</a> of the set.</p>
<p>The time a single system needs in order to be done for the frame is usually
not known beforehand, because it usually scales with the data the system
operates on.
Said data can change at runtime, often through user input.</p>
<p>For performance's sake - to minimize the makespan - it's sometimes desirable to
have several of these systems executed at the same time, in parallel.
In practice, however, systems often operate on intersecting sets of data,
which necessitates the use of some kind of synchronization mechanism.</p>
<p>Said mechanism can't be a simple lock over the shared data, since that would
force the execution of systems to be sequential.
It can be several orthogonal locks, but that's not the most performant approach,
and runs the risk of deadlocking in a naive implementation.</p>
<p>A more popular solution is to employ a special algorithm - a "scheduler" -
that queues systems to run in a way that has better utilization of processing
resources (read: threads, since a thread can be running only one system at
a time) than running them sequentially, yet doesn't violate data access rules,
without the need for locks.
(In Rust these rules state that data may be changed from only one place
at a time, and data that may be changed elsewhere cannot be read.)
The problem of finding such an algorithm is closely related to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprocessor_scheduling">multiprocessor scheduling</a> problem; finding the optimal schedule for the
systems, assuming their run times are known, is always NP-hard.</p>
<p>For an ECS program to be schedulable it needs to be executable at least
sequentially, i.e. whatever constraints on system order execution it might have
must not contain cycles of dependencies - the systems must form an acyclic
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjunctive_graph">disjunctive graph</a>.
Execution order will be elaborated upon further in the article; for now, the
set  will be said to contain all such programs:</p>

<p>An ECS program  consisting of 
systems is further defined as such:</p>

<p>where  is an individual system, 
is the time it needs to complete its work, and 
is the set of data it operates on. Then, a scheduling
algorithm  is a mapping of  to
some schedule :</p>

<p>The makespan  is the optimal makespan for a
given ,  is the makespan
of , and  is the practical
worst-case makespan of executing all systems of  in
sequence:</p>

<p>The problem then can be stated as finding</p>

<p>and, ideally,</p>

<p>In this article, two systems are described as disjoint if running them in
parallel would not violate access rules,
i.e. .
If the rules would be violated, the systems are intersecting,
i.e. .</p>
<p>Disjointedness is not necessarily transitive. Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>system <code>0</code> with required access to <code>A</code></li>
<li>system <code>1</code> with <code>B</code></li>
<li>system <code>2</code> with <code>A</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Systems <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> are disjoint, systems <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> are disjoint, yet <code>0</code> and
<code>2</code> intersect; or, .</p>
<p>Likewise, intersection is also not necessarily transitive. Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>system <code>0</code> with required access to <code>A</code></li>
<li>system <code>1</code> with <code>A</code> and <code>B</code></li>
<li>system <code>2</code> with <code>B</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Systems <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> intersect, systems <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> intersect, yet <code>0</code> and <code>2</code>
are disjoint; or, .</p>

<p>The first instinct is to generate an execution schedule once, when the scheduler
is first defined and populated.
Even if doing so is NP-hard, it wouldn't be a constant cost, seeing as changes
to  are comparatively rare in practice, if there are any
at all.</p>
<p>One way or another, a sequence of sets of disjoint systems is produced; when
the schedule is executed, sets are iterated sequentially, and systems within
them are ran in parallel.
This can be thought of as a directional acyclic graph where nodes are the
implicit synchronization points between the sets, and edges are the systems and
connect the points in such a way that edges originating in one node all
terminate in the same other node.
Formally:</p>

<p>Since the run time of a system is usually not known at the point of schedule
creation, the schedule has to assume that all systems take equally long.
There is an obvious problem: run times are in no way guaranteed to be equal,
and often independently change during the program's operation.
This almost inevitably produces a situation where some systems in a disjoint
set take longer than the rest, reducing average resource utilization.</p>
<p>Assuming sufficient processing resources (all systems in a
set  can run in parallel at full performance),
the best-case makespan  of 
is the sum of  of the longest-running system in each
disjoint set:</p>

<p>Trivially, if all systems of  are disjoint:</p>

<p>(Naturally, all correct scheduling algorithms should be able to
produce  when applied to such .)</p>
<p>The first idea for alleviating the unknown time problem is to make the
time known.</p>
<p>The scheduler could ask its user to provide hints for the system run time,
be it manually, or via some automated benchmark framework.
However, anticipating all factors that might influence the run time is
impractical for most projects, so this approach would be feasible only for
programs with well-behaved, predictable time coefficients.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the scheduler could collect the run times of systems during
execution, picking up on any changes, and adjusting the schedule to maximize
utilization on the fly (making "static" a misnomer).
Potential volatility of the run time could thwart this approach: if a system
is recorded to take some amount of time to finish during this frame, it's not
guaranteed to not take a vastly different amount next frame, when the
measurement is actually used (in practice, persistently high volatility
between frames is uncommon).</p>
<p>The feasibility of pure  is further undermined by
requirements of certain kinds of ECS, most notably archetypal ECS - a subtype
distinct in the way it organizes data internally.
Without going into specifics: sometimes when the data in such an ECS changes
it also changes which systems are disjoint (this is what the phrase "world's
archetypes have changed" in the examples later in the article refers to).
To address that, the scheduler must partially rebuild its execution graph
whenever such a change occurs.
(Technically, it could also ignore this avenue for parallelization and instead
rely only on statically provable disjointedness; however, that still leaves it
with the unknown time problem.)</p>

<p>The idea of tweaking the schedule on the fly can be taken much further:
a scheduler could retain no static execution graph at all.</p>
<p>Such  would, instead, start
execution of whichever system, then find another one that is disjoint with
the one now running, then another that is disjoint with the two now running...
Once no systems can be started the scheduler simply waits for one of them to
finish; as soon as that happens, it checks again if more systems can now start.</p>
<p>This eliminates the biggest problem stemming from unknown run time of systems:
there are no implicit synchronization points, systems start as soon as
resources are available (access and threads).</p>
<p>However, the order in which systems start matters. Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>systems <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code></li>
<li><code>2</code> intersects <code>0</code> and <code>1</code></li>
<li><code>3</code> intersects <code>1</code></li>
</ul>
<p>If <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> are started first, <code>2</code> can start after both of them finish,
and <code>3</code> can start as soon as <code>0</code> finishes; <code>2</code> and <code>3</code> can run in parallel.</p>
<p>If <code>0</code> and <code>3</code> are started first, <code>1</code> can start after <code>3</code> finishes, and <code>2</code>
can start after <code>0</code> finishes, but <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> can't run in parallel.</p>
<p>This implies that a naive  implementation cannot be said
to always produce an optimal schedule.</p>

<p>An important but not yet elaborated upon property of
any  can be gleaned from its definition: it needs to
work for all .
In practice, these programs often impose additional requirements, which may
narrow the search space (the amount of valid schedules) the algorithm has to
contend with by constraining some of their systems to certain positions in the
schedule.</p>
<p>While these constraints may reduce the running time
of  itself, reducing the search space can potentially
exclude the optimal schedule, which, coupled with the fact that no constraint
can ever increase the search space, means that  is
either increased or not affected by any given constraint.</p>
<h2 id="thread-local-systems"><a href="#thread-local-systems" aria-label="Anchor link for: thread-local-systems">
    
    §§
    
</a>Thread-local systems</h2>
<p>Some systems may require being executed on the thread that defined them, due to
some of the system's internal data being thread-local (in Rust terms, <code>!Send</code>
and/or <code>!Sync</code>, depending on mutability of systems in a given implementation).</p>
<p>This requirement does not forbid parallelization: thread-agnostic systems (or
even systems local to different threads) may still run in parallel on other
threads.</p>
<p>While scheduling thread-local systems, it is only necessary to consider them in
the context of their threads - an obvious constraint.
The makespan of a program containing such systems has an additional lower
bound - it cannot be less than the greatest sum of execution time of systems
local to one thread:</p>

<p>where  is a set of all  local to
thread .</p>
<h2 id="thread-local-data"><a href="#thread-local-data" aria-label="Anchor link for: thread-local-data">
    
    §§
    
</a>Thread-local data</h2>
<p>Some of the data managed by the ECS may only be accessed by its defining thread
(<code>!Sync</code> for strictly immutable data, otherwise  <code>!Send</code>).
This case is similar to thread-local systems, differing in one key way:
the thread-local data can be shared between several systems.</p>
<p>However, it's impossible to run those …</p></div></div>

The previous post received a lot of great feedback and it seems that people are interested in this topic, so I wanted to continue the series and expand upon another hardware debugging mechanism. For those who are unfamiliar, JTAG is a hardware level debugging mechanism that many embedded CPUs utilize, with this post I hope to explain how to approach JTAG from a reverse engineers perspective and provide some practical examples along the way.</p><h2 id="goals">Goals</h2><p>With this post, I hope to do the following:</p><ol><li>Explain how JTAG works</li><li>Demonstrate how to discover and utilize a JTAG port/interface on an unknown target</li><li>Provide an overview of some of the current OSS tools that can be used to interact with a JTAG interface</li><li>Utilize JTAG to extract firmware and debug a target</li></ol><p>Also, before I give an overview, I wanted to point out a few great resources for learning about JTAG</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/cyphunk/JTAGenum/wiki/Embedded-Analysis#jtag">Cyphunk’s Embedded Analysis Page</a></li><li><a href="https://www.fpga4fun.com/JTAG.html">FPGA4Fun JTAG Overview</a></li><li><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/69ac/07f94832ceb4d2344c9c2d2bc8fc04e68124.pdf?_ga=2.81325524.238759085.1584580795-2049975628.1584580795">Blackbox JTAG Reverse Engineering</a></li></ul><h2 id="jtag-overview">JTAG Overview</h2><p>JTAG is a hardware interface that was developed to assist developers and testers with low level debugging. JTAG was originally developed for testing integrated circuits and more specifically, sampling IO pins on a target under test. This type of debugging interface allows engineers to test connections on PCBs without needing the probe the physical pin itself. The JTAG interface is controlled via the state machine outlined below:</p><p><img data-src="http://openocd.org/doc-release/doxygen/jtag-state-machine-large.png" alt="JTAG State Machine" src="http://openocd.org/doc-release/doxygen/jtag-state-machine-large.png"></p><p>One of the important things to remember about JTAG at this level is that it involves two registers, the instruction register, and the data register. To utilize these registers, the proper states in the above state machine must be entered using the following interface signals:</p><div><table><thead><tr><th>Line</th><th>Usage</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>TMS</td><td>This pin is used to navigate and control the JTAG state machine</td></tr><tr><td>TDI</td><td>Input pin, used to write data to the target</td></tr><tr><td>TDO</td><td>Output pin, Used to read data back out from the target</td></tr><tr><td>TCK</td><td>Used to determine when data is sampled for all inputs and outputs</td></tr><tr><td>TRST (Optional)</td><td>This pin can be used to reset the state machine to the starting state</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The state machine is navigated using the TMS and TCK lines, while data is written to or read from via TDI and TDO respectively. TMS is sampled on the rising edge of TCK, meaning that the TMS line must be asserted before TCK is toggled to navigate through the state machine. Data is then shifted into the instruction register (IR) or data register (DR) depending on the state of the JTAG state machine. When an operation is completed (or after the update DR/IR phase) the resulting data can be <em>shifted</em> out of DR by entering the <code>Shift-DR</code> state. With these primitives in place, manufacturers can implement whatever features they wish over JTAG.</p><p>The JTAG standard treats IR and DR as shift registers, and due to this, multiple targets can be daisy-chained together.</p><p><img data-src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Jtag_chain.svg/654px-Jtag_chain.svg.png" alt="JTAG Daisy Chain" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Jtag_chain.svg/654px-Jtag_chain.svg.png"></p><p>In a nutshell, JTAG defines a state machine that is navigated with a minimum of 4 signals. With this state machine in place, end users can write and read from two shift registers, IR and DR.</p><h3 id="jtag-registers">JTAG Registers</h3><p>JTAG utilizes two main registers, the instruction register, and the data register. The instruction register is used to determine what function the JTAG controller is about to carry out such as a memory read, or memory write for example. The data register is then used as an additional input to the instruction register, for the previous example, they may be used to provide an address to read from or write to. These registers can vary in size based on their function.</p><p>To write to a register one would perform the following steps, we’ll use the IR as an example:</p><ol><li>Enter <code>Test Logic Reset</code> state (TLR) (This can be done by asserting the <code>TMS</code> line and cycling <code>CLK</code> 5 times)</li><li>Enter <code>Select IR Scan</code> state</li><li>Enter <code>Capture IR</code> state</li><li>Enter <code>Shift IR</code> – This is where we load the data into IR from TDI</li><li>Enter <code>Exit IR</code> state</li><li>Enter <code>Update IR</code> state – This stage “latches” the value into IR.</li></ol><p>Following this, if there were no data registers required, the operation would be performed, and the result (if any) would be loaded into the data register to be shifted out. However, many instructions require a data register to be filled out as well before operating. In that case, once the data register is written to and updated, the operation will be performed and the result can be shifted out of the data register.</p><p>Some instructions do not require the DR to be loaded, for example, if we had loaded the <code>IDCODE</code> instruction into IR (1110b), this would load the processor’s IDCODE value into the data register for us to then clock out and read it on <code>TDO</code>. To read the result out of <code>TDO</code>, one would navigate to the <code>Shift-DR</code> state, and clock in 32 bits on <code>TDI</code>, this would cause the data in the data register to be shifted out on the <code>TDO</code> line. See the image below for a visual representation of what would happen if one loaded the IR with the <code>IDCODE</code> instruction</p><p><img data-src="https://www.embecosm.com/appnotes/ean5/images/jtag-architecture-2.png" alt="IDCODE Instruction" src="https://www.embecosm.com/appnotes/ean5/images/jtag-architecture-2.png"></p><p>It’s important to remember, that <code>IR</code> and <code>DR</code> can be thought of as shift registers, meaning that when we update them with new values, the old values are then shifted out on <code>TDO</code>.</p><p>The JTAG standard defines the following instruction registers:</p><ul><li><code>BYPASS</code><ul><li>This instruction connects <code>TDI</code> and <code>TDO</code></li><li>In the <code>Shift DR</code> state, data is transferred from <code>TDI</code> to <code>TDO</code> with a delay of one <code>TCK</code> cycle</li><li>0 is loaded into the data register during the <code>Capture DR</code> state</li><li>This can be used to determine how many devices are in a scan chain</li></ul></li><li><code>IDCODE</code><ul><li>When loaded the Device Code Id Register is selected as the serial path between TDI and TDO</li><li>In the Capture-DR state, the 32-bit device ID code is loaded into this shift section</li><li>In the Shift-DR state, this data is shifted out, least significant bit first</li></ul></li><li><strong>Core JTAG Concepts</strong><ul><li>The state machine is navigated with 4 signals: <code>TCK</code>,<code>TMS</code>,<code>TDO</code> and <code>TDI</code></li><li><code>TDI</code> is used to provide input, <code>TDO</code> is used for output</li><li>Using this state machine data can be shifted into the IR (<code>Shift IR</code>) and the DR (<code>Shift DR</code>)</li><li>The instruction register (<code>IR</code>) can be thought of as a function, and the data register (<code>DR</code>) can be considered the argument to that function</li><li>As data is shifted into <code>DR</code> and <code>IR</code>, the previous contents are shifted out on <code>TDO</code></li><li>Once data is shifted into these registers, an operation can be performed (entirely dependent on host implementation aside from a few reserved instructions)</li><li>Data is <em>read</em> out of the target by shifting it onto <code>TDO</code> from the data register in the <code>Shift DR</code> state.</li></ul></li></ul><p>So now that we have gone over how JTAG works at a low level, we should talk about why we might care about it, and how this interface can grant access to useful features for reverse engineers. One of the most commonly used applications of the JTAG interface is hardware-level debugging (hence the title of this post). This is implemented by the chip manufacturer, and can vary from chip to chip, however, one of the most common implementations of hardware-level debugging for ARM targets is <a href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0314h/DDI0314H_coresight_components_trm.pdf">ARM’s CoreSight Debug Interface</a>. This is the same implementation that we <a href="https://wrongbaud.github.io/posts/stm-xbox-jtag/">communicated with over SWD in my last post</a>, only, in this case, the Debug Access Port is communicated with over JTAG. The specifics of the JTAG implementation can be <a href="https://static.docs.arm.com/ihi0031/c/IHI0031C_debug_interface_as.pdf">found here</a>. Luckily for us, some excellent OSS tools can be used to communicate with these ports - this post will focus on using OpenOCD.</p><p>OpenOCD takes care of utilizing the JTAG or SWD interface to grant the end-user various primitives that are provided by the debug interface exposed through the CoreSight DAP. The Coresight / DAP architecture is fairly complicated and too much to cover in this (already long) post, so I will potentially save that for another post</p><h2 id="jtag-for-reverse-engineers">JTAG for Reverse Engineers</h2><p>It’s extremely important to have a solid understanding of the protocol fundamentals when approaching something like this from a reverse engineer’s perspective. When reverse engineering hardware (or software) you want to have your ground truth covered since there are always infinite unknowns. These next few sections will go over how we can take advantage of our low-level knowledge of these protocols to assist us on our path to gaining access to hardware level debugging via JTAG. The first thing that we need to do is determine the pinout, and if the pins exposed allow access to the JTAG interface.</p><h3 id="determining-the-pinout">Determining the pinout</h3><p>JTAG signal lines are often grouped together, sometimes (if you’re extremely lucky!) you will see one of the following headers:</p><p><img data-src="https://elinux.org/images/4/48/Ti_arm_jtag.jpg" alt="JTAG Headers" src="https://elinux.org/images/4/48/Ti_arm_jtag.jpg"></p><p>If you find something like this however, it may not have the exact signal groupings, so we will discuss how to determine a pinout if one assumes it’s used for JTAG.</p><p>When reverse engineering something like this, you want to start with what you know. Since we know that most manufacturers at <em>least</em> implement <code>IDCODE</code> and <code>BYPASS</code> let’s talk about how we can take advantage of those two instructions.</p><p>If you have identified what you believe to be a potential JTAG header or pinout, but do not know the pins, we can use the behavior of these two registers to determine the pinout.</p><p>Since the <code>IDCODE</code> register is typically loaded as the default IR, one can test an assumed pinout by doing the following:</p><ol><li>Assign roles to potential output pins (TMS, TCK, etc)</li><li>Enter the <code>Test Logic Reset</code> state</li><li>Enter the <code>Select DR Scan</code>, <code>Capture DR</code>, <code>Shift DR</code></li><li>Clock 32 values on <code>TDI</code> and monitor <code>TDO</code> for a valid <code>IDCODE</code> value</li><li>Check the <code>IDCODE</code> value that you shifted out if it looks valid congratulations! Otherwise, reassign pins and repeat!</li></ol><p>In addition to taking advantage of the fact that the <code>IDCODE</code> register is often loaded into the IR by default, we can also utilize the fact that both the IR and DR behave as shift registers, so if we assume a common register length (32 bits often works) we can attempt to brute force the pinout by doing the following:</p><ol><li>Assign roles to potential output pins (TMS, TCK,etc)</li><li>Using these assumed values, enter the <code>Test Logic Reset</code> state</li><li>Enter the <code>Shift IR</code> state</li><li>Shift in a unique 32-bit value on <code>TDI</code></li><li>Continue to shift 1’s on <code>TDI</code> while monitoring for your unique pattern on TDO (be sure to do this as lease 32 times!).</li><li>If the pattern is discovered, congratulations! Otherwise, …</li></ol></div></div>

        <p>Thanks for the suggestion, Max. I feel like it might be best to continue with this as a thread for now, updating the list as comments are made. Once that gets unmanageable, moving it to a wiki feels like the next step. What do you think?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>poliDAO —</strong>  a multi-party system is great but even then raising attention (and funds) for grassroots movements that are small and localized remains inefficient not very scalable. Also, first-movers inside small grassroots movements often happen to hold more power than they might have to.<br>
It is this case that has been taken further and is now being actively studied for green grassroots movement in eastern Hamburg.</p>

		<div><p>I went into my office yesterday for the first time in a few months to pick some stuff up. We got notified
a couple of days ago to get any personal property out of the office before Thanksgiving or else it'd be
thrown out, so I guess we're moving out of the office<sup id="fnref:moving-out"><a href="#fn:moving-out">1</a></sup>. It was a pretty eerie place to be; even now, 8
months later, most people haven't been back and it kind of looks like the entire office was abducted by aliens in
early March.</p>

<p>Despite how weird it is, I still miss working out of the office.</p>
<!-- more -->

<p>I miss having a clean delineation between "work" and "home".</p>
<p>I miss having copious desk space and a big monitor<sup id="fnref:house"><a href="#fn:house">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I miss the 48" TVs on the wall showing Grafana dashboards with key metrics so there was always ambient knowledge of
what was going on with the product.</p>
<p>I miss having meetings in conference rooms where you can see other people and have a giant whiteboard to sketch on.</p>
<p>I miss casual collaboration. Video chat is a poor substitute and Slack is a deeply irritating tool that combines the
worst aspects of synchronous and asynchronous communication.</p>
<p>I miss productivity! Our engineering productivity has fallen through the floor since COVID despite everyone
working longer and harder; I fundamentally do not think remote teams can <em>ever</em> be as productive as in-person teams.</p>
<p>I miss having my employer pay for electricity and heat and fast symmetric multi-gigabit Internet access instead of
shifting those costs to me.</p>
<p>I miss having a plethora of convenient and delicious options for take-out lunch! I miss the gyros and french fries
at <a href="https://www.ayolagreek.com/">Ayola</a>. I miss the chicken pesto sandwich at <a href="https://working-girls-cafe.square.site/">Working Girls'
Cafe</a>. I miss the chow mein and pork buns from <a href="https://yanksing.com/">Yank Sing</a>. I
miss the katsu curry from <a href="http://www.muraccis.com/">Muracci's</a>. I miss the curry burritos from <a href="https://www.curryupnow.com/">Curry Up

miss the $5 lunch specials from <a href="http://www.mehfilindian.com/">Mehfil</a>.</p>
<p>I miss the succession of friendly baristas at our <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/hermanos-coffee-juice-san-francisco">favorite coffee shop</a> who always knew our orders and put up with our banter.</p>
<p>I miss occasional after-work drinks at the <a href="https://sf.eater.com/2019/4/25/18516128/skydeck-spirits-in-the-sky-rooftop-bar-san-francisco">sky bar</a> with the $18 well drinks that we always convinced management to pay for.</p>
<p>Hell, I miss <a href="https://www.bart.gov/">BART</a> in all its loud and smelly glory.</p>
<p>Look, I know, it's not all bad. It's a lot easier taking care of a baby while working from home than it would be if
I were commuting 45 minutes each way every day. I'm spending a lot less money on food and coffee and BART. And I'm
not arguing that we should be in the office now; not a single one of those things I listed above is worth the health
risk of jamming 150 people<sup id="fnref:deniers"><a href="#fn:deniers">3</a></sup> into an open-plan office with a quasi-functional ventilation
system<sup id="fnref:ventilation"><a href="#fn:ventilation">4</a></sup>. But I
really hope that office-work isn't a permanent victim of this pandemic, that all the companies pushing for
permanent WFH to save a few bucks on rent reconsider their stances, and that there comes a time when I can go back to
work again.</p>

<p>Anonymous Sum Types are one of those Rust features that doesn't exist yet and you either are very familiar with the idea and can't wait for the day an RFC gets approved or... you've never heard of it and think the name sounds as gibberish. Luckily in my experience the transition from the latter to the former is a smooth one!</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/376971848555954187/778499930305986590/unknown.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>What's an Anonymous Sum Type?</h2>
<p>Let's break it down word for word. (If you're already familiar, feel free to skip this)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anonymous</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anonymity, the programming term, refers to a variant of a construct which bears no name. For example, in Javascript you have this little guy:</p>

<p>And, for those who are neither familiar with javascript nor anonymous functions as a whole, you might be confused about what the purpose of a function with no name to call it with! However a function in javascript is an object, which means the above is an expression. So any API which takes a function as a parameter can now take an anonymous function. So you can do the following:</p>

<p>And if you're familiar with Rust, you'll realize Rust has a very similar construct, closures!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sum Types</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm sure if you're reading this you're likely familiar with both a sum (as most programmers are familiar with algebra) and a type, but what exactly is a sum type? (also known as a "tagged union" or "discriminated union" or "tagged variant" and probably one or two other things I'm sure)</p>
<p>You might have even used a sum type without being familiar with the overly academic nomenclature of "sum type", let's take at a really common use case in Rust for sum types and, "coincidentally", the topic of this blog post: error handling.</p>
<p>In Rust error handling it has a strong emphasis on returning errors, as opposed to many languages which reach for exceptions. Here is how this difference looks in <em>reality</em>:</p>


<p>In the Java/exceptions version, the addition of error handling does not affect the return type. However, in Rust, you return one of the two types: either <code>CsvFile</code> or <code>io::Error</code>. So, if you think about the actual type you are returning, <code>Result&lt;CsvFile, io::Error&gt;</code> is a type representing the combination of the two types. (Spoiler: this is what a sum type is, more on that in a second)</p>
<p>Let's try doing something similar by hand in Rust:</p>

<p>Now, at risk of over-explaining the concept, let's represent this in a different manner. A type is merely a set of values that allows us to constrain the values we have to work with. Let's try representing <code>bool</code> and <code>u32</code> as sets:</p>
<pre><code>bool = { true, false }
u32 = { 0, 1, 2, 3, ... , (2^32) - 3, (2^32) - 2, (2^32) - 1 }
</code></pre>
<p>that means we can represent our type <code>BoolOrU32</code> as the union of the set <code>bool</code> and the set <code>u32</code>:</p>
<pre><code>BoolOrU32 = bool ∪ u32 = { true, false, 0, 1, 2, 3, ... , (2^32) - 3, (2^32) - 2, (2^32) - 1 }
</code></pre>
<p>Now one thing to consider is that with our <code>BoolOrU32</code> enum, we are still storing the information which tells us if it is a <code>bool</code> or a <code>u32</code>. This is what differentiates a sum type from a C-styled union. This concept of storing which variant the enum is is the "tagged" part of the other name for sum types, "tagged unions".</p>
<p>To put that all together, <strong>an anonymous sum type is an unnamed combination of types</strong>.</p>
<h2>Error Handling Woes</h2>
<p>Taking a look back at our previous example there's a bit of a problem:</p>
<pre><code>warning: this is super limiting
  --&gt; ~/dev/csv-parser/src/lib.rs
   |
33 | fn parse_csv(path: &amp;Path) -&gt; Result&lt;CsvFile, io::Error&gt;;
   |                                              ^^^^^^^^^ this sucks
   |
   = help: consider using one of the following libraries:
           thiserror
           eyre
           snafu
</code></pre>
<p>While some errors from parsing a file might be I/O related (for example if the file doesn't exist), but some are parsing related errors! We could use <code>io::Error::new(io::ErrorKind::Other, my_error_here)</code> but that's rather verbose to construct, hacky, and it's even somehow an order worse to extract our error type from the <code>io::Error</code>!</p>
<p>One solution to this problem is to hand roll an <code>enum</code> to make a sum type for your error type. This is a really great way of going about things, and is my goto for error handling! It's a great fit for libraries as it allows library consumers to handle only certain errors, or specify error handling by type. It's not very helpful to handle a missing file and an invalid webpage certificate the same way!</p>
<p>However... this introduces a new problem. Internally, you often want granularity as far as your error types. It allows people new to the codebase to see exactly which 2-3 errors a function could return, it allows you to use exhaustive matching to catch more bugs at compile time, etc. However, it's not very appealing to make a new enum for every new combination of errors a function produces. I mean how do you even get past the gruelling process of naming such a type? <code>IoOrParseError</code> isn't exactly what I call a lovely name...</p>
<h2>A Solution! (Sort of)</h2>
<p>Not wanting to name a sum type? That sounds like a job for... anonymous sum types! This is, admittedly, one of the features I've wanted since I first fell in love with Rust's enums being sum types (in a systems programming language? scandelous!). However, last I checked, bumping every Sum Type RFC with an alt got me nowhere! (Yes, for anyone who is paying attention, I <em>will</em> recycle the exact same joke as from my RustConf talk)</p>
<p>It's time to take matters into my own hands. Introducing <code>some-error</code>!</p>

<p>The idea is simple: use an attribute macro to allow for a very minimal/focused version of anonymous sum types specifically aimed at use in error handling. To use it you just slap <code>#[some_error]</code> on your function, set the return type as <code>Result&lt;T, E1 + E2 + ...&gt;</code> and you're good to go! You can even use <code>?</code> for any of the included error types.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Wait, what's the big idea with this hand-wavey black magic nonsense!"</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Man Behind The Curtain</h2>
<h3>The Syntax</h3>
<p>In Rust, you can return trait objects, for example:</p>

<p>Where <code>dyn Any + Send + Sync</code> can be any object which can be any type that implements <code>Any</code>, <code>Send</code>, and <code>Sync</code>, the same single function can even return any number of types, so long as all of those types implement <code>Any + Send + Sync</code>. Tiny bit of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/trait-system/dyn-trait-for-trait-objects.html">Rust history</a>, but before Rust 2018, the syntax for this didn't include <code>dyn</code>:</p>

<p>And since this still parses in spite of being deprecated, that means we can use it for our own nefarious macro purposes! (<del>until it is inevitably removed</del>)</p>
<h3>The Pattern Matching</h3>
<p>Unlike the function itself, matching on the anonymous sum type requires no macro. That means this time around we can't cheat! Everything must be above board or <code>rustc</code> will give me a slap on the wrist. Although, I can't quite say I got out of the macro hackery unscathed, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79148"><code>rustc</code> punished me with a bit of ICE for my crimes</a>.</p>
<p>This time, I abuse a lesser-known <a href="https://jam1.re/img/rust-fact.png">Rust fact</a> that Rust functions and modules exist in different scopes, allowing you to make them overlapping:</p>

<p>And, similarly to traits and derive macros, this allows you to import both at once:</p>

<p>which gives the illusion that the function can have associated constants, types, functions, etc.</p>
<h3>Making <code>?</code> "Just Work"</h3>
<p>This part is rather easy! One really wonderful feature of Rust is that the <code>?</code> operator will automatically coerce from <code>Result&lt;T, E1&gt;</code> to <code>Result&lt;T, E2&gt;</code>, given <code>E2: From&lt;E1&gt;</code>. Meaning all we have to do is generate some trivial <code>From</code> implementations and voila! Now any part of the sum type can be returned using <code>?</code>.</p>
<h3>The Variants</h3>
<p>One problem that occurred while making this is that, unlike a normal enum, the variants can't really have identifiers as names. Since it's a common pattern in Rust to refer to errors in the form of <code>module::Error</code> (such as <code>io::Error</code> or <code>fmt::Error</code>), the variants need to be paths (as I don't really consider any form of normalization such as <code>IoError</code> to really be an appealing solution).</p>
<p>So how can we go about this? Since we're already using a macro anyways, we might as well make the most of it! Let's just generate modules to emulate the paths and then re-export the individual variants of our error type!</p>

<h2>Wait What Do You Mean "Sort of" a Solution?</h2>
<p>Welllllllllllllll. While I am rather happy with how far I was capable of pushing what is possible, I can't say whether or not I actually like it. I haven't been able to extensively test it as I started writing the library a day before writing this. Perhaps this results in a lot of problems! Maybe those problems are all solvable by language-level support of anonymous sum types. Maybe someone else needs to "yes and" this idea before it is actually truely useful. I can't say!</p>
<p>My goal here was not to make <strong>The</strong> error handling library, but rather to explore a new design idea. And possibly to give people something to play with to find sharp edges to motivate a language-level implementation.</p>
<p>You're free to use some-error in your projects, and I will certainly maintain it to the best of my ability, but I guess what I'm trying to say is please don't flame me on reddit just because this library isn't going in anyone's million LOC codebase.</p>

November 21, 2020 | https://yakshav.es/the-patron-saint-of-yakshaves/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://yakshav.es/the-patron-saint-of-yakshaves/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>In 2015, I gave a talk in which I called <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/skade/tex-the-ultimate-yakshave">Donald Knuth the Patron Saint of Yak Shaves</a>. The reason is that Donald Knuth achieved the most perfect and long-running yak shave: TeX.</p>
<p>I figured this is worth repeating.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-achieve-the-ultimate-yak-shave">How to achieve the ultimate Yak Shave</h2>
<p>The ultimate yak shave is the combination of improbable circumstance, the privilege to be able to shave at your hearts will and the will to follow things through to the end. Here’s the way it was achieved with TeX. The recount is purely mine, inaccurate and obviously there for fun. I’ll avoid the most boring facts that everyone always tells, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth_reward_check">why Knuth’s checks have their own Wikipedia page</a>.</p>
<p>So, let’s get things started.</p>
<h2 id="the-pre-shave">The Pre-Shave</h2>
<p>TeX was invented to typeset a book. No plural. It was invented to typeset the second edition of “The Art of Computer Programming”. The second edition had to be typeset again, as “hot type” typesetting, which was used for the first edition, was not available anymore. Being unimpressed by the available options, Knuth decided to write his own system, which later ended up as TeX.</p>
<p>But “The Art of Computer Programming” is an impressive book in its own right: it is still unfinished, currently spanning 3.5 volumes (yes, the fourth is unfinished, but the first chapters are released). It was called a book of the century by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080820030403/http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/100-or-so-books-that-shaped-a-century-of-science">American scientist writers</a>.</p>
<p>Yak shave -2: Write a book of the century</p>
<p>Digging deeper into TAOCP, it already shows the works of a yak shaver destined for greater things. All programs in this book refer to a common assembly language: MIX. Which was invented for the book.</p>
<p>Yak shave -1: Invent your own computer for illustration purposes</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>The first version of TeX was implemented using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAIL_(programming_language)">SAIL</a> programming language. It was later replaced by WEB. What’s WEB? It’s a programming language, invented by… You’ll have guessed it by now, Donald Knuth. It transpiles to PASCAL. Knuth transpiled the WEB before it was cool.</p>
<p>Yak shave 1: Somewhere along the road, implement your own programming language…</p>
<p>WEB is a special language: in WEB, any bare text is just text. It’s interleaved with marked pieces of code, which are later used for the program code. The documentation can be run through a special program to produce… a TeX file. The concept is called “literate programming” and was introduced by… Donald Knuth.</p>
<p>Yak shave 2: Invent your own programming paradigm for it</p>
<p>But, what does TeX do? Mainly, it does text layout and a couple of other things. Knuth being known for research on algorithms couldn’t do without coming up with his own algorithm, later published together with Michael Plass. What does the algorithm do? It finds a visually pleasing way to lay out a paragraph on a page without making line breaks look jarring (for example by adjusting the “glue”, the whitespace between words). Here’s a <a href="https://www.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca/~cs490/2015W2/lectures/Knuth.pdf">nice explanation</a>.</p>
<p>It’s still considered good and has a huge factor in the recognisable look of TeX documents.</p>
<p>Yak shave 3: Invent your own layout algorithm for it</p>
<p>Which brings us to the next problem: <em>what</em> does this thing lay out? Generically speaking: objects and clusters of objects of varying sizes. Interestingly, that’s what TeX deals with, it has no concept of a character other then dimensions.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these are usually characters and characters are provided by fonts. Fonts must usually be licensed at a fee and free fonts weren’t so available in the 70s.</p>
<p>Another very recognisable feature of TeX documents that they are often set in a font called “Computer Modern”.</p>
<p>I’m trying to make this whole thing a bit more thrilling, so I will let you guess who created that one.</p>
<p>Yak shave 4: Design a font</p>
<p>Fonts need to be authored. Usually, they are described in some vector description, often Bézier curves. This is fairly standard and not an innovation of Knuth. <em>But</em>, he wrote a description language for that, along with an interpreter to turn this descriptions into proper font files. This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metafont">METAFONT</a>. It’s not strictly part of TeX, it’s just that the Yak happened to stand close.</p>
<p>Yak shave 5: Write an authoring tool for fonts</p>
<p>As a side-note, METAFONT was later evolved into METAPOST for generic vector drawings, which has the one feature I still miss from many modern graphics description languages: the ability to describe an (addressable) point as the intersection between two other primitives.</p>
<p>Another side-note: both TeX and METAFONT still see releases, at a slow pace. TeX is currently at version 3.14159265, METAFONT at 2.7182818. Yep, TeX is slowly converging towards pi, while METAFONT towards e. Take that, semantic versioning advocates!</p>
<p>Yak shave 6: Come up with your own versioning scheme<br>
Yak shave 7: Avoid adoption of it for greater good</p>
<p>We’re not done yet. We can layout text (and other things), but where do we convert it to? Now, everyone knows the horror printers invoke, so no one wants to deal with those directly. Classic TeX instead converts things to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_independent_file_format">DVI</a>, the “device independent” format. I don’t know many details about it, except what’s on the wiki page, which feels the need to specifically point out that “DVI is not a document encryption format”. It is again a stack-based language (in contrast to PostScript not turing complete), which can then be interpreted through a driver, which would then send that to whatever target (a printer, PDF or such). It was designed by…</p>
<p>David R. Fuchs, Knuth just wrote the implementation.</p>
<p>Yak shave 8: Implement a custom language for printable documents</p>
<p>Note that I haven’t mentioned that TeX is an… interesting… language by itself, but I don’t consider that a yak shave, this was just the implementation.</p>
<p>That makes most of the initial implementation complete. Which means, in orderly fashion, you should give matters in the hand of the community.</p>

<p>Since the release of TeX, the community has been busy working on using it as a platform. If you ever downloaded the full TeX distribution, please bear in mind that you are downloading the amassed work of over 40 years, to make sure that each and every TeX document ever written builds. We’re talking about documents here.</p>
<p>But mostly, two big projects sprung out of that. The first is LaTeX by Leslie Lamport. Lamport is a very productive researcher, famous for research in formal methods through TLA+ and also known laying groundwork for many distributed algorithms. LaTeX is based on the idea of seperating presentation and content. It is based around the idea of document classes, which then describe the way a certain document is layed out. Think Markdown, just much more complex. The second is ConTeXt, which is far more focused on fine grained layout control.</p>
<p>Both share a common property:</p>
<p>Community yak shave 1: Create not one, but two programs that are very ungoogleable… Before Google is invented.</p>
<p>Being active in a language that has lingo built around “Rust”, “Cargo” and “manifests”, I feel right at home.</p>
<p>Now, the community also wants to evolve TeX: a lot has changed over the years in technology, so, for example, you’d like to use modern font formats, directly write to modern output formats or use this new UTF-8 thingy. For that, there are specialised TeX interpreters, such as <code>pdf(la)tex</code>, <code>lua(la)tex</code> and <code>xe(la)tex</code>. There’s a problem here: you are not allowed to change TeX and distribute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX#License">it under that name</a>. The thinking here is that if you have a <code>tex</code> binary, you can compile any valid TeX from the past and from the future.</p>
<p>The first issue on that road is that WEB isn’t really a popular programming language, neither is PASCAL and running it on modern systems is a bit of a pain. Which means…</p>
<p>Community yak shave 2: Transpile WEB to C and work from there</p>
<p>This is just the start of a great endeavour…</p>
<p>Community yak shave 3: Build a lot of tooling around that</p>
<h2 id="the-moral-of-the-story">The Moral of the Story</h2>
<p>Whenever you feel like “can’t we just replace this whole thing, it can’t be so hard” when handling TeX, don’t forget how many years of work and especially knowledge were poured into that system. Typesetting isn’t the <em>most</em> popular knowledge around programmers. Especially see it in the context of the space it is in: they can’t remove legacy. Ever. That would break documents.</p>
<p>TeX is also not a programming language. It might resemble one, but mostly, it should be approached as a typesetting system first. A lot of its confusing lingo gets much better then. It’s not programming lingo.</p>
<p>By approaching TeX with an understanding for its history, a lot of things can be learned from it. And yes, a replacement would be great, but it would take ages.</p>
<p>In any case, I hope I thoroughly convinced you why Donald Knuth is the Patron Saint of Yak Shaves.</p>

<p>This comes out of a enjoyable discussion with <a href="https://lambdaisland.com/">Arne from Lambda Island</a>, who listened and said “you should totally turn this into a talk”.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf">eqaf</a>, a constant-time compare function implementation in <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>, is a great case to demonstrate the <a href="https://signalsandthreads.com/language-design/#0008401">predictable performance of OCaml’s compiler</a>. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>The goal of a constant-time compare function is to avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack">timing attacks</a>, which requires fully deterministic and predictable runtime performance.</li>
<li>Usually, cryptography functions are written in assembly to have total control of resulting binary and avoid unneeded optimization by the compiler.</li>
<li>However, <a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf">eqaf</a> showed us that you can write clean OCaml and get simple and predictable resulting assembly.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2 id="about-garbage-collection">About Garbage Collection</h2>
<p>It’s hard to have a stable runtime performance for languages that comes with a garbage collector. To have a predictable runtime performance characteristic in these languages, the following rules are usually required to be followed religiously:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid garbage collections by avoiding memory allocations.</li>
<li>Avoid boxed values to generate assembly as low-level as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, the resulting code are usually unidiomatic and hard to maintain.</p>
<h2 id="compiler-explorer">Compiler Explorer</h2>
<p><a href="https://godbolt.org/">Compiler Explorer</a> is a handy tool for exploring compilers and its assembly output. It has built-in OCaml support and removes boilerplate automatically. I recommend you to test the following example with it.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="code">Code</h2>
<p>Here’s the implementation of <code>eqaf</code>’s <code>equal</code>.</p>

  <span>then</span> false
  <span>else</span> equal <span>~</span>ln<span>:</span>al a b
</code></pre></div><p>Besides basic OCaml syntaxes[1], interesting bits in the example are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can force OCaml to always inline a function via adding an attribute <code>[@inline]</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>String.unsafe_get</code> works like <code>String.get</code> but without bound-checking. It’s unsafe for most use-cases but it’s used here to <a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf/blob/master/lib/eqaf.ml#L3">avoid jumping to exception</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OCaml provides a FFI <code>external</code> for <a href="https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/intfc.html">interfacing with C</a>. Here we use it to call a primitive function provided by OCaml’s runtime <code>%caml_string_get16u</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>external</code> is always unsafe and should be really take care about.</li>
<li>Primitives are not stable. For example: <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-base64/pull/36">https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-base64/pull/36</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>n asr m</code> shifts <code>n</code> to the right by <code>m</code> bits. This is an arithmetic shift: the sign bit of <code>n</code> is replicated. The result is unspecified if <code>m &lt; 0</code> or <code>m &gt; Sys.int_size</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ref</code> creates a <a href="https://dev.realworldocaml.org/imperative-programming.html">reference cell</a> and allows in-place replacement with <code>:=</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>pred x</code> is <code>x - 1</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>lor</code>, <code>lxor</code>, and <code>land</code> are logical bit-wise <code>or</code>, <code>xor</code>, and <code>and</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the OCaml code is quite low-level (and not very functional). It’s still cleaner than most constant-time compare functions implemented in assembly.</p>

<p>Here’s the resulting assembly of the previous example, copied from the <code>eqaf</code> <a href="https://github.com/mirage/eqaf/blob/master/lib/eqaf.ml">source</a>. You can get the same output via <a href="https://godbolt.org/">Compiler Explorer</a>.</p>

<h2>Public Notice of Sale: CBQ, LLC and Carl Buddig Company – Auction of 191,075 lbs. of St. Louis Style Ribs</h2>
<p>CBQ, LLC and Carl Buddig Company (“CBQ”) is offering for sale pursuant to 810 Ill. Comp. Ann. 5/2-706 approximately 191,075 lbs. of frozen St. Louis Style ribs. CBQ advises that it is selling the ribs because Canadian American Boxed Meat Corp. refused to return the purchase price after CBQ revoked its acceptance of the ribs. CBQ advises it revoked its acceptance because the ribs contained metal particles from rusted, galvanized steel and 400-series steel. The ribs are located at 15600 Wentworth Ave., South Holland, IL 60473. The CBQ is selling the ribs “as-is” “where-is” with no warranties or representations of any kind. Prospective purchasers may inspect samples of the ribs at the above location by contacting Peter Maciejewski at <a href="https://www.dailydac.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="5222372637203f12302736363b357c313d3f7c">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> Prospective purchasers may submit bids by emailing them to Peter Maciejewski at <a href="https://www.dailydac.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="f9899c8d9c8b94b99b8c9d9d909ed79a9694">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> on or before November 27, 2020 at 5:00 p.m. All bids must be firm offers and must provide for payment in immediately available funds, FOB at the address above within 3 business days of acceptance.

				<p>This post concludes my introduction to the chrono extension in C++20. Today I present the time-zones functionality.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://www.modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/Times_Zones/TimelineCpp20CoreLanguage.png" alt="TimelineCpp20CoreLanguage" width="650" height="278"></p>
<p>I should have written, today I mainly present the time-zones functionality in C++20. Before I write about the time-zones in C++20, I want to present the online resource <a href="https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date/wiki/Examples-and-Recipes">Examples and Recipes </a>from Howard Hinnant, which has about 40 examples of the new chrono functionality. Presumably, the chrono extension in C++20 is not easy to get; therefore it's quite important to have so many examples. You should use these examples as a starting point for further experiments and, therefore, sharpen your understanding. You can also add your recipes.</p>
<p>To get an idea of&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date/wiki/Examples-and-Recipes">Examples and Recipes</a> I want to present a program for<a href="https://github.com/rbock"> Roland Bock</a> that calculates ordinal dates.</p>
<h2 id="h1-calculating-ordinal-dates">Calculating Ordinal Dates</h2>
<p>"<em>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_date" rel="nofollow">ordinal date</a> consists of a year and a day of year (1st of January being day 1, 31st of December being day 365 or day 366). The year can be obtained directly from year_month_day. And calculating the day is wonderfully easy. In the code below we make us of the fact that year_month_day can deal with invalid dates like the 0th of January</em>:" (Roland Bock)</p>
<p>I added the necessary headers to Roland's program.</p>

<p>I want to add a few remarks to the program. Line (1) truncates the current time point. The value is used in the following line to initialize a calendar date. Line (2) calculates the time duration between the two time points. Both time points have the resolution day. Finally, <code>year_day.count()</code> in line (3) returns the time duration in days.<img src="http://www.modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/Times_Zones/ordinalDate2.png" alt="ordinalDate2" width="350" height="181"></p>
<p>My following examples to time-zones are also inspired by the already mentioned web resource <a href="https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date/wiki/Examples-and-Recipes">Examples and Recipes</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h2-times-zones">Times-Zones</h2>
<p>First of all, a time-zone is a region and its full history of the date such as daylight saving time or leap seconds. The time-zone library in C++20 is a complete parser of the<a href="https://www.iana.org/time-zones"> IANA timezone database</a>. The following table should give you a first idea of the new functionality.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/Times_Zones/timeZone.png" alt="timeZone" width="600" height="277"></p>
<p>I use in my examples the function <code>std::chrono::zones_time</code> which is essentially a time-zone combined with a time point.</p>
<p>Before I show you two examples I want to make a short remark. To compile a program using the time-zone library, you have to compile the<code> tz.cpp</code> file and link against the <code>curl</code> library. The curl library is necessary to get the current <a href="https://www.iana.org/time-zones"> IANA timezone database</a>. The following command line for g++ should give you the idea:</p>

<p>My first program is straightforward. It displays the UTC time and the local time.</p>
<h3 id="h2-1-utc-time-and-local-time">UTC Time and Local Time</h3>
<p>The<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time"> UTC time or Coordinated Univeral Time</a> is the primary time standard worldwide. A computer uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">Unix time</a> which is a very close approximation of UTC. The UNIX time is the number of seconds since the Unix epoch. The Unix epoch is 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970.</p>
<p><code></code><code>std::chrono::system_clock::now()</code> in line (1) returns in the following program<code> localTime.cpp </code> the Unix time.<code><br></code></p>

    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl;

    <span>auto</span> localTime <span>=</span> date<span>::</span>make_zoned(date<span>::</span>current_zone(), utcTime);
    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"  "</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> localTime <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl;
    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"  "</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> date<span>::</span>floor<span>&lt;</span>std<span>::</span>chrono<span>::</span>seconds<span>&gt;</span>(localTime.get_local_time())

    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"  UTC offset: "</span>  <span>&lt;&lt;</span> offset <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl;

    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl;

}
</pre>
</div>

<p>I have not to add too much to the program. The code block beginning with line (1) gets the current time point, truncates it to seconds, and displays it. The call<code> date::make_zoned</code> creates a <code>std::chrono::zoned_time localTime. T</code>he following call<code> localTime.get_local_time() </code>returns the stored time point as a local time. This time point is also truncated to seconds. <code>localTime</code> (line 3) can also be used to get information about the time-zone. In this case, I'm interested in the offset to the UTC time.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/Times_Zones/localTime.png" alt="localTime" width="400" height="297"></p>
<p>My last program answers a crucial question when I teach in a different time-zone: When should I start my online class?</p>
<h3 id="h2-2-various-time-zones-for-online-classes">Various Time-Zones for Online Classes</h3>
<p>The program <code>onlineClass.cpp</code> answers the following question: How late is it in given time-zones, when I start an online class at the <code>7h, 13h,</code> or <code>17h</code> local time (Germany)?</p>
<p>The online class should start on the 1st of February 2021 and should take 4 hours. Because of the daylight saving time, the calendar date is essential to get the correct answer.</p>

<p>Before I dive into the functions<code> getMinutes</code> (line 1) and <code>printStartEndTimes</code> (line 2), let me say a view words about the <code>main</code> function. The <code>main</code> function defines the day of the class, the duration of the class, and all time-zones. Finally, the range-based for-loop (line 3) iterates through all potential starting points for an online class. Thanks to the function <code>printStartEndTimes</code> (line 2) all necessary information is displayed.</p>
<p>The few lines beginning with line (4) calculate the<code> startDate</code> and <code>endDate</code> of my training by adding the start time and the duration of the class to the calendar date. Both values are displayed with the help of the function <code>getMinutes</code> (line 1). <code>date<span>::</span>floor<span>&lt;</span>std<span>::</span>chrono<span>::</span>minutes<span>&gt;</span>(zonedTime.get_local_time())</code> gets the stored time point out of the<code> std::chrono::zoned_time</code> and truncates the value to the minute resolution. To properly align the output of the program, line (5) <code> </code><code></code>determines the size of the longest of all time-zone names. Line (6) iterates through all time-zones and displays the name of the time-zone, and the beginning and end of each online-class. A few calendar dates even cross the day boundaries.<img src="http://www.modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/Times_Zones/onlineClass.png" alt="onlineClass" width="600" height="760"></p>
<p>There is more to write about the extended chrono library. For example, C++20 offers new clocks such as<code> std::chrono::utc_clock</code> that include leap seconds, or the<code> std::chrono::tai_clock</code> that represents the International Atomic Time (TAI). Additional, thanks to the new formatting library in C++20, time durations can be nicely formatted. This feature is not available so far. If you want to study the formating rules for time durations, here are they: <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono/system_clock/formatter#Format_specification">std::formatter</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h3-what-s-next">What's next?</h2>
<p>If you want to compare signed and unsigned integrals, you may have a lot of fun. This fun ends with C++20.</p>

                <p><sup>PRO TIP</sup> An MVP is a temporary site, it doesn't have to be <i>and shouldn't be</i> perfect.

                <summary>What if I don't like the default styles?</summary>
                <p>Most styles are editable through <em>CSS variables</em>. You can also add your own styles
                    inline, at the end of MVP.css or in a new stylesheet.</p>
                <p><sup>PRO TIP</sup> If there are two conflicting CSS styles, the last one will take precedence.</p>
                <pre>                    <code>
:root {
    --color: #118bee;
}

/* Lower in the CSS, or in a 2nd stylesheet */

:root {
    --color: green; /* This will take precedence */
}
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>What if I still don't like it?</summary>
                <p>That's OK, you probably shouldn't love your MVP. The goal of MVP.css is to help you
                    feel <i>slightly</i> less embarrased about it.</p>

In this article I'll explain one method of generating the Sierpinski triangle recursively, with an implementation written in Vanilla JavaScript using HTML5 canvas. I'll also explain how to you'd go about downloading the contents of an HTML5 Canvas element as a PNG.</p>
<p>First, here's what the Sierpinski triangle looks like:</p>

<h2>What is the Sierpinski Triangle?</h2>
<h3>The Sierpinski Triangle is a Fractal, Making it Naturally Recursive</h3>
<p>One initial thing to notice about the Sierpinski triangle is that every triangle is composed of smaller, identical triangles. Those triangles are also made up of even smaller, identical triangles, which are also made up of more triangles, and so on.</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/generating-the-sierpinski-triangle-in-vanilla-javascript-with-html5-canvas-with-some-mathematical-background/fractal.jpg" alt="Sierpinski Triangle Fractal"></p>
<p>This property in which the Sierpinski triangle is made up of identical, scaled-down copies of itself makes it a <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Fractal.html">fractal</a> in mathematics. Fractals are shapes that are made up of scaled down copies of themselves. The Sierpinski triangle is actually arguably one of the most famous fractals that exist, along with <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PythagorasTree.html">Pythagoras Trees</a>, <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/MandelbrotSet.html">the Mandelbrot set</a>, and more.</p>
<p>The fact that fractals are made up of copies of themselves makes them naturally recursive, and it tends to be simpler to programmatically generate fractals recursively as supposed to using an iterative approach.</p>
<h3>The Sierpinski Triangle Only Uses Equilateral Triangles</h3>
<p>Next, notice how the Sierpinski triangle is made up of a single shape: the equilateral triangle. This is not a coincidence, and it is in fact one of the reasons the Sierpinski triangle is a notable mathematical figure.</p>
<p>The Sierpinski triangle takes advantage of a property of equilateral triangles: that they are one of the only shapes that can be made up solely by scaled down versions of itself, where a large equilateral triangle can be made by tesselating four equally smaller equilateral triangles. This makes them uniquely positioned to be the centerpiece of simple fractals, since it is intuitive to encompass smaller copies of an equilateral triangle inside a larger one.</p>
<p>This also makes it possible for fractals based on equilateral triangles, like the Sierpinski triangle, to be composed of only one shape. Other polygon-based fractals that don't use equilateral triangles often include several different shapes.</p>
<h2>Generating the Sierpinski Triangle in JavaScript with HTML5 Canvas</h2>
<h3>Setting Up the HTML and Canvas Element</h3>
<p>Let's start by setting up the <code>canvas</code> element and basic HTML markup:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Sierpinski Triangle&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;canvas id="canvas" width="1000" height="1000"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;

    &lt;!-- JavaScript Code Here --&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Note that the width and height variables in the canvas represent the inner dimensions of the canvas, not necessarily its size on the page. This means it can be resized in the future to fit different screen sizes, while maintaining its inner dimensions of 1000px by 1000px.</p>
<h3>Creating Equilateral Triangles on the Canvas in JavaScript</h3>
<p>Since equilateral triangles are the only shape used in the Sierpinski triangle, it makes sense to write a utility function to draw a given equilateral triangle on the canvas at a specified position and of a specified size.</p>
<p>This function will take in two arguments: the position of the bottom left vertex on the triangle (<code>pos</code>), and the length of the sides of the triangle (<code>sidelen</code>).</p>
<p>To create polygons in HTML5 canvas, there are several functions to move to positions on the canvas, draw a path around an area of the canvas, and fill in that area. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>context.beginPath()</code> and <code>context.closePath()</code> — create and close a path; commonly used with <code>context.fill()</code> after closing the path</li>
<li><code>context.moveTo(x, y)</code> — move to a position on the canvas.</li>
<li><code>context.lineTo(x, y)</code> — move to a position on the canvas while drawing a line from the current position.</li>
<li><code>context.fill()</code> — fill the most recent canvas path.</li>
</ul>
<p>Creating a triangle simply means identifying the positions of the three vertices, drawing a path around those vertices, and filling the drawn area with a color. Identifying the positions of the vertices is pretty intuitive. Below is a visual showing the positions of the vertices. Note that the height of an equilateral triangle is mathematically equal to as <code>sin(Pi/3) * sidelen</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/generating-the-sierpinski-triangle-in-vanilla-javascript-with-html5-canvas-with-some-mathematical-background/equilateral-triangle.jpg" alt="Equilateral Triangle Vertex Positions"></p>
<p>With the positions of the vertices done, here's what the function to create an equilateral triangle on the canvas would look like:</p>
<pre><code>const c = document.getElementById("canvas");
const ctx = c.getContext("2d"); // context variable is used to draw on a 2D plane

const createTriangle = (pos, sidelen) =&gt; {
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.moveTo(...pos); // go to the left vertex

  // note that (0,0) in canvas is the top left, so 'up' on the vertical component would use substraction.
  ctx.lineTo(pos[0] + sidelen / 2, pos[1] - sidelen * Math.sin(Math.PI/3)); // draw line from left vertex to top vertex
  ctx.lineTo(pos[0] + sidelen, pos[1]); // draw line from top vertex to right vertex
  ctx.lineTo(...pos); // draw line from right vertex back to left vertex
  ctx.closePath();
  ctx.fill(); // fill triangle
};</code></pre>
<h3>Implementing an Algorithm to Generate the Sierpinski Triangle</h3>
<p>Now that the canvas and HTML has been set up and the <code>createTriangle</code> utility function has been written, we can start implementing an algorithm to generate the Sierpinski triangle.</p>
<p>Since fractals are naturally recursive, we'll use a recursive approach to generate the entire triangle.</p>
<p>First, recall that every triangle in the Sierpinski triangle is made up of three smaller triangles, one on the left, another on the right, and a final one on the top. Each smaller triangle is a copy of the outer triangle, the Sierpinski triangle. So, simply create a smaller Sierpinski triangle inside of each of the three triangles, and then more smaller Sierpinski triangles inside of those, and so on. Technically, the Sierpinski triangle repeats forever, but for visualizations like this, a stopping point should be defined when there have been enough repeats that the smallest triangles are hard to make out. At this point, filling in the smallest triangles acts as an effective substitution of repeating further.</p>
<p>To create this stopping condition, a variable called <code>depth</code> can be used. <code>depth</code> would represent the amount of times the program should continue repeating the fractal. <code>depth</code> should start at a certain value and decrease for every repeat, and every smaller Sierpinski triangle created. Once <code>depth</code> reaches zero (the base case), the program would stop and fill in the three triangles instead of continuing to repeat the fractal.</p>
<p>To create this functionality, let's create a function called <code>createSierpinskiTriangle</code> which takes the position of the Sierpinski triangle to generate, its side length, and the depth. The function should identify the positions of the three inner triangles, draw them if depth is equal to zero, or call <code>createSierpinskiTriangle</code> on the three inner triangles if the depth is greater than zero.</p>
<p>Here's what this would look like:</p>
<pre><code>const createSierpinskiTriangle = (pos, sidelen, depth) =&gt; {
  const innerTriangleSidelen = sidelen / 2; // side length of inner triangles is half the side length of the outer triangle
  const innerTrianglesPositions = [
    pos,
    [ pos[0] + innerTriangleSidelen, pos[1] ],
    [ pos[0] + innerTriangleSidelen / 2, pos[1] - Math.sin(Math.PI/3) * innerTriangleSidelen ]
  ]; // these positions are the same as what was used in the createTriangle function
  if(depth == 0) {
    innerTrianglesPositions.forEach((trianglePosition) =&gt; {
      createTriangle(trianglePosition, innerTriangleSidelen);
    });
  } else {
    innerTrianglesPositions.forEach((trianglePosition) =&gt; {
      createSierpinskiTriangle(trianglePosition, innerTriangleSidelen, depth - 1);
    });
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>To call the function, draw the Sierpinski triangle at the bottom left of the canvas (<code>(0, 1000)</code>) with a side length of <code>1000</code>px (the width of the canvas) and a depth of <code>5</code>.</p>
<pre><code>createSierpinskiTriangle([0, 1000], 1000, 5);</code></pre>
<p>Here's the result:</p>
<p><img src="https://xtrp.io/api/content/static_files/generating-the-sierpinski-triangle-in-vanilla-javascript-with-html5-canvas-with-some-mathematical-background/sierpinski-triangle.jpg" alt="Recursive Method Result"></p>
<p>Try increasing the depth, and you should see that the triangle gets more and more detailed. Increasing the depth by one will result in three times the amount of total triangles to be drawn, so very high depths like 20 might not be performant since the canvas would have to draw 3^20 (~3.5 billion) triangles.</p>
<h3>Downloading the Generated Triangle From the Canvas as a PNG</h3>
<p>Now that we've generated the triangle recursively, one thing you may want to do is download the generated Sierpinski triangle as an image on your computer. Luckily, this is very simple to do in HTML5 Canvas.</p>
<p>First, the canvas must be converted to a data URL. If you're not familiar with data URLs, here's a simple definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A data URL is a URL scheme that allows data and files (images, audio files, etc.) to be respresented in a single URL containing all of the data. For example, if one wanted to include an image on a website, you would add the image to the web server and link to it in the HTML. With data URLs, the data URL contains the contents of the entire file, so it can simply be put into the HTML directly. This is useful in canvas because we want to export the image without it having a specific public URL, and data URLs allow that to be done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The contents of the <code>canvas</code> element can be converted to a data URL with the <code>.toDataURL</code> method.</p>
<p>Next, let's download the data URL into the user's machine. In HTML, downloading a file is done by clicking a link and specifying the <code>download</code> attribute. For example, here's how someone would download an image as <code>myimage.png</code> when the user clicks a link: <code>&lt;a href="image.png" download="myimage.png"&gt;download!&lt;/a&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Downloading a file through JavaScript is as simple as creating a link element with the specified <code>href</code> and <code>download</code> attributes, and artificially clicking on it.</p>
<p>Here's what this would look like:</p>
<pre><code>const downloadCanvasContents = () =&gt; {
  const link = …</code></pre></div></div>

<p>RubyConf 2020</p>
</div>
<p>Due to COVID-19, and a rough year for humanity in general, I was looking forward to hanging out with
fellow Rubyists even if virtual. The team behind managing and hosting the event did an excellent job
in making it a fun and welcoming experience. Kudos!</p>
<p>I’ve been enjoying the virtual format for conferences this year and hoping this becomes more of a
mainstay for future conferences. During Slack conversations, people had mentioned taking a hybrid
approach where people could attend in person but there would also be a way, for people who couldn’t
travel, to also experience the joy of Ruby remotely. I like this idea a lot.</p>
<p>If I had one complaint, I would have wished the service for hosting the event was an all-in-one
platform. Instead, you had to jump between multiple services:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.crowdcast.io/">Crowdcast</a> - Used for streaming both live and pre-recorded
presentations. I do have to say I enjoyed being able to rewatch parts of a presentation after it
was over since it only took a few minutes to become available. Even better, you could jump over to
a track you didn’t attend and catch up on it at double speed. ⚡️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> - No complaints here. Although, it would have been nice to have the
Slack experience embedded within Crowdcast.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.alchemists.io/articles/avoid_zoom">Zoom</a> - Necessary for some of the workshops and sponsored events. This
was unfortunate as I’ve written about my <a href="https://www.alchemists.io/articles/avoid_zoom">dislike for Zoom</a> before and we
should do better as an industry in this regard.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>What I was hoping for was more of an experience like <a href="https://hopin.com/">Hopin</a>. I had
experienced an event on their platform earlier in the year and really loved how you could <em>hop</em>
between reception, the main stage, chats, sessions, expos, and other networking activities.</p>
<p>With all of the above said, the following are notes captured from the conference that caught my
interest. It wasn’t possible to attend all of the talks live but, as mentioned above, being able to
catch up on them after the fact at double speed was a nice bonus. Enjoy and may the following be of
use to you.</p>

<p>Aaron’s talk dives into a his work around <code>GC.compact</code> which was added in Ruby 2.7.0 to move objects
around and update references in order to keep memory smaller and well organized. The goal is to make
this process more concurrent. I had seen an earlier version of this talk when Aaron spoke at our
local <a href="https://www.meetup.com/boulder_ruby_group">Boulder Ruby Meetup</a> group but was nice to
watch again in a more polished format. While this isn’t recommended for production, at least not
yet, Aaron does recommmend turning this on for your continuous integration builds.</p>
<p>As an aside, Aaron used macOS <a href="https://help.apple.com/instruments">Instruments</a> to benchmark
Ruby. Instruments comes with a GUI tool for digging into the results. Neat.</p>

<div>
<h3 id="_the_humble_hash_by_ariel_caplan">The Humble Hash by Ariel Caplan</h3>
<p>I wasn’t able to attend this talk live but caught up on it after the fact and ended up having a few
conversations with Ariel afterwards.</p>
<p>In the talk, he made a good points about using primitives (i.e. <code>String</code>, <code>Symbol</code>, <code>Numeric</code>, etc.)
for hash keys which is a good rule to live by. Even an <code>Array</code> or another <code>Hash</code> can work. The
important aspect of any key is that object equality <em>must be obvious</em>.</p>
<p>He also mentioned using default values and even the lesser used and powerful default proc for Hash
construction:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>example</span> <span>=</span> <span>Hash</span><span>.</span><span>new</span> <span>"test"</span>
<span>example</span><span>[</span><span>:a</span><span>]</span>  <span># =&gt; "test"</span>

<span>example</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>example</span><span>.</span><span>default</span> <span>=</span> <span>"test"</span>
<span>example</span><span>[</span><span>:a</span><span>]</span>  <span># =&gt; "test"</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>For default proc support, check out <code>Hash.infinite</code> and <code>Hash.with_default</code> support baked into my
<a href="https://www.alchemists.io/projects/refinements/#_hash">Refinements</a> gem or study the
<a href="https://github.com/bkuhlmann/refinements/blob/master/lib/refinements/hashes.rb#L6-L12">source
code</a> directly. Hashes are definitely powerful. 🎉</p>
<p>That said, I hadn’t seen this variant where a hash is used for memoization which is worth
consideration:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>def</span> <span>expensive_cacluation_example</span><span>(</span><span>argument</span><span>)</span>
  <span>@expensive_cacluation_example</span> <span>||=</span> <span>Hash</span><span>.</span><span>new</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>a_hash</span><span>,</span> <span>value</span><span>|</span>
    <span>a_hash</span><span>[</span><span>key</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>do_expensive_calculation</span><span>(</span><span>key</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>@expensive_cacluation_example</span><span>[</span><span>argument</span><span>]</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here’s another variant using instance variables (non-hash):</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>def</span> <span>extract_fees_by_type</span><span>(</span><span>type</span><span>)</span>
  <span>instance_name</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>'@extract_fees_by_type'</span><span>,</span> <span>type</span><span>.</span><span>to_s</span><span>].</span><span>join</span><span>(</span><span>'_'</span><span>).</span><span>to_sym</span>

<h3 id="_improve_your_technical_writing_by_noel_rappin">Improve Your Technical Writing by Noel Rappin</h3>
<p>This was a two-hour workshop on technical writing. I’m always eager to get better as a writer and
communicate complex subjects in a manner that is easy to digest so was looking forward to learning
more in this space. The following are notes from attending the workshop:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The reader should always be able to understand something they were unable to do before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Writing is a great way to solidify and provide concrete evidence of your expertise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When writing, you want to communicate in a way that makes ideas <em>travel</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always best to write just after you have learned something and when you still have that learners
mindset.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Noel had a suggested process for tackling writing endeavors which is a nice starting blueprint but
definitely take the time to explore and deviate as best works for you. Starting with any process
helps you unblock and focus. The following focuses on tackling the problem, your perspective, and
the reader’s perspective:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Problem</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Be careful not to focus entirely on the solution. You want to illuminate why this is important to
the reader.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does the reader already know? Make a list and think about what you can and can’t assume.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>You</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What is your goal to get across?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What value do you bring to the piece that is unique to your perspective?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What makes your perspective different?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reader</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You are telling a story, like the hero’s journey, where someone doesn’t know how to do something
and now comes back with the skills needed to perform the task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You want to set up the problem, goal, and get the reader ready to want to learn how to solve the
problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each step should build upon the previous step. The trick is doing this well to where the reader
is also thinking the same thing right about the same time you reveal the solution.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoidances</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Don’t use metaphors in technical writing due to confusing people from different
languages/cultures.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The following are examples of technical writing that mix the use of diagrams, charts, doodles, etc.
to convey a point along with good writing prose:</p>

		<section>
			

			<p><span>The Crash of 2008 has infused our societies with enormous scepticism on the role of the authorities, both government and Central Banks. It is quite natural that many dream of a currency that politicians, bankers and central bankers cannot manipulate; a currency of the people by the people for the people. Bitcoin has emerged as the great white hope of something of the sort. Alas, the hope it brings to many people’s hearts and minds is false. And the reason is simple: While it is true that local communities have, in the past, generated successful communitarian currencies (that enabled them to improve welfare in their midst, especially at a time of acute economic crises), <b><i>there can be no de-politicised currency capable of ‘powering’ an advanced, industrial society</i></b>.</span></p>


<p><span><b>1. What are bitcoins and what makes them a very special form of digital currency</b></span></p>
<p><span>Bitcoins are digital units of currency that one can use, on the Internet, to purchase (a limited number of) goods and services. The digital nature of bitcoin is not what makes it novel and unique. There are, indeed, a large array of digital currencies, including dollars, euros, frequent flyer points, Amazon points etc. Starting with standard (fiat) money, more than 90% of dollars, euros, yen etc. are, indeed, digital. When your bank gives you a loan, for instance, it appears as digital money in your bank account. And when you use debit/credit cards or Internet Banking in order to transfer it to someone else’s account, from whom you are buying a good or service, your dollars, euros and yen come and go as mere digital currency units. Only a tiny portion of standard money takes a paper or metallic form.</span></p>
<p><span>Similarly, when an airline grants you frequent flyer points, that you can add to by using a particular credit card or redeem on some flight, upgrade or duty free item, it is creating a digital currency that you are accumulating for the purposes of using it in the future in order to purchase goods or services. Similarly, when the European Union created its carbon trading scheme, to be used by corporations and traders, it concocted a digital stock of carbon dioxide, divided it up in small bundles, distributed them to corporations (attaching to each such bundle or unit a quantity of carbon dioxide that the bundle’s owner could emit) and then set them free to trade these bundles (or pollution rights) amongst themselves in the hope that this digital market would generate a price for carbon dioxide such that corporations would have an incentive to produce less of it and sell (to less efficient firms) the balance of their bundles. Had this scheme worked, these bundles of carbon dioxide would emerge as a digital-only currency.</span></p>
<p><span>So, bitcoin is not novel because it is a digital currency or because it is a ‘made up’ currency. Digital, ‘made up’ currencies are everywhere. What <i>is</i>, however, genuinely novel and unique about bitcoin is that no ‘one’ institution or company is safeguarding the so-called <i>Ledger</i>: the record of transactions that ensures that, when you have spent one unit of currency, there is one less unit of currency in your (digital) wallet.</span></p>
<p><span>Put differently, take gold sovereigns as an example: By their (metallic) nature they constitute private and excludable media of exchange, in the sense that if I use one to pay Mary for a car that she is selling, I shall end up with one less such unit in my wallet. The great challenge of creating a non-physical, wholly digital, currency is the pressing question: <i>If a currency unit is a string of zeros and ones on my hard disk, who can stop me from taking that string, copying and pasting it as often as I want and become infinitely ‘moneyed’?</i> For if I can do that, then it is as if all of us have a printing press in their living room, in which case we would have the makings of instant hyperinflation.</span></p>
<p><span>Until bitcoin’s emergence, the conventional wisdom was that to make a non-hyper-inflationary digital currency possible, a Ledger of Transactions, keeping track of each unit that you and I spent, must be kept by some Central Bank or some corporation. E.g. the Fed or the ECB or indeed Visa keeping track of our digital dollars, or euros. Or British Airways or Lufthansa or Amazon maintaining a Ledger of the ‘frequent flyer’-like points that they administer. Bitcoin, quite audaciously, broke the back of this assumption.</span></p>
<p><span>Bitcoin was born the day in 2008 some anonymous computer geek, using an unlikely Japanese pseudonym (<i>aka</i> Nakamoto), posted an algorithm (on some obscure listserve website) that made something remarkable possible: It could generate a string of zeros and ones that was unique, ensuring that, before it could be transferred from one computer or device to another, a minimum number of other users had to trace its transfer and verify that it left the device of the seller (of some good or service) before moving to the device of the buyer. Moreover, the algorithm was written in such a way as to guarantee a steady ‘production’ of these strings, or bitcoins, over time and in response to the computing power devoted by users in order to help track transfers and, thus, in order collectively to maintain <i>The Ledger</i>. Lastly, to cap the supply of bitcoins, and thus safeguard their value, the algorithm guaranteed that the maximum number of these strings, or bitcoins, could only grow (given the algorithm’s structure) to 21 million units by the year 2040. Once it reached that quantity, its ‘production’ would cease and the users of bitcoins would have to do with these 21 million units. Meanwhile, before that date, and before the maximum bitcoin supply is reached, the ease with which users could ‘mint’ or ‘dig up’ fresh bitcoins (by making computer power available to the bitcoin community) would be inversely related to the total quantity of bitcoins already ‘created’ or ‘extracted’ from the algorithm.</span></p>
<p><span>In a sense, the designer of the bitcoin algorithm (the delectable Mr ‘Nakamoto’, who has, by the way, dropped off the radar some time ago) seems to have designed the new currency on the basis of faith in the crudest version of the ‘monetarist’ <i>Quantity Theory of Money</i> (i.e. the idea that the value of money depended solely on the quantity of money supplied to the public) and, thus, aimed at creating the digital equivalent to… gold. Come to think of it, bitcoin was, indeed, modelled on gold.</span></p>
<p><span><b>2. Bitcoin as a digital simulation of some precious metal (e.g. gold)</b></span></p>
<p><span>What is the great merit of gold? Its scarcity! The fact that, once humans, for some strange reason (most possibly related to gold’s perpetual glitter and scarcity) started using it as (a) a means of exchange and (b) a store of value, gold became a currency and its smallest possible, meaningful, quantity became a currency unit. The designer of bitcoin’s algorithm tried his damnest to emulate gold. Just like gold, which one presumes to be in fixed supply under the Earth’s surface, bitcoin is also limited, artificially (through the design of its algorithm) to a plateau of 21 million units. And just like gold, there are two ways in which bitcoins can be acquired: One is to buy them using dollars, chickens, silk, honey, whatever… The other is to ‘dig’ for them like 19<sup>th</sup> century gold diggers dug for gold. To that intent, Mr ‘Nakamoto’ designed his brilliant algorithm in a manner that allowed for ‘bitcoin digging’. This is how he did it:</span></p>
<p><span>The uniqueness of bitcoin, as alluded to earlier, is that no centralised institution (private or public) is the custodian of the bitcoin transactions’ <i>Ledger.</i> So, who is? The answer is a spectacularly liberal-<i>cum</i>-communitarian: “We all are!” By that, what I mean is that the bitcoin algorithm is written in a manner that makes it possible (indeed demands) that the whole community of bitcoin users has access to, and polices, the Ledger of Transactions (which ensures that I cannot cut and paste my one bitcoin a large, or indeed infinite, number of times).</span></p>
<p><span>In this sense, bitcoin users must make available computing power to the bitcoin users’ community so that everyone can ‘see’ the Ledger, in order to ensure perfect community ownership of the transactions’ record, as opposed to trusting some government agency (e.g. the Fed) or some private corporation that may have its own agenda. Naturally, as the bitcoin economy, and the number of transactions grows exponentially, the amount of computing power that is necessary for one individual to devote to the ‘bitcoin community’ in order to ‘mint’, or ‘unearth’ a new bitcoin rise exponentially with time. This increasing complexity also acts as a legitimiser of the notion that new bitcoins are delivered to the accounts of the users that put increasing computing power at the bitcoin community’s disposal.</span></p>
<p><span><b>3. Bitcoin’s two fundamental flaws</b></span></p>
<p><span>As with all things digital, there are a number of concerns to do with security; with the fear of hackers and e’spivs. Imagine a world that has shifted entirely to bitcoin. Would we not live in fear that some ingenious hacker will get the better of Nakamoto’s algorithm and manipulate it to his benefit? Would it be wise for humanity simply to assume that the bitcoin algorithm is un-hackable (especially so in the absence of some authority that can intervene and save the day if something horrible happens to the algorithm)? Besides, even if the algorithm is safe, there is always the danger of waking up to the realisation that one’s bitcoin stash was e’looted during the night. And if one entrusts one’s stash to some company with better firewalls and computer security, what happens (in the absence of a bitcoin Central Bank) if that company goes broke or simply disappears into the Internet’s darker crevices (with its customers’ bitcoins)?</span></p>
<p><span>These concerns would probably suffice to put a dent in bitcoin’s prospects. But they are not the main drawbacks of the currency. No, there are two insurmountable flaws that make bitcoin a highly problematic currency: First, the bitcoin social economy is bound to be …</span></p></section></article></div></div>

<p>For a long time mediocre artists have used the stories of outliers like Vincent Van Gogh, who only sold two paintings during his lifetime, to romanticize the starving artist lifestyle.</p>



<p>They popularized the notion that is not just ok but also desirable to fail at selling your work. For them, being broke and unable to feed your family signals talent and even unrecognized genius.</p>



<p><strong>But the truth is that starving artists aren’t obscure geniuses — they’re mostly losers who suck at marketing.</strong></p>



<p>Usually, they have two main problems: they don’t understand why people buy things, and they don’t know how to effectively communicate their ideas.</p>



<p>50 years ago, there might have been some valid excuses for not knowing about consumer behavior and storytelling. But in the digital world we live today those excuses are no longer valid. If you don’t use the internet to learn these skills and sell your work is because you don’t want to.</p>



<p>Van Gogh’s case is excusable — he suffered from severe mental illness throughout his life and never even dreamed of having a computer. But you, that are mentally stable and have an internet connection, have no excuse.</p>



<p>If you don’t sell or monetize your creative work on the internet is not because you’re a genius. Quite the opposite.</p>
