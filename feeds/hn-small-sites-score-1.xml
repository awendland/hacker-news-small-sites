  <p><span>08 Sep 2020</span></p><p>Ractor, the new concurrency primitive in Ruby, <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/3365" target="_blank">has been merged</a> to the upstream few days ago. I’ve been following that PR and watching the author’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40t8EPpnujg&amp;list=PLbFmgWm555yZeLpdOLhYwORIF9UjBAFHw&amp;index=17" target="_blank">talk at RubyKaigi</a> (in Japanese, I wasn’t able to find the translated version but it should be available <em>somewhere</em>), which got me excited to try Ractor myself.</p>

<p>A web application server is the first thing that comes to mind when playing with concurrency. On top of that, not too long ago I’ve implemented TCP servers in Rust and Go, so I got curious to write a <strong>simple web server using Ractor</strong>.</p>

<p>Let’s dive in!</p>

<h2 id="whats-in-a-web-server">What’s in a web server?</h2>

<p>A web server is something that accepts a TCP socket, reads from it, parses HTTP headers and responds with HTTP body. It’s a text-based protocol that is easy to implement.</p>

<p>Here’s a sample request (what you’d read from the socket):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:10000
User-Agent: curl/7.64.1
Accept: */*
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And a sample response (what you’d write):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200
Content-Type: text/html

Hello world
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We will start by grabbing a gist from the <a href="https://blog.appsignal.com/2016/11/23/ruby-magic-building-a-30-line-http-server-in-ruby.html" target="_blank">Building a 30 line HTTP server in Ruby</a> post by AppSignal.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>require</span> <span>'socket'</span>
<span>server</span> <span>=</span> <span>TCPServer</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>8080</span><span>)</span>

<span>while</span> <span>session</span> <span>=</span> <span>server</span><span>.</span><span>accept</span>
  <span>request</span> <span>=</span> <span>session</span><span>.</span><span>gets</span>
  <span>puts</span> <span>request</span>

  <span>session</span><span>.</span><span>print</span> <span>"HTTP/1.1 200</span><span>\r\n</span><span>"</span>
  <span>session</span><span>.</span><span>print</span> <span>"Content-Type: text/html</span><span>\r\n</span><span>"</span>
  <span>session</span><span>.</span><span>print</span> <span>"</span><span>\r\n</span><span>"</span>
  <span>session</span><span>.</span><span>print</span> <span>"Hello world! The time is </span><span>#{</span><span>Time</span><span>.</span><span>now</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>

  <span>session</span><span>.</span><span>close</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="starting-with-ractor">Starting with Ractor</h2>

<p>To get started with Ractor, I recommend to read the <a href="https://github.com/ko1/ruby/blob/dc7f421bbb129a7288fade62afe581279f4d06cd/doc/ractor.md" target="_blank">doc</a> in the ruby repo.</p>

<p>Now, let’s wrap the example from above into Ractors.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>require</span> <span>'socket'</span>
<span>server</span> <span>=</span> <span>TCPServer</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>8080</span><span>)</span>
<span>CPU_COUNT</span> <span>=</span> <span>4</span>
<span>workers</span> <span>=</span> <span>CPU_COUNT</span><span>.</span><span>times</span><span>.</span><span>map</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>Ractor</span><span>.</span><span>new</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
      <span># receive TCPSocket</span>
      <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>Ractor</span><span>.</span><span>recv</span>

      <span>request</span> <span>=</span> <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>gets</span>
      <span>puts</span> <span>request</span>

      <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>print</span> <span>"HTTP/1.1 200</span><span>\r\n</span><span>"</span>
      <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>print</span> <span>"Content-Type: text/html</span><span>\r\n</span><span>"</span>
      <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>print</span> <span>"</span><span>\r\n</span><span>"</span>
      <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>print</span> <span>"Hello world! The time is </span><span>#{</span><span>Time</span><span>.</span><span>now</span><span>}</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>
      <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>close</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>conn</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span> <span>=</span> <span>server</span><span>.</span><span>accept</span>
  <span># pass TCPSocket to one of the workers</span>
  <span>workers</span><span>.</span><span>sample</span><span>.</span><span>send</span><span>(</span><span>conn</span><span>,</span> <span>move: </span><span>true</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We start the number of workers that equals the number of CPUs and have the main thread to listen to connections on the socket and send accepted connection to a random Ractor. We can validate that it works as expect by making a request with <code>curl</code>.</p>

<p>However, distributing requests among workers using <code>workers.sample</code> is not very efficient. That random worker might still be busy serving the previous request. We’d rather have workers pull from a shared queue where we’d send all requests.</p>

<p>I wanted to make that part better but I didn’t find any Ractor-friendly queue implementation. However, the <a href="https://github.com/ko1/ruby/blob/dc7f421bbb129a7288fade62afe581279f4d06cd/doc/ractor.md" target="_blank">doc</a> suggesting using a pipe like a queue. Let’s try that!</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>require</span> <span>'socket'</span>

<span># pipe aka a queue</span>
<span>pipe</span> <span>=</span> <span>Ractor</span><span>.</span><span>new</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>Ractor</span><span>.</span><span>yield</span><span>(</span><span>Ractor</span><span>.</span><span>recv</span><span>,</span> <span>move: </span><span>true</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>CPU_COUNT</span> <span>=</span> <span>4</span>
<span>workers</span> <span>=</span> <span>CPU_COUNT</span><span>.</span><span>times</span><span>.</span><span>map</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>Ractor</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>pipe</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>pipe</span><span>|</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>pipe</span><span>.</span><span>take</span>

      <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>recv</span><span>(</span><span>1024</span><span>)</span>
      <span>puts</span> <span>data</span><span>.</span><span>inspect</span>

      <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>print</span> <span>"HTTP/1.1 200</span><span>\r\n</span><span>"</span>
      <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>print</span> <span>"Content-Type: text/html</span><span>\r\n</span><span>"</span>
      <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>print</span> <span>"</span><span>\r\n</span><span>"</span>
      <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>print</span> <span>"Hello world!</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>
      <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>close</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>server</span> <span>=</span> <span>TCPServer</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>8080</span><span>)</span>
<span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>conn</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span> <span>=</span> <span>server</span><span>.</span><span>accept</span>
  <span>pipe</span><span>.</span><span>send</span><span>(</span><span>conn</span><span>,</span> <span>move: </span><span>true</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It worked! By using the pipe I was able to make all workers to pull for sockets which improved the load balancing part.</p>

<p>What’s still not great is that there’s nothing that monitors workers in case one of them unexpectedly dies. And similar to <a href="https://github.com/puma/puma/blob/master/docs/architecture.md" target="_blank">Puma’s architecture</a>, it would be more efficient to have a separate thread to wait for sockets to become ready to read before passing them to actual workers.</p>

<p>I was able to move listener into its own Ractor and to make the main thread to watch all Ractors:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>require</span> <span>'socket'</span>

<span>pipe</span> <span>=</span> <span>Ractor</span><span>.</span><span>new</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>Ractor</span><span>.</span><span>yield</span><span>(</span><span>Ractor</span><span>.</span><span>recv</span><span>,</span> <span>move: </span><span>true</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>CPU_COUNT</span> <span>=</span> <span>4</span>
<span>workers</span> <span>=</span> <span>CPU_COUNT</span><span>.</span><span>times</span><span>.</span><span>map</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>Ractor</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>pipe</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>pipe</span><span>|</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>pipe</span><span>.</span><span>take</span>
      <span>puts</span> <span>"taken from pipe by </span><span>#{</span><span>Ractor</span><span>.</span><span>current</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>

      <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>recv</span><span>(</span><span>1024</span><span>)</span>
      <span>puts</span> <span>data</span><span>.</span><span>inspect</span>

      <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>print</span> <span>"HTTP/1.1 200</span><span>\r\n</span><span>"</span>
      <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>print</span> <span>"Content-Type: text/html</span><span>\r\n</span><span>"</span>
      <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>print</span> <span>"</span><span>\r\n</span><span>"</span>
      <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>print</span> <span>"Hello world!</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>
      <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>close</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>listener</span> <span>=</span> <span>Ractor</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>pipe</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>pipe</span><span>|</span>
  <span>server</span> <span>=</span> <span>TCPServer</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>8080</span><span>)</span>
  <span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>conn</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span> <span>=</span> <span>server</span><span>.</span><span>accept</span>
    <span>pipe</span><span>.</span><span>send</span><span>(</span><span>conn</span><span>,</span> <span>move: </span><span>true</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>Ractor</span><span>.</span><span>select</span><span>(</span><span>listener</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span><span>workers</span><span>)</span>
  <span># if the line above returned, one of the workers or the listener has crashed</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Again, it worked!</p>

<p>The next step of implementing a web server would be to bake a HTTP parser to read request headers. There’s a <a href="https://github.com/cotag/http-parser" target="_blank">http-parser</a> gem that is using a C extension, and I’ve heard that is not supported by Ractor yet.</p>

<p>I found an HTTP parser that comes as a part of WEBrick which is a built into Ruby’s standard library.</p>

<p>I tried the following snippet:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>require</span> <span>'webrick'</span>

<span>CPU_COUNT</span> <span>=</span> <span>4</span>
<span>workers</span> <span>=</span> <span>CPU_COUNT</span><span>.</span><span>times</span><span>.</span><span>map</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>Ractor</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>pipe</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>pipe</span><span>|</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>pipe</span><span>.</span><span>take</span>

      <span># raises "can not access non-sharable objects in constant HTTP by non-main Ractors (NameError)"</span>
      <span>req</span> <span>=</span> <span>WEBrick</span><span>::</span><span>HTTPRequest</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>WEBrick</span><span>::</span><span>Config</span><span>::</span><span>HTTP</span><span>)</span>
      <span>req</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>)</span>

      <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>print</span> <span>"HTTP/1.1 200</span><span>\r\n</span><span>"</span>
      <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>print</span> <span>"Content-Type: text/html</span><span>\r\n</span><span>"</span>
      <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>print</span> <span>"</span><span>\r\n</span><span>"</span>
      <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>print</span> <span>"Hello world!</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>
      <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>close</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>WEBrick::Config::HTTP</code> turned to be a mutable hash with some configuration objects. Since that constant and a hash were initialized in the main thread, it wasn’t allowed to be safely used from ractors. I worked around by inlining the hash definition but then I hit another non-shareable constant referenced from the WEBrick code that wasn’t too easy to inline.</p>

<p>This is probably the part that will improve on the upstream very soon. After all, this is the earliest Ractor implementation.</p>

<h2 id="the-end">The end</h2>

<p>I’m really excited about new concurrency primitives like Ractor getting pushed into Ruby’s upstream.</p>

<p>The Ractor model seems powerful and ready for experimental use. Within the next 6 months (Ruby 3.0 release is scheduled for December), I foresee a Ractor-based web server to come out to leverage this feature and get the most out of server CPUs. This is a great opportunity to learn concurrent programming and to contribute to the Ruby community.</p>

<p>For those curious to try Ractor, I’d suggest to try implementing other things that benefit from parallel execution, for instance a background job processor.</p>

<p>To try Ractor, you’ll need to build Ruby from the upstream. Read my previous posts (<a href="https://kirshatrov.com/2020/01/11/contributing-to-mri/" target="_blank">Contributing to Ruby MRI</a>) to learn about how to do that.</p>

		<p>In October 2017, important figures of German and international business and political life gathered at a reception in a glass-walled hall on one of the upper floors of Frankfurt’s tallest skyscraper. At the event, one of the top executives of a German automobile manufacturing group, warmed and loosened up by some glasses of wine, started entertaining those around him with anecdotes. After some time, the conversation was directed to Hungary.</p>
<p>The senior automotive manager bragged about the fact that the executives of his company could call Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó at any time if they had any requests regarding their factories in Hungary. He then added that if necessary, they could even speak directly to Viktor Orbán – in fact, he said, the Hungarian Prime Minister had already helped them with a specific case.</p>
<p>Two years earlier, in September 2015, Germany’s automotive industry was hit by its biggest scandal ever. It was found that Volkswagen Group’s (VW) diesel cars used software manipulation to cheat on emission tests for many years (later several other German and non-German companies were found to have manipulated their data in a similar way). As a result of the scandal, the price of VW shares began to plummet and it looked like several companies could be seriously endangered, forcing them to close factories and cut jobs.</p>
<p>At the reception in Frankfurt, the German automotive executive claimed that the diesel emissions scandal had become so embarrassing for the federal government after a while that they felt the German state was starting to back out from behind them. Executives of his group of companies then turned directly to Viktor Orbán, asking him to represent the interests of car manufacturers in the European Council that was currently discussing the matter. Viktor Orbán agreed to help and kept his promise, the German automotive executive said with satisfaction.</p>
<div itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/VideoObject"><p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/xCtaFfcysH4?iv_load_policy=3&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0&amp;wmode=transparent&amp;autoplay=0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div>
<p>Since the beginning of 2016, the European Council, which represents governments of European Union member states, has repeatedly addressed the reform of vehicle emission rules. However, Germany has been trying to soften stricter regulations in alliance with Italy and Eastern European member states with significant German automotive investments. In September 2017, a new regulation finally came into force but it was full of loopholes, applied only to new cars not yet on the roads, and made many other concessions to automakers.</p>
<p>A German business source present at the Frankfurt reception told Direkt36 about the lobbying and the role of Orbán, adding that there was nothing glaring about it. “Representatives of every important company say they have Szijjártó and others’ phone numbers,” the source said, adding that top executives of several German carmakers told similar stories, and that they all</p>
<blockquote><p>“absolutely feel that the Hungarian government is in their pockets.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The spokesperson of Viktor Orbán and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade headed by Szijjártó did not respond to our request.</p>
<p>However, a former senior official in the Orbán government confirmed that “Viktor Orbán defends the interests of German car manufacturers in the European Council”. Nevertheless, according to the source, there is nothing surprising in this, as Hungarian governments have always been accommodating to German carmakers. Following the outbreak of the diesel emissions scandal, Mihály Varga, Minister of Finance of the Orbán government, said that 2-2.5 million of the Volkswagen Group’s 11 million diesel cars with cheating engines were manufactured at the Audi plant in the city of Győr and that “the government’s most important goal is maintaining jobs in the automotive industry and preserving the stability that the automotive industry provides in Hungary”.</p>
<p>The above story is a good example of how a relationship based on mutual benefits and dependence has developed between German policy makers, influential companies in German industry and the Hungarian government over the years and decades. German carmakers are the number one engine of Hungarian economic growth and, through this, of the Orbán government’s political successes. According to data by the Hungarian Central Statistical Office, car manufacturing accounts for 4.5% of Hungary’s GDP and suppliers working for large car manufacturers account for another 5-8%. This means that every eighth to tenth forint produced in Hungary has to do something with the Germany-dominated car industry.</p>
<p>Now is a particularly sensitive period in Hungarian-German relations. In the coming months, political issues determining the long-term European bargaining power of the Orbán government and Hungary will be settled in the European Union. In these debates, Viktor Orbán’s German allies will have the final say, and although they have repeatedly criticized decisions of the Hungarian government, they have so far refrained from acting really hard.</p>
<p>Direkt36 uncovered details of this intricate system of relationships, the interests that drive it, and the key players in a months-long investigation. We found how decades of personal relationships control Orbán’s maneuvers in Germany; how German companies give up much-talked-about democratic values ​​if it is in their business interests; and, for example, that the Hungarian government was able to prevent Jewish leaders in Budapest from sharing their concerns with Angela Merkel.</p>
<p>In our research, we had in-depth background conversations with two dozen sources — current and former government officials, diplomats, political intermediaries, business executives, and analysts. Most of them shared information about behind-the-scenes events if we did not write down their names.</p>
<h2>I. Orbán’s German patrons</h2>

<p>“Call the Count and tell him we’d like to visit him!” <span lang="EN">This is the task Viktor Orbán gave Gergely Prőhle on the night of his first election victory, on May 24, 1998. Prőhle was the head of the Budapest office of the Friedrich Naumann Foundation (ie the party foundation of the German Free Democratic Party, the FDP). </span> Four days later, the new prime minister-elect was already in Bonn, where executives of German industrial giants like Audi, Bosch or Siemens were waiting to meet him. Orbán reassured them, according to the Hungarian state news agency’s report, that a predictable economic environment awaits them, moreover, his government wants to increase foreign investment, primarily in manufacturing.</p>
<p>The meeting, which was organized in only matter of few days, was thanks to to Otto Graf Lambsdorff, the influential liberal politician and honorary president of the FDP, who was most often referred to by his acquaintances only as “the Count”. Lambsdorff had known Orban for a long time, he led the Liberal International when Fidesz became a member in 1992. During Orbán’s visit, Lambsdorff proudly talked to the German press about the future prime minister and boasted that he “has been watching Orbán’s political career since the regime change in Hungary and is very happy to support him”. Gergely Prőhle, who later also served as ambassador to Berlin and deputy secretary of state for foreign affairs under the Orbán government, told Direkt36 that “Lambsdorff had already started traveling to Eastern Europe before 1989 and had become Orbán’s first German patron. He was an infinitely smart person from whom much could be learned. The count saw the economic-political ties in light of a full historical context, he was a formidable personality”.</p>
<p><span lang="EN">The relationship between Orbán and Lambsdorff was so close that it even survived when Fidesz broke ties with the European political family the Count represented. Prőhle also wrote an article on Lambsdorff for <a href="https://www.valaszonline.hu/2019/12/05/ezt-a-libprohle-gergely-otto-graf-lambsdorff/">Valasz Online</a>. According to him, the Count watched Orbán’s politics turn conservative in the mid-1990s with some disappointment, but accepted the political realities. He also observed, how over time, leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) Helmut Kohl became the most important point of reference for Orbán. At one point, Orbán explained to Lambsdorff that </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span lang="EN">“in order for him to maximize votes in Hungary, the liberal slogan is not good, and the Count understood that”. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span lang="EN">However, the two politicians remained close friends, and later in 2009 Orbán was the only foreign guest at Lambsdorff’s private funeral.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">During his visit to Germany in May 1998, Orbán not only spoke to company executives, but also spent an hour and a half meeting with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, then head of government for 16 years, who was facing a really close election a few months later. At that time, officials from the Hungarian foreign ministry, which was still under socialist leadership, advised Orbán to also meet Kohl’s challenger, Gerhard Schröder, because he seemed more likely to win the election. However, because of his loyalty to Kohl, “Orbán rejected this idea, while for example, the Polish Prime Minister did meet with Schröder. Schröder and his people didn’t forget this later, neither for the Poles, nor for us,” a former Hungarian foreign ministry official told Direkt36.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">It was a tight race, but Schröder eventually defeated Kohl. According to Sándor Peisch, who served as Hungarian ambassador to Berlin under the Socialist MSZP governments between 2003 and 2010, this was also the end of an era when the German leadership still looked at Hungary with gratitude for its role in the country’s reunification. An important milestone in the process leading to the fall of the Berlin Wall, was the opening of the Hungarian-Austrian border. It started in the summer of 1989 and was officially announced in September, paving the way for East German refugees to travel via Austria to West Germany. But “the SPD was never enthusiastic about reunification. At one of our meetings, for example, Chancellor Schröder began to complain about how much money it had costed,” Peisch told Direkt36.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Viktor Orbán and Helmut Kohl thus ruled simultaneously for only a few months. While Lambsdorff was a true …</span></p></div></div>

<h2 id="how-well-can-you-visualise-something">How well can you visualise something?</h2>

<p>I just learnt that people visualise differently. Take this 10 second test:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leonlinsx.com/assets/images/Aphantasia-test.png" alt="aphantasia"></p>

<p>I’m at a 3 to 4, whereas my cousin swears she’s at a 6 [1]. This goes a long way towards explaining my confusion whenever people were telling me to visualise things… I never could get the detail and clarity that everyone else seemed to be experiencing.</p>

<p><strong>For those people that score a 1, you likely have <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-34039054" title="BBC">aphantasia</a>, a condition in which you’re unable to visualise mental images.</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/ab1fi4/is_aphantasia_real_exaggerated_or_a/" title="reddit">There’s skepticism over whether it’s real,</a> but the research seems convincing. The <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26792259_Loss_of_imagery_phenomenology_with_intact_visuo-spatial_task_performance_A_case_of_'blind_imagination'" title="older">initial paper</a> studied a person who initially had high visual memory and then lost it. Since he was able to talk about the distinct difference between his two states, I’m inclined to think this is a real phenomenon.</p>

<p>The research estimates 2% of the population having aphantasia, a small amount on the other extreme (hyperphantasia), and most people are in the middle with good visualisation ability.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eugencpopa.ro/wp-content/uploads/Afantazia-.pdf" title="newer">The newer paper</a> has a questionnaire, more scientific than my simple test above, that you might want to check out for confirmation. I’m inferring that a score of ~30 or lower indicates aphantasia, and a higher score close to 80 indicates hyperphantasia [2].</p>

<p>Was an interesting day when I realised the way I think is completely different from how most people think! The strange thing is I could have gone my entire life without knowing, since it’s not something you’d discover on your own. Combined with the low occurrence rate, no wonder it’s taken so long for the scientific community to realise the existence of aphantasia.</p>

<p>What’s even stranger is that despite this literally life-changing knowledge, I don’t see how anything changes for me. <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/when-the-minds-eye-is-blind1/" title="learning">It doesn’t seem like you can learn to get better</a>, implying we’re all stuck at whatever we grew up with (or were born into?).</p>

<p>It also doesn’t seem like there have been many negative side effects thus far [3]. Knowing about this <em>has</em> made me less confused whenever I read or hear people talking about using my imagination though! Do let me know how you end up scoring!</p>

<h2 id="what-goes-on-behind-the-scenes-of-an-ipo">What goes on behind the scenes of an IPO?</h2>

<p>People hear about IPOs frequently, but usually are less aware of what happens behind the scenes. a16z recently <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/07/09/ipo-process-prices-behind-scenes-companies/" title="a16z">wrote a post</a> about the process, and I’m following up with some of my experience. As a reminder, none of this is investment advice. Ever.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[The S1] also serves as a marketing document positioning the company and its role in the marketplace, because the company has to avoid public promotion during the waiting period and follow strict rules around what they can and can’t say on behalf of the company. But behind closed doors during this time, the company does pre-pitch the company story and financials to potential investors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The “dumb” retail investor buys into an IPO because they’ve heard the stock will do well. The “smart” retail investor does diligence on the S1, comes up with their own financial model, and then decides whether they should participate.</p>

<p>Most retail investors assume there’s a level playing field, since the S1 should show all the important publicly available information and there shouldn’t be anything they’re missing out. <strong>This has never been true.</strong> Professional investors meet with management <em>all the time</em>, even pre-IPO. They don’t get material non-public information from these meetings, but I can assure you that nobody would waste their time doing management meetings if they weren’t helpful in some way.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With the order book in hand, the underwriters (banks) will allocate the shares to institutional investors. As part of this, they — and the company — want to minimize IPO allocations to investors that have a track record of selling the stock too quickly. They don’t always succeed in doing this, but that’s OK, since some selling helps make a “market”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s a capital markets team in the investment bank that works together with the company to decide how much stock to initially give out to the interested investors. Investors could ask for 10 shares at a $40 IPO price, but just 5 shares if the IPO price goes up to $45. Investors frequently ask for more shares than they think they’ll get, leading to an offering being “oversubscribed”. <strong>Nearly all offerings are oversubscribed,</strong> so if you read the news reporting that, just ignore it.</p>

<p>The intent during this bookbuilding process is to determine what price the company should IPO at, how much “real” demand there is, and who to give it to. I think regular IPOs usually allocate ~80% to institutional clients and ~20% other (<strong>Winnie</strong>, correct me if I’m mistaken here). Importantly, you and I don’t get to buy at the IPO price, but only at the price the stock starts trading at, which is usually higher.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People often assume an IPO means the entire company is going public — just because those companies are required to open their books and report their earnings on a quarterly basis — but actually no more than 10%-15% of the company is typically being sold. Such limited supply can have outsize impact in a short time frame, especially if there’s great demand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No company I know of has given 100% of the company away during an IPO. I suppose it’s possible, but that would be strange and probably a red flag [4]. The price is <a href="https://clutejournals.com/index.php/JBER/article/view/2412" title="IPO pop">usually set to have a first day “pop”</a> as a form of reward to the shareholders that supported the company and to also generate positive publicity and good vibes for the company employees.</p>

<p><a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/slacks-direct-listing-bill-gurley-says-startups-call-morgan-stanley-2019-6-1028298641" title="Bill">Critics of the IPO process</a> think that this “pop” leaves money on the table, which is true, but <strong>most employees would (irrationally) prefer to have the stock IPO and keep going up</strong> rather than the reverse.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So how to gauge the success of IPO after the “pop”? Beyond Meat is trading today above $100. Does that mean the company left money on the table? If you do the math, the company raised about $240 million from the IPO. Had the stock been priced at the first-trade price ($46), however, it could have raised nearly double that amount — and well more if it had priced at the closing stock price. Then again, people might not have invested as much at that price.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To further explain the <a href="http://www.underpricing.de/Downloads/Louhgran_Why%20Dont%20Issuers.pdf" title="research">“money on the table” issue</a>, BYND priced at $25, meaning institutional investors (not you and I) bought it at $25. When it started trading, someone (could be you or I now) put in an order at $46, and a holder of the share was willing to sell at $46, hence filling that order.</p>

<p>Some people would argue that if there was demand at $46, perhaps BYND should just have priced at $46 instead and gotten more cash from investors. Bill Gurley would argue to use a direct listing instead to match all demand and supply.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leonlinsx.com/assets/images/Tilray-IPO.png" alt="Tilray"></p>

<p>I agree there’s money left on the table, but think about the alternative. Suppose BYND priced at $100 right from the start. That leaves nothing on the table, but now there’s a much higher chance the price declines after the IPO. And if it does decline, perhaps the price momentum keeps sinking it lower. We don’t know how much of the current trading price of BYND is due to momentum, and it seems to me it could have gone the other way as well. The general public still thinks of FB, GOOG, and Uber’s IPOs as failures due to the lack of a “pop”. You might argue who cares about the general public, but employee morale within the company is affected as well. My point here is there’s currently less incentive for companies to get pricing exactly right, and who knows what the right price is anyway [5]?</p>

<p>After I published last month’s newsletter, <a href="https://on.substack.com/p/the-future-of-substack" title="substack site">a16z led a $15mm funding round in Substack</a>, the platform I’m currently using to send this [6]. I’m going to talk about why a16z was interested in Substack and where I think this trend is headed.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/07/16/substack/" title="a16z">a16z’s press release</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since then, the internet has opened up new opportunities for media producers. A writer, streamer, or podcaster can now reach an audience of millions. Powerful tools have been created to make it easier to self-publish any format of content. […] But most of this is driven by advertising-based business models from the 1800s — the technology may have changed, yet the economic model is largely the same.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stratechery has <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/why-web-pages-suck/" title="ads">written before</a> on how ad networks facilitated the growth of advertising on the internet. The move from print media to digital media implied that the marginal cost to serve a consumer was zero. This reduction of the barrier to entry led to an influx of free content online, a trend which has still persisted but evolved into different forms [7].</p>

<p><strong>Because of the low cost to produce, high degree of substitutability, and high degree of fragmentation in the suppliers of content, content producers assumed that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/17/subscription-news-services-flourish-as-google-facebook-dominate-ads.html" title="cnbc">people wouldn’t pay for content</a>, and that selling ads was the better business model.</strong></p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/17/subscription-news-services-flourish-as-google-facebook-dominate-ads.html" title="cnbc">the CNBC article</a> notes though, a few factors have led to the rise of alternative, subscription based models instead. <strong>The dominance and effectiveness of google and facebook in digital advertising means that advertising on traditional content producers such as news sites has become less effective.</strong> As an advertiser, I’d rather spend more of my ad budget on where 60% of the internet is going to pass through and get a higher ROI on my ad spend.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leonlinsx.com/assets/images/US-digital-advertising-share-2018.png" alt="ads"></p>

<p>The stranglehold on traffic by Google and Facebook also potentially result in a cost to acquire the marginal user, implying that the marginal cost to serve is no longer zero. For the normal media site, you’re now facing a …</p></section></div></div>

<p>I decided I wanted to try making some skeletonised leaves. So I did some Googling and decided to try <a href="https://penguinbaybiology.org/make-clear-leaf-view-vein-structure/">this</a> approach.</p>



<p>We went out in the evening and gathered some leaves from the local  Shrubbery. Totally not suspicious 🙂</p>

<p>I bought some Sodium Hydroxide and a cheap steel pot from ebay. Note: it must <strong>not</strong> be Aluminium as the Sodium Hydroxide will react with Aluminium!</p>

<p>Although Sodium Hydroxide isn’t a deadly poison, you really don’t want it on your skin or in your eyes, so gloves/goggles are a necessity for safety. Hmm, I should really look into some sort of cheap lab coat as well to protect my clothes for this sorta stuff:</p>

<p>I scaled up the proportions to 1L of (Edinburgh) tap water and 30G of Sodium Hydroxide powder. I put them in the pot, brought it to the boil and added the leaves. </p>



<p>For fun I also tested the pH of the solution with my new pH paper (also from Ebay/China). Its about a 14, so pretty alkaline!</p>

<p>The instructions suggested boiling for about two hours, but it appears to depend on the leaves you choose. I checked on it every 20 minutes or so, and pulled leaves out as they became ready. </p>



<p>To process them, I had the following set up next to the pot:</p>



<ul><li>Tray 1: Plain tap water to wash off the Sodium Hydroxide.</li><li>Tray 2: Some “Ordinary Household Bleach” (aka Sodium Hypochlorite) to bleach any remaining colour out.</li><li>Tray 3: More plain tap water to wash off the bleach.</li><li>A sheet of alumunium foil to put the leaves on to dry out.</li></ul>



<p>After all of them were processed, I ended up with this:</p>

<p>The next morning I was able to unpeel the more robust leaves, yielding me these:</p>

<p>Observations</p>



<ul><li>You need to use <em>robust</em> leaves from trees. I tried some nettle leaves, but they quickly turned to mush. Some of the tree leaves appeared to process fine, but turned out to be way too delicate to remove from the foil after drying: definitely depends on the species. There may be a better way to dry them, will think on it.</li><li>Only process one species of leaf at a time, otherwise you constantly have to check each one in the pot, which means you’re disturbing them more to check.</li><li>Make sure to check on the water level! I <em>almost</em> boiled it dry.</li><li>Its fiddly! During processing, you have to <em>carefully</em> unroll the leaves by hand while wearing gloves to get them flat prior to drying.</li><li>I tried processing a dried up Oak leaf since theoretically it should be closer to being skeletonised: it didn’t seem to work very well (you can see the unsuccessful result on the aluminium foil photo).</li></ul>



<p>What Next?</p>



<p>They’re definitely more robust than I expected, but they’re still quite delicate. I fancy trying dying them and embedding them into some transparent resin next.</p>

      <p>If you’ve ever had a need to implement an <strong>audit log</strong> to track all the changes that get persisted for all or at least some models in your application, there is a good chance that you’ve encountered <a href="https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail">PaperTrail gem</a> that makes it trivial to <strong>track all the changes</strong> - it might be as easy as adding <code>has_paper_trail</code> to the desired models.</p>

<p>However, storing versions is just one thing. The other one is using them later, which sometimes might be far from obvious. For example, you see that some record was updated, but you don’t exactly know why. Maybe you have <code>whodunnit</code> stored, but it still doesn’t give you the entire picture as there might be multiple ways how a given record can be updated and you are trying to establish some <strong>causality</strong> between multiple actions as one update can lead to another one that can lead to yet another one. Not to mention that the persistence can be executed from the background jobs, which will mean that <code>whodunnit</code> will either be nil or be something else (if you, for example, decide to use the name of the job class for <code>paper_trail_user</code>). Merely using <code>created_at</code> won’t be that useful for sure as it’s not enough to group versions form the same context.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there is an easy solution to this problem, which is also quite simple to implement - it’s adding a <code>correlation UUID</code>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-correlation-uuid">What Is Correlation UUID?</h2>

<p>Correlation UUID is a value in UUID format that is used for grouping <em>things</em> (events, logs…) that have the same origin (e.g., a specific action) that helps establish the causality (how exactly you ended up with something and what events lead to it). Thanks to that, you can easily figure out what happened during a specific request by assigning the same value of correlation UUID to all PaperTrailVersion records that got created. Furthermore, you can also track its side effects by reusing the same value in background jobs, e.g., in Sidekiq.</p>

<p>You might be wondering if this really has to be in UUID format, but the answer here is simple: no, it doesn’t need to be. For example, you can use ULID, which could even be a better choice as it has the benefit of being lexicographically sortable. It just happens that UUID is the most popular approach and it’s easy to generate.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-implement-correlation-uuid-for-papertrailversions">How to implement Correlation UUID for PaperTrailVersions</h2>

<p>The most straightforward approach would be assigning some global value unique per request (which implies the need for thread-safety) before saving the version. So what we need is an extra column (<code>correlation_uuid</code>) and something like <code>Thread.current</code> store but with values erased after each request. Fortunately, there is a gem that does exactly that: <a href="https://github.com/steveklabnik/request_store">request_store</a>.</p>

<p>Using a global is quite ugly, but it allows us to implement the desired feature in a simple way, and it doesn’t necessarily make the design worse as <code>paper_trail</code> already uses a similar global for storing, e.g. <code>whodunnit</code> value.</p>

<p>Here is how an example UUID generator could look like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>RequestCorrelationUuidGenerator</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>uuid</span>
    <span>store</span><span>[</span><span>:correlation_uuid</span><span>]</span> <span>||=</span> <span>SecureRandom</span><span>.</span><span>uuid</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>uuid</span><span>=</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span>
    <span>store</span><span>[</span><span>:correlation_uuid</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>value</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>store</span>
    <span>RequestStore</span><span>.</span><span>store</span><span>[</span><span>:paper_trail</span><span>]</span> <span>||=</span> <span>{}</span>
  <span>end</span>
  <span>private_class_method</span> <span>:store</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>paper_trail</code> stores global data in <code>RequestStore.store[:paper_trail]</code> so it’s a reasonable idea to reuse it for storing our correlation UUID.</p>

<p>Now, that we have a generator, let’s add a callback to the to PaperTrailVersion model:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Version</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>PaperTrail</span><span>::</span><span>Version</span>
  <span>before_create</span> <span>:ensure_correlation_uuid_assigned</span>

  <span>private</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>ensure_correlation_uuid_assigned</span>
    <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>correlation_uuid</span> <span>=</span> <span>RequestCorrelationUuidGenerator</span><span>.</span><span>uuid</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And that’s it! That will be enough to group version coming from a single request. Now, if you find something suspicious, you can take the correlation UUID, find other versions with that value, order them by <code>created_at,</code> and the debugging should be way more pleasant. Just don’t forget to add the index ;).</p>

<h2 id="correlation-uuid-for-further-side-effects---how-to-use-it-in-background-jobs">Correlation UUID for further side-effects - how to use it in background jobs?</h2>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, it might be quite valuable to pass the correlation UUID further to the background jobs, so that we can understand every step of the saga that originated from a specific action.</p>

<p>Of course, background jobs are not requests, but fortunately, it’s not that difficult to reuse our <code>RequestCorrelationUuidGenerator</code> inside jobs.</p>

<p>Since Sidekiq is arguably the most popular solution for background jobs processing in Rails apps, I will show an example solution for Sidekiq. However, the idea itself should be possible to replicate for every other processor.</p>

<p>As a prerequisite to make it work with Sidekiq, we will need to introduce <a href="https://github.com/madebylotus/request_store-sidekiq">request_store-sidekiq</a> gem. Since <code>request_store</code> clears the storage after each request, so that the values don’t stick between them, we need something that will do the same thing, but after the job is processed. And that’s exactly what this gem does.</p>

<p>The first problem that we need to solve is to make the correlation UUID somehow available in the job. One way to do this would be to make it an argument of the job, but that sounds painful to deal with. Ideally, we would have something that doesn’t force us to change the signature of the <code>perform</code> method, and that injects the value without us doing it directly in any place. The second problem to solve would be to extract somehow the value of correlation UUID before the job gets executed and set that UUID for the global context (for a current Thread) using <code>RequestCorrelationUuidGenerator.uuid=</code> attribute writer.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Sidekiq has us covered as it allows us to add some extra behavior when enqueuing the job and around the execution of the job. We can do that using <a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Middleware">middlewares</a>.</p>

<p>What we will need are two middlewares:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a client middleware that will inject the correlation UUID to the job</li>
  <li>a server middleware that will set the correlation UUID</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is an example implementation of the desired client middleware:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>InjectCorrelationUuidMiddleware</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>call</span><span>(</span><span>_worker_class</span><span>,</span> <span>job</span><span>,</span> <span>_queue</span><span>,</span> <span>_redis_pool</span><span>)</span>
    <span>job</span><span>[</span><span>"correlation_uuid"</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>RequestCorrelationUuidGenerator</span><span>.</span><span>uuid</span>
    <span>yield</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since <code>job</code> is a hash of a serialized job, we can put there pretty much anything we want. That way, we will make sure that the correlation UUID is stored in Redis.</p>

<p>And here is the server middleware:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>SetCorrelationUuidMiddleware</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>call</span><span>(</span><span>_worker</span><span>,</span> <span>job</span><span>,</span> <span>_queue</span><span>)</span>
    <span>RequestCorrelationUuidGenerator</span><span>.</span><span>uuid</span> <span>=</span> <span>job</span><span>.</span><span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"correlation_uuid"</span><span>,</span> <span>RequestCorrelationUuidGenerator</span><span>.</span><span>uuid</span><span>)</span>
    <span>yield</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The last thing we need to do is to actually inject these middlewares so that Sidekiq can make the proper use of them. We can put that in an initializer:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Sidekiq</span><span>.</span><span>configure_client</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>config</span><span>|</span>
  <span>config</span><span>.</span><span>client_middleware</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>chain</span><span>|</span>
    <span>chain</span><span>.</span><span>add</span> <span>InjectCorrelationUuidMiddleware</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>Sidekiq</span><span>.</span><span>configure_server</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>config</span><span>|</span>
  <span>config</span><span>.</span><span>client_middleware</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>chain</span><span>|</span>
    <span>chain</span><span>.</span><span>add</span> <span>InjectCorrelationUuidMiddleware</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>config</span><span>.</span><span>server_middleware</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>chain</span><span>|</span>
    <span>chain</span><span>.</span><span>add</span> <span>SetCorrelationUuidMiddleware</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To understand more about middlewares, it would definitely help to get through the <a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Middleware">docs</a>. What is important to remember here is that jobs can also enqueue other jobs. That’s why we need to add <code>SetCorrelationUuidMiddleware</code> twice - one for the client (e.g., for the request) and for the server (other jobs).</p>

<h2 id="alternatives-and-similar-problems">Alternatives and similar problems</h2>

<p>If you find yourself often wondering about the causality between the events, state transition, and trying to figure out how you exactly ended up in a given state, you might consider changing the implementation of your domain model and perhaps introduce CQRS and Event Sourcing. You might also want to check Sagas and Process Managers. Even though these are the concepts that are used rather in distributed systems, you might still find them useful if you have a complex logic that gets executed in the jobs that often enqueue other jobs.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>

<p>Having <strong>correlation UUID</strong> assigned to <strong>PaperTrail Versions</strong> is something that might significantly <strong>help with debugging</strong>. Fortunately, it’s something that is not that difficult to implement.</p>

Unit tests are meant to test a single unit of behavior. A well-known rule of thumb is to isolate code that reaches external dependencies.

This way we can to unit test it without performing a request every time we run the test. The question is, how can we isolate it? Hopefully, that’s what I’m going to answer in this post! I’ll not only show you how to do it but also weigh the pros and cons of each approach.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-demo-app">Creating a Demo App</h2>
<p>To put this problem in context, let's imagine that we're building a weather app. This app uses a third-party API to retrieve weather information for a particular city. Our app must generate a simple HTML page, like the image below.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1600427026729/SbZKkiywH.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="weather_app.png">
To get the information about the weather, we must find it somewhere. Fortunately,  <a target="_blank" href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeatherMap</a> provides everything we need through its REST API service.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ok, that's cool, but how can we use it? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can get everything we need by sending a GET request to: <code>'https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city_name}&amp;appid={api_key}&amp;units=metric'</code>. For this tutorial, we’ll parametrize the city name and settle with the metric unit.</p>
<h3 id="retrieving-the-data">Retrieving the Data</h3>
<p>To retrieve the weather data, we'll use <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/psf/requests"><code>requests</code></a>. We can create a function that receives a city name as parameter and returns a <em>json</em>. The <em>json</em> will contain the temperature, weather description, sunset, sunrise time and so on. </p>
<p>The example below illustrates such function.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>find_weather_for</span>(<span>city: str</span>) -&gt; dict:</span>
    <span>"""Queries the weather API and returns the weather data for a particular city."""</span>
    url = API.format(city_name=city, api_key=API_KEY)
    resp = requests.get(url)
    <span>return</span> resp.json()
</code></pre>
<p>The URL is made up from two global variables.</p>
<pre><code>BASE_URL = <span>"https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather"</span>
API = BASE_URL + <span>"?q={city_name}&amp;appid={api_key}&amp;units=metric"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The API returns a <em>json</em> in this format:</p>
<pre><code>{
  <span>"coord"</span>: {
    <span>"lon"</span>: <span>-0.13</span>,
    <span>"lat"</span>: <span>51.51</span>
  },
  <span>"weather"</span>: [
    {
      <span>"id"</span>: <span>800</span>,
      <span>"main"</span>: <span>"Clear"</span>,
      <span>"description"</span>: <span>"clear sky"</span>,
      <span>"icon"</span>: <span>"01d"</span>
    }
  ],
  <span>"base"</span>: <span>"stations"</span>,
  <span>"main"</span>: {
    <span>"temp"</span>: <span>16.53</span>,
    <span>"feels_like"</span>: <span>15.52</span>,
    <span>"temp_min"</span>: <span>15</span>,
    <span>"temp_max"</span>: <span>17.78</span>,
    <span>"pressure"</span>: <span>1023</span>,
    <span>"humidity"</span>: <span>72</span>
  },
  <span>"visibility"</span>: <span>10000</span>,
  <span>"wind"</span>: {
    <span>"speed"</span>: <span>2.1</span>,
    <span>"deg"</span>: <span>40</span>
  },
  <span>"clouds"</span>: {
    <span>"all"</span>: <span>0</span>
  },
  <span>"dt"</span>: <span>1600420164</span>,
  <span>"sys"</span>: {
    <span>"type"</span>: <span>1</span>,
    <span>"id"</span>: <span>1414</span>,
    <span>"country"</span>: <span>"GB"</span>,
    <span>"sunrise"</span>: <span>1600407646</span>,
    <span>"sunset"</span>: <span>1600452509</span>
  },
  <span>"timezone"</span>: <span>3600</span>,
  <span>"id"</span>: <span>2643743</span>,
  <span>"name"</span>: <span>"London"</span>,
  <span>"cod"</span>: <span>200</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>The data is returned as a python dictionary when we call <code>resp.json()</code>. In order to encapsulate all the details, we can represent them as a <code>dataclass</code>. This class has a factory method that gets the dictionary and returns a <code>WeatherInfo</code> instance.</p>
<p>This is good because we keep the representation stable. For example, if the API changes the way it structures the <em>json</em>, we can change the logic in just one place, in the <code>from_dict</code> method. So, other parts of the code won’t be affected. We can even get information from different sources and combining them in the <code>from_dict</code> method!</p>
<pre><code><span>@dataclass</span>
<span><span>class</span> <span>WeatherInfo</span>:</span>
    temp: float
    sunset: str
    sunrise: str
    temp_min: float
    temp_max: float
    desc: str

<span>    @classmethod</span>
    <span><span>def</span> <span>from_dict</span>(<span>cls, data: dict</span>) -&gt; "WeatherInfo":</span>
        <span>return</span> cls(
            temp=data[<span>"main"</span>][<span>"temp"</span>],
            temp_min=data[<span>"main"</span>][<span>"temp_min"</span>],
            temp_max=data[<span>"main"</span>][<span>"temp_max"</span>],
            desc=data[<span>"weather"</span>][<span>0</span>][<span>"main"</span>],
            sunset=format_date(data[<span>"sys"</span>][<span>"sunset"</span>]),
            sunrise=format_date(data[<span>"sys"</span>][<span>"sunrise"</span>]),
        )
</code></pre>
<p>Now, let's create a function called <code>retrieve_weather</code>. We'll use this function to call the API and return a <code>WeatherInfo</code> so we can build our HTML page.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>retrieve_weather</span>(<span>city: str</span>) -&gt; WeatherInfo:</span>
    <span>"""Finds the weather for a city and returns a WeatherInfo instance."""</span>
    data = find_weather_for(city)
    <span>return</span> WeatherInfo.from_dict(data)
</code></pre>
<p>Good, we have the basic building blocks for our app. Before moving forward, let's unit test those functions.</p>
<h2 id="1-using-mocks">1. Using Mocks</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object">According to wikipedia</a>, a mock object is an object that simulates the behavior of a real object by mimicking it. In Python, we can mock any object using the <code>unittest.mock</code> lib that is part of the standard library. To test the <code>retrieve_weather</code> function, we can then mock <code>requests.get</code> and return a static data.</p>
<h3 id="pytest-mock"><code>pytest-mock</code></h3>
<p>For this tutorial, we’ll use <code>pytest</code> as our testing framework of choice. <code>pytest</code> is a very extensible library that allows the extension through plugins. And to accomplish our <em>mocking</em> goals, let’s use <code>pytest-mock</code>. This plugin abstracts a bunch of setups from <code>unittest.mock</code> and makes our testing code very concise. If you are curious, I discuss more about it in <a target="_blank" href="https://miguendes.me/7-pytest-plugins-you-must-definitely-use-ckesvzzt60014e2s1b89a08o7">another blog post</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ok, enough talking, show me the code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's a complete test case for the <code>retrieve_weather</code> function. This test uses two fixures, one is the <code>mocker</code> fixture provided by the <code>pytest-mock</code> plugin. The other one is ours. It's just the static data we saved from a previous request.</p>
<pre><code><span>@pytest.fixture()</span>
<span><span>def</span> <span>fake_weather_info</span>():</span>
    <span>"""Fixture that returns a static weather data."""</span>
    <span>with</span> open(<span>"tests/resources/weather.json"</span>) <span>as</span> f:
        <span>return</span> json.load(f)
</code></pre>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>test_retrieve_weather_using_mocks</span>(<span>mocker, fake_weather_info</span>):</span>
    <span>"""Given a city name, test that a HTML report about the weather is generated
    correctly."""</span>
    
    fake_resp = mocker.Mock()
    
    fake_resp.json = mocker.Mock(return_value=fake_weather_info)
    
    fake_resp.status_code = HTTPStatus.OK

    mocker.patch(<span>"weather_app.requests.get"</span>, return_value=fake_resp)

    weather_info = retrieve_weather(city=<span>"London"</span>)
    <span>assert</span> weather_info == WeatherInfo.from_dict(fake_weather_info)
</code></pre>
<p>If we run the test, we get the following output:</p>
<pre><code>============================= test session starts ==============================
...[omitted]...
tests/test_weather_app.py::test_retrieve_weather_using_mocks PASSED      [100%]
============================== 1 passed in 0.20s ===============================
Process finished with exit code 0
</code></pre>
<p>Great, our tests pass! But... Life is not a bed of roses. This test has pros and cons. Let's take a look at them.</p>
<h4 id="pros">Pros</h4>
<p>Well, one pro we already discussed is that by mocking the return of the API we make our tests easier. We isolate the communication with the API and make the test predictable. It will always return what we want.</p>
<h4 id="cons">Cons</h4>
<p>As cons, the problem is, what if we don’t want to use <code>requests</code> anymore and decide to go with the standard’s lib <code>urllib</code>. Every time we change the implementation of <code>find_weather_for</code> we will have to adapt the test. A good test is a test that doesn’t change when our implementation change. So, by mocking, we end up coupling our test with the implementation.</p>
<p>Also, another downside is the amount of setup we have to do before calling the function. At lest, 3 lines of code.</p>
<pre><code>...
    
    fake_resp = mocker.Mock()
    
    fake_resp.json = mocker.Mock(return_value=fake_weather_info)
    
    fake_resp.status_code = HTTPStatus.OK
...
</code></pre>

<p>Can we do better? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, please, follow along. Let's see now how to improve it a bit.</p>
<h3 id="responses"><code>responses</code></h3>
<p>Mocking <code>requests</code> using the <code>mocker</code> feature has the downside of having a long setup. A good way to avoid that is to use a library that intercepts <code>requests</code> calls and patch it. There are more than one lib for that, but simplest to me is <code>responses</code>. Let’s see how can we use it to replace <code>mock</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>@responses.activate</span>
<span><span>def</span> <span>test_retrieve_weather_using_responses</span>(<span>fake_weather_info</span>):</span>
    <span>"""Given a city name, test that a HTML report about the weather is generated
    correctly."""</span>
    api_uri = API.format(city_name=<span>"London"</span>, api_key=API_KEY)
    responses.add(responses.GET, api_uri, json=fake_weather_info, status=HTTPStatus.OK)

    weather_info = retrieve_weather(city=<span>"London"</span>)
    <span>assert</span> weather_info == WeatherInfo.from_dict(fake_weather_info)
</code></pre>
<p>Again, this function makes use of our <code>fake_weather_info</code> fixture.</p>
<p>Good... let's run the test.</p>
<pre><code>============================= test session starts ==============================
...
tests/test_weather_app.py::test_retrieve_weather_using_responses PASSED  [100%]
============================== 1 passed in 0.19s ===============================
</code></pre>
<p>Great! This test pass too. But... It's still not that great...</p>
<h3 id="pros">Pros</h3>
<p>The good thing about using libraries like <code>responses</code> is that we don't need to patch <code>requests</code> ourselves. We save some setup by delegating the abstraction to the library. However, in case you haven't noticed, we have problems.</p>
<h3 id="cons">Cons</h3>
<p>Again, the problem is, much like <code>unittest.mock</code>, our test is coupled to the implementation. If we replace <code>requests</code>, our test break.</p>
<h2 id="2-using-an-adapter">2. Using an Adapter</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>If by using mocks we couple our tests, what can we do?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s image the following scenario: Say that we can no longer use <code>requests</code> and we’ll have to replace it by <code>urllib</code>, since it comes with Python. Not only that, we learned the lessons of not coupling test code with implementation and we want to avoid that in the future. We want to replace <code>urllib</code> and not have to rewrite the tests.</p>
<p>It turns out we can abstract away the code that performs the GET request.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Really? How?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can abstract it by using an adapter. The adapter is a design pattern that is used to encapsulate, or wrap, the interface of other class and expose it as a new interface. This way we can change the adapters without changing our code. For example, we can encapsulate the details about <code>requests</code> in our <code>find_weather_for</code> and expose it via a function that takes only the URL.</p>
<p>So, this...</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>find_weather_for</span>(<span>city: str</span>) -&gt; dict:</span>
    <span>"""Queries the weather …</span></code></pre></div></div>

<h5>By Jim Grey (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://softwaresaltmines.com/about/" target="_blank">about</a>)</h5>



<p>I hired a software developer right out of college. He had a lot to learn, but he learned it steadily. Yet he admitted to me privately that he wasn’t sure he belonged. He thought that the other developers spoke so confidently and delivered so competently. He compared himself to them and, in his mind, came up wanting.</p>

<p>What he didn’t know was that I was leading developers for the first time. I’d been in management roles in the industry for a very long time, but always of testing and communications teams. </p>



<p>Worse, I hadn’t written a meaningful line of code in about a decade. Even then, most of that code was test automation. That’s not the same as writing product code.</p>



<p>Yet here I was, leading developers. The CTO who hired me wanted my skill in managing people, leading projects, and refining process. But I had so much to learn about modern software development. It was embarrassing to need the developers to explain the basics to me.</p>



<p>I told this young developer this story and admitted that I felt like an impostor, too. But I’d experienced impostor syndrome before. I knew that with effort and time I’d learn what I needed to learn and the feeling would abate. More importantly, even with all I needed to learn, I knew I had something valuable to offer right now. He did too, I told him.</p>



<p>We all figure it out as we go. In time, we build experience that lets us get it right more often.</p>



<p>What I wish I’d told him, what I’ve learned since then, is that there are three kinds of impostors. There are the impostors who don’t know they’re impostors. They’re so self-possessed that they overestimate themselves. There are the impostors who know it but do everything they can to hide it. They live in fear and anxiety that they will be found out. And then there are the impostors who know it, admit it to themselves, and sometimes even admit it to others. They’re the ones who can grow the fastest.</p>



<p>This young developer was the best kind: he admitted it. It let me tell him my own story, which helped put his mind at ease. Then it let us talk frankly about the areas where he felt like he didn’t know what he was doing, so I could pair him with other engineers who could level him up faster.</p>

        <p>No. I just clickbaited you but don’t leave yet, keep reading for something fun!</p>
<p>A couple of days ago I found something curious on <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/">VirusTotal</a>. There were more than 40 thousand binaries with the same size in a single day. That seemed very odd so I loaded two random binaries and compared their contents. The only difference was on strings section.</p>
<p>VirusTotal detections were very low (two to three) and identified the samples as EvilQuest/ThiefQuest malware.</p>
<p>To prove that all the binaries were the same except for strings, I wrote a quick <a href="https://github.com/gdbinit/evilquest_stats">Mach-O stats</a> utility in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> (yes, 2020 is this crazy!) to hash the code and strings sections separately. The hypothesis is that the code section would have the same hash for all the samples, and the strings section would have a unique hash for each sample. The output confirmed that this was indeed the case - same code, different strings.</p>
<p>Running this program against 206091 binaries totalling 34GB of data:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">Mach-O Stats

</code></pre></div><p>Given that the strings are encrypted/obfuscated, my first idea was that this could be a new version with mutated versions being used in different sources. Doesn’t make that much sense given that the code was the same but given that EvilQuest has ransomware features, this could be for example different BitCoin wallets for each sample.</p>
<p>Now it was time to load one of the samples into a disassembler and give a look at its contents. Assuming that the VirusTotal detections were correct even if too low, I grabbed the <a href="https://objective-see.com/downloads/malware/EvilOSX.zip">known sample</a> of EvilQuest. This sample contains debugging symbols so it’s very easy to navigate since most function names are explicit about their intents. The new sample fixed that mistake and had that information removed.</p>
<p>Before bringing the heavy diffing guns such as <a href="https://www.zynamics.com/software.html">BinDiff</a> and <a href="http://diaphora.re/">Diaphora</a> I like to give a look around to feel what’s going on. In this case the code had differences but was very similar. I could see what were clearly obfuscated/encrypted strings like in the original sample. So, I tried to find those functions using the symbols from the first sample. That was fast and easy and confirmed that the code was related (either from the same author or someone reusing it - attribution is hard :P).</p>
<p>Scott Knight released a <a href="https://github.com/carbonblack/tau-tools/tree/master/malware_specific/ThiefQuest">script</a> to decrypt/encrypt the original samples strings, but it doesn’t work with the new samples. It makes sense given that there are keys and tables that could have changed, and also what appears to be a new type of obfuscated/encrypted string format.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="plaintext">000Bg{0000090nQ4XL1qPsnl1ZjpKX0lkFoa0000053
</code></pre></div><p>The new strings type appears to always starts with <strong>000Bg{</strong>.</p>
<p>Learning a new programming language is easier when you have things to do with it, so I decided to write a <a href="https://github.com/gdbinit/evilquest_deobfuscator">decrypter/deobfuscator</a> in Go. In hindsight it wasn’t a smart decision because it’s kind of ugly to deal with buffers in Go and much easier in C (or I don’t know yet the best way to do it in Go).</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ ./evilquest_deobfuscator -s <span>"000Bg{0000090nQ4XL1qPsnl1ZjpKX0lkFoa0000053"</span>

</code></pre></div><p>Meanwhile, the next day there were again more than 40 thousand new samples with the same size. Confirmed again that the only difference was in strings. While reversing and writing the strings decrypter I noticed that the hash of the sample I was using was modified. That generated a brain click and I went to bed thinking that this wasn’t a big malware campaign (very sad!) because it didn’t make sense with so many samples but it could be a VirusTotal issue. VirusTotal sandbox just got trapped into an analysis loop. This idea was reinforced by the fact that the sample had been submitted from the <strong>ZZ</strong> country code, meaning unknown origin. Connecting these two ideas reinforced my belief that this was the right path.</p>
<p>After I finished the <a href="https://github.com/gdbinit/evilquest_deobfuscator">strings decrypter</a> I could verify that my unique samples campaign hypothesis wasn’t valid. The strings were all the same, just encrypted/obfuscated with different keys.</p>
<p>So, the next step was to verify the code to see what was happening there. This was very easy to find since it’s the first thing the sample does.</p>
<p>At the entrypoint we can observe the mutation function being called first with <code>argv[0]</code> as its argument.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="plaintext">000000010001A8D0         public start

(...)
</code></pre></div><p>Next follows opening the executable itself with <code>rb+</code> mode (reading and writing). Fun enough there is a memory leak because the decrypted string buffer is malloc’ed in the decryptor function. One of the differences from this sample versus the previous is the increased usage of dynamically allocated memory, increasing the potential for memory leaks. There are a lot more memory leaks all over the code. Xcode Instruments has a nice leak detector (<em>hint, hint</em>).</p>

  <p>Like so many things I’m supposed to do but don’t — getting exercise, eating right, sleeping well, standing up for women and minorities in public spaces — backing up my data has always been something I’ve half-assed at best.</p>
<p>I’ve lugged around an external hard drive with a few hundred gigabytes of data for the last 10 years, and made backups to it once every three or four years or so. Every time I’ve tried restoring anything from those backups I’ve regretted it, because of course I just bought the drive, plugged it in and copied stuff to it, so it is a FAT32 drive while I have mostly had EXT4 filesystems, which means all my file permissions get lost during the process.</p>
<p>I’ve written shameful little shell scripts to set file permissions to 0644 and directory permissions to 0755, recursively, many many times.</p>
<p>Part of my problem was that I both know just enough rsync to be dangerous and have a credit card so I can provision cloud VMs, so forever just around the corner was my perfect backup solution that I’d write myself and maintain and actually do instead of dealing with whatever I had going on in my life. I’ve come to accept that this will never happen, or perhaps more definitively, that I’d rather cut myself than write and maintain another piece of ad-hoc software for myself.</p>
<p>Luckily I recently found two things that have solved this whole problem for me: <a href="https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">borg</a> and <a href="https://www.rsync.net/">rsync.net</a>.</p>
<p>Borg is backup software. It compresses and deduplicates data at the block level, and strongly encourages (but does not force) you to encrypt data before backing it up. It is everything I’d want from my half-assed rsync and shell script abomination.</p>
<p>I read its documentation a couple of times and was impressed. I then set about comparing different VM hosts to see which one would give me the cheapest block storage option, when the result of some <a href="https://github.com/scotte/borgsnap">random google search</a> led me to rsync.net. They are a company that stores backups, pretty cheaply, and <a href="http://www.rsync.net/products/attic.html">even more cheaply</a> if you use borg to take them. I guess they just really love borg and want us to love it too.</p>
<p>I signed up for their cheapest plan, which starts at 100GB stored for $18 per year. They have no network in- or egress costs, and the storage amount can be adjusted at any time. Once my account had been activated, I did a little password reset dance, and uploaded a public SSH key.</p>
<p>I wanted to back up my <code>$HOME</code> directory, so after installing borg I ran:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre>export BORG_REMOTE_PATH="borg1"
borg init --encryption repokey-blake2 UID@ch-s011.rsync.net:home</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>This created a remote borg repository called "home" on rsync.net’s servers. The environment variable is so we use a more recent version of borg on the remote server (version 1.1.11 at the time of writing), as the default version is rather old (version 0.29.0).</p>
<p>When choosing what encryption method to use, one can choose between a "repokey" or a "keyfile". They both create a private key locked with a passphrase; the difference is that with "repokey" the key is stored in the borg repo, while with "keyfile" it is stored outside of it. This boils down to whether we think a passphrase is enough security for our data, or whether we think having a secret keyfile is necessary. I figured my password manager could create a strong enough passphrase for my needs, and I didn’t want to think about losing the keyfile, so I chose "repokey-blake2".</p>
<p>To create my first backup, I ran</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre>borg create --exclude "$HOME/.cache" UID@ch-s011.rsync.net:home::backup-1 "$HOME"</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>which created the archive "backup-1" in my "home" borg repository. I didn’t change the compression algorithm from the default one.</p>
<p>By default borg compresses data with lz4. It can use other compression methods (xz, zlib, zstd). I compared their compression ratios on some binary files I had and found no difference between them. I think this is because the large binary files I have are mostly audio and video files in lossy formats, which don’t seem to benefit very much from further compression. I have a lot of text files as well, but text takes up so little relative space on today’s hardware that it makes no sense to spend CPU cycles on compressing it better than lz4 does.</p>
<p>This backup command hummed along for a good while, and through a couple of reboot cycles. Doing a second backup right after it finished (or the day after) took a lot less time because of the deduplication:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre>borg create --exclude "$HOME/.cache" UID@ch-s011.rsync.net:home::backup-2 "$HOME"</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Restoring from backup is also easy:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre>borg extract UID@ch-s011.rsync.net:home::backup-2</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>I set this up to run as a daily timed systemd service at noon (very easy on NixOS, which every Linux user should be using unless they hate themselves), and will never, ever think about this again. For a handful of bucks a year, that is a good deal.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="english-version">
                        <p>The dictionary definition of the word “grift” is as follows: “<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/grift">to acquire money or property illicitly</a>”. It may be a strong word, but also more or less encapsulates the regulatory ethos that’s governing cross-border technology businesses these days.</p><p>The TikTok-Oracle deal flaunts this grifting ethos, but it’s just the latest example of a series of haphazard regulatory actions mired in geopolitical brinkmanship -- a trend that may implicate deals with much larger impact, like the pending Nvidia acquisition of Arm.</p><h2 id="tiktok-oracle">TikTok-Oracle</h2><p>There are still many missing details to the TikTok-Oracle deal, and Trump <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tiktok-oracle/trump-raises-questions-about-tiktok-oracle-deal-if-bytedance-ties-remain-idUKKBN2672KD">may not approve the deal</a>. But in the grand scheme of things, many of these details are no longer important, because the spirit of the entire TikTok “soap opera” is cemented: a <strong>regulatory grift </strong>by the Trump administration that enriches its political donor (Larry Ellison), strengthens its campaign message (anti-China, job creation), while doing next to nothing to protect Americans from either intrusive data collection or foreign influence.</p><p>Let’s look at each of these malfeasances.</p><p><strong><em>What Oracle gets.</em></strong> TikTok’s immediate business value accrues to Oracle Cloud to the tune of possibly <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/with-tiktok-deal-oracle-could-gain-billion-dollar-cloud-customer?utm_content=article-4850&amp;utm_campaign=article_email&amp;utm_source=sg&amp;utm_medium=email">$1 billion in annual revenue</a> in the coming years, as it desperately tries to catch up to AWS and Azure. The Oracle brand may also get a boost from this young, cool consumer product, even though Oracle has no experience running such a product. Since I’ve written in detail about TikTok’s business value in “<a href="https://interconnected.blog/what-is-tiktok-worth-to-whom-and-why/"><strong>What is TikTok Worth to Whom and Why?</strong></a>”, I won’t repeat myself here. <strong>One element I did not discuss so explicitly is how valuable TikTok’s user data is to the Oracle data broker business.</strong></p><p>In a nutshell, a data broker sells data to third parties mostly for marketing or advertisement purposes. Oracle’s data broker businesses are euphemistically called <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cx/marketing/">Oracle CX Marketing</a> and <a href="https://www.oracle.com/data-cloud/">Oracle Data Cloud</a>. Having the treasure trove of data that TikTok has already collected is perhaps an even more immediate business boost to Oracle than getting the product’s workload onto its cloud. Ironically (or perhaps appropriately), the person who called out the privacy violations of data brokers like Oracle, Equifax, and others is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-beckerman-9b750a58/"><strong>Michael Berkerman</strong></a><strong>, who is currently TikTok US’s Head of Public Policy</strong>. He did so last year as the then President and CEO of the Internet Association in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/michael-beckerman-why-do-we-need-a-federal-privacy-law-ask-the-data-brokers-selling-your-private-information">an OpEd published on Fox News</a> -- a “media” outlet that the President of the United States most certainly pays attention to. I wonder how long Berkerman will be sticking around, if at all, after the TikTok-Oracle deal closes.</p><p>Lastly, Oracle will likely get a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/58eb7c26-2154-477f-af19-19157ae29261">minority stake in TikTok</a> with ByteDance still being the majority shareholder. This piece of equity in one of the most valuable private tech companies in the world -- trading at a $140 billion valuation in the secondary market earlier this year -- is something that Oracle would have no business getting in a normal investing situation. Not a bad deal <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/oracle-billionaire-larry-ellison-is-fundraising-for-donald-trump-2020-2">for hosting a single fundraiser</a>.</p><p><strong><em>What the Trump campaign gets.</em> </strong>Being more “anti-China” than Biden and going after the Vice President’s son’s business dealings in China has been a messaging tentpole of the Trump re-election campaign. It can now claim credit for acting tough and forcing a marquee Chinese tech company to “surrender” its crown jewel product to America, while accomplishing none of those things, because TikTok’s core technology is staying with ByteDance in China.</p><p>The Oracle bid also apparently includes a “<strong>20,000 new jobs” </strong>commitment -- a typical public relations promise with no legally binding effect. Being “anti”-China while “creating” jobs is a strong one-two punch as we approach the final stretch of the 2020 election season, so much so that Secretary Mnuchin couldn't wait to sell the 20,000 jobs message on CNBC the day after Oracle’s winning bid was made public, <em>even though</em> the deal hasn’t been approved or finalized yet.</p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZPRPswu2Cyc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>TikTok US’s current payroll is about 1,400 people. <strong>That would be an almost 20x increase in headcount.</strong> Theoretically possible? Sure. Practical and sensible? Hardly.</p><p><em><strong>What the American people get.</strong> </em>Nothing, except that they still get to watch cool dance videos and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@rosssmith/video/6797540353730743557">grandmas do this</a> on their phones. We have no new information or answer to any of the three legitimate concerns surrounding TikTok:</p><ul><li>Does it send data to China?</li><li>Is its user data collection practices proper?</li><li>Is it being used as a tool for foreign influence?</li></ul><p>To be clear, there <em>are</em> regulatory tools based on technology at our disposal to answer these questions, <strong>with or without Oracle</strong>. I’ve laid them out in detail in “<a href="https://interconnected.blog/a-framework-to-dis-trust-and-verify-tiktok/"><strong>A Framework to (Dis)trust and Verify TikTok</strong></a>”. Unfortunately, it’s clear as day that the Trump administration is only interested in the political messaging benefits of TikTok-Oracle, not doing the actual work that is required to protect the interests of the American people.</p><p><strong>There is another winner that we should all take note of: <em>Chinese regulators.</em></strong></p><p>Chinese regulators typically use their power to force technology and IP transfers from foreign entities to domestic companies via joint-ventures or outright acquisitions -- <strong>another form of regulatory grift</strong>. This TikTok-Oracle deal is the first time to my knowledge, where Chinese regulators use their power to protect a home-grown technology from being <em>transferred out</em> to a foreign entity.</p><p>This win has just as much to do with exerting their regulatory power as the sucker on the other side of the negotiation table. This dynamic isn’t new, if we look at the failed NXP-Qualcomm acquisition in 2018.</p><h2 id="nxp-qualcomm">NXP-Qualcomm</h2><p>Qualcomm’s attempt to buy the Dutch semiconductor maker, NXP, for $44 billion was abandoned, because it could not get approval from Chinese regulators. This occurred during the previous height of tension when the U.S. and China were tossing retaliatory trade tariffs at each other like a couple of teenage boys in a backyard snowball fight.</p><p>The Chinese regulators did not disapprove of the deal and asked for changes to gain approval, which would’ve been a good faith move. <strong>They just ignored it and let the deadline pass.</strong> This is after Secretary Mnuchin and his Commerce Department counterpart, Wilbur Ross, lobbied the Chinese Vice Minister, Liu He, and Ambassador to the US, Cui Tiankai, to approve the deal. The backdrop of this lobbying was Trump easing the penalties on the Chinese telecom equipment maker, ZTE, for violating U.S. sanction rules with regard to Iran and North Korea -- hoping for some reciprocity and dealmaking.</p><p>This foolish hope did not pan out. Instead, Qualcomm, America’s national champion in the race to 5G, had to fork up a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/qualcomm-plans-to-abandon-nxp-deal-1532549728">$2 billion cancellation fee to NXP and increase its stock buyback program from $10 to $30 billion</a> to appease its shareholders. What’s more, this turn of events showed Chinese regulators that given the <strong>interconnected nature of the global economy</strong>, particularly technology businesses, they have far-reaching authority and leverage to shape deals, events, and technology acquisition vis-a-vis <strong>a tough-talking, weak-acting </strong>Trump administration. It is a key reversal in fortune, when a large swath of China’s technology sector, particularly Huawei, has been hammered by U.S. sanctions.</p><p>Qualcomm-NXP was a defensive play -- not approving a deal. TikTok-Oracle is a proactive play -- not losing control of domestic technology. <strong>There’s now an opportunity for even more aggressive “regulatory grift”: Arm-Nvidia.</strong></p><h2 id="arm-nvidia">Arm-Nvidia</h2><p>It’s hard to comprehend the long-term impact that Nvidia’s $40 billion acquisition of Arm will have on the future of technology. One thing is certain though: it’s way more important than TikTok and Oracle, separately and combined.</p><p>We shouldn’t assume the Arm-Nvidia deal will be closed as expected given all the corporate governance issues with Arm’s China operation. Arm China’s CEO, Allen Wu, has been fired by the board for various acts of conflicts of interest and double dealing, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/arms-fired-china-jv-head-refuses-to-leave-company-reps-banned-from-company-premises/">yet refuses to leave</a>. Arm’s CEO, Simon Segars, is trying to assure the public that the mess <a href="https://www.yicaiglobal.com/news/chip-designer-arm-to-solve-chinese-jv-management-issue-before-nvidia-buyout">will be cleaned up </a>in order to not endanger the sale, but he’s not in a position of leverage, now that the deal is public and the expectations are high. (Nvidia’s market cap increased by $17.5 billion the day after the deal was announced.)</p><p>Furthermore, the Arm China division is a joint-venture where 51% of the entity is owned by a consortium of these three funds:</p><ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Investment_Corporation">China Investment Corporation</a> (China’s sovereign wealth fund)</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_Fund">Silk Road Fund</a> (a state-owned fund focused on projects related to the Belt &amp; Road Initiative)</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temasek_Holdings">Temasek Holding</a> (Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund)</li></ul><p>The other 49% is owned by Softbank via Arm. The joint venture structure is par for the course for any foreign technology company doing business in China. But such a tight ownership by state-owned funds means Chinese regulators (and Singaporean regulators for that matter) have strong jurisdictional power over the deal from the get-go. NXP-Qualcomm’s legal hook was a tenuous nexus. TikTok-Oracle’s hook was established by <a href="https://en.pingwest.com/a/7657">an eleventh hour change</a> to the government’s technology “entity list”. Arm-Nvidia doesn’t need any extra work for regulators to aggressively insert themselves into the picture.</p><p>What will the Chinese regulators do is hard to tell at this moment. However, given the fact that Arm’s chip design IP has a 95% global market share in mobile devices and is <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/aws-graviton2-what-it-means-for-arm-in-the-data-center-cloud-enterprise-aws/">making inroads into cloud data centers</a> as well, <strong>it’s likely that China will either veto the deal (like NXP-Qualcomm) or try to keep any semiconductor IP that Arm China has even a tangential connection to</strong>. Some Chinese tech media <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/W8nhj6udDTdr54ui7_0RIQ">are already speculating about a veto</a>. Using this opportunity to acquire some key technology also makes sense, because by <em>not</em> doing so, China runs the monumental risk of having the entire Arm ecosystem be subject to U.S. sanctions after it becomes a property of Nvidia. An “<strong>Arm sanction</strong>” would cripple China’s entire mobile technology sector, where domestic chip design options barely exist and the open source option, RISC-V, still …</p></div></div>

                  <p><em>The tech executive turned data justice warrior is celebrated as a truth-telling hero, but there’s something a bit too smooth about this narrative arc.</em></p><div><p><img src="https://conversationalist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Tristan-Harris.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://conversationalist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Tristan-Harris.jpg 799w, https://conversationalist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Tristan-Harris-300x200.jpg 300w, https://conversationalist.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Tristan-Harris-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></p><p><span>Credit: Stuart Isett/Fortune</span><span></span></p></div>
<p>A few months ago, I was contacted by a senior executive who was about to leave a marketing firm. He got in touch because I’ve worked on the non-profit side of tech for a long time, with lots of volunteering on digital and human rights. He wanted to ‘give back’. Could I put him in touch with digital rights activists? Sure. We met for coffee and I made some introductions. It was a perfectly lovely interaction with a perfectly lovely man. Perhaps he will do some good, sharing his expertise with the people working to save democracy and our private lives from the surveillance capitalism machine of his former employers. The way I rationalized helping him was: firstly, it’s nice to be nice; and secondly, movements are made of people who start off far apart but converge on a destination. And isn’t it an unqualified good when an insider decides to do the right thing, however late?</p>
<p>The Prodigal Son is a New Testament parable about two sons. One stays home to work the farm. The other cashes in his inheritance and gambles it away. When the gambler comes home, his father slaughters the fattened calf to celebrate, leaving the virtuous, hard-working brother to complain that all these years he wasn’t even given a small goat to share with his friends. His father replies that the prodigal son ‘was dead, now he’s alive; lost, now he’s found’. Cue party streamers. It’s a touching story of redemption, with a massive payload of moral hazard. It’s about coming home, saying sorry, being joyfully forgiven and starting again. Most of us would love to star in it, but few of us will be given the chance.</p>
<p>The Prodigal Tech Bro is a similar story, about tech executives who experience a sort of religious awakening. They suddenly see their former employers as toxic, and reinvent themselves as experts on taming the tech giants. They were lost and are now found. They are warmly welcomed home to the center of our discourse with invitations to write opeds for major newspapers, for think tank funding, book deals and TED talks. These guys – and yes, they are all guys – are generally thoughtful and well-meaning, and I wish them well. But I question why they seize so much attention and are awarded scarce resources, and why they’re given not just a second chance, but also the mantle of moral and expert authority.</p>
<p>I’m glad that Roger McNamee, the early Facebook investor, has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/29/rebecca-solnit-younger-feminists-shift-understanding-give-new-tools">testified to the U.S. Congress</a> about Facebook’s wildly self-interested near-silence about its amplification of Russian disinformation during the 2016 presidential election. I’m thrilled that Google’s ex-‘design ethicist’, Tristan Harris, “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/29/rebecca-solnit-younger-feminists-shift-understanding-give-new-tools">the </a><em>closest thing Silicon Valley has to a conscience,</em>“(startlingly faint praise) now runs a Center for Humane Technology, exposing the mind-hacking tricks of his former employer. I even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hSrUaSNFSY&amp;t=2309s">spoke</a> —critically but, I hope, warmly—at the book launch of James Williams, another ex-Googler turned attention evangelist, who “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Humane_Technology">co-founded the movement</a>”of awareness of designed-in addiction. I wish all these guys well. I also wish that the many, exhausted activists who didn’t take money from Google or Facebook could have even a quarter of the attention, status and authority the Prodigal Techbro assumes is his birth-right.</p>
<p>Today, when the tide of public opinion on Big Tech is finally turning, the brothers (and sisters) who worked hard in the field all those years aren’t even invited to the party. No fattened calf for you, my all but unemployable tech activist. The moral hazard is clear; why would anyone do the right thing from the beginning when they can take the money, have their fun, and then, when the wind changes, convert their status and relative wealth into special pleading and a whole new career?</p>
<p>Just half an hour flipping through my contacts produced half a dozen friends and acquaintances who didn’t require a ‘road to Damascus’ conversion to see what was wrong with big tech or the ways governments abuse it. Nighat Dad runs the <a href="https://digitalrightsfoundation.pk/">Digital Rights Foundation in Pakistan</a>, defending online freedom of expression and privacy for women, minorities and dissidents. That’s real courage. <a href="https://privacyinternational.org/people/95/gus-hosein">Gus Hosein</a> has worked in tech and human rights for over 20 years, runs Privacy International, the UK-based non-profit, and is the most visionary thinker I know on how to shake up our assumptions about why things are as they are.&nbsp; <a href="https://biancawylie.com/">Bianca Wylie </a>founded the volunteer-run Open Data Institute Toronto, and works on open data, citizen privacy and civic engagement. The “<a href="https://www.citylab.com/life/2018/12/bianca-wylie-interview-toronto-quayside-protest-criticism/574477/">Jane Jacobs of the Smart Cities Age</a>,” she’s been a key figure in opening up and slowing down Alphabet’s Sidewalk Labs juggernaut in Toronto. Aral Balkan runs <a href="https://small-tech.org/">Small Technology Foundation </a>and works on both the tools and the policies to resist surveillance capitalism. Unafraid of being unpopular, even with other activists, Balkan freely hammers rights organizations or conferences for taking big tech’s sponsorship money while criticizing the companies’ practices. In the western Balkans, <a href="https://hvale.me/">hvale vale</a><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"></a> works tirelessly and cheerfully on women’s rights, sexual rights and the political and practical path to a feminist internet. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Gross">Robin Gross</a>, &nbsp;a Californian intellectual property lawyer, could have put her persistence and sheer pizazz to work defending big entertainment companies, but instead she’s worked for decades against the copyright maximalism that strangles artists’ creativity and does nothing to increase their incomes. I would love to hear their voices amplified, not (just) the voices of those who took a decade and more to work out the rottenness at the core of big tech.</p>
<p>Ex-Google lobbyist Ross Lajeunesse left the company in 2019 over its censored search engine for China and also because of homophobic, sexist and racist work practices. He’s now running for a Democratic senate nomination, and recently wrote a classic of the ‘scales have fallen from my eyes’ genre, called “I Was Google’s Head of International Relations. <a href="https://medium.com/@rossformaine/i-was-googles-head-of-international-relations-here-s-why-i-left-49313d23065">Here’s Why I Left</a>.” Its lede is <em>“The company’s motto used to be “Don’t be evil.” Things have changed.”</em></p>
<p>Really? Has Google really changed? Lajeunesse joined in 2008, years into Google’s multi-billion dollar <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2010-10-21/google-2-4-rate-shows-how-60-billion-u-s-revenue-lost-to-tax-loopholes">tax avoidance</a>, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/google-hit-with-job-discrimination-lawsuit/">sexist labor practices</a> and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6740075.stm">privacy hostility</a> and continued to work there through the years of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40406542">antitrust fines</a>, misuse of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-40406542">personal health data</a>, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/judge-rejects-324-5m-wage-fixing-settlement-struck-by-apple-google-others/">wage fixing</a>, and financially <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/30/us/politics/eric-schmidt-google-new-america.html">pressuring think tanks</a>. Google didn’t change. It just started treating some of its insiders like it already treated outsiders. That only looks like radical change if you’ve never thought too hard about what you are doing and to whom.</p>
<p>One hundred thousand people work for Google/Alphabet; some of them have much more power than others. The point isn’t whether Lajeunesse is or isn’t culpable for the many acts of the enormous company he represented—as its chief lobbyist in Asia for several years—it’s that of all the people who spent the decade of 2010-20 working thanklessly to expose and reduce the firm’s monopolistic abuse and assault on global privacy, it’s the ex-lobbyist who gets our attention now.</p>
<p>We all need second chances. Even if we don’t need those fresh starts ourselves, we want to live in a world where people have a reason to do better. But the prodigal tech bro’s redemption arc is so quick and smooth it’s barely a road bump. That’s because we keep skipping the most important part of the prodigal son story—where he hits rock bottom. In the original parable, the prodigal son wakes up in a pig sty, starving, and realizes his father’s servants now live better than he does. He resolves to go home to the people and place he did not value or respect before. He will beg to be one of his father’s servants. He accepts his complete loss of status. But instead of chastising and punishing his prodigal son, the rejoicing father greets him joyfully and heads off the apology with a huge party. It’s a great metaphor for how to run a religion, but a lousy way to run everything else.</p>
<p>Prodigal tech bro stories skip straight from the past, when they were part of something that—surprise!—turned out to be bad, to the present, where they are now a moral authority on how to do good, but without the transitional moments of revelation and remorse. &nbsp;But the bit where you say you got things wrong and people were hurt? That’s the most important part. It’s why these corporatized reinventions feel so slick and tinny, and why so many of the comments on Lajeunesse’s <a href="https://medium.com/@rossformaine/i-was-googles-head-of-international-relations-here-s-why-i-left-49313d23065">train wreck post</a> on Medium were critical. The journey feels fake. These ‘I was lost but now I’m found, please come to my TED talk’ accounts typically miss most of the actual journey, yet claim the moral authority of one who’s ‘been there’ but came back. It’s a teleportation machine, but for ethics.</p>
<p>(While we’re thinking about the neatly elided parts of the prodigal tech bro story, let’s dwell for one moment on the deletion of the entire stories of so many women and people of color barely given a first chance in Silicon Valley, let alone multiple reinventions.)</p>
<p>The only thing more fungible than cold, hard cash is privilege. The prodigal tech bro doesn’t so much take an off-ramp from the relatively high status and well-paid job he left when the scales fell from his eyes, as zoom up an on-ramp into a new sector that accepts the reputational currency he has accumulated. He’s not joining the resistance. He’s launching a new kind of start-up using his industry contacts for seed-funding in return for some reputation-laundering.</p>
<p>So what? Sure, it’s a little galling, but where’s the harm?</p>
<p>Allowing people who share responsibility for our tech dystopia to keep control of the narrative means we never get to the bottom of how and why we got here, and we artificially narrow the possibilities for where we go next. And centering people who were insiders before and claim to be leading the outsiders …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemprop="articleBody"> <p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: This post explains portions of two protobufs used by Apple, one for the Note format itself and another for embedded objects. More importantly, it explains how you can figure out the structure of protobufs.</p> <!--more--> <h2 id="background">Background</h2> <p>Previous entries in this series covered how to deal with <a href="https://ciofecaforensics.com/2020/01/10/apple-notes-revisited/">Apple Notes</a> and the <a href="https://ciofecaforensics.com/2020/01/13/apple-notes-revisited-easy-embedded-objects/">embedded objects</a> in them, including <a href="https://ciofecaforensics.com/2020/01/14/apple-notes-revisited-embedded-tables/">embedded tables</a> and <a href="https://ciofecaforensics.com/2020/01/20/apple-notes-revisited-galleries/">galleries</a>. Throughout these posts, I have referred to the fact that Apple uses protocol buffers (protobufs) to store the information for both notes and the embedded objects within them. What I have not yet done is actually provide the .proto file that was used to generate the Ruby output, or explained how you can develop the same on your app of interest. If you only care about the first part of that, you can view the <a href="https://github.com/threeplanetssoftware/apple_cloud_notes_parser/blob/master/proto/notestore.proto">.proto file</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/threeplanetssoftware/apple_cloud_notes_parser/blob/master/proto/protobuf_config.py">config</a> I use for <a href="https://github.com/jmendeth/protobuf-inspector">protobuf-inspector</a>. Both of these files are just a start to pull out the important parts for processing and can certainly be improved.</p> <p>As with previous entries, I want to make sure I give credit where it is due. After pulling apart the Note protobuf and while I was trying to figure out the table protobuf, I came across <a href="https://github.com/dunhamsteve">dunhamsteve’s</a> work. As a result, I went back and modified some of my naming to better align to what he had <a href="https://github.com/dunhamsteve/notesutils/blob/master/notes.md">published</a> and added in some fields like version which I did not have the data to discover.</p> <h2 id="what-is-a-protocol-buffer">What is a Protocol Buffer?</h2> <p>To quote directly from <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">the source</a>,</p> <blockquote> <p>Protocol buffers are Google’s language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data – think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler. You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages.</p> </blockquote> <p>What does that mean? It means a protocol buffer is a way you can write a specification for your data and use it in many projects and languages with one command. The end result is source code for whatever language you are writing in. For example, <a href="https://github.com/sballin/alfred-search-notes-app/blob/master/search/proto/notestore.pb.go">Sean Ballinger’s Alfred Search Notes App</a> used my <code>notestore.proto</code> file to compile to Go instead of Ruby to interact with Notes on MacOS. When you use it in your program, the data which you save will be a raw data stream which won’t look like much, but will be intelligable to any code with that protobuf definition.</p> <p>The definition is generally a <code>.proto</code> file which would look something like:</p> <figure><pre><code data-lang="protobuf"><span>syntax</span> <span>=</span> <span>"proto2"</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Represents an attachment (embedded object)</span>
<span>message</span> <span>AttachmentInfo</span> <span>{</span>
   <span>optional</span> <span>string</span> <span>attachment_identifier</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
   <span>optional</span> <span>string</span> <span>type_uti</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure> <p>This definition would have just one message type (AttachmentInfo), with two fields (attachment_identifier and type_uti), both optional. This is using the <code>proto2</code> syntax.</p> <h2 id="why-care-about-protobufs">Why Care About Protobufs</h2> <p>Protobufs are everywhere, especially if you happen to be working with or looking at Google-based systems, such as Android. Apple also uses a lot of them in iOS, and for people that have to support both operating systems, using a protobuf makes the pain of maintaining two different code bases slightly less annoying because you can compile the same definition to different languages. If you are in forensics, you may come across something that looks like it isn’t plaintext and discover that you’re actually looking at a protobuf. When it comes specifically to Apple Notes, protobufs are used both for the Note itself and the attachments.</p> <h2 id="how-to-use-a-proto-file">How to Use a .proto file</h2> <p>Assuming you have a <code>.proto</code> file, either from building one yourself or from finding one from your favorite application, you can compile it to your target language using <a href="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases">protoc</a>. The resulting file can then be included in your project using whatever that language’s include statement is to create the necessary classes for the data. For example, when writing Apple Cloud Notes Parser in Ruby, I used <code>protoc --ruby_out=. ./proto/notestore.proto</code> to compile it and then <code>require_relative 'notestore_pb.rb'</code> in my code to include it.</p> <p>If I wanted instead to add in support for python, I would only have to make this change: <code>protoc --ruby_out=. --python_out=. ./proto/notestore.proto</code></p> <h2 id="how-can-you-find-a-protobuf-definition-file">How Can You Find a Protobuf Definition File?</h2> <p>If you come up against a protobuf in an application you are looking at, you might be able to find the <code>.proto</code> protobuf definition file in the application itself or somewhere on the forensic image. I ended up going through an iOS 13 forensic image earlier this year and found that Apple still had some of theirs on disk:</p> <figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>[</span>notta@cuppa iOS13_logical]<span>$ </span>find | <span>grep</span> <span>'\.proto$'</span>
./System/Library/Frameworks/MultipeerConnectivity.framework/MultipeerConnectivity.proto
./System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ActivityAchievements.framework/ActivityAchievementsBackCompat.proto
./System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ActivityAchievements.framework/ActivityAchievements.proto
./System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CoreLocationProtobuf.framework/Support/Harvest/CLPCollectionRequest.proto
./System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ActivitySharing.framework/ActivitySharingDatabaseCodables.proto
./System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ActivitySharing.framework/ActivitySharingDomainCodables.proto
./System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ActivitySharing.framework/ActivitySharingInvitationCodables.proto

./System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/HealthDaemon.framework/Statistics.proto
./System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/AVConference.framework/VCCallInfoBlob.proto
./System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/AVConference.framework/captions.proto</code></pre></figure> <p>Some of these are <em>really</em> interesting when you look at them, particularly if you care about their location data and pairing. You don’t even have to have an iOS forensic image sitting around as all of the same files are included in your copy of MacOS 10.15.6, as well, if you run <code>sudo find /System/ -iname "*.proto"</code>. I am not including any interesting snippets of those because they are copyrighted by Apple and I would explicitly note that none are related to Apple Notes or the contents of this post.</p> <p>In general, you should not expect to find these definitions sitting around since the definition file isn’t needed once the code is generated. For more open source applications, you might be interested in some <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ext%3Aproto++AND+inurl%3Aproto+AND+message+AND+proto2">Google Dorks</a>, especially when looking at Android artifacts, as you might still find them.</p> <h2 id="how-can-you-rebuild-the-protobuf">How Can You Rebuild The Protobuf?</h2> <p>But what if you can’t find the definition file, how can you rebuild it yourself? This was the most interesting part of rewriting Apple Cloud Notes Parser as I had no knowledge of how Apple typically represents data, nor protobufs, so it was a fun learning adventure.</p> <p>If you have nothing else, the <code>protoc --decode-raw</code> command can give you an intial look at what is in the data, however this amounts to not much more than pretty printing a JSON object, it doesn’t do a great job of telling you you what might be in there. I made heavy use of mildsunrise’s <a href="https://github.com/mildsunrise/protobuf-inspector">protobuf-inspector</a> which at least makes an attempt to tell you what you might be looking at. Another benefit to using this is that it lets you incrementally build up your own definition by editing a file named <code>protobuf_config.py</code> in the protobuf-insepctor folder.</p> <p>For example, below is the output from protobuf-inspector when I ran it on the Gunzipped contents of one of the first notes in my test database.</p> <figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>[</span><span>notta</span><span>@</span><span>cuppa</span> <span>protobuf</span><span>-</span><span>inspector</span><span>]</span><span>$</span> <span>python3</span> <span>main</span><span>.</span><span>py</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>~/</span><span>note_18</span><span>.</span><span>blob</span>

  <p>Neobanks are on a tear and users are loving them. Neobanks are online-only banks, typically funded by venture capital, that piggy-back on top of an existing institution’s banking license and offer a way for customers to store/spend money. Examples include Revolut, Nubank, Chime, Simple, N26, and more. They have a real shot at becoming the mainstream banking choice for customers over the next decade. Nubank, the most popular neobank in Brazil, recently <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nubank-brazil-growth/brazilian-fintech-nubank-has-grown-to-15-million-users-ceo-idUSKBN1WQ26C" target="_blank">announced</a> that they have 15 million customers. For reference, Wells Fargo has <a href="https://google.com/" target="_blank">22 million active users</a> on its mobile app. Neobanks are a rising force and key in understanding where the financial services industry is headed.</p>

<p>But how do these neobanks make money? The imprecise answer of “they make money when you swipe their card” doesn’t tell you much. In this post, I’ll concretely show how the mechanics of a neobank’s business model works.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at <a href="https://www.chime.com/" target="_blank">Chime</a>, the largest consumer neobank in the US. Chime’s core offering is a debit card alongside checking and savings accounts. They have nifty features like the ability to receive your paycheck two days early, no overdraft fees, and 100% mobile banking. With 60% of Americans not being able to cover a surprise $1,000 expense, a 2-day advance on a paycheck can be a huge relief for managing expenses. And the nixing of overdraft fees is a massive help for the <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/banking/2018/banking-overdraft-fees-cfbp-credit-unions/" target="_blank">US consumers paying a mind-boggling $34 billion/year</a> in overdraft fees. These differentiated features have led to Chime amassing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/04/chime-now-has-5-million-customers-and-introduces-overdraft-alternative/" target="_blank">5 million customers</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chime-set-to-quadruple-revenue-in-2019-2019-11" target="_blank">$200 million in annualized revenue</a>.</p>

<p><strong>A neobank like Chime primarily makes money in two ways:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Interchange revenue paid by payment processors (e.g., Stripe) when they process a payment for a Chime card</li>
  <li>Collecting interest from users’ deposits</li>
</ol>

<p>Although some neobanks have different revenue streams (e.g., Wealthfront charges users roboadvisor fees as a percentage of the total value of assets stored with them), interchange and deposits interest are the two largest and most common revenue streams for neobanks. These are also some of the largest revenue streams for big banks (lending though typically being the largest).</p>

<h3 id="interchange"><strong>Interchange</strong></h3>

<p>Interchange revenue is money that a card issuer (such as Chime) receives when someone swipes their card. Interchange is paid by the merchant through payment processing fees. The merchant is the party accepting a card payment in return for goods/services (e.g., your local supermarket). As an example, if a merchant uses <a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank">Stripe</a> for payment processing and is paying the standard <a href="https://stripe.com/pricing" target="_blank">2.9%</a> in transaction fees, Stripe will use a portion of that 2.9% to pay the card issuer.</p>

<p>Image Credit: <a href="https://www.helcim.com/article/how-credit-card-processing-works/" target="_blank">Helcim</a></p>

<p>The specific amount paid to the card issuer depends on a number of factors and it varies for every transaction. The most important factors are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Whether the card is debit or credit
    <ul>
      <li>Credit is significantly higher interchange</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Whether the card has specific rewards/perks
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://usa.visa.com/pay-with-visa/cards/visa-credit-cards/visa-infinite-credit-cards.html" target="_blank">Visa Infinite</a> (many rewards/perks) has a higher interchange rate than the standard Visa card</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The type of the merchant for a given transaction
    <ul>
      <li>Hotels have some of the highest interchange rates</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Ultimately the card network (e.g., Visa) decides what the interchange rates are. The key equation for an interchange revenue stream is:</p>

<p><i>avg. interchange rate * total transaction volume</i></p>

<p>In Chime’s case, their cards are on the Visa network so Visa decides how much interchange they receive. The Visa interchange rates, along with Chime’s specific rates, are <a href="https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/download/merchants/visa-usa-interchange-reimbursement-fees.pdf" target="_blank">public</a> <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. Depending on the type of merchant and transaction, Chime earns between 0.8% - 1.9% of a transaction’s amount, Although it’s impossible to know the exact amount of interchange Chime receives without knowing the distribution of Chime users’ spending, a reasonable guess based on aggregate consumer spending would put Chime’s average interchange rate at 1.25%<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. This means that Chime receives around 1.25% of _all spending on their cards_. Not bad! There are still a handful of costs that Chime has to pay per transaction:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Intermediary card processors
    <ul>
      <li>Example: Chime uses <a href="https://www.galileo-ft.com/" target="_blank">Galileo</a>, which likely charges them anywhere from 0.05% - 0.4% of transaction volume</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Fraud: if a customer loses their card and a thief spends money on it, Chime may have to cover the cost
    <ul>
      <li>Note: keep in mind that since Chime is offering debit cards, not credit cards, there is no risk of the customer not paying back Chime for transactions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Server costs: the server that has to process a transaction</li>
</ul>

<p>Even with these costs, Chime is still making a handsome profit per transaction. Being the card issuer, as they are here, is a very high-margin business.</p>

<h3 id="deposits-interest"><strong>Deposits Interest</strong></h3>

<p>Interest revenue is earned by a depository institution investing customer funds in low-risk securities. The depository institution typically also pays the customer for keeping their deposits at the institution. The key equation for profitability of this revenue stream is:</p>

<p><i>(% interest earned - % interest paid to depositor) * deposits amount</i></p>

<p>The <em>% interest earned</em> for neobanks is typically equal to the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS" target="_blank">effective federal funds rate</a>. Because the federal funds rate is constantly shifting, the profitability of this revenue stream for neobanks is constantly shifting. This is why neobanks frequently change the interest rate offered to depositors (see <a href="https://blog.wealthfront.com/category/product-news/" target="_blank">Wealthfront’s blog</a> as an example). This is a stark contrast to big banks however. A key benefit of a banking charter is that banks can lend out a multiple of their deposits as loans (e.g., mortgages, business loans). This amount is referred to as net interest margin, and is typically much higher than the federal funds rate - <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/061715/what-net-interest-margin-typical-bank.asp" target="_blank">it was 3.3% on average for banks in 2018</a>. The _% interest paid to depositor* is how much the depositor earns by storing their funds with the institution, and is set by the depository institution. For the recent wave of high-yield accounts offered by neobanks, they’ve set <em>% interest paid to depositor</em> essentially equal to *% interest earned_, making this revenue stream’s profitability close to zero. The typical rationale is for the high-yield account to draw in consumers for other higher-margin products such as debit/credit cards or loans.</p>

<p>In Chime’s case, <em>% interest earned</em> (the federal funds rate) is 0.09% at the time of writing (Sept. 2020), and <a href="https://chime.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/221487887-What-do-I-need-to-know-about-the-Chime-Savings-Account-" target="_blank"><em>% interest paid to depositor</em></a> is 1.00%. This means that Chime is actually losing money on their deposit account product, and likely using it as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_leader" target="_blank">loss leader</a> for the debit card, which has far higher profit margins. Also note that Chime only gives depositors 1% in interest for funds in their savings account. For any funds in the checking account (which over all customers may be larger), no interest is given.</p>

<p>These are the two main revenue streams for the majority of neobanks, but there are also others such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-selling" target="_blank">cross-selling</a>, <a href="https://www.svmcards.com/" target="_blank">reward redemption referrals</a>, and new ones being created by startups. Hopefully this has given you a grasp of the basics, let me know if you have any thoughts/questions below!</p>

A FAST installation experience (with the ability to use templates!)</strong></h4><p>The first thing that caught my attention when I first came across and used Gatsby for the first time was just how easy it was to get something up and running.&nbsp;</p><p>A simple installation of the Gatsby CLI 'npm install -g gatsby-cli', followed by a Gatsby creation command that pulled from any relevant repo I wanted (<strong>as a template</strong>) 'gatsby&nbsp;new&nbsp;my-tailwind-starter&nbsp;https://github.com/PlanFlowDev/Simplicity-Itself-Gatsby-Tailwind-Starter-Theme', was enough to get me a project setup. Once installed, to run it, all I had to do was run ‘gatsby develop’ within my project directory.&nbsp;</p><p>Everything just worked. And I was ready to go quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>The ability to get up and running quickly with a template was key to making this experience both unique and very satisfying.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of UX, having to ‘start from scratch’ is one of the worst, yet mostly unknown UX mistakes that most new technologies make when trying to attract new users.&nbsp;</p><p>The more you can reduce the overhead to getting the user to a <a target="_blank" title="Kathy Sierra - Badass - Making Users Awesome" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fpHYm6kTik">satisfied state of ‘having something’,</a> the better adoption rates you’ll see.&nbsp;</p><p>Gatsby’s fast installation with the ability (even encouragement) to use a template, does this well.</p><h4><strong>2. A fast-growing ecosystem (plugins and themes)</strong></h4><p>Getting up and running with new technology is always a situation that requires learning and the use of additional resources, to help make the integration process easier, both mentally and with the technology itself.</p><p>The size and activity of the ecosystem that supports and underpins a technology is key to assisting rapid adoption and a positive experience for the users.</p><p>The momentum that an active and growing community also makes people very forgiving of errors and mishaps with the technology, which are inevitable, and keeps the plugins, themes, and projects coming because people can usually find solutions (ie. via StackOverflow or Reddit) to their problems as they’re building.</p><p>Gatsby, of all the Front End Frameworks I’ve seen, especially for building static sites, has the best community.</p><h4><strong>3. Easy to read documentation</strong></h4><p>When you find yourself on the documentation page of the technology you’re using more often than other sources (very common in web dev), you can be sure that that technology has pretty good documentation. Usually, there are many alternatives to technology’s own official docs for most use cases (StackOverflow being one big one). Finding yourself on the official docs more often than not is a good sign.</p><p>I find Gatsby’s docs a lot better than the docs I’ve found in a few other Front End Frameworks.&nbsp;</p><p>Gatsby docs are a lot less jargon-filled and easier to parse. This, even when you are a developer who can understand the jargon, is a massive benefit.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>4. A unique design aesthetic that stands out</strong></h4><p>Most frameworks have forgettable designs.</p><p>My guess is that this is partly down to the developer’s focus on how it works rather than how it looks.</p><p>Gatsby seems to take a different approach. It’s hard to forget Gatsby’s big purple G once you see it, along with its overall very well designed and consistent website design and general branding.&nbsp;</p><p>This is bigger than people think when it comes to user adoption (which is the most important UX consideration for new technologies), particularly within the front end development space, where the overlap of design and development is only becoming more obvious.</p><p>Gatsby is the clear winner in this space.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>5. Strong alignments (bundling) with other key, fast-growing technologies (GraphQL, ReactJS)</strong></h4><p>Since the beginning of the software industry, bundling has been a key method of growing the market share of individual pieces of software. For the most part, software needs a lot of other parts to work functionally, so the logic behind also selling them together conceptually is a natural extension.&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft, the largest software company in the world, became (in a <a target="_blank" title="https://www.ozy.com/true-and-stories/the-agreement-that-catapulted-microsoft-over-ibm/94437/" href="https://www.ozy.com/true-and-stories/the-agreement-that-catapulted-microsoft-over-ibm/94437/">now infamous</a> deal) what it is today by bundling its MS-Dos operating system with an early IBM desktop machine.</p><p>Apple’s launch of the iPhone, and its eventual dominance in the market was largely fueled by its bundling of its phone with the millions of applications that developers ultimately filled within their app store.&nbsp;</p><p>Within the Front End Framework space, Gatsby has done a very good job of bundling itself with GraphQL. Most searches of GraphQL on Google and YouTube very often pull up a Gatsby related tutorial, which means that in some small way, they are beginning to become synonymous. Even more so than other frameworks have managed to so far.</p><p>Gatsby’s close association with the React community has also done a lot to propel its position within the Front End Framework space.</p><h4><strong>UX Determines Adoption, Adoption Determines Success</strong></h4><p>Ultimately, among the many Front End Frameworks that exist, Gatsby is built in the right way to succeed. Having hit a lot of the key UX points outlined above, it is the choice I’d most highly recommend for a Front End Developer looking for the right framework to use for your next project.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>Dear Android users, if you use the Firefox web browser on your smartphones, make sure it has been updated to version 80 or the latest available version on the Google Play Store.</p>

<p>ESET security researcher Lukas Stefanko yesterday&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/LukasStefanko/status/1307013106615418883" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>&nbsp;an alert demonstrating the exploitation of a recently disclosed high-risk remote command execution vulnerability affecting the Firefox app for Android.</p>

<p>Discovered originally by Australian security researcher&nbsp;<a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-operations/gl-redteam/red-team-tech-notes/-/tree/master/firefox-android-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Moberly</a>, the vulnerability resides in the SSDP engine of the browser that can be exploited by an attacker to target Android smartphones connected to the same Wi-Fi network as the attacker, with Firefox app installed.</p>
<p>SSDP, stands for Simple Service Discovery Protocol, is a UDP based protocol that is a part of UPnP for finding other devices on a network. In Android, Firefox periodically sends out SSDP discovery messages to other devices connected to the same network, looking for second-screen devices to cast.</p>
<p>Any device on the local network can respond to these broadcasts and provide a location to obtain detailed information on a UPnP device, after which, Firefox attempts to access that location, expecting to find an XML file conforming to the UPnP specifications.</p>

<p>According to the vulnerability report Moberly submitted to the Firefox team, the SSDP engine of the victims’ Firefox browsers can be tricked into triggering an Android intent by simply replacing location of the XML file in the response packets with a specially crafted message pointing to an Android intent URI.</p>
<p>For this, an attacker connected to a targeted Wi-Fi network can run a malicious SSDP server on his/her device and trigger intent-based commands on nearby Android devices through Firefox—without requiring any interaction from the victims.</p>
<p>Activities allowed by the intent also includes automatically launching the browser and open any defined URL, which, according to the researchers, is sufficient to trick victims into providing their credentials, install malicious apps, and other malicious activities based on the surrounding scenarios.</p>
<p>“The target simply has to have the Firefox application running on their phone. They do not need to access any malicious websites or click any malicious links. No attacker-in-the-middle or malicious app installation is required. They can simply be sipping coffee while on a cafe’s Wi-Fi, and their device will start launching application URIs under the attacker’s control,” Moberly said.</p>

<p>“it could have been used in a way similar to phishing attacks where a malicious site is forced onto the target without their knowledge in the hopes they would enter some sensitive info or agree to install a malicious application.”</p>
<p>Moberly reported this vulnerability to the Firefox team a few weeks back, which the browser maker has now patched in the Firefox for Android versions 80 and later.</p>
<p>Moberly has also released a&nbsp;<a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-operations/gl-redteam/red-team-tech-notes/-/blob/master/firefox-android-2020/ffssdp.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proof-of-concept exploit</a>&nbsp;to the public that Stefanko used to demonstrate the issue in the above video against three devices connected to the same network.</p>

							<p>A while back I posted a series of articles exploring the scalability of SCons, a popular Python-based build tool.  In a nutshell, my experiments showed that <b>SCons exhibits roughly quadratic growth in build runtimes as the number of targets increases</b>:</p>

<li><a href="http://www.electric-cloud.com/blog/2010/08/11/the-last-word-on-scons-performance/">The last word on SCons performance</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
Recently Dirk Baechle attempted to rebut my findings in an entry on the SCons wiki:  <a href="http://scons.org/wiki/WhySconsIsNotSlow">Why SCons is not slow</a>.  I thought Dirk made some credible suggestions that could explain my results, and he did some smart things in his effort to invalidate my results.  Unfortunately, his methods were flawed and his conclusions are invalid.  My original results still stand: <b>SCons really is slow.</b>  In the sections that follow I’ll share my own updated benchmarks and show where Dirk’s analysis went wrong.</p>
<h3>Test setup</h3>
<p>
As before, I used <a href="https://github.com/emelski/scons_bench/blob/master/genscons.pl">genscons.pl</a> to generate sample builds ranging from 2,000 to 50,000 targets.  However, my test system was much beefier this time:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th></th>
<th>2013</th>
<th>2010</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>OS</th>
<td>Linux Mint 14 (kernel version 3.5.0-17-generic)</td>
<td>RedHat Desktop 3 (kernel version 2.4.21-58.ELsmp)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>CPU</th>
<td>Quad 1.7GHz Intel Core i7, hyperthreaded</td>
<td>Dual 2.4GHz Intel Xeon, hyperthreaded</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>RAM</th>
<td>16 GB</td>
<td>2 GB</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>HD</th>
<td>SSD</td>
<td>(unknown)</td>
</tr><tr>
<th>SCons</th>
<td>2.3.0</td>
<td>1.2.0.r3842</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Python</th>
<td>2.7.3 (system default)</td>
<td>2.6.2</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
Before running the tests, I rebooted the system to ensure there were no rogue processes consuming memory or CPU.  I also forced the CPU cores into “performance” mode to ensure that they ran at their full 1.7GHz speed, rather than at the lower 933MHz they switch to when idle.</p>
<h3>Revisiting the original benchmark</h3>
<p>
I think Dirk had two credible theories to explain the results I obtained in my original tests.  First, Dirk wondered if those results may have been the result of <i>virtual memory swapping</i> — my original test system had relatively little RAM, and SCons itself uses a lot of memory.  It’s plausible that physical memory was exhausted, forcing the OS to swap memory to disk.  As Dirk said, “this would explain the increase of build times” — you bet it would!  I don’t remember seeing any indication of memory swapping when I ran these tests originally, but to be honest it was nearly 4 years ago and perhaps my memory is not reliable.  To eliminate this possibility, I ran the tests on a system with 16 GB RAM this time.  During the tests I ran <span><span face="Courier New">vmstat 5</span></span>, which collects memory and swap usage information at five second intervals, and captured the result in a log.</p>
<p>
Next, he suggested that I skewed the results by directing SCons to inherit the ambient environment, rather than using SCons’ default “sanitized” environment.  That is, he felt I should have used <span><span face="Courier New">env = Environment()</span></span> rather than <span><span face="Courier New">env = Environment(ENV = os.environ)</span></span>.  To ensure that this was not a factor, I modified the tests so that they did not inherit the environment.  At the same time, I substituted <span><span face="Courier New">echo</span></span> for the compiler and other commands, in order to make the tests faster.  Besides, I’m not interested in benchmarking the compiler — just SCons!  Here’s what my <span><span face="Courier New">Environment</span></span> declaration looks like now:</p>
<pre title="">env = Environment(CC = 'echo', AR = 'echo', RANLIB = 'echo')
</pre>
<p>With these changes in place I reran my benchmarks.  As expected, there was no change in the outcome.  There is no doubt:  <b>SCons does <i>not</i> scale linearly</b>.  Instead the growth is <i>polynomial</i>, following an n<sup>1.85</sup> curve.  And thanks to the the <a href="https://github.com/emelski/scons_bench/blob/master/logs/2.3.0/001/50000.vmstat">vmstat output</a> we can be certain that there was absolutely no swapping affecting the benchmarks.  Here’s a graph of the results, including an n<sup>1.85</sup> curve for comparison — notice that you can barely see that curve because it matches the observed data so well!</p>
<p>

<p>
For comparison, I used the SCons build log to make a shell script that executes the same series of <span><span face="Courier New">echo</span></span> commands.  At 50,000 targets, the shell script ran in 1.097s.  You read that right:  <b>1.097s</b>.  Granted, the shell script doesn’t do stuff like up-to-date checks, etc., but still — of the 3,759s average SCons runtime, 3,758s — 99.97% — is SCons overhead.</p>
<p>
I also created a non-recursive Makefile that “builds” the same targets with the same <span><span face="Courier New">echo</span></span> commands.  This is a more realistic comparison to SCons — after all, nobody would dream of actually controlling a build with a straight-line shell script, but lots of people would use GNU make to do it.  With 50,000 targets, GNU make ran for <b>82.469s</b> — more than 45 times faster than SCons.</p>
<h3>What is linear scaling?</h3>
<p>
If the performance problems are so obvious, why did Dirk fail to see them?  Here’s a graph made from his test results:</p>
<p>

<p>
Dirk says that this <a href="http://scons.org/wiki/WhySconsIsNotSlow#Linear_scaling">demonstrates “SCons’ linear scaling”</a>.  I find this statement baffling, because his data clearly shows that <i>SCons does not scale linearly</i>.  It’s simple, really:  <i>linear scaling</i> just means that the build time increases by the same amount for each new target you add, regardless of how many targets you already have.  Put another way, it means that the difference in build time between 1,000 targets and 2,000 targets is <i>exactly the same</i> as the difference between 10,000 and 11,000 targets, or between 30,000 and 31,000 targets.  Or, put yet another way, it means that when you plot the build time versus the number of targets, you should get a straight line with <i>no change in slope at any point</i>.  Now you tell me:  does that describe Dirk’s graph?</p>
<p>
Here’s another version of that graph, this time augmented with a couple additional lines that show what the plot would look like if SCons were truly scaling linearly.  The first projection is based on the original graph from 2,500 to 4,500 targets — that is, if we assume that SCons scales linearly and that the increase in build time between 2,500 and 4,500 targets is representative of the cost to add 2,000 more targets, then this line shows us how we should expect the build time to increase.  Similarly, the second projection is based on the original graph between 4,500 and 8,500 targets.  You can easily see that the actual data does not match either projection.  Furthermore you can see that the slope of these projections is <i>increasing</i>:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://emelski.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/scons_baechle_augmented.png"><img data-attachment-id="1039" data-permalink="https://blog.melski.net/2013/12/11/update-scons-is-still-really-slow/scons_baechle_augmented/#main" data-orig-file="https://emelski.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/scons_baechle_augmented.png" data-orig-size="500,500" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="SCons full build runtime with linear projections, via D.

<p>
This shows the importance of testing at large scale when you’re trying to characterize the scalability of a system from empirical data.  It can be difficult to differentiate polynomial from logarithmic or linear at low scales, especially once you incorporate the constant factors — polynomial algorithms can sometimes even give <i>better</i> absolute performance for small inputs than linear algorithms!  It’s not until you plot enough data points at large enough values, as I’ve done, that it becomes easy to see and identify the curve.</p>
<h3>What does profiling tell us?</h3>
<p>
Next, Dirk reran some of his tests under a profiler, on the very reasonable assumption that if there was a performance problem to be found, it would manifest in the profiling data — surely at least one function would demonstrate a larger-than-expected growth in runtime.  Dirk only shared profiling data for two runs, both incremental builds, at 8,500 and 16,500 targets.  That’s unfortunate for a couple reasons.  First, the performance problem is less apparent on incremental builds than on full builds.  Second, with only two datapoints it is literally not possible to determine whether growth is linear or polynomial.  The results of Dirk’s profiling was negative:  he found no “significant difference or increase” in any function.</p>
<p>
Fortunately it’s easy to run this experiment myself.  Dirk used <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/profile.html">cProfile</a>, which is built-in to Python.  To profile a Python script you can inject cProfile from the command-line, like this: <span><span face="Courier New">python -m cProfile scons</span></span>.  Just before Python exits, cProfile dumps timing data for every function invoked during the run.  I ran several full builds with the profiler enabled, from 2,000 to 20,000 targets.  Then I sorted the profiling data by function internal time (time spent in the function exclusively, not in its descendents).  <i>In every run</i>, the same two functions appeared at the top of the list:  <span><span face="Courier New">posix.waitpid</span></span> and <span><span face="Courier New">posix.fork</span></span>.  To be honest this was a surprise to me — previously I believed the problem was in SCons’ Taskmaster implementation.  But I can’t really argue with the data.  It makes sense that SCons would spend most of its time running and waiting for child processes to execute, and even that the amount of time spent in these functions would increase as the number of child processes increases.  But look at the growth in runtimes in these two functions:</p>

<p>
Like the overall build time, these curves are obviously non-linear.  Armed with this knowledge, I went back to Dirk’s profiling data.  To my surprise, <i>posix.waitpid and posix.fork don’t even appear in Dirk’s data</i>.  On closer inspection, his data seems to include only a subset of all functions — about 600 functions, whereas <a href="https://github.com/emelski/scons_bench/blob/master/logs/2.3.0_profiling/001/20000.prof">my profiling data</a> contains more than 1,500.  I cannot explain this — perhaps Dirk filtered the results to exclude functions that are part of the Python library, assuming that the problem must be in SCons’ own code rather than in the library on which it is built.</p>
<p>
This demonstrates a second fundamental principle of performance analysis:  make sure that you consider <i>all</i> the data.  Programmers’ intuition about performance problems is notoriously bad — even mine! — which is why it’s important to measure before acting.  But measuring won’t help if you’re missing critical data or if you discard part of the data before doing any analysis.</p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>
On the surface, performance analysis seems like it should be simple:  start a timer, run some code, stop the timer.  Done correctly, performance analysis can illuminate the dark corners of your application’s performance.  Done incorrectly — and there are <i>many</i> ways to do it incorrectly — it can lead you on a wild goose chase and cause you to squander resources fixing the wrong problems.</p>
<p>
Dirk Baechle had good intentions when he set out to analyze SCons performance, but he made some mistakes in his process that led him to an erroneous conclusion.  First, he didn’t run enough …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Note:&nbsp;this was originally published at </em><a href="https://alexoppenheimer.substack.com/" target="_blank"><em>https://alexoppenheimer.substack.com/</em></a>‍</p><p>I have been studying the SaaS model in depth for almost 7 years now. Since the day <a href="https://alexoppenheimer.substack.com/p/harry-2d5d1af6bf">Harry Weller</a> walked into my office with a stack of materials and told me to study it and then SaaS build models and bring them to portfolio companies, I don't think a day has gone by where I have not thought about the conceptual and operational nuances of the recurring revenue business model.</p><p>Somewhere around mid 2015 I had my "aha" moment in my research when I tied my academic training in mechanical engineering to the startup business models I was building: it's all calculus. The integral-derivative relationship applies incredibly well to the ARR and Recognized Revenue relationship. Making this connection between engineering math and financial math gave me a feeling that only a true nerd could appreciate: the joy of putting integral symbols and accounting terms on the same slide.</p><p>The simplest way to illustrate this mathematical parallel is with a car:</p><figure id="w-node-2abd43418357-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5f649b33c9e3271323643b3d_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252F42d5ef92-52d9-49fe-8be7-16028bee1ff4_884x306.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>If a car is moving at 60mph, then in one hour it will travel 60 miles (assuming its speed does not change). That is the definition of "miles per hour." ARR is very similar: if a company is "moving" at $10M ARR, then in one year it will recognize $10M of revenue (assuming everything stays consistent). Recognized revenue is the distance, ARR is the speed. It's critical to recognize that ARR is a rate at a specific point in time used to imply something (here, expected recognized revenue in the future period).</p><p>For the more accounting oriented, another analogy can be made to the balance sheet:</p><figure id="w-node-9fc87f218c80-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5f649b3392b0138c4e64006b_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252F6c06ddcc-de3e-4d96-960a-22b4b39e334e_842x455.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>While revenue is the top line metric on the income statement, ARR works more like a balance sheet metric: it is taken at a single point in time rather than over a period of time. This can make income statements confusing and misaligned - another example of the divergence of accounting in economics in subscription businesses.</p><p>Now back to calculus... if the ARR function was actually a mathematical equation, you could integrate it. If y = 10x where y = ARR and x = time in months, then after two months ARR = $20. After 12 months, ARR = $120 (assuming we start from $0 of ARR). So at the end of a year, the business has grown from $0 to $120 in ARR. But what is the recognized revenue? The complex answer is that it's the integral of 10x from 0 to 12 months. (Apologies in advance if this triggers a high school calculus flashback.)</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5f649b337d3c7911d7362b81_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252Ff7fcb57f-644b-490c-bfa8-6d0c986d2fda_305x80.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>You could also chart this out and see that it is a right triangle with the area of 1/2*base*height. Where the base is 12 months and the height is $120: $1,440/2 = $720).</p><p>Pretty cool relationship and calculation conceptually, but in real businesses ARR growth doesn't fit a simple equation (or any equation at all), so it's not inherently practical to start breaking out the power rule and your old textbooks to predict ARR growth.</p><p>If we switch back to the car analogy, it takes on a little more of a nuanced meaning. Just like a business doesn't grow on a smooth curve, car speeds do not either. Just like the gas pedal makes the car go faster and the brake pedal &amp; friction make it go slower, so too in a SaaS company, <a href="https://alexoppenheimer.substack.com/p/thin-slicing-arr">the new sales are making the speed/ARR increase and the churned customers are making the speed/ARR decrease</a>. I will dive into more details in later posts, but the goal in a car is to go as far and fast as you can while burning the least amount of fuel. So too in a SaaS company, the goal is to have the highest ARR you can, recognize the most revenue and burn the least cash. You can think about SaaS Magic Number like the fuel efficiency of a SaaS business - looking forward to diving into why this is actually helpful in building a company.</p></div></div>]]>

    <p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-2/matching_squares.png"></p>
      
    
  </div><div><p>A month after the initial Bevy release, and thanks to <strong>87</strong> contributors, <strong>174</strong> pull requests, and our <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/cart"><strong>generous sponsors</strong></a>, I'm happy to announce the <strong>Bevy 0.2</strong> release on <a href="https://crates.io/crates/bevy">crates.io</a>!</p>
<p>For those who don't know, Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. You can check out <a href="https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/">Quick Start Guide</a> to get started. Bevy is also free and open source forever! You can grab the full <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy">source code</a> on GitHub.</p>
<p>Here are some of the highlights from this release:</p>
<h2 id="async-task-system">Async Task System</h2>

<p>Bevy uses multi-threading throughout the engine: ECS scheduling, asset loading, rendering, etc. Before this release it used <a href="https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon">Rayon</a> for almost all of these tasks. Rayon is nice because it is generally as simple as calling <code>some_list.par_iter().for_each(|x| do_something(x))</code>. Rayon then automatically breaks the <code>for_each</code> into tasks and runs them on as many cores as it can. Rayon is a great choice if you want to easily parallelize code, but it has the downside of being pretty cpu-hungry.</p>
<p>Bevy (and a number of other rust game engines and ecs frameworks using rayon) have received feedback that they were overly cpu hungry / usage was not proportional to "real" work done.</p>
<p>We decided to resolve this problem by building a custom async-friendly task system, which enables the creation of context-specific task pools. For example, you might have separate pools for compute, IO, networking, etc. This also gives us the flexibility to load balance work appropriately according to work type and/or priority. The cpu usage wins have been huge:</p>
<h3 id="total-combined-percent-cpu-usage-8-core-machine-smaller-is-better">Total Combined Percent CPU Usage - 8 Core Machine (smaller is better)</h3>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-2/bevy_tasks_1.svg" alt="threading cpu usage 8 core"></p>
<h3 id="total-combined-percent-cpu-usage-32-core-machine-smaller-is-better">Total Combined Percent CPU Usage - 32 Core Machine (smaller is better)</h3>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-2/bevy_tasks_2.svg" alt="threading cpu usage 32 core"></p>
<h2 id="initial-web-platform-support">Initial Web Platform Support</h2>
<p>authors: @smokku</p>
<p>(A subset of) Bevy now runs on the web using WebAssembly/WASM! Specifically, Bevy apps can run Bevy ECS schedules, react to input events, create an empty canvas (using winit), and a few other things. This is a huge first step, but it is important to call out that there are still a number of missing pieces, such as 2D/3D rendering, multi-threading, and sound. </p>
<p>Those limitations haven't stopped @mrk-its from building the first WASM Bevy game!</p>
<h3 id="bevy-robbo-playable-here"><a href="https://github.com/mrk-its/bevy-robbo">bevy-robbo</a> (<a href="https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/mrk-public/bevy-robbo/index.html">playable here</a>)</h3>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-2/bevy-robbo.png" alt="bevy-robbo"></p>
<p>They use Bevy for game logic and cleverly work around the render limitations by passing ASCII art game state from <a href="https://github.com/mrk-its/bevy-robbo/blob/master/src/systems/js_render.rs">this Bevy system</a> to <a href="https://github.com/mrk-its/bevy-robbo/blob/master/assets/render.js">this JavaScript function</a>. </p>
<p>You can play around with some Bevy WASM examples by <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/master/examples#wasm">following the instructions here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="parallel-queries">Parallel Queries</h2>
<p>authors: @GrantMoyer</p>
<p>Bevy ECS Queries are a flexible way to retrieve data from the Entity Component System. Systems that <em>use</em> queries already run in parallel, but before this change the queries themselves could not be <em>iterated</em> in parallel. <strong>Bevy 0.2</strong> adds the ability to easily iterate queries in parallel:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>pool</span><span>: </span><span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ComputeTaskPool</span><span>&gt;</span><span>, </span><span>mut </span><span>query</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> Transform</span><span>&gt;) {</span><span>
    query</span><span>.</span><span>iter</span><span>().</span><span>par_iter</span><span>(</span><span>32</span><span>).</span><span>for_each</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>pool</span><span>, |</span><span>mut </span><span>transform</span><span>| {</span><span>
      transform</span><span>.</span><span>translate</span><span>(</span><span>Vec3</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>1.0</span><span>, </span><span>0.0</span><span>, </span><span>0.0</span><span>));
    });
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This provides a nice functional api (similar to Rayon) that runs on top of the new <code>bevy_tasks</code> system. It breaks the query up into 32 "batches" and runs each batch as a different task in the bevy task system. </p>

<p>authors: @MarekLg</p>

}

}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Bevy's old transform system used separate <code>Translation</code>, <code>Rotation</code>, and <code>Scale</code> components as the "source of truth". Users modified with these components in their systems, after which they were synced to a <code>LocalTransform</code> component, which was in turn synced to a global <code>Transform</code> component, taking hierarchy into account. This was nice for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slightly more cache efficient to retrieve individual components like <code>Translation</code> (because less data needs to be accessed)</li>
<li>Theoretically more parallel-friendly. Systems that only access <code>Translation</code> won't block systems accessing <code>Rotation</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However this approach also has some pretty serious downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>The "individual components" are the source of truth, so <code>LocalTransform</code> is out of date when user systems are running. If an up to date "full transform" is needed, it must be manually constructed by accessing all three components.</li>
<li>Very hard to reason about. There are 5 components users need to think about and they all interact with each other differently.</li>
<li>Setting a Transform to a specific matrix value (ex: <code>Mat4::look_at()</code>) was extremely cumbersome, and the value would be immediately overwritten unless the user explicitly disabled component syncing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given these issues, we decided to move to a single unified local-to-parent <code>Transform</code> component as the source of truth, and a computed <code>GlobalTransform</code> component for world-space transforms. We think this api will be much easier to use and to reason about. <a href="https://gist.github.com/joeante/79d25ec3a0e86436e53eb74f3ac82c0c">Unity is also considering a similar Transform rework for their ECS</a> and a lot of discussion on this topic happened in this <a href="https://community.amethyst.rs/t/legion-transform-design-discussion">Amethyst Forum Thread</a>.</p>

}
</span></code></pre><h2 id="bevy-ecs-performance-improvements">Bevy ECS Performance Improvements</h2>
<p>authors: @cart</p>
<h3 id="generational-entity-ids">Generational Entity IDs</h3>
<p>We changed Entity IDs from being random UUIDs to incrementing generational indices. Random UUIDs were nice because they could be created anywhere, were unique across game runs, and could be safely persisted to files or reused across networks. I was really hoping we could make them work, but they ended up being too slow relative to the alternatives. The randomness had a measurable cost and entity locations had to be looked up using a hash map.</p>
<p>By moving to generational indices (we use the hecs implementation), we can directly use entity ids as array indices, which makes entity location lookups lightning fast.</p>
<h3 id="read-only-queries">Read Only Queries</h3>
<p>I implemented "read only" traits for queries that don't mutate anything. This allows us to guarantee that a query won't mutate anything.</p>
<h3 id="removed-locking-from-world-apis">Removed locking from World apis</h3>
<p>This gives us a really nice speed boost. We can do this safely due to a combination of the new "read only queries" and changing World mutation apis to be a mutable World borrow.</p>
<p>This is not yet enabled for <code>Queries</code> in systems because a system could have multiple <code>Queries</code>, which could be simultaneously accessed in a way that doesn't make mutable access unique. I think thats a solve-able problem, but it will take a bit more work. Fortunately "for-each" systems don't have any collision risk, so we now use lock-less queries there.</p>
<h3 id="direct-component-lookup-in-nanoseconds-smaller-is-better">Direct component lookup (in nanoseconds, smaller is better)</h3>
<p>As a result of these optimizations, direct component lookup is <em>much</em> faster than it used to be:</p>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-2/get_component.svg" alt="get_component graph"></p>
<p>Note that this benchmark used <code>world.get::&lt;T&gt;(entity)</code>. <code>query.get::&lt;T&gt;(entity)</code> should have results similar to the <code>hecs</code> results because it still uses a lock. Eventually I'm hoping that we can remove locks from system queries too.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<article>
  
  <div><p>Part of a good DevOps routine is to have the infrastructure as code. This way you can utilize a high level of control with source control. You can also effortlessly spin up another identical environment.</p>

<h2 id="terraform">Terraform</h2>

<p>If you have a sizable project that has a lot of resources or a DevOps enthusiast, it may be smart to keep it in source control.</p>

<p>Terraform is Hashicorp’s solution for <em>IaC</em>. The configuration language of choice is HcL (Hashicorp configuration language). Please do not fear learning a new language. HcL is highly enjoyable and simple to learn. It’s also multi-cloud so you can learn Terraform once and use it to provision resources on AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.</p>

<p>The Azure provider is relatively mature and it’s in constant development. It’s open-source so if you are having issues, you can always create an issue on their repository. If you absolutely cannot do what you want to do using Terraform, you could always use ARM templates in Terraform or even CLI commands. So let’s go through the tutorial of using it in Azure with CI/CD using Azure DevOps.</p>

<h2 id="recipe">Recipe</h2>

<h3 id="1-install-terraform-extension">1. Install Terraform extension</h3>

<p>In this tutorial, I will use an extension to AzureDevOps that will enable us to run Terraform in our build pipeline. Get it <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-devlabs.custom-terraform-tasks">here</a> and install it in your organization.</p>

<h3 id="2-create-project-on-azuredevops">2. Create project on AzureDevOps</h3>

<p>Before you start creating a pipeline, you should have a project ready on AzureDevOps. Remember that the service <code>Pipelines</code> needs to be on (can be turned on in settings -&gt; overview) and <code>Repos</code> as well.</p>

<p>After that, you should create a repository and clone it to your desktop. Since the pipeline will include two stages; develop and master, it is smart to create a branch <code>develop</code> out from <code>master</code>.</p>

<h3 id="3-set-up-a-service-connection">3. Set-up a service connection</h3>

<p>A service connection enables you to hook-up the AzureDevOps project to the magical fairy-cloud of Azure. Create it by going to <code>Project settings</code> → <code>Service connections</code> and hit new service connection from the top right corner. There you select <code>Azure Resource Manager</code> and then you can use <code>Service principal (automatic)</code> as the authentication method.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.andreasrein.net/images/06-app-service-terraform/azure-devops-service-connection.png"></p>

<p>You then select the scope but remember that if you want Terraform to be able to create resource groups, you should leave the <code>Resource group</code> select as unselected. Pick a short and sweet name, create and you are good to go. I distinguish between the development environment and the production environment in this tutorial and, you should preferably do that too. If you do so, you can use two different subscriptions.</p>

<h3 id="4-install-terraform">4. Install Terraform</h3>

<p>Download Terraform <a href="https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html">here</a>, zip it out and put it somewhere on your disk. Remember to add it to your system’s <code>PATH</code>.</p>

<h3 id="5-write-infrastructure-code">5. Write infrastructure code</h3>

<p>The fun begins after you have successfully installed Terraform. You can finally start writing deliberate infrastructure code in HcL so warm your fingers up and let’s start by getting your editor ready. If you are using Visual Studio Code, I highly recommend the excellent plugin <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mauve.terraform">Terraform</a>.</p>

<p>So create these files:</p>

<ul>
<li>variables.tf</li>
<li>variables/dev.tfvars</li>
<li>variables/prod.tfvars</li>
<li>main.tf</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Terraform can be highly modular but for the purpose of this guide, I have decided to keep it as simple as possible.</em></p>

<h4 id="variables-tf">variables.tf</h4>

<p><code>variables.tf</code> is the home of all the variables but not the values themselves. The values can be found in the environment specific .tfvars files.</p>

<pre><code># General
variable "resource_group_name" {
  description = "The name of the resource group"
}

variable "location" {
  description = "The Azure region in which all resources should be created"
}

# App Service
variable "app_service_plan_name" {
  description = "The name of the app service plan for the backend"
}

variable "app_service_name" {
  description = "The name of the app service for the backend"
}

# Application Insights
variable "application_insights_name" {
  description = "The name of the application insights resource"
}
</code></pre>

<h4 id="variables-dev-tfvars">variables/dev.tfvars</h4>

<p><code>variables/</code> is the folder with the environment specific variable values. The example uses an homegrown Azure resources naming convention. Go with what you like as long as you keep it consistent.</p>

<pre><code>resource_group_name                       = "rg-terraform-dev"
location                                  = "West Europe"
app_service_plan_name_backend             = "azappp-terraform-dev"
app_service_name_backend                  = "azapp-terraform-dev"
application_insights_name                 = "appi-terraform-dev"
</code></pre>

<h4 id="variables-prod-tfvars">variables/prod.tfvars</h4>

<pre><code>resource_group_name                       = "rg-terraform-prod"
location                                  = "West Europe"
app_service_plan_name_backend             = "azappp-terraform-prod"
app_service_name_backend                  = "azapp-terraform-prod"
application_insights_name                 = "appi-terraform-prod"
</code></pre>

<h4 id="main-tf">main.tf</h4>

<p><code>main.tf</code> is where the infrastructure code resides. The Azure Provider is well documented and it can be found <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/">here</a>.</p>

<pre><code>/*
* Provider block defines which provider they require
*/

provider "azurerm" {
  version = "=2.26.0"
  features {}
}

terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {}
}

/*
* Resource Group
*/
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "this" {
  name     = var.resource_group_name
  location = var.location
}

/*
* App Service Plan
*/
resource "azurerm_app_service_plan" "this" {
  name                = var.app_service_plan_name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.this.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.this.name
  kind                = "Windows"

  sku {
    tier = "Standard"
    size = "S1"
  }
}

/*
* App Service
*/
resource "azurerm_app_service" "this" {
  name                = var.app_service_name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.this.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.this.name
  app_service_plan_id = azurerm_app_service_plan.this.id

  site_config {
    websockets_enabled = true
  }

  app_settings = {
    "APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY"      = "${azurerm_application_insights.this.instrumentation_key}"
    "APPINSIGHTS_PORTALINFO"              = "ASP.NET"
    "APPINSIGHTS_PROFILERFEATURE_VERSION" = "1.0.0"
    "WEBSITE_HTTPLOGGING_RETENTION_DAYS"  = "35"
  }
}

/*
* Application Insights
*/
resource "azurerm_application_insights" "this" {
  name                = var.application_insights_name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.this.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.this.name
  application_type    = "web"
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="6-create-storage-account-for-state-files">6. Create storage account for state files</h3>

<p>Terraform relies on a state file so it can know what has been done and so forth. The Terraform extension will use a storage account in Azure that we define. So go to your Azure portal and create these resources or use your existing ones.</p>

<ul>
<li>Resource Group: rg-terraform-demo</li>
<li>Storage Account: stterraformdemo</li>
<li>Storage Container: terraform</li>
</ul>

<p>The resource naming is completely optional since they are inside the azure-pipelines.yml file. Remember to double-check the state file resources in <code>azure-pipelines.yml</code>.</p>

<h3 id="7-write-build-pipeline">7. Write build pipeline</h3>

<p>The infrastructure is defined and ready to be deployed on Azure but before we can do that, we would have to define the AzureDevOps build pipeline.</p>

<p>In this example, I will use a deployment template so we can keep it clean in the main azure-pipelines file and reuse it later.</p>

<p>So create these files:</p>

<ul>
<li>azure-pipelines.yml</li>
<li>azure-pipelines-deployment-template.yml</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="azure-pipelines-yml">azure-pipelines.yml</h4>

<p>The two stages, <code>DeployDev</code> and <code>DeployProd</code> is identical apart from the variables passed in the template and that the <code>DeployProd</code> only triggers from the <code>master</code> branch.</p>

<pre><code># Set how the build pipeline triggers
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - develop
      - master

# Just say its gonna trigger on pull requests too
pr:
  branches:
    include:
      - develop
      - master

variables:
  # Name of the pipeline. Defaults to the AzureDevOps project name but it can be changed.
  - name: pipelineName
    value: TerraformDemo
  # Name of the resource group where the state file lies
  - name: tfStateRgName
    value: rg-terraform-demo
  # Name of the storage account for the state file
  - name: tfStateStName
    value: stterraformdemo
  # Name of the container for the state file
  - name: tfStateCtrName
    value: terraform

stages:
- stage: DeployDev
  displayName: Deploy Dev
  jobs:
  - template: azure-pipelines-deployment-template.yml
    parameters:
      environment: 'Dev'
      pipelineName: ${{variables.pipelineName}}
      backendServiceName: AzureDev
      tfStateRgName: ${{variables.tfStateRgName}}
      tfStateStName: ${{variables.tfStateStName}}
      tfStateCtrName: ${{variables.tfStateCtrName}}

- stage: DeployProd
  displayName: Deploy Prod
  condition: and(succeeded(), eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/master'))
  jobs:

    parameters:

      tfStateStName: '${{variables.tfStateStName}}'
      tfStateCtrName: '${{variables.tfStateCtrName}}'
</code></pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<p>I've been fortunate to work for multiple top technology companies in my career, including AWS/Amazon, Oracle, and Facebook. There are classes of problems you can only tackle at companies like these, where billions of dollars of business flows through systems that you design and build. It's fulfilling knowing something you've created has touched thousands, millions, or in some cases of <em>billions</em> of people. </p><p>But I didn't start my career in big tech. I'm just a simple kid from Montana—and a college dropout at that. My entry into the world of software started with freelancing, contract gigs, and startups. While landing that work without a "proper education" certainly wasn't easy, the level of scrutiny that smaller companies apply in their interview process tended to be considerably lower than most Bay Area and Seattle technology companies. </p><p>I remember my first interview at one of these giants. It was for a Software Development Engineer (SDE) position at AWS. <strong>I didn't pass the interview loop.</strong> But did well enough that they invited me back for a Web Development Engineer (WDE) loop, which I cleared. I converted to SDE roughly six months later. </p><p>After joining, I remember thinking how poorly I prepared for the interview process, and how much time I wasted by not preparing. I could clearly do the job, or else they wouldn't have let me convert so quickly. I wished I knew how different it was compared to anything I had done before. In total, I had to clear <em>nine interviews</em> to get that WDE offer. It was intense. </p><p>That was a decade ago. Since then, I've been been in many similar interviews, and have been on the other side of the table hundreds of times—as interviewer, interview lead, and hiring manager. </p><p>There are dozens of great books on technical interviewing. But I'd like to offer three tips that I think are most easily overlooked while preparing for a technical interview. <strong>These tips are overlooked because they acknowledge that technical interviewing is a fundamentally broken process at most large companies.</strong> </p><p>Yes, they ask you to solve problems that you'll rarely have to tackle day-to-day. This is well-known and discussed often in tech circles. But more importantly, <em><strong>interviewers are biased and often poorly trained</strong></em>. Corporate cross-breeding spawns interview behaviors that are poor imitations of their original, more effective versions. These things—more than anything technical—have the greatest potential to tank your interview.</p><p>Here are three tips to help you survive this mess.</p><h3 id="1-assess-your-interviewer-">1: Assess your interviewer. </h3><p>Technical interviewing is a distinct skill from software development. </p><p>But... tech interviewing is broken. So your meta-job as an interviewee is to understand what kind <em>what kind of broken</em>—what kind of company you're interviewing at, what kind of process they have, what kind of cultural background has informed their evaluation processes. You need to quickly understand how proficient your interviewer is, what their biases are, and whether or not he or she will do a faithful job representing you, the candidate. </p><p>Your job during an interview is to 1) convince that person they like you, and 2) arm that person with all the evidence they need to support you—preferably in that order.</p><h3 id="2-keep-talking-interviewers-fill-silences-with-their-own-biases-">2: Keep talking. Interviewers fill silences with their own biases. &nbsp; </h3><p>Silence can be deadly in an interview, so keep information flowing. If you truly need quiet to think, explicitly say this to your interviewer: "I need a few moments to collect my thoughts. I'll explain my thinking in a minute, before I begin."</p><p>Your interviewer's job is to evaluate not just your skills, but your working method and clarity of thought. Does this person get along with his/her peers? Do they have a structured way of breaking down problems? Would I enjoy working with this person? </p><p>They're in evaluation mode, trying to understand what's going through your head. <em>But they're also human.</em> If they don't know what you're thinking, they'll almost inevitably fill in the blanks with whatever biases they've formed so far. </p><p>I've seen 3 minutes of silence by one candidate reported as, <em>"They thoughtfully considered the problem before trying to put code on the board."</em> </p><p>I've seen those same 3 minutes described as, <em>"They struggled to get traction on the problem, and didn't start writing code without repeated prompting."</em></p><p>Messed up, huh? I'm not saying it's right. I'm saying you have to assume it will happen, and prepare for it. </p><h3 id="3-create-a-conspiracy-interviewers-are-more-likely-to-recommend-someone-they-feel-an-affinity-with-">3: Create a conspiracy. Interviewers are more likely to recommend someone they feel an affinity with. </h3><p>While #1 and #2 are about overcoming unfair flaws in the interview process, #3 is about exploiting them for your own gain. </p><p>Your tech interviewer is probably a mostly-normal person. It's easy to forget that when they're grilling you about compression algorithms and time complexities. But underneath that piercing glare is a meat-sack of hopes, fears, insecurities, and desires—just like anyone else. </p><p>In an interview setting, the <em>desire for belonging</em> is the easiest to exploit. We all want to feel like we're part of the group—safe, powerful.</p><p>The maneuver for this is simple enough:</p><ol><li><strong><em>Briefly discuss something you know your interview would like to strongly associate with, but may not actually be.</em></strong> Maybe it's being the most senior engineer in the org. Maybe it's working on the hardest problems in the industry. </li><li><strong><em>Associate yourself with that thing.</em></strong> Humbly imply that you were associated with these things in the past (without lying), and that you're excited to see what kind of similar opportunities are available here, at this company.</li><li><strong><em>Imply that the interviewer is obviously also associated with that thing.</em></strong> Imply that they obviously understand what you're talking about—that you're part of the same club.</li></ol><p>With these three steps, you've created a co-conspirator—someone who shares a special, secret connection. If it sticks, they can't help but start to like you, because they've associated <em>themselves</em> with you, and the natural bias to to favor themselves—and thus you.</p><h2 id="unfortunate-truths">Unfortunate Truths</h2><p>You may not want to participate in such a broken process. You may think that by playing to the process, you're somehow reinforcing it. To some extent, you are. But shy of instigating an industry-wide boycott or starting your own company, if you want to work at one of these big tech companies, you take the good—the ability to create value for millions of people, to develop and empower your teammates, to create cool things—with the bad. Your options are to ignore these realities, or plan for them. </p><p><strong><em>And once you've made it, gosh darnit, make it your mission to improve things! </em></strong>Lobby to change the interview process, focusing on ownership, effective cross-functional collaboration (including so-called "soft skills"), and customer obsession. Take or help create interview training, <em>especially around unconscious bias</em>. Fix inefficiencies. Focus on candidate experience, and on align it with the outcomes you want.</p><p>But until then, tuck these tips in your back pocket, and don't be afraid to use them. </p>

September 19, 2020 | https://datacrayon.com/posts/search-and-optimisation/practical-evolutionary-algorithms/preface/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://datacrayon.com/posts/search-and-optimisation/practical-evolutionary-algorithms/preface/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<div>
<div>

<p>Evolutionary Algorithms (<em>EAs</em>) are a fascinating class of algorithms for meta-heuristic optimisation. There exist many books on the topic of EAs, ranging from their theory to practice. The first book I read on the topic was <em>Genetic algorithms in search, optimization, and machine learning</em> by David E. Goldberg (1989), and to this day I still recommend it to new students in the field.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div>

<div>
<p>However, there is a re-occurring difficulty when my students are starting out in the field, <em>"how do I move from theory to practice?"</em>. Most books will have some chapters dedicated to applications of EAs, but what's missing is an up-to-date book dedicated to using modern technology and concepts.</p>
</div>
</div><div>

<div>
<div>
<p>When writing this book, I had to answer some difficult questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What programming language will my examples be written in?</li>
<li>What software libraries will I use?</li>
<li>How do I structure the chapters and sections, do I lead entirely by example or do I dedicate some parts to the theory?</li>
<li>Do I focus on single-objective EAs or multi-objective EAs?</li>
</ul>
<p>Nevertheless, the decisions had to be made. I selected Python as the programming language simply due to its rise in popularity (in 2019), and this was only a difficult choice because there is a wealth of resources written for MATLAB. Of the resources written in MATLAB, it is a shame to not be able to use PlatEMO, which is a well-maintained open-source platform for Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimisation. In its place, when a software library is needed, I will turn to Platypus, which provides optimisation algorithms and analysis tools for multi-objective optimisation.</p>
<p>For the structure of the chapters and sections, I have decided to lead entirely by example. There will be code to demonstrate every concept used, and I will show how we can implement algorithms from their mathematical representation. In these cases, I will focus on the readability of the implementations rather than their performance.</p>
<p>Finally, I will focus on multi-objective EAs as this represents the majority of real-world problems. However, single-objective EAs will make an appearance to highlight the differences between the two.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div>

<div>
<p>Perhaps the most difficult question to answer is <em>where do we start?</em> There is so much to cover, and many potential starting points. For this book, I will start with a definition of objective functions, and illustrate the relationship between what we call the problem space and the objective space. With this approach, I hope there will be a clear understanding of what the various operators within an EA are affecting.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>2020 is <del>almost</del> here.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that you and I are going to blast off to Mars or the Moon
on a <a href="https://www.spacex.com/starship" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Spacex Starship</a> <del>anytime soon</del> ever,
so we better turn our gaze towards another frontier of technology:</p>
<p>CSS. 🙃</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at how we could use the new powers of CSS to write modern
web applications of 2020 and beyond, here on Earth.</p>
<p>On this post, we will revisit the basics of a webpage, i.e. HTML &amp; CSS,
and develop a clean intelligent and maintainable CSS framework from scratch.
I have named our new CSS framework <a href="https://toucaan.com/" target="_blank">Toucaan</a> and you can
join me on the journey of building it together.</p>
<p>Here is its official <a href="https://github.com/bookiza/toucaan" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">repository</a> and a
noddy Toucan logo that I made using CSS.</p>

<div>
<p><a href="http://toucaan.com/" target="_blank"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bookiza/toucaan/master/assets/toucaan.png" alt="Toucaan-A Tropical CSS Framework" width="400"></a></p><h2>The Tropical CSS Framework.</h2>
</div>

<p>Qualitatively speaking the intent of Toucaan is to weed out all the unwanted
CSS that a framework doesn’t need anymore. It is a deep-dive into the core
properties of CSS standards in a bid to discover new and useful patterns
according to <a href="https://bubblin.io/blog/the-new-landscape-of-the-web" target="_blank">the new landscape of the web</a>.</p>
<p>Who knows we might even identify a few industry-wide antipatterns in the process
and we can address those with a few suggestions as we go about building
Toucaan ground up.</p>
<h3 id="why-call-it-toucaan">Why call it Toucaan</h3>
<p>Well, quite simply because I owned the pretty domain name.</p>
<p>Besides Toucan is a beautiful bird. This aggressive little arboreal ramphastidus symbolizes both beauty and strength. We are going to base our CSS framework on this highly social and resilient bird to implement a styling stricture that will cover all the wilderness on the web. Ocassionally—though rarely—we may even spar with other CSS frameworks using our “colorful, mean and oversized” bill.</p>
<p>So—say hello to <strong>Toucaan</strong>—the tropical CSS framework for the web. 😉</p>
<div><div><pre><code>👉 CSS may be hard but… **if Tou-caan, then you can too!**
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/assets/master/charlesbabbage.jpg" width="100%">
</p>

<p>With Toucaan we will revisit every web design and layouting principle that there is.
Test our ideas out in the open. No trick or technique, whether old or new is off the
table, but we will certainly avoid using hacks. There are a few other rules that
Toucaan will adhere to and those are described over <a href="https://github.com/bookiza/toucaan/blob/master/RULES.md" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Now there are a lot of well-established CSS frameworks out there like the Bootstrap,
Bulma, Foundation, TailwindCSS, and a bunch of strategies like the BEM, OOCSS, or SMACSS
(and others) to organize the application code but we will not try to imitate or wrestle with those.</p>
<p>We will rather write Toucaan on a blank slate and in such a way that we do not take away
most of what these tools have to offer, but we also end-up with more that is possible
with what’s new on the table for everyone to use lately. On production.</p>
<p>Let’s begin.</p>

<p>Before we write our first line of code let us take a deep breath and look at the
variety of devices that are a part of the web today. With subtle differences in
their aspect ratios, device handling &amp; user behavior, browser support, and screen-wise
capabilities it is important to understand what the new landscape of the web looks
like today and understand exactly what we are up against for the new framework of 2020.</p>
<p>Here are some of the devices that sport a modern web browser:
<br></p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/assets/master/major-devices.png" alt="Major web devices." width="100%">
</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/assets/master/web-devices.png" alt="Major web devices." width="100%">
</p>

<p>There is the Apple Watch 5 with a Webkit browser and the iPhones are available
in numerous sizes instead of just the one model that Apple used to promote earlier.
There are multiple iPads and iPad Pros, a slew of Android tablets
of different form-factors plus the desktops, laptops, and touchscreen tablet-PCs.</p>
<p>Smart televisions like the LG OLED series (and many others) come with a solid stock
browser and a pointer driven UI as well. Given that Samsung came out with a foldable phone recently and Microsoft
has <del>is probably coming out with</del> outed a foldable Surface tablet, it is
rather safe to assume that screens available today are on
a <strong>linear continuum</strong> of size and form-factor.</p>
<p>That the slate of glass is practically resizable freely just like the desktop browser itself.</p>
<p>And the web is no longer tied to a “mobile-first” paradigm alone.</p>
<p>One can easily consider a large phone a tablet (phablet?) or a tablet could
easily be turned into a desktop with options. While there is a large variety
of devices that are available on the web today, there is also a great
difference in the behavior, the way users interact with each of these devices—–ala,
subtle differences in controls and input methods, accessibility over the content.</p>
<p>Other than that there are cars too on the web—–in that, smartcars
sport a neat web browser for those who need to be online on road.
And low-powered devices on the budget end of the market, like the Nokia 2.2
on Android (with A53 core) or similar that are very popular in their segment.</p>

</div>

<p>Since Toucaan is about living CSS a short distance into the future, we
will consider the V9 web browser on Tesla into the scope of our project as well.
This is something that I have been meaning to do for quite some time and given
that people will have nothing to do but surf the web or <a href="https://bubblin.io/" target="_blank">read a book</a> in
a self-driving car, this sounds like a reasonable thing to do.</p>

<div>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/assets/master/tesla-web-browser.png" alt="Major web devices." width="100%"></p><p>Web is way bigger than it ever was.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Quick note</strong>: I wanted to publish this article three&gt; years ago but the
rate of change in the industry kept me from doing so. With new features being
rolled out every week it was hard to keep up and decide on a strategy.
CSS grids or Flexbox, ES6 or not, and that whole reactive developer toolchain thing.
All those “developer happiness” bits kept flowing while Apple &amp; Google announced a
non-rectangular <a href="https://bubblin.io/blog/notch" target="_blank">notched phones</a>
upsetting my plans to do a paced research.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The web is enormous now and it is no doubt much harder to design and scale
web-apps between the lowest and the highest options available today.</p>
<p>Notice that we are not even talking about browsers inconsistencies at this point.
The range of hardware itself is wide enough to somewhat trump the very
first assumption taken by nearly all the major CSS frameworks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Hardcoded breakpoints on CSS @media-queries”</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Voila, and now we have our first <strong>anti-pattern</strong> to go after! ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)</p>

<p>Breakpoints are hardcoded on Tailwind CSS like this [<a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme#screens" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/breakpoints/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2</a>], for example.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>// tailwind.config.js</span>
<span>module</span><span>.</span><span>exports</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>theme</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>screens</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>'</span><span>sm</span><span>'</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>640px</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>// Translates to hardcoded break-points in media queries.</span>
      <span>'</span><span>md</span><span>'</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>768px</span><span>'</span><span>,</span>
      <span>'</span><span>lg</span><span>'</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>1024px</span><span>'</span><span>,</span>
      <span>'</span><span>xl</span><span>'</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>1280px</span><span>'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>On Bulma, the breakpoints [<a href="https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/blob/49708a36a1f88870ec19db74888acc526a4188f3/css/bulma.css#L497" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">1</a>] are used similarly
to silo the blocks of css code like so:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>/* Bulma CSS like any other framework uses hardcoded breakpoints like so: */</span>

<span>@media</span> <span>screen</span> <span>and</span> <span>(</span><span>max-width</span><span>:</span> <span>768px</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>/* Some style classes &amp; rules here. */</span> <span>}</span>

<span>@media</span> <span>screen</span> <span>and</span> <span>(</span><span>min-width</span><span>:</span> <span>769px</span><span>),</span> <span>print</span> <span>{</span> <span>/* Same classNames but different rules here. */</span> <span>}</span>

<span>@media</span> <span>screen</span> <span>and</span> <span>(</span><span>max-width</span><span>:</span> <span>1023px</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>/* We armtwist the ruleset again… */</span> <span>}</span>

<span>@media</span> <span>screen</span> <span>and</span> <span>(</span><span>min-width</span><span>:</span> <span>1024px</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>/* Are we on the desktops now? */</span> <span>}</span>

<span>@media</span> <span>screen</span> <span>and</span> <span>(</span><span>min-width</span><span>:</span> <span>1216px</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>/* Dang!, what are we supporting here? */</span> <span>}</span>

<span>@media</span> <span>screen</span> <span>and</span> <span>(</span><span>min-width</span><span>:</span> <span>1408px</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>/* Is this the iPad Pro 12.9 inches or something else? */</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Then for each silo this happens on the CSS elsewhere…</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>+</span><span>mobile</span>
  <span>+</span><span>typography-size</span><span>(</span><span>'mobile'</span><span>)</span>

<span>+</span><span>tablet</span>
  <span>+</span><span>typography-size</span><span>(</span><span>'tablet'</span><span>)</span>

<span>+</span><span>touch</span>
  <span>+</span><span>typography-size</span><span>(</span><span>'touch'</span><span>)</span>

<span>+</span><span>desktop</span>
  <span>+</span><span>typography-size</span><span>(</span><span>'desktop'</span><span>)</span>

<span>+</span><span>widescreen</span>
  <span>+</span><span>typography-size</span><span>(</span><span>'widescreen'</span><span>)</span>

<span>+</span><span>fullhd</span>
  <span>+</span><span>typography-size</span><span>(</span><span>'fullhd'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Bootstrap does the same thing… and then thousands of utility <code>classNames</code> are
repeated on each silo of devices to cater to the behavior desired of that group.</p>
<p>Pretty much every CSS framework follows this pattern and a new breakpoint is added
every few years to account for industry-level changes. The question is how many
breakpoints will cover the new landscape of the web now?</p>
<p>Can we continue this way as the industry continues to evolve at a break-neck speed.</p>
<p>At what point will the hardcoded breakpoints become all too many?</p>
<h3 id="mode-driven-instead-of-data-driven">Mode-driven instead of data-driven:</h3>
<p>While it would be a nice exercise to plot a graph of all the screen sizes
(pixel ratio data) that are available on the market, but going down this path to
figure out the ideal set of breaking point values to separate watches from mobile
from tablets from desktops from cars to any other larger surface that is about to
come on the web is anything but scalable. Or even practical.</p>
<p>In my opinion, using hardcoded values on CSS media queries is an artifact of the
mobile-web. A result from the tunnel vision that we have had of the web since the very first iPhone.
It is a simplistic solution from a simpler time that is no longer valid today.</p>
<p>An anti-pattern that should be done away with.</p>
<p>So, is there a way to implement layout responsively without using hardcoded
break-points?</p>
<p>Turns out, there is!</p>
<p>We can build any kind of responsive application using a really simple and smart
set of rules that we will talk about in the next section.</p>
<h2 id="the-two-states-of-web-design">The Two States of Web Design.</h2>
<p>There are only two states of web-design. Let’s see how:</p>
<p>Ccreate a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bookiza/toucaan/master/examples/example0.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blank page</a>
on your machine and load it on a browser (desktop) first.</p>
<p>This is easy enough, simply jump into the terminal and:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>touch </span>example0.html     // Create a new file but <span>do </span>not write anything on it.

<span>$ </span>chrome example0.html    // Open this 0 byte files on your favorite browser.
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>What do you see on this blank page?</p>
<p>Of course nothing. It is an all-white or an all-black blank page depending
on settings. Did you know that this blank webpage is already responsive?</p>
<p>No CSS or media-query is required to adapt the UX/UI of a blank page on mobile
or desktop or any other web device. You can resize the browser to any size or
aspect ratio and the blank page will continue to scale accurately.</p>
<p>It’s perfectly responsive, and just “belongs to” the device naturally. Intrinsically.</p>

<div>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/assets/master/viewports.png" alt="Major web devices." width="66%"></p><p>Viewport rectangles of the browser window on resize.</p>
</div>

<p>Let’s switch gears and mount the desktop in portrait mode instead:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/assets/master/desktop-portrait-landscape.png" width="100%">
</p>

<p>Now the rectangular screen is in portrait orientation so the browser window
will appear longer in height—kind of like a mobile phone but</p></div></div>

September 19, 2020 | https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/trump-ban-tiktok-wechat-usa/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/trump-ban-tiktok-wechat-usa/">archive.org</a>

      Legal questions aside, let's explore the technical possibilities.
    </p><div>

<p>Let’s be very clear here. I am not a fan of TikTok. I had the misfortune of coming across it when it was still called Musically and I had to explain to a little girl that she, unlike her friends, was not allowed to dance for strangers. That ruined an otherwise perfect evening.</p>

<p>I’m also not a fan of Donald Trump(et). It’s safe to assume that he threatens to shut down TikTok for all the wrong reasons, but if he manages to pull through, it will be a benefit for mankind. So, is it actually technically possible to get TikTok and WeChat banned in the US?</p>

<h2 id="removing-apps-from-google-play">Removing apps from Google Play</h2>

<p>Story time (you can skip ahead two paragraphs for an obvious revelation)!</p>

<p>I once wrote a pretty silly slot machine game for Android. It was as a coding exercise and failed in pretty much every aspect except being recognized for what it actually wasn’t: a real gambling app.

  <figcaption>Pocket Bandit: pretty (, colorful,) boring</figcaption>
  
</figure><p>
                             
                             
All you could do was to bet one to three coins, then pull the lever and watch the reels spin. You started with a fixed amount of credit and the laws of probability dictated that you’d eventually go bankrupt. Once that happened, you could simply restarted the “game” and had a full purse again. No <em>wait x hours or pay $$$ to continue playing</em> bullshit. No way of winning anything either. In other words: the most boring one-armed bandit ever. Not even suitable for detoxing a gambling addict. I had somehow managed to put in all the mechanics of a classical slot machine except the one (winning/loosing) that was responsible for producing the excitement.</p>

<p>Well, there’s no rule that states, you can’t publish rubbish on Google Play. Much to my surprise though, there is a rule that says, you can’t publish gambling apps in some Arab countries without governmental approval. So, one fateful morning, I received a mail from Google telling me that my app had been pulled from Play in those countries. I was pissed. Not because the world needed my app. Not because some Arabs were now deprived of the most dull entertainment, only I could provide. I was pissed because someone had obviously only spent the time of looking at the screenshots to determine that this was a gambling app, but hadn’t bothered to reason how you were suppose to spend (real) money in an app that doesn’t even request network permission. It felt unjustified. Like a downvote driven in with the banhammer. Someone with the attention span of a puppy had the power of Thor.</p>

<p>There was no point in appealing. After all, the game was crap, but the incident was a nice reminder on how fragile businesses, build on apps are. Somewhere, someone with too little time to be thorough can simply nuke them without prior warning. Needless to say, that in time, the same  kind of sloppiness resulted in more of my apps being pulled …</p>

<p>So, what’s the take away from my story?</p>

<p>Geo fencing has always been a core feature of Play and Google never really went out of its way to stand up for developers. Sure, my apps are small fries compared to behemoths like TikTok, but then again, they aren’t direct competitors to youtube either. Let’s keep that in mind in case anyone has high hopes for Google putting up a fight.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-sideloading">What about sideloading?</h2>

<p>Who needs Play anyway? Android is not IOS, we can simply download the APK off the web and install it ourselves, right? Eh well, no. It’s not that simple. Bytedance swallowed Google’s Cool Aid and switched to App Bundles/Dynamic Delivery in order to reduce the size of their app. So instead of a single, one size fits all APK, you get a bunch of individual files. In case of TikTok v17.6.3 and depending on your device, the list might look like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>com.zhiliaoapp.musically-2021706030.apk</li>
<li>com.zhiliaoapp.musically-2021706030_config.armeabi_v7a.apk</li>
<li>com.zhiliaoapp.musically-2021706030_config.en.apk</li>
<li>com.zhiliaoapp.musically-2021706030_config.xhdpi.apk</li>
<li>com.zhiliaoapp.musically-2021706030_df_creationtool_so.apk</li>
<li>com.zhiliaoapp.musically-2021706030_df_creationtool_so.config.armeabi_v7a.apk</li>
<li>com.zhiliaoapp.musically-2021706030_df_fusing.apk</li>
<li>com.zhiliaoapp.musically-2021706030_df_photomovie.apk</li>
</ul>

<p>Split APKs cannot be sideloaded (easily). On plain Android, there’s simply no user interface for telling the packagemanager that you want it to install an app from several connected files (<a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/merge-split-apk/">after all, making sideloading difficult was/is the whole idea behind App Bundles</a>). You need extra tools (e.g. ADB) for that. But let’s be brutally honest here, if you are in the target audience of TikTok, then you are probably missing a brain cell or two (out of a total of two) and won’t be able to use them.</p>

<div>
  
  <p><span>Fun fact</span>
  
  
App Bundles have a build in security flaw. Traditional APKs cannot be modified by the Playstore. App Bundles can. For rogue government agencies, this provides the option of pushing hacked app updates to </p><u>selected</u><p> individuals. For that reason, <b>no</b> app in the "communications" category should ever use App Bundles as a distribution format. Imagine that! Coincidentally, Trump was actually right when calling TikTok a security issue. Cheers ByteDance!

</p></div>
                             
                             

<p>So, why doesn’t ByteDance simply host a traditional APK on the TikTok website then?</p>

<p>Two reasons actually</p>

<ol>
<li>Self hosting your app means, people will download the self hosted version (duh!), even if they could get it from the Playstore. As a result, the Playstore version sees less downloads, less reviews and less ratings which may eventually lead to it spiraling down in the rankings (ever wondered why all youtubers end their videos with the magic mantra “like and subscribe, hit the bell and give me a thumbs up”? Same mechanic there). This, by the way was the leverage, Google used to monopolize the app store market on Android: you are free to host elsewhere, but if your competitors solely host with us, they will eventually outrank you.</li>
<li>ByteDance not only drank the Google Cool aid, but also coughed it up and swallowed it again. Part of their revenue is in-app purchases. Those don’t work with sideloaded APKs. They could, of course, implement their own <abbr title="In App Purchase">IAP</abbr>, but that’s something <a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/2020081401/">Epic tried with Fortnite</a> recently…</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="removing-existing-tiktok-installations-from-devices">Removing existing TikTok installations from devices</h2>

<p>Buckle up, this may come as a surprise or as a confirmation of your fears!</p>

<p>Did you ever notice the big green “install” button on the Google Play website? With it, you can conveniently browse the store on your PC and send apps to your phone for installation.</p>

<figure>
  <a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/trump-ban-tiktok-wechat-usa/googleplay-tiktok.png">
    <img src="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/trump-ban-tiktok-wechat-usa/googleplay-tiktok.png">
  </a>
  
  <figcaption>Screencap: The install button on the Play website is sort off a remnant from the old days when 320x480 screens where the norm and you'd rather browse the androidmarket (as it was called back then) on your PC.</figcaption>
  
</figure>
                             
                             

<p>This is done via “Push messages”. Which is just a modern way of saying that your phone wakes up every couple of minutes in order to waste battery and bandwidth on checking if there are any new ads you should see. It also checks if there are any app updates or pending installs (from the green button) while it is at it, just so you have a reason not to disable the <del>spy</del> playstore app when you don’t need it. The relevant <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/">message structure</a> looks like this:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="protobuf"><span>message</span> <span>Notification</span> {<span>

<p>A request to delete an app from a device looks like this:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="protobuf">notificationType<span>:</span> <span>2</span><span>
</span><span></span>docid {<span>
</span><span></span>  backendDocId<span>:</span> <span>"com.zhiliaoapp.musically"</span><span>

</span><span></span>purchaseRemovalData {<span>
</span><span></span>  malicious<span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>
</span><span></span>}</code></pre></div>

<p>Note that the malicious flag is purely cosmetic. The only thing Play has to send is the package name of the app and the notificationType 2. The app gets deleted, even if it wasn’t installed via Play.</p>

<h2 id="blocking-tiktok-in-the-usa">Blocking TikTok in the USA</h2>

<p>Let’s say you are an existing TikTok user and a US citizen. Let’s say, after reading the above, you disable the Playstore client, so Google can’t delete apps from your phone. What are they going to do then? Tell your ISP to firewall the TikTok servers (I heard, China has the tech for that. Maybe they’ll share…)? Well, curiously, there’s a much simpler solution. Did I already mention that ByteDance drank the Google Coolaid to the last drip? Let’s use an <a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/">apk downloader</a> to request the <a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/trump-ban-tiktok-wechat-usa/com_zhiliaoapp_musically.json">Google Playstore entry for the TikTok app</a>. Here’s an excerpt:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>"dependency"</span><span>:</span> [{

<p><span>Blog post 11 September 2020, by Tom Tervoort, Senior Security Specialist and Ralph Moonen, Technical Director at Secura</span></p>
<p><span><span><em></em></span></span><span><strong><span>Last month, Microsoft patched a very interesting vulnerability that would allow an attacker with a foothold on your internal network to essentially become Domain Admin with one click. All that is required is for a connection to the Domain Controller to be possible from the attacker’s viewpoint. </span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>Secura's security expert Tom Tervoort previously discovered <strong><span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.secura.com/blog-cve-2019-1424" rel="noopener noreferrer">a less severe Netlogon vulnerability last year that allowed workstations to be taken over</a></span></strong>, but the attacker required a Person-in-the-Middle (PitM) position for that to work. Now, he discovered this second, much more severe (CVSS score: 10.0) vulnerability in the protocol. By forging an authentication token for specific Netlogon functionality, he was able to call a function to set the computer password of the Domain Controller to a known value. After that, the attacker can use this new password to take control over the domain controller and steal credentials of a domain admin. </span></p>
<p><span>The vulnerability stems from a flaw in a cryptographic authentication scheme used by the Netlogon Remote Protocol, which among other things can be used to update computer passwords. This flaw allows attackers to impersonate any computer, including the domain controller itself, and execute remote procedure calls on their behalf. </span></p>
<p><span>Secura urges everybody to install the patch on all their domain controllers as fast as possible. Please refer to Microsoft’s advisory. <strong>We published a test tool on Github</strong>, which you can download here:&nbsp;<strong><span><a href="https://github.com/SecuraBV/CVE-2020-1472">https://github.com/SecuraBV/CVE-2020-1472</a></span></strong> that can tell you whether a domain controller is vulnerable or not.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p>Distributed Task Processing using Celery</p>
    <br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <p>Overview</p>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>Recently, two new crypto currencies have entered the market and are all the rage - the <span>BLU</span> coin
        and the <span>RED</span> coin. There are only three exchanges where these popular coins are being traded - the
        <span>CAT</span>, <span>DOG</span>, and <span>FOX</span> exchanges respectively.
        There is an API exposed, through which buyers can query the current best favorable rate provided by one of the 3 exchanges.
        Given the popularity of these coins, the API is being bombarded by the consumers. How can one handle this situation ? What if
        there is an easy way to distribute the processing, in an asynchronous way, on a single host (or multiple hosts) using message
        passing, and with an ability to retry automatically on failures ???</p>
      <p>Welcome <a href="https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/" target="_blank"><span>Celery</span></a> - the
        distributed task processing framework for <span>Python</span> !!!</p>
    </div>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p><span>Celery</span> is a simple, flexible, and reliable distributed task queue processing framework for Python,
        with the following features:</p>
      <ul id="blue-sqr-ul">
        <li>
          <p>Distributed task processing is initiated through message passaging using a middleware broker such as the
            <a href="https://www.polarsparc.com/xhtml/RabbitMQ-1.html" target="_blank"><span>RabbitMQ</span></a></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Task processing is handled by worker(s) which are responsible for the execution of the task</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Results from a task processing can be stored in a backend store such as <a href="https://redis.io/" target="_blank">
            <span>Redis</span></a></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Task processing can be immediately triggered (real-time) or can be scheduled (batched)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Failed tasks will be automatically retried on errors</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Complex pipeline of task(s) can be processed by distributing the task(s) across different host(s)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Architecture is based on a pluggable component model</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>The following illustration depicts the high-level architecture of the Celery task queue processing:</p>

          <td><span>Worker</span></td>
          <td>The entity that executes task(s)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><span>Backend</span></td>
          <td>The store where the worker(s) persist the result of an execution</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    
    <p>Now, we can explain the high-level flow using the architecture diagram from Figure.1 above. When client(s) (also referred
        to as <span>Producer</span>(s)) invoke a Python method (annotated with a special Celery task decorator), the
        decorated task sends a message (with the name of the method along with its arguments) to a designated task queue in the
        messaging Broker and returns an asynchronous result object to the caller. There are task Worker(s) waiting on the designated
        task queue (also referred to as <span>Consumer</span>(s)). When a message arrives on a queue, a task Worker
        executes the specified Python method with the method arguments (from the message) and sends the result (of the task execution)
        to the configured Backend store. The caller can check if the task execution has completed using the asynchronous result
        object. Once the task execution completes, the caller can get the result from the asynchronous result object, which in-turn
        fetches the result from the Backend store.</p>
    <p>Installation</p>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>We can install, setup, and demonstrate Celery on a single host with VMs or on multiple host(s). For my setup, will leverage
        a 6-node cluster consisting of <span>5</span> <a href="https://www.polarsparc.com/xhtml/XU4-Cluster.html" target="_blank"><span>ODroid XU4</span></a>'s and a <a href="https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-c2/" target="_blank"><span>ODroid C2</span></a>.

<br/>
September 19, 2020 | http://bugfree.dk/blog/2012/06/24/effective-ml-and-fsharp | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://bugfree.dk/blog/2012/06/24/effective-ml-and-fsharp">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post">
  <p>
    This is a summary of <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/yminsky">Yaron Minsky</a>'s nine pieces of advice from the <a href="http://vimeo.com/14313378">Effective ML</a> video. Since ML is a predecessor of F#, most of the advice applies to F# as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>1. Favor readers over writers (10:20)</strong>. There're systematic differences in opinion between those who spent their time reading code and those who spent it writing code. Whenever there's a difference in opinion between these two groups, the readers are always right and the writers are always wrong. The readers will always push in the direction of clarity and simplicity and the ability to change behavior easily. At least if you're building software that's going to last.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>2. Create uniform interfaces (12:15)</strong>. Always create an interface to your code to make it easier on the reader. When you build interfaces, you should have standards that apply uniformly across your code base to build solid expectations. Those who use your code should know what to provide and what to expect when interfacing with your codebase.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>3. Make illegal states unrepresentable (18:03)</strong>. Use the type system as a tool to enforce invariants on the code you write. Choose your data types such that states that are illegal don't show up as legal states in the program. Take this code representing various connection information as an example. It keeps track of relevant information in a fairly readable manner:
  </p>
  <pre>type connection_state =
  | Connecting
  | Connected
  | Disconnected

type connection_info = {
    state:             connection_state
    server:            IPAddress
    last_ping_time:    DateTime option
    last_ping_id:      int option
    session_id:        string option
    when_initiated:    DateTime option
    when_disconnected: DateTime option
}</pre>
  <p>On the surface these types look reasonable, but there're some tricky invariants that need to hold about the data. For instance, if you have a last_ping_time, you should probably also have a last_ping_id and vice versa. And the session_id and when_initiated probably only makes sense when you're connected. Similarly, when_disconnected only makes sense if you've been disconnected.</p>
  <p>The key is that there's nothing about the types that help you enforce all these invariants. A better approach would be to refactor the connection_info into a series of types where the invariants would be inherent in the types themselves rather than being implicit in the logic surrounding the types:</p>
  <pre>type connecting = { when_initiated: DateTime }
type connected = { last_ping: (DateTime * int) option
                   session_id: string }
type disconnected = { when_connected: DateTime }

type connection_state =
  | Connecting of connecting
  | Connected of connected
  | Disconnected of disconnected

type connection_info = {
    state: connection_state
    server: IPAddress
}</pre>
  <p>server remains in connection_info because it applies to any of the states. The other information have been grouped together with the state it related to. The different connection_states are no longer merely a simple enumerated type but each of the different tags have content. Note also how the last_ping is now both the last_ping_time and last_ping_id. Either both are present, and grouped together, or not.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>4. Code for exhaustiveness (28:33)</strong>. This one is closely related to making illegal states unrepresentable in that you should write your code aiming at exhaustiveness guarantees. For instance, when you have a match statement, the compiler will warn you if the match isn't exhaustive. The key benefit is as a refactoring tool because it guides changes in the code base. Don't use the match all because it means that if you expand on the discriminated union the compiler will not warn you.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>5. Open few modules (34:08)</strong>. When you open a module, it makes your code a bit shorter, and that's great for the guy who wrote the code, but not the guy reading it. Now you can no longer just look at the code and tell where the value came from. In F#, with Visual Studio integration and IntelliSense, this is less of a problem. But the key advice is to respect the cognitive limitation of the people reading the code. If you want people to remember something, make them remember only for a short period of time.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>6. Make common errors obvious (38:10)</strong>. Use exceptions for exceptional conditions is what people often tell you. But whether something is a common case depends on context. For instance, in one context it's an error if an element isn't in a list, whereas in others it's perfectly acceptable. For your API it may depend on the caller if a case is exceptional or not. To better support the caller, you could create two versions depending on how you want to communicate an error:
  </p>
  <pre>val hd : 'T list -&gt; 'T option
val hd_exn : 'T list -&gt; 'T</pre>
  <p>Now you can tell from the name of the function weather it throws an exception or not. For people reading the code it makes it easier to understand the error behavior of the code.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>7. Avoid boilerplate (40:52)</strong>. Avoid repeating the same code, or almost the same code, in multiple places. Boilerplate appears, in general, because people have a cut and paste template they use to do almost the same thing in multiple spots and because their language isn't good enough to encode what they want to do in a clean way. You want to get rid of boilerplate because the structure you're repeating is there for a reason, and your code evolves. At that point you're not going to remember all the places where the repetition shows up. It also goes back to readability. It's hard to convince people to read code if it's dull. And nothing is duller than boilerplate, even though the code is critical.
  </p>
  <p>Interestingly, reducing boilerplate doesn't always make code less verbose. The goal isn't to make the code shorter but to separate out which parts of the code is the same and which parts vary.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>8. Avoid complex type hackery (45:30)</strong>. The enemy of good code, of correctness, isn't dynamic guarantees, properties about the code that cannot be proved at compile time, but complexity. Refrain from making your code more complex (using <a href="http://mlton.org/PhantomType">phantom types</a>, for instance), just so you can have the type system verify additional properties of the code.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>9. Don't be puritanical about purity (47:10)</strong>. Avoiding side-effect is generally worth striving for, because code without side-effects tends to be easier to reason about. But sometimes it's also just easier to code with side-effects. There may even be performance reasons for allowing side-effects so don't be embarrassed about it. In reality, programs don't just compute things, they do things like write files, send messages, and so on. All this doing involves side-effects. Again, remember that the enemy of correctness is complexity. Don't jump through hoops to make your code too complex just to make it pure.
  </p>

<p><img data-src="https://i.ibb.co/n3YzYyF/Main-Images-4-1.png" alt="How does Django validate passwords" title="How does Django validate passwords" src="https://i.ibb.co/n3YzYyF/Main-Images-4-1.png">
</p><p>
A few days ago, I was working on one of my old Django projects. It was running an old version of Django and I wanted to keep it updated with the latest changes of the framework.</p>
<p>
So to check the <a href="https://ranvir.xyz/blog/django-admin-tips-and-tricks/">admin site</a>, I tried to create the superuser after connection to the local database.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>python</span> <span>manage</span><span>.</span><span>py</span> <span>createsuperuser</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>
When I passed a password similar to the username it failed saying, <code>The password is too similar to the username.</code></p>
<p><img data-src="https://i.ibb.co/94D2x9G/Screenshot-2020-09-19-at-1-32-17-AM.png" alt="The password is too similar to the username" title="The password is too similar to the username" src="https://i.ibb.co/94D2x9G/Screenshot-2020-09-19-at-1-32-17-AM.png">
</p><p>
This error triggered me to check the working behind this password validation feature.</p><p>
The first thing that I looked into was the <code>manage.py</code> file itself which in turn was importing and executing a method called, <code>execute_from_command_line</code>.</p><p>
I traced it back and found a package <code>commands</code> containing everything that I wanted to know. This directory had two files.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>1.</span> <span>createsuperuser</span><span>.</span><span>py</span>
<span>2.</span> <span>changepassword</span><span>.</span><span>py</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="the-changepassword-command">The changepassword command</h2><p>
Since I had never used/ heard about the <code>changepassword</code> command, I thought of trying it first and to my great pleasure, it worked. You have to pass the username as the first argument.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>python</span> <span>manage</span><span>.</span><span>py</span> <span>changepassword</span> <span>username</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><img data-src="https://i.ibb.co/YRfMkYW/Screenshot-2020-09-19-at-3-10-09-AM.png" alt="python manage.py changepassword" title="python manage.py changepassword" src="https://i.ibb.co/YRfMkYW/Screenshot-2020-09-19-at-3-10-09-AM.png">
</p><p>
Sometimes you find gold when you read the code, right? ðŸ˜�</p><p>
Now letâ€™s get back to the business and look into the <code>createsuperuser</code> command class in more detail.</p>
<h2 id="fetching-the-correct-database">Fetching the correct database</h2><p>
If you have been using Django for some time, you would know that Django allows you to change a lot of things depending upon the settings you define.</p><p>
This also includes using some random model as your base User model. This is the first thing that the superuser creation <code>__init__</code> constructor method checks for.</p>
<h2 id="creating-the-superuser-without-interaction">Creating the superuser without interaction</h2><p>
You can use a version of the command that allows you to create the superuser without any interaction.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>python</span> <span>manage</span><span>.</span><span>py</span> <span>createsuperuser</span> <span>--</span><span>username</span> <span>ranvir</span> <span>--</span><span>email</span> <span>abc</span><span>@</span><span>abc</span><span>.</span><span>com</span> <span>--</span><span>no</span><span>-</span><span>input</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><img data-src="https://i.ibb.co/LJtHHq5/Screenshot-2020-09-19-at-3-17-49-AM.png" alt="python manage.py createsuperuser no-input" title="python manage.py createsuperuser no-input" src="https://i.ibb.co/LJtHHq5/Screenshot-2020-09-19-at-3-17-49-AM.png">
</p><p>
Although the user created using this process will have no password. We can create the password either using the <code>changepassword</code> command or the admin panel.</p>
<h2 id="required-fields-and-interactive-mode">Required fields and interactive mode</h2><p>
For the default <code>User</code> model, <code>email</code> is the only required field but you can change that by changing your <code>REQUIRED_FIELD</code> setting as well.</p><p>
In the interactive mode( which is the default mode as well), the first thing that the prompt asks you to fill, is the username.</p><p>

Django tries to smartly suggest the current system username as the default username. (Just Wow)</p>
<p><img data-src="https://i.ibb.co/pr1Z1Qw/Screenshot-2020-09-19-at-2-14-46-AM.png" alt="django suggest the current system username" title="django suggest the current system username" src="https://i.ibb.co/pr1Z1Qw/Screenshot-2020-09-19-at-2-14-46-AM.png">
</p><p>
It wonâ€™t suggest the system username if it is already taken. (Thatâ€™s AI for me ðŸ˜‚)</p>
<p><img data-src="https://i.ibb.co/r3YxbKL/Screenshot-2020-09-19-at-2-15-41-AM.png" alt="django doens't suggest the current system username if already taken" title="django doens't suggest the current system username if already taken" src="https://i.ibb.co/r3YxbKL/Screenshot-2020-09-19-at-2-15-41-AM.png">
</p><p>
After the username, you have to fill in the required field which is the email field for the default User model.</p><p>
Finally, you have to fill in the password field.</p>
<h2 id="the-validate-password-method">The validate password method</h2><p>
Sorry for keeping you waiting this long before jumping onto the real reason behind the post.</p><p>
The <code>validatepassword</code> is the function that is used to validate the password provided by the user.</p><p>
Again, we can configure all these validators as well, if these different password validation doesnâ€™t work for you, go forward and remove the classes from your settings file.</p><p>
These are the default validators.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>'NAME'</span><span>:</span> <span>'django.contrib.auth.password_validation.UserAttributeSimilarityValidator'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>},</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>'NAME'</span><span>:</span> <span>'django.contrib.auth.password_validation.MinimumLengthValidator'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>},</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>'NAME'</span><span>:</span> <span>'django.contrib.auth.password_validation.CommonPasswordValidator'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>},</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>'NAME'</span><span>:</span> <span>'django.contrib.auth.password_validation.NumericPasswordValidator'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>},</span>
<span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>
If we use the default validators, then the password,</p>
<ol>
<li>Should not be similar to <code>username</code>, <code>first_name</code>, <code>last_name</code> and <code>email</code>. It also checks for the similarity using <a href="https://docs.python.org/2.4/lib/sequence-matcher.html">SequenceMatcher</a>. It should be less than 0.7 similar which you can customize. (Told you, itâ€™s AI)</li>
<li>Should be greater than 8 characters.</li>
<li>Should not be in the list of common passwords. The list of common passwords is in the file, <code>common-passwords.txt.gz</code>. It contains a list of around 20000 common passwords which you should not use.</li>
<li>Should not contain all numeric characters.</li>
</ol><p>
I would suggest keeping the basic configuration intact for the password handling. You can use your own validations on top of it as well.</p><p>
So, thatâ€™s it for this time. Till next time.</p>

<p>In a recently leaked internal drawing from Volkswagen AG, the German automaker is seen comparing its upcoming ID.4 compact electric SUV to the Tesla Model Y.</p>



<p>Translating a word on the drawing revealed that this is a hand-drawn sketch of both cars probably by a Volkswagen car designer. The sketch mostly outlines the comparison of the exterior dimensions between both EVs.</p>

<p>For the ease of understanding the comparison, I took the numbers mentioned on the above sketch sheet and put it in the following table. I also converted millimeters to inches for readers acquainted with the imperial unit system.</p>



<h2>Table: Tesla Model Y vs. VW ID.4 Dimensions and Specs Comparison</h2>

<h3>Price Comparison</h3>



<p>The most interesting bit from this comparison is the price point at which Volkswagen is able to offer a comparable range electric SUV against the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/model-y/">Tesla Model Y</a>. A difference of around €10k is a huge plus point for the VW ID.4 at the moment.</p>



<p>The price of the Model Y will certainly go down once <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/giga-berlin/">Giga Berlin</a> is up and running with Model Y production next year. The plant will save the time and cost of shipping all the way from the United States and result in a possibly significant price decrease.</p>

<h3>Charging &amp; Charging Infrastructure</h3>



<p>But VW ID.4’s peak charging rate or at the speed that it can be charged is lacking at least 1 generation behind the Tesla Model Y’s.</p>



<p>Tesla’s older V2 Superchargers are able to charge Teslas at 120 to 145 kW. With the latest V3 stations, Teslas are able to charge at 250 kW peak rate which translates to around <a href="https://www.xautoworld.com/tesla/model3-v3-supercharging-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1000 miles or 1600 kilometers of range added to the battery pack in 1 hour</a> of charging.</p>



<p>Tesla Model Y has another advantage as the automaker’s dedicated Supercharger Network is already abundant in Europe, North American, and the main Chinese cities. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/volkswagen/">Volkswagen</a>, besides partnering with 3rd-party EV charging providers will have to build its own infrastructure as well to compete with Tesla — because electric car drivers need peace of mind when they need electrons for the battery.</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>



<p>The good news in all of this is VW is taking electric mobility seriously now and recently, <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/09/08/elon-musk-test-drove-the-vw-id-3-germany/">Volkswagen Chairman Herbert Diess invited Elon Musk for a test drive on the company’s ID.3</a> hatchback EV.  Elon Musk said, “I think for a non-sporty car it’s pretty good”. </p>



<p>Looks like Tesla and Elon Musk are well prepared for this type of competition in the compact SUV / Crossover segment, therefore the Gigafactory Berlin is taking shape so fast. If Tesla is also able to source Model Y parts from local suppliers at competitive prices <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/09/14/tesla-450k-heat-pumps-china-mdoel-3-model-y/">like China</a>, the Model Y price might be further reduced to give thought time to the VW ID.4.</p>



<p>Volkswagen’s electric mobility division is moving fast as last week they handed over ID.3 to its first owner and the ID.4 production as seen in the following picture has already started at the automaker’s Zwickau manufacturing plant. </p>

<p>As Tesla is willing to ramp the Tesla Model Y production at the Gigafactory Berlin to 500,000 units/year in the coming years. Volkswagen is also aiming for the same number of ID.4 vehicles produced and sold till 2025.</p>



<blockquote><p>Volkswagen wants to become the world market leader in e-mobility – but that won’t happen by itself. The Volkswagen brand is therefore investing around 11 billion euros by 2024. As a compact SUV, the ID.4 has, in our view, the best prerequisites for being successful in a large scale in all important markets. We, therefore, expect the Volkswagen brand to produce a total of 1.5 million e-cars per year by 2025. And the ID.4 is likely to account for around a third of this. The ID.4 will thus become the driving force behind our reorientation a hundred thousand times over.</p><cite>Volkswagen CEO Ralf Brandstätter via a company <a href="https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/stories/the-id4-to-become-an-electrically-powered-world-car-6423" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press-release</a>.</cite></blockquote>



<p>On the other end, Tesla CEO <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/09/03/model-y-gigafactory-berlin-radical-technology-shif-elon-musk/">Elon Musk on his visit to Germany said that Model Y production at Giga Berlin</a> will mark a radical shift in how cars are made. Part of this is revealed that Tesla plans to install <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/09/11/tesla-fremont-factory-drone-video-shows-the-model-y-gigacast-machines-roadrunner-magic-cube/">giant casting machines at the German Gigafactory</a> that will accelerate the production process manyfold.</p>



<p>The competition between these two automotive giants in the electric vehicle universe will be interesting to see in the near future.</p>

September 19, 2020 | https://szeitlin.github.io/posts/engineering/pachyderm-vs-airflow/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://szeitlin.github.io/posts/engineering/pachyderm-vs-airflow/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

<p>If you do a lot of data pipelining, you’ve probably heard a lot about Airflow by now. I gave a talk
about it a while back at a meetup, and wrote a blog post about it. The gist of my pitch for Airflow
was essentially <em>“Look, it’s so much better than cron.”</em></p>

<p>Fast-forward a year or two, and my team is using Pachyderm now. This post is about why I wanted to try Pachyderm,
what I love about it, some things that can be improved about it, and some of the tricks you’ll need to know if you want to start using it.</p>

<p><em>Note: I am not in any way being paid by Pachyderm.</em></p>

<hr>



<ul>
<li><p>Designed for a machine learning model workflow, but can also handle regular data pipelining
(including cron-style scheduling). This is incredibly reassuring to me, because Airflow is kind of the other way around.</p></li>

<li><p>Scalability (parallelization support). I haven’t done much with this yet, but it’s also reassuring to know it’s there,
since we’re a rapidly growing company, and I’m sure our data needs are going to continue to expand.</p></li>

<li><p>Data and code provenance tracking are built-in.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>What that means:</em> It’s easy to figure out what version
 of your code was running at any given time, and on what data. This is critical if you’re iterating on
 code for ETL processes or models, or tracking a model that’s going to evolve over time based on what data it has seen.</p>

<ul>
<li>The egress feature and built-in feed-forward are amazingly elegant.<br></li>
</ul>

<p>Feed-forward (I don’t know what they call it, that’s just what I call it) means
you can have one pipeline read from the output of another, and trigger off of that directly.</p>

<p>In Airflow, for comparison, you had to configure this with messaging and it was kind of clunky
(and originally there was no push, only pull, so you were always polling for <em>is that thing done yet?</em>).</p>

<p>In Pachyderm, it’s an extremely simple configuration.</p>

<p>Egress means you don’t have to write a plugin to do something as basic as push your data to s3. Pachyderm already
knows how to do that for you (see below for an example of how this is specified in a pipeline).</p>

<p>There’s also an easy way to tell it to re-process as much data as you want (*except for cron inputs, but they’re
going to fix that).</p>

<ul>
<li>Not having to clean up the fallout from runaway backfills</li>
</ul>

<p>Runaway backfill in Airflow made our server fall down more than once whenever anybody
forgot to update the start date or name of their DAG. This was a built-in default setting that we couldn’t change,
where Airflow would try to backfill any missing data to the beginning of time
(1970, of course), and celery would get overloaded.</p>

<p>We tried numerous approaches to make it impossible to do this
by accident, including having tests for checking that the start_date for a revised DAG
was always after the date of the latest changes.</p>

<p>It was the bane of my Airflow existence. Clearing the celery cache
and getting it to restart, and then backfill what we <em>actually</em> wanted was always a time-consuming process, including
kicking the web server again and getting everything back online.</p>

<ul>
<li>Smart re-tries by default (and this is configurable).</li>
</ul>

<p>Having retries at all was a big advantage of Airflow over basic cron, especially since it’s modular, so you can
have different re-try settings for each step of an ETL pipeline.</p>

<p>Having said that, this was a also kind of a pain to deal with in Airflow, because
if somebody set a ridiculous number of retries, or a backfill job was failing,
it could easily become a blocker for unrelated pipelines just by
gunking up the celery queue with tons of re-tries for something that was
 already failing (see above re: runaway backfill).</p>

<p>With Airflow, we were always having to guess about how many
retries to do, and how much back-off to add in between tries.</p>

<p>Pachyderm’s defaults for this are completely reasonable
(3 retries, with increasing delay in between each try).</p>

<p>If you get the enterprise version (which is cheap for an enterprise product):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It’s more secure than Airflow, with built-in encryption (There’s also no risk of exposing
passwords by printing all the logs to a webpage that anyone can see, the way Airflow did by default.)</p></li>

<li><p>Really responsive and smart team, and a growing community of users</p></li>

<li><p>Nice dashboard to go with the CLI tool</p></li>

<li><p>Finally, if you don’t like writing DAGs in Airflow, and are considering one of the myriad (!) new tools
to simplify that for you, this is even simpler than that. (And in my opinion, makes a lot more sense.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And here’s an example of a full ETL process with 3 pipeline steps:</p>

<p><strong>1. Get the data from an api</strong></p>

<pre><code>{
    "pipeline": {
       "name": "api_to_s3_pipeline"
    },

    "transform": {
       "cmd": ["python3", "get_requests.py"],
       "image": "pathto.ecr.region.aws.com/mydockerregistry:my_api_image_v1",
       "image_pull_secrets": ["regcred"]
    },
    "input":{
        "cron": {
            "name": "api_daily_job",
            "spec": "16 6 * * *",
            "repo": "api_to_s3"
         }
    },
    "egress": {"URL": "s3://mys3bucket/"},
    "enable_stats": true,
    "job_timeout": 10m
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>2. Process the data with pyspark on kubernetes</strong></p>

<pre><code>{
    "pipeline": {
       "name": "pyspark_pipeline"
    },

    "transform": {
       "cmd": ["python3", "pyspark_processsing.py"],
       "image": "pathto.ecr.region.aws.com/mydockerregistry:my_pyspark_image_v1",
       "image_pull_secrets": ["regcred"]
    },
    "input":{
        "atom": {
            "name": "pyspark_daily_job",
            "repo": "pyspark_daily_job",
            "glob: "/*/*/*/"
         }
    },
    "egress": {"URL": "s3://my-pyspark-bucket/"},
    "enable_stats": true,
    "job_timeout": 120m
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>3. Load the data to Redshift</strong></p>

<pre><code>{
    "pipeline": {
       "name": "load_to_redshift_pipeline"
    },

    "transform": {
       "cmd": ["python3", "load_to_redshift.py"],
       "image": "pathto.ecr.region.aws.com/mydockerregistry:my_psycopg2_image_v1",
       "image_pull_secrets": ["regcred"]
    },
    "input":{
        "atom": {
            "name": "daily_load_job",
            "repo": "daily_load_job",
            "glob: "daily_*.gz"
         }
    },
    "enable_stats": true,
    "job_timeout": 125m
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also, they just got Series A funding, so they’re going to be around for a while.</p>

<hr>



<p>This was my first time using kubernetes, never mind suddenly being in charge of it (!).</p>

<p>Fair warning: Minikube is deceptively easy to set up and use for very basic testing. If this is all you do with
kubernetes, you’ll think Kubernetes very simple.</p>

<p>Kubernetes itself
isn’t that hard to deploy if you know what needs to be configured, but I really didn’t
know any of that when I started. I ran into some weird issues where the kubernetes control script
<code>kubectl</code> didn’t set the permissions correctly on some of the config files. (Shoutout to Sean Jezewski for helping me
troubleshoot unintuitive stuff like that.)</p>

<p>In case you’re wondering, as did almost everyone I spoke to while I was doing this,
EKS on AWS is not really ready for prime-time yet.</p>

<p>I ended up relying on a script that the Pachyderm guys wrote to deploy Kubernetes
directly on EC2, and just adapted that for our needs.</p>

<p>Things that are great about deploying in the cloud:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Encapsulation is your friend. It’s so much easier when you have complete control of the environment, and there’s no mystery
about what packages are available or what the paths are.</p></li>

<li><p>Scaling becomes relatively easy. Just split your data and run more jobs in parallel.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Things to remember about deploying in the cloud:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Logging is your friend. You won’t be able to debug with print statements on a remote, headless machine. Some of my
teammates didn’t quite understand this until they actually did it. Good logging makes it trivially easy to figure out what went wrong.</p></li>

<li><p>Versioning is your friend. Kubernetes won’t pull the container unless it knows it needs to, so you have to keep renaming your container
if you want to test changes. It’s kind of a pain, but it’s simple enough to
just make it part of the workflow (and our next step is to have Jenkins do this for us as part of our
CICD workflow).</p></li>

<li><p>Having to rebuild the container and version it and push it up each time does a couple of things:</p></li>
</ul>

<p>a) Testing is even more important. It’s a lot nicer if you can do enough testing that after a few bug fixes you’re on version 4, rather than
(as one of my early pipelines is) version 16.</p>

<p>b) It can be a little bit more annoying to push bug fixes/updates (especially without a CICD system
to build and deploy the containers for you)</p>

<hr>



<ul>
<li>People steered us away from EKS, so then setting up our own kubernetes cluster without a
devops person (!) was challenging, mostly because of</li>

<li><p>AWS permissions issues, including but not limited to:</p>

<p>a) giving the cluster the ability to run queries on the RDS database in the same account</p>

<p>b) creating a separate VPC for Redshift so I could create a peering connection for that (see separate post)</p>

<p>c) giving the cluster the ability to access s3 buckets</p>

<p>d) giving my team access to the docker registries on ECS</p>

<p>e) stupid things like legacy s3 bucket region restrictions that are (or should be?)
going away any minute now(?), but EC2 still cares about, which generate completely
uninformative AccessDenied errors</p></li>

<li><p>Figuring out the workflow for deploying and debugging. This was a little weird at first, but once I got the hang of it,
actually very easy (more on that below)</p></li>

<li><p>Setting up a docker registry and using that (and we don’t have Jenkins handling that for us yet)</p></li>

<li><p>Managing two clusters on two separate accounts, and switching between them (learning in hard mode is not
always twice as fun as just learning!)</p></li>

<li><p>There is a built-in outlet to connect Pachyderm up with Prometheus, but no built-in monitoring means we’re doing it downstream
(i.e with automated email alerts sent from Looker if something fails) or manually checking via the
CLI or dashboard view. I have been using the CLI thus far, but now that we have more than a few pipelines
going on one cluster, the dashboard is starting to make more sense.</p></li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">




<p>A small list of methods for fast file system navigation from the command line.
While I tried all of them and finally settled on a minimal approach described at the end, the article doesn’t advocate for one method over the others.
Different users have different needs and should choose the approach most suitable in their circumstances.</p>

<h2 id="spring">Spring</h2>

<p>At the beginning, just after learning to use the command line, my terminal navigation included a lot of <code>cd</code> and a lot of <code>ls</code>.
I jumped around folders, learned shortcuts like, <code>cd ~</code>, <code>cd -</code>, and started becoming familiar with the shell.
Having multi-argument commands for quick file manipulation felt powerful and fresh, or so I remember.</p>

<p>After going to command line you no longer have to open folders in a graphical window manager, scan their names, use <code>&lt;ctrl + mouse click&gt;</code> to select them, and then drag the mouse to move those selected folders to another place.
You do <code>'mv pattern* place/'</code> instead.
All is nice.</p>

<p>But there was one problem.</p>

<h2 id="summer">Summer</h2>

<p>Along the way I started organizing my folders using a structure like this:</p>

<pre><code>└── work
    ├── bitbucket
    │   └── user1
    │       ├── repo1
    │       └── repo2
    ├── github
    │   ├── user1
    │   │   ├── repo1
    │   │   └── repo2
    │   ├── user2
    │   │   ├── repo1
    │   │   └── repo2
    │   ├── user3
    │   │   ├── repo1
    │   │   ├── repo2
    │   │   ├── repo3
    │   │   └── repo4
    │   └── user4
    │       └── repo1
    ├── teaching
    │   ├── class1
    │   │   ├── lecture1
    │   │   └── lecture2
    │   └── class2
    │       ├── lecture1
    │       └── lecture2
    ├─── clients
    │   ├── client1
    │   │   ├── project1
    │   │   ├── project2
    │   │   └── project3
    │   ├── client2
    │   │   ├── project1
    │   │   ├── project2
    │   │   └── project3
    │   └── client3
    │      └── project1
    └─── ...
</code></pre>

<p>I often had to go in and out of various project folders and my <code>cd</code> + <code>ls</code> navigation became tedious.
Reaching a project involved navigating a big tree of directories.
On top of that a lot of directories had similar names which got in the way of tab completion.
This is where I found “z” - a command line utility that tracks your most visited folders based on frequency and recency<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote"><sup>◦</sup></a>.</p>

<p>“z” keeps a database of your most frequently used folders and allows to quickly jump to these folders even if you don’t remember their full name.
Instead of doing a lot of <code>cd</code> + <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code> all you have to do is type <code>'z proj'</code> and <code>z</code> will take you to your most frequently/recently accessed folder that has <code>proj</code> somewhere in its name.
It takes a short amount of time for “z” to learn about your most visited places but after that it becomes quick and convenient.</p>

<p>But there was one problem.</p>

<h2 id="autumn">Autumn</h2>

<p>“z” didn’t always take me where I wanted to be.
It worked, I would say, around 95% of the time or more.
But those other times it took me to an unrelated directory and distracted from the work at hand forcing to navigate my way back using the old <code>cd</code>.
Moreover, sometimes I moved and renamed various folders which likely contributed to its disorientation.</p>

<p>After this experience I decided that the terminal should be dumb and deterministic without any fuzziness or smart guessing.
And here I found <code>marks</code> - a short and sweet command line script for keeping manual directory bookmarks.<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote"><sup>◦</sup></a>
It consisted of 4 tiny functions: one for creating a mark, one for removing, one for listing all the marks, and one for jumping to the bookmarked folder:</p>

<pre><code>export MARKPATH=$HOME/.marks

function mark {
  mkdir -p "$MARKPATH"; ln -s "$(pwd)" "$MARKPATH/$1"
}

function unmark {
  rm -i "$MARKPATH/$1"
}

function marks {
  ls -l "$MARKPATH" | sed 's/  / /g' | cut -d' ' -f9- | sed 's/ -/\t-/g' &amp;&amp; echo
}

function jump {
  cd -P "$MARKPATH/$1" 2&gt;/dev/null || echo "No such mark: $1"
}
</code></pre>

<p>As well as a function generating completion suggestions after pressing <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code>:</p>

<pre><code>_completemarks() {
  local curw=${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}
  local wordlist=$(find $MARKPATH -type l -printf "%f\n")
    COMPREPLY=($(compgen -W '${wordlist[@]}' -- "$curw"))
    return 0
}

complete -F _completemarks jump unmark
</code></pre>

<p>The workflow of marks is manual but convenient.
You have to go into the directory you want to bookmark and execute the <code>mark</code> command followed by the custom name, like <code>'mark myproject'</code>.
After that you can quickly jump back to this bookmarked folder using <code>'jump myproject'</code> and when the bookmark is no longer relevant you can get rid of it with <code>'unmark myproject'</code>.</p>

<p>With this approach the user is in control.
There is no secret smart behaviour which means no auto-magic and no surprises.
And after moving a project to another place the bookmark can be easily adjusted to point to its new location immediately, without waiting for a hidden automatic process to update its location, frequency, and recency.</p>

<p>But there was one problem.</p>

<h2 id="winter">Winter</h2>

<p>Neither of those <code>jump</code> nor <code>z</code> commands could take me everywhere I needed to go.
So the typical workflow would start with jumping to a project via the <code>jump</code> command but then switching to the old navigation via <code>cd</code> once inside it.
Which meant that for navigating the file system I always had to keep using both: <code>jump</code> and <code>cd</code>.
And having two distinct commands for doing the same thing felt a bit weird.
This is where I learned about the <code>$CDPATH</code><a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote"><sup>◦</sup></a> variable and rolled out my own solution.</p>

<p>All you have to do is add this to your .bashrc:</p>

<pre><code>export CDPATH=.:~/.marks/
</code></pre>

<p>Then, to add a bookmark called <code>@name</code> pointing to a <code>"dir"</code> directory:</p>

<pre><code>ln -sr dir ~/.marks/@name
</code></pre>

<p>To delete a bookmark:</p>

<pre><code>rm ~/.marks/@name
</code></pre>

<p>To jump to its location:</p>

<pre><code>cd @name
</code></pre>

<p>And to list all available bookmarks:</p>

<pre><code>cd @&lt;tab&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>$CDPATH</code> solution works best when all the bookmarks are started with a special symbol which in my case was <code>@</code>.
This solves a couple of problems.
One, the bookmarked directories, if prefixed with <code>@</code> symbol, will not interfere with directories in the current folder.
Second, all the available bookmarks will be displayed by typing <code>'cd @&lt;tab&gt;'</code>.
And third, all bookmarks are now part of <code>cd</code> and so they gain tab completion for free.
You can even use tab completion for jumping directly to folders nested within bookmarks by doing <code>'cd @bookmark/subfolder/'</code>.</p>

<p>Using this method you no longer have to maintain a short list of custom bookmark functions and their autocompletion in your .bashrc.
And command for “change directory” can always be done with the same old and familiar <code>cd</code> command, independant of context.</p>

<p>But there was one problem.</p>

<h2 id="springagain">Spring again</h2>

<p>After working with the <code>$CDPATH</code> approach for a while I began noticing something peculiar.
At no point in time did I have a list with a dozen or more bookmarks.
Instead I found myself constantly going to the same 2 or 3 projects, finishing them, removing them from <code>~/.marks/</code> folder, adding new ones, and repeating the cycle again.
Why would someone keep bookmarks for 3 directories?</p>

<p>This time, instead of changing the command, I tried to do something different and changed the folder structure.
My projects moved from the state of being relevant to being archived so why not create an archive directory and organize folders based not on their name or type but on state?
Thus the <code>"zzz"</code> folder was born.
And now my project structure looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>└── work
    ├── active_project1
    ├── active_project2
    └── zzz
        ├── bitbucket
        │   └── user1
        │       ├── repo1
        │       └── repo2
        ├── github
        │   ├── user1
        │   │   ├── repo1
        │   │   └── repo2
        │   ├── user2
        │   │   ├── repo1
        │   │   └── repo2
        │   ├── user3
        │   │   ├── repo1
        │   │   ├── repo2
        │   │   ├── repo3
        │   │   └── repo4
        │   └── user4
        │       └── repo1
        ├── teaching
        │   ├── class1
        │   │   ├── lecture1
        │   │   └── lecture2
        │   └── class2
        │       ├── lecture1
        │       └── lecture2
        ├─── clients
        │   ├── client1
        │   │   ├── project1
        │   │   ├── project2
        │   │   └── project3
        │   ├── client2
        │   │   ├── project1
        │   │   ├── project2
        │   │   └── project3
        │   └── client3
        │      └── project1
        └─── ...
</code></pre>

<p>With this structure the bookmarking systems no longer provide big benefits as most frequent and recent folders are always under ~/work/some_project.
And since at any timepoint only a few of them are visible the tab completion will do its job: <code>'cd ~/w&lt;tab&gt;/s&lt;tab&gt;'</code>.</p>

<p>The name <code>"zzz"</code> might seem strange but is convenient: the letters “zzz” symbolically mark the projects within as being in a “sleeping” state while the 3 “z” letters in a row make sure that this folder is always placed at the very end of your active project list.
A nice folder structure is still maintained in the archive but for the ease of access all active folders are layed flat under the <code>~/work/</code> directory.
When the project is paused or completed it is moved to its place within the <code>"zzz"</code> hierarchy, maintaining the previous structure.
There is one extra benefit - contents of the <code>"work"</code> directory act as a reminder about all the projects that are in progress.
If necessary a to-do list with concrete details might be placed at the same level.</p>

<p>And just like that, like a newbie, I navigate the file system with <code>cd</code> and <code>ls</code> again.</p>

                    <p>Recently I've been reflecting on the (loosely defined) quality and popularity of programing languages. Despite growing appreciation for static typing and compilers (whether in fully-compiled languages like Java or with JIT recently introduced in PHP or Ruby), 2 dynamic, scripting languages pushed their way up in the popularity rankings in the last couple of years. These languages are JavaScript and Python.</p><p>While JavaScript has had a huge advantages of having its interpreter installed on most of computers and of being the only language that could be directly executed in the browser, Python's success on the surface seems more unexpected and less obvious. In this post I'm going to think and try to find out why Python has won against other, similar languages.</p><p>If you can think some other reasons you'd like to share, drop me a message or leave a comment in the discussions linked below. And if you enjoy my content, make sure to check out my YouTube channel where I share career-related advice for programmers.</p><figure><img src="https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-17-at-11.38.27-PM.png" alt="Chart showing popularity of programming languages over time according to TIOBE index; Python popularity remains rather steady from 2005 to 2018 and then suddenly grows" srcset="https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-17-at-11.38.27-PM.png 600w, https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-17-at-11.38.27-PM.png 933w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>TIOBE creates one of the most popular (hard to evaluate quality) rankings of programming languages popularity</figcaption></figure><h2 id="competitors">Competitors</h2><p>In a relatively short period of time, between 1987 and 1995, a few major and influential languages were created. Among them there were a couple of high-level scripting languages that gained a lot of popularity and that remain used and are developed until today:</p><ul><li><strong>Python</strong> was created by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer working at a research institute. Inspired by ABC, created at the institution where van Rossum worked at that time, Python was initially created in late 1980s. Driven by values like explicitness, simplicity and readability, 30 years later Python is among the most popular languages in the world and is heavily used in many areas like machine learning, academia or web development</li><li><strong>PHP</strong> wasn't really meant to be a language, but rather a preprocessor which was supposed to help generating HTML more dynamically. Created in 1994 in Canada, PHP quickly gained popularity as a new, easy way to create websites that can connect to database and dynamically generate content before sending it to the user. It's been 20 years since arguably the most influential version of PHP was released (4.0). Today PHP team aims to release version 8 soon, and the language they develop, despite a lot of competition, continues to power a significant portion of websites and web applications all around the world.</li><li><strong>Perl</strong> might not be so well known by younger readers due to a complicated history over the last 15 years, but once it was a language of hackers and programming enthusiasts. Its development started in 1987, the last major version, Perl 5, &nbsp;was released in 2000, but a new one, Perl 7 (the history of Perl 6 is complicated) is just around the corner. Perl does not have a single purpose like PHP. While it has been used extensively as a backend server language, it's also used for some system tools in utilities in GNU/Linux.</li><li><strong>Ruby</strong> is a creation of Japanese programmer, Yukihiro Matsumoto, who wanted to create a language that would be pleasant to work with. Programmer's happiness, freedom and flexibility are values that drove the development of the language. The project waas started in 1993, and in December 2020, a new major version, Ruby 3, is expected. While Ruby gained worldwide popularity thanks to a web framework, Ruby on Rails, and is often considered a web programming language, it has significant usage in other domains like server tooling and, primarily in Japan, embedded devices</li><li><strong>JavaScript </strong>is kind of a guest in this article, as I can't say that it's clearly less popular than Python, so I will mention it here and there. Created in 1995 in USA it started as a language to be included in Netscape Navigator browser. Its goal was to add more dynamic elements to websites. It later became de facto standard for other browsers, and in early 2010s, with creation of NodeJS, it moved out of the browser to become a general purpose language. While it remains primarily used for the web, we see an increase in number of desktop applications and various utilities created in JavaScript (or one of languages compiling to JS like TypeScript).</li></ul><figure><img src="https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/2020/09/scripting-creators.jpg" alt="Collage of multiple photos.

While Ruby has been my go to language for many years, I understand why others might prefer basically any other language from the list and they can make very valid arguments to justify their choice. </p><p>Over time all these languages became more and more similar to each other. Don't get me wrong, there are still major differences between them - different philosophies, syntaxes, different legacy issues - in the recent years they all became much closer to each other in terms of features though. So while I am sure that certain features can drive the initial interest and usage of the language (PHP made it simple to generate dynamic websites, Perl's syntax was created with linguistic principles in mind), I don't think that Python won because of having tuples, shorter syntax or enforced indentation. There must be more than that.</p><h3 id="corporate-adoption">Corporate adoption</h3><p>A strong corporate player which adopts some language in its own software and openly declares it can be a huge boost for the language popularity. Even more if the language is created by the company. The success of Java as an enterprise language is owed at least in part to marketing efforts of Sun. C# would never reach its current position if it wasn't created and promoted by Microsoft.</p><p>While Python was created as a hobby project and not a business tool, it got some strong support in 2000s, with Google as the biggest company adopting Python. Neither of the other languages has ever received such a strong support. Even though Facebook was initially written in PHP, today it's hard to see any PHP code among their open source projects (beside Hack, their language built from PHP).</p><p>Corporate support does not guarantee success - Dart created by Google is still actively developed, but never reached popularity of Python or even Go (another Google's language). Therefore it can't be the solely reason explaining Python's popularity over other languages, but it gave Python a big boost in 2010s and the age of data science.</p><figure><img src="https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/2020/09/python-google-academia.png" alt="logo Google, +, logo of Python, +, academic hat" srcset="https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/python-google-academia.png 600w, https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/2020/09/python-google-academia.png 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Google and other corporations that adopted Python together with academia boosted language adoption</figcaption></figure><h3 id="academia-and-first-mover-advantage">Academia and first mover advantage</h3><p>I'm pretty sure you know the history of QWERTY - the keyboard layout used by nearly 100% of people using Latin alphabet (with some minor modifications in various countries). QWERTY was not designed for fast typing - quite the opposite, its goal was to prevent people from typing too fast, because that blocked the typing machines, which were very common before invention of modern computers. The old limitations do not apply anymore, yet we still use the same suboptimal layout. Why? Because everyone else uses is. Because almost every keyboard in the world is designed with this layout in mind, and making people switch would require enormous effort.</p><p>It's quite hard to change habit as an individual, and even harder as a large group of individuals with their own opinions. I believe this is one of the reasons behind lasting popularity of some programing languages. Let's take PHP - since early 2000s it's been supported by basically any hosting provider. If you wanted to run applications in Python you had to buy VPS and install the interpreter on your own, or ask the admin to provide it for you. And PHP was already there, so why not to use it instead?</p><p>This might be a bit of a stretch, but I think a similar thing can be said about Python in academia. Yes, technically it wasn't the first language used by academic institutions, but I believe it was the first language that allowed scientists to write high-level code and provided them with large set of functions that allowed scientists to work with complex numbers and equations. While significantly slower than PHP, Python allowed everyone to quickly build prototypes which later could be moved to C or C++ if performance was the problem.</p><p>With the rise of open source and growing number of available libraries, Python became go-to scripting language in academia and while there are other tools that might be more popular (looking at MATLAB for calculations and Java as intro to programming for students), Python's position is very strong, and any language that will try to take its position has to compete against 20+ years of work on libraries and tools written for scientists.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->  
  
<!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="the-rise-of-the-new">The rise of the new</h3><p>Together with the two reasons above comes timing and the changes happening in software industry. In the last few years the large web frameworks started losing steam. Growing popularity of microservices and function-as-a-service, together with some benefits of using the same language for the client and the API, pushed adoption of JavaScript as the language of the web (there were more reasons for sure). Other languages which were primarily used in the webdev had to either find other niches or accept losing popularity.</p><p>At the same time another area started gaining huge popularity - data science. Such a powerful, new discipline had a chance to open door for new players - in terms of business, technological advancement, and (among many others) programming tools. It also helped Python to establish and strengthen its position as the programming language on the verge of science and engineering.</p><figure><img src="https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/2020/09/python-ecosystem.png" alt="Collage of logos.

<h2>Why I Quit a $500K Job at Amazon to Work for Myself</h2>



<p>Last week I left my cushy job at Amazon after 8 years. Despite getting rewarded repeatedly with promotions, compensation, recognition, and praise, I wasn’t motivated enough to do another year.</p>



<p>I spent my entire time in AWS building tools for developers. I liked that field so much that I would have been satisfied working in it for the rest of my life.</p>



<p>I joined Amazon as an entry level developer. Within 3.5 years I had been promoted twice to a senior engineer, and I was practically guaranteed another promotion to principal engineer this year if I had stayed. My potential at the company was high, I was told.</p>



<p>My esteem within the company grew along the years and I was regarded an expert and a leader in my field. People looked up to me and respected me.</p>



<p>I made $75K in my first year and that gradually grew to $511K by my last year. I could have made another $1M if I stayed another couple of years.</p>



<p>My work–life balance was good too, despite Amazon’s reputation. I didn’t need to prove myself anymore, and I could get everything done in 40 hours a week. My team worked from home one day a week, and I rarely opened my laptop at night or weekends.</p>



<p>Also, the people I worked with were exceptional. I had three managers in total, and all were generous people with lots of empathy. I’m very grateful to everyone I worked with.</p>



<p>Everything was going well and getting better. But despite all this, my motivation to go to work each morning was decreasing—almost in an inverse trend to my career and income growth.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://i0.wp.com/danielvassallo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rewards_motivation-2340812862-1549830899929.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1" alt="Rewards up, motivation down." srcset="https://i0.wp.com/danielvassallo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rewards_motivation-2340812862-1549830899929.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/danielvassallo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rewards_motivation-2340812862-1549830899929.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/danielvassallo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rewards_motivation-2340812862-1549830899929.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/danielvassallo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rewards_motivation-2340812862-1549830899929.png?resize=1100%2C619&amp;ssl=1 1100w, https://i0.wp.com/danielvassallo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rewards_motivation-2340812862-1549830899929.png?w=1801&amp;ssl=1 1801w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Rewards up, motivation down.</figcaption></figure>



<p>It would have been foolish of me to expect my motivation to start increasing if I got yet another promotion, or another compensation bump, or another big project. But there was something else that was trending down with my motivation. It was my freedom.</p>



<h3>The Motivation Decline</h3>



<p>For the first couple of years my motivation was off the charts. I was mostly working with another person on an internal tool, and there was very little scrutiny around it. It was a time where I had a lot of independence in choosing how to work and what to work on—at least relative to more recent years.  It was just me and the other person improving this thing, talking to users, releasing updates, testing it, and everything else. Whatever we felt was important, we generally got to do. We did the best work we could for its own sake and we were mostly self-directed.</p>



<p>The last couple of years, however, were quite different. I was leading the most important project in the history of my department, with many stakeholders and complex goals. What I could do was always bounded by my ability to convince all the people involved that it was the best way to navigate our goals. </p>



<p>I was always going to be working on somebody else’s terms at Amazon. The terms were simple in the beginning (keep fixing the thing), but kept getting more complicated as the years passed by (maximize all goals; satisfy all stakeholders). Then there were other restrictions inherent to working in a large organization about how to do the work, what work to do, what goals to set, and what business was worth pursuing. This situation was squeezing me into doing things that I’d rather not do, and vice versa.</p>



<h3 id="mce_19">Finding New Motivation</h3>



<p>What kind of work would I do if I had to do it forever? Not something that I did until I reached some milestone (an exit), but something that I would consider satisfactory if I continued to do it until I’m 80. What is out there that I could do that would make me excited waking up every day for the next 45 years that could also earn me enough money to cover my expenses? Is that too unambitious? I don’t think so. Because there are two types of drivers that get me out of bed in the morning.</p>



<p>One comes from the outside in the form of a carrot or a stick. For instance, I’m not automatically driven to do my tax returns every April, but I make sure I do because I don’t want to go to prison. Or I might not want to work on something I dislike, but I do so anyway because I may need to pay the bills, or want to buy a fancy car. These are the extrinsic motivators.</p>



<p>The other comes from within. This is what drives me to do things when there isn’t a carrot or a stick. Hobbies are one activity driven by this. But what I was looking for was something that I could do for a living that was also driven by this type of motivation: the intrinsic kind.</p>



<p>Back to the question of whether this is too unambitious. See, I realized that extrinsic motivation doesn’t last. Whenever I got promoted, it felt good for a week, and then it was as over. When I first hit $100K income, I would take a peek at my W2 for a few days admiring the six digits, but then it wore off. When I hit $200K, $300K, $400K, and $500K, it was the same thing. I would be delusional to think that earning $1M, or $10M would suddenly make it different. And I feel the same with every other extrinsic reward or material possession. Getting them feels good for a while, but this wears off quickly.</p>



<p>The things that don’t wear off are those that I’ve been doing since I was a kid, when nothing was forcing me to do them. Things such as writing code, selling my creations, charting my own path, calling it like I saw it. I know my strengths, and I know what motivates me, so why not do this all the time? I’m lucky to live in a time where I can do something independently in my area of expertise without requiring large amounts of capital or outside investors. So that’s what I’m doing.</p>



<h3>What’s Next?</h3>



<p>I’m going all in on independence, and I’m going to try to make a living with my own bare hands starting from nothing. I don’t expect to only do things that I like, but it will be on my terms. My target is to cover my family’s expenses before I run out of savings while doing something that intrinsically motivates me. What more would I ever want to be satisfied with my work?</p>

  <p>Relativity is one of my favorite topics in physics. Its origins were almost pure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein's_thought_experiments">logic puzzle science</a>, which in my opinion is one of the most fun and satisfying types of science. Most people have a vague sense of what relativity is – the speed of light is finite, and something about time travel? – but they don’t really know what it is, which is too bad because the principles are very simple, and the results are pretty awesome.</p>

<p>There are two halves of relativity as Einstein developed it: special relativity and general relativity.</p>

<p>Special relativity is, at heart, two ideas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The laws of physics are the same to everyone everywhere, as long as they are using a non-accelerating (“inertial”) frame of reference.</li>
  <li>The speed of light in a vacuum is the same regardless of frame of reference.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before Einstein, these two things were widely considered to be paradoxical: how could it be that the speed of light is constant for everyone – its velocity is not added to your velocity, if you are moving – but also physics doesn’t depend on your perspective? What Einstein did was take both of these things seriously and realized that when you put them together, you get a space-time connection and lot of other really powerful stuff.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation">time dilation</a> immediately falls out. Imagine that you are standing on the platform of a train station while a train flies past, and your friend is onboard the train. If your friend puts a mirror on the ceiling of the train car and, lying on the floor, points a flashlight at it, he will see the light reflected back at him having gone up in a straight line and returned in a straight line to the floor. However, from your perspective on the platform, while the light is traveling up and down, it is also traveling sideways. This means the path it travels is <em>longer</em> than the path it appears to travel to your friend. Since the speed of light is constant, and the distance between the floor and the ceiling don’t change, from your perspective, time must be passing more slowly for your friend than for you. And indeed this is an experimentally tested real effect! (For example, you need to take it into account for GPS to work reliably.) It is important to note that your friend, on the train, never feels anything different: from their perspective, time is passing just fine at the same rate it always does. The effect is entirely about the difference in your perspectives.</p>

<p>The idea that the laws of physics are the same of everyone is sometimes called “general covariance” and is really important for the tractability of a description of physics overall. There isn’t necessarily a guarantee that it would be true in our universe, but it turns out that it is.</p>

<p>General relativity adds one more idea: when an observer is using an accelerating (“non-inertial”) frame of reference, the laws of physics might appear to be different, and that difference shows up as a gravitational field.</p>

<p>For example, if you are in a car accelerating on the highway and you throw a ball into the air, it will veer towards the back of the car. You know that this is because the car is accelerating - but it is also completely equivalent to model this as a gravitational field coming from the back of a non-accelerating car! In fact, the equivalence principle says that if you were in a windowless box that was either being accelerated by a rope or is in the presence of a gravitational field, there is no measurement you could make that would tell them apart.</p>

<p>The language of physics is math, and so while it’s easy to get the big ideas that underlie relativity, getting the full depth of the implications requires going to the equations. The math of special relativity is mostly pretty easy – you can get surprisingly far with high school level math – but general relativity is a completely different beast, and one of the reasons Einstein’s original GR papers are so challenging is because the math really required to do it well (e.g. differential geometry) didn’t exist at the time. Einstein had the realization that the universe has no sense of coordinates, just a way of measuring distances between events, which he described as “no prior geometry,” but it took a while for the full mathematical description of what this actually meant to be worked out.</p>

<p>Anyway, relativity is incredibly trippy and fascinating, so if you’ve liked this sneak peek I highly recommend checking out Einstein’s short 1916 book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity:_The_Special_and_the_General_Theory">“Relativity: The Special and the General Theory”</a> which is written for laypeople and uses very little math while still walking you through the core of it all with Einstein’s unique incisive clarity. General relativity is certainly one of the most beautiful things in all of science (possibly <em>the</em> most; quantum field theory is very cool too, though it lacks the intrinsic elegance of GR), and I wish more people had the chance to understand and appreciate it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p><strong>A cruel</strong> <strong>deception</strong> – <strong>RAF pilot</strong> <strong>remains</strong> discovered in <strong>North Korea</strong> is a story that once I had the full details of the aftermath several years later, quite frankly left me speechless and angry.</p><p>In early 2004, I was contacted at the embassy in Pyongyang by David Hinton, the brother of an RAF pilot who had been shot down in 1952 over North Korea during the Korean war. He said he had been working for several years trying to garner as much information from a variety of primary sources as to the fate of his brother.Â&nbsp; He said he now had in his possession most of the details of the shoot down supplied by eyewitness United States Air Force (USAF) pilots and map coordinates of the site of the crash (which he later sent to me).</p><p>He then expressed a wish to be able to visit North Korea and hopefully, finally discover the fate of his brother. Could we help?</p><p>The background was that the pilot, Flt Lt Desmond Hinton, who received the Distinguished Flying Cross in World War II for shooting down two Japanese fighters had bailed out of his burning F84e Thunderjet whilst carrying out a strafing mission north east of Pyongyang on 2 January 1952. At the time, Flt Lt Hinton was one of a number of RAF pilots who were attached to and flying with the USAF. Despite enquiries after the war and with no further information as to his fate forthcoming, Flt Lt Hinton was subsequently officially listed as missing in action.</p><div id="gallery-1"><figure><p><a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/british-diplomat-works-with-north-korean-military/thumbnail-1/#main"><img width="400" height="311" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/thumbnail-1-1.jpg?fit=400%2C311&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" alt="Flt Lt Hinton North Korea" aria-describedby="gallery-1-980" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/thumbnail-1-1.jpg?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/thumbnail-1-1.jpg?resize=300%2C233&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/thumbnail-1-1.jpg?fit=400%2C311&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "></a></p><figcaption id="gallery-1-980"> Flt Lt Hinton with USAF colleagues -Photo David Hinton</figcaption></figure></div><p>I knew that this was going to be a tall order to try and carry out. The Korean War itself was and still is a huge propaganda tool for the Kim dynasty. So requesting assistance in finding a hated enemy, albeit a fallen one, was perhaps a request too far.</p><p>But surprisingly, no.</p><p>Permission was granted for me to meet with the North Korean military and at the initial meeting, I provided them with all the research material sent to me by David Hinton and they said they would investigate.</p><p><em><strong>The</strong><strong> process of making this project happen, working with the North Korean military, I have covered in a previous post</strong></em> <a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/british-diplomat-works-with-north-korean-military/">British Diplomat Works With North Korean Military </a></p><p>Against all expectations, the military did get back to me shortly afterwards with some quite startling news. Based on the information I had given them, they had identified the crash site which was close to a village called Kuso-ri/Gueso-ri situated near to what is currently the main airport for Pyongyang.</p><p>They had spoken with villagers including two elders who had witnessed the shoot down. Flt Lt Hinton had indeed ejected but his parachute failed and he was killed on impact. The villagers had then interred him in an unmarked grave in a field adjacent to the village. An exact location had been identified and human bones and fragments of uniform and aircraft had been uncovered. <em><strong>This scenario is somewhat similar to my previous post</strong> </em><a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/tragic-raf-pilots-secret-grave-discovered-in-albania/">Tragic RAF Pilotâ€™s Secret Grave Discovered In Albania</a></p><p>With this discovery, events moved quickly. A visa for David to enter North Korea was fast tracked and he duly arrived hopeful for some form of final closure. During his visit, he was treated as an honoured guest by the North Koreans and enjoyed the rare distinction of being accompanied throughout his visit by a senior Korean People’s Army officer, Colonel Kwak Chol-hui, who was at that time Director of Negotiations for Remains at the armistice site at Panmunjom.</p><p>So, on the day appointed to visit the village to view the grave, we arrived early and were met by the Colonel and both witnesses who then led us to the gravesite which was a short distance away.</p><p>The grave consisted simply of a mound of earth surrounded by a white picket fence, without any inscription. It lay close to a narrow footpath on a hillside 200 meters from the road.</p><p>David was introduced at the grave to the two witnesses to Desmond’s crash, a Mr Ri and Mr Han, local villagers who were only 13-years old at the time of the incident but who still appeared to have perfect recollections of the event. Perhaps a little too perfect and too detailed I thought at the time. But, maybe it was just me being a tad too cynical.</p><p>David then gave a short speech at the grave, thanking Colonel Kwak and the British embassy for making his visit possible, while the head of the village promised to tend the grave and paint the fence regularly.</p><p>We spent about 2 hours in the village and at the gravesite before it was time to leave. We said farewell to the Colonel and the witnesses and set off back to Pyongyang and David left North Korea the next day.</p><p>Upon his return to the UK, he was kind enough to send me copies of the many photographs he had taken that day and which I still have.</p><p>I learnt later that in 2011, a casket containing the bones of Flt Lt Hinton had been passed with great ceremony to the then British ambassador to North Korea for repatriation and presumably for burial at the UN Korean War cemetery in Busan, South Korea.</p><p><strong>And here the story would have finally ended. But no!</strong></p><p>The British Daily Mail ran a story on 17th June 2018 that was a shocker to me. It was revealed that subsequent DNA testing carried out on the bones after the repatriation identified them not as those of Flt Lieutenant Hinton but those of an animal!</p><p>According to the paper, family members were informed but the media was kept in the dark for fear of damaging relations between North Korea and the UK. Don’t you just love political machinations!</p><p>The paper then went on to quote the source as the memoirs of Mr Thae Yong-Ho, a North Korean diplomat who was Deputy North Korean Ambassador to the UK at the time and who defected to South Korea in 2016.</p><p>It also came as North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un had agreed with US President Donald Trump at their Singapore summit that all remains of US servicemen who died in the Korean War would now be returned.</p><p>Interestingly, the New York Times ran a story on 1st August 2018 detailing how difficult it had been to identify remains of American MIA’s handed over by the North Koreans to the US as a result of the Agreement with the paper also quoting the Hinton DNA story.</p><p>Mr Thae maintained that the Hinton episode was a case of crass incompetence. He also stated that Britain did protest but North Korean officials countered by saying they lacked the proper equipment to distinguish human from animal bones.</p><p>To this day, I cannot believe how stupid the North Koreans behaved in this matter. They must have known that DNA would be carried out on the bones.Â&nbsp; If so, why did they release them?</p><p>A country that has a nuclear programme, the ability to launch missiles and a sophisticated scientific infrastructure coming out with such a lame excuse just didn’t hold water.</p><p>I might add that at the time of the Hinton project, Mr Thae was well known to the embassy in Pyongyang, both professionally and socially. He was an experienced diplomat at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs where as part of his portfolio, he was in charge of the UK desk, hence the contacts. So, he would have been well aware (and probably involved behind the scenes) in what developed.</p><p>So what should have been a positive North Korean story about the discovery and dignified burial of a fallen RAF pilot and the assistance given to a close relative to enable him to pay his last respects, in the end turned out to be nothing but a cruel and wicked deception.</p><p><em><strong>Sources:</strong></em></p><p>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5852503/Remains-RAF-hero-shot-North-Korea-2011-turns-animal-bones.html</p><p>“Cryptography From the Third-<wbr>Floor Secretariatâ€� 2018 Thae Yong-Ho</p><div heateor-sss-data-href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/a-cruel-deception-raf-pilots-remains-discovered-in-north-korea/"><p>Spread the love</p><ul><li><a data-pin-lang="en_US" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/a-cruel-deception-raf-pilots-remains-discovered-in-north-korea/" data-pin-count="false" data-pin-do="buttonPin" data-pin-config="beside"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/assets.pinterest.com/images/pidgets/pinit_fg_en_rect_gray_20.png?w=845" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/assets.pinterest.com/images/pidgets/pinit_fg_en_rect_gray_20.png?w=845"></a></li></ul></div></div></div>]]>

<p>I live in an inner-city apartment. There’s a concrete slab, brick walls, and no ceiling cavity access. Oh, and we rent, so drilling into things is frowned upon. The home automation potential in a scenario like this consists of some coloured lights, and watering about four plants on a timer. It’s not exactly an inspiring IoT site. There’s also not much wrong with the humble light switch that works instantly, every time.</p>



<p>In complete contrast to this, my parents live on 100 acres / 40 hectares of land, a few hours out of the city. It’s quintessential rural Australia. They’re mostly off the grid: there’s a skerrick of Telstra 4G signal, and some power, except when there isn’t, which is surprisingly often. This is an absolute IoT playground, and we’ve given that a fair crack over the seven years as they’ve established themselves there.</p>



<h2>Opportunity</h2>



<p>On a property like this, water is critical. There are the basic living requirements, the opportunity of gardens, and the very real risk of bushfires. All up, we have ~300,000 litres of water tanks on the property, and then a small dam and two creeks. We use sensors to track tank volumes. We measure flow rates at key plumbing points (for both instantaneous oversight and tracking cumulative usage). We use power meters to detect when pressure pumps are running.</p>



<p>Energy management is also important. Whilst there is the option of grid connectivity, we try to run as off-grid as possible, or at least export-only. This requires some smarts around load management. For example, instead of just having a hot water system that aggressively chases a specific temperature, we want the hot water systems to head for a temperature range, but only use excess solar production to do it. If there’s a bit less sun for the day, it’s ok if the water it a few degrees cooler: don’t burn down the batteries or import power just to hit a specific temperature.</p>



<p>And then there’s a safety aspect. The property is on the top of an escarpment where storms can roll in fast from a few different directions. By running things like lightning sensors on the property, we can trigger our own localised alerts for approaching storms.</p>



<h2>Challenges</h2>



<p>The challenge is to convert all these possibilities into something real, that works, and doesn’t cost an absolute mint. Over the years, we found this incredibly hard to solve for. You’ll find a solution for measuring tank volume, but it comes with its own LoRA gateway, a cloud dependency, and a new app. You’ll find a cheap Z-Wave temperature sensor, but it’s only really good for a room, and doesn’t have a probe that you can put into the measurement point in a hot water system. You’ll find a flow meter, but it’s only an industrial solution that wants to talk RS485 serial. Who even does that anymore⁈ You’ll find a garage door opener that works for the extra-high roller doors on the shed, but it has its own 433MHz RF remote.</p>



<p>It’s easy to end up with a horrible mishmash of radio technologies, software platforms, and APIs, not to mention some scary pricing as you drift from the traditional world of home automation into the more dated world of industrial automation.</p>



<h2>Goal</h2>



<p>We want to be able to dream up crazy new ideas, pick and choose the right sensors, and then integrate them with relative ease and consistency. That means a balance between the ability to build new things ourselves, but not having to go and custom fabricate a circuit board and write new firmware just to add a new sensor.</p>



<h2>Considerations</h2>



<h3>Sense</h3>



<p>Most sensors give out some kind of analogue signal (like a pressure sensor where the output voltage varies from 0V to 5V depending on applied pressure), a pulse (like a flow meter that pulses once for every 500mL of water that flows through it), or a digital signal (like a temperate and humidity sensor with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1-Wire">1-Wire</a> output).</p>



<p>To handle all of these scenarios, we’ll need some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPIO">GPIO pins</a> (the most basic of digital connections), and something with an analogue-to-digital-converter onboard (so that we can measure that variable pressure scenario).</p>



<h3>Affect</h3>



<p>Most of the outputs that we’re dealing with are straight up binary: turn a pump on, open a valve, flash a light. This means that they can be again driven by some GPIO pins, paired with an appropriately sized relay.</p>



<p>For more complex outputs, like sound, we can defer back to more consumer-grade hardware, like just broadcasting an announcement on the Google Home speaker in the kitchen.</p>



<h3>Plug and Play</h3>



<p>As much as we’re building things ourselves, we don’t need to put too many barriers in front of ourselves. We’re after a module that we can connect sensors to easily, without too much soldering, and certainly not having to build up our own circuit boards / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veroboard">Veroboard</a>. We want to be out of the lab and into the environment as fast as possible.</p>



<h3>Secure</h3>



<p>There’s a persistent joke about how the ‘S’ in IoT stands for security.</p>



<p>Security was absolutely a consideration for us though: both on-property, and when it comes to remote access. When you’re switching things like power, or controlling a precious resource like water, you want to be confident that you’re the only person in control.</p>



<p>Our preference has been to keep connectivity and control local to the property, via authenticated connections, and then apply a separate remote access approach further up the stack. This means the hardware needs to have enough power and smarts to handle secured local connections, and not be dependent on its own path to the internet.</p>



<h3>Compute</h3>



<p>Some sensors require both precise timing and persistence to count things like pulses and turn them into natural measures. For example, a flow meter might give you a signal pulse for very 500mL of water that flows through it. If you miss a pulse and stop counting for a bit, you’re missing water. Our preference has been to count pulses on the hardware attached to the sensor, and then report back the natural values (L/min, L/day) whenever the network and central compute is available. We want to keep sensor-specific concepts, like pulses, at the sensor, and just send meaningful information over the network.</p>



<p>As much as we want things to be connected, they can still be somewhat smart in their own right. If a hardware module has both a temperature sensor and a relay to turn a heating element on and off, it’s perfectly capable of being a thermostat on its own, regardless of what’s happening to the wider network or any centralised compute. It will be <em>smarter</em> when the central controls are online, because it can be aware of other datapoints like the solar charge status, but it doesn’t have to be totally bound to the availability of those other systems to operate its basic function. Achieving this balance requires us to be able to run basic logic directly on the module.</p>



<p>The world is not static. If we want to run logic on these devices, and keep them secure, they need to be able to receive firmware updates over-the-air. We don’t want to be clambering around under sheds with laptops to reprogram a thermostat.</p>



<h3>Connect</h3>



<p>Network standards are still the multi-billion-dollar question in IoT.</p>



<p>Early on, we deployed a number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-Wave">Z-Wave</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zigbee">Zigbee</a> based devices. These are two different mesh protocols, at the mid-point of their VHS vs. Betamax battle for dominance. They’re common in consumer automation solutions like smart switches, and good for extremely low power environments, like where you want to be able to throw a temperature sensor in the corner of a room with a coin-cell battery in it and then forget about it for a year. The sensor ecosystem is very consumer focussed (you’ll find a million temperate sensors, but no tank pressure sensors). The communication protocol is constrained: by design, it’s a very low bandwidth data network, operating up to 40kbps for Z-Wave, or a whopping 250kbps for Zigbee. Range is limited to keep within the power limits, so typically as low as ~15-20m. There’s no common way of building on-device logic, and if you do manage to, then it’s incredibly hard to apply firmware updates over-the-air for either of them.</p>



<p>Our exploration continued into LoRA and NB-IoT, but we’ve opted away from both for this property. They’d each be very compelling options if we wanted to cover the larger property, such as if it was more of a working farm with distributed infrastructure than predominantly bushland and gardens with clustered buildings.</p>



<p>Ultimately, we settled on Wi-Fi as our preferred connectivity on the property. We’re already got great coverage throughout the house, cottage, shed, and key outdoor locations via <a href="https://unifi-network.ui.com/">a UniFi deployment</a>. Whilst this is heavily centred on the built infrastructure, and not the full 100 acres of property, that’s where most of the sense-and-act needs to occur anyway. Investing in the Wi-Fi coverage provides other benefits, like <a href="https://www.telstra.com.au/support/mobiles-devices/telstra-wifi-calling">Wi-Fi calling</a> for mobiles where we’re otherwise on the fringe of 4G coverage. The UniFi infrastructure is readily extensible, as <a href="https://larsklint.com/updating-farm-wi-fi-with-ubiquiti-unify/">Lars has proven on his property</a> with the deployment of <a href="https://llamacam.com.au/">Llama Cam</a>, and even <a href="https://larsklint.com/farm-wifi-off-the-grid-with-ubiquiti-solar/">extending the coverage to places without power</a>. Finally, it gives us a pretty amazing management plane that’s a lot nicer to work with than trying to diagnose a Z-Wave/Zigbee mesh.</p>

<h3>Power</h3>



<p>We’re happy to depend on a power source for most devices: they’re usually located near other loads that are already powered, or it’s easy enough to get power to them, such as dropping in a 12V cable out to a water tank at the same time as trenching the plumbing in. If we really want to run on battery, it’ll be ok to have a larger 12v battery and a small solar panel or something: we don’t need to try and run off a coin-cell battery for years on end.</p>

n September 14 2020, Li-Meng Yan, a dissident Chinese virologist, along with three
colleagues, posted an article at <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/4028830">zenodo.org</a>
<sup>[1]</sup> claiming to prove that SARS-CoV-2 was artificially created. Twitter 
canceled the author's account two days later and political activists vociferously 
attacked the paper on political grounds. It is clear that many people don't want to 
hear her evidence. But the issue is extremely important. If the virus was produced 
in an experiment and accidentally released, as this paper claims, it means the Wuhan 
Institute of Virology is in dire need of upgrades to their virus-handling procedures 
to prevent it from happening again.
</p><p>
My background is 30 years as a researcher in protein biochemistry using biophysical 
techniques and molecular biology, including design, cloning, and expression of 
recombinant proteins, to study protein function and structure. Here's a brief
summary of the argument put forward in the paper along with my comments.
</p><p>
<i>Update, Sep 20 2020</i>: I've expanded the comments to describe the evidence they
would need to make their case more convincing.
</p><hr><p>
<b>Claim 1:</b> 
   “[the sequences of] RaTG13, RmYN02, and several pangolin viruses recently
   published are highly suspicious and likely fraudulent.”
   “The RaTG13 virus is excluded from this analysis given the strong evidence 
   suggesting that its sequence may have been fabricated and the virus does not exist 
   in nature.”
</p><p>
<b>Comment:</b>
   RaTG13 was published by Shi Zhengli at the same time as the SARS-CoV-2 sequence. 
   In 2013 Shi also published a partial gene segment of RaBtCoV/4991, which is identical 
   to RaTG13, but it is incomplete. The authors say that the WIV took this partial
   sequence and fraudulently added the remainder to exculpate themselves, trying
   to make it appear that RaTG13 was a pre-existing virus. 
</p><p>
   Evidence in favor of this claim is that Shi <i>et al.</i> made no mention of 
   RaBtCoV/4991 in their 2020 paper. But unless someone wants to claim that 4991 
   was also fabricated, RaBtCoV/4991 had to come from somewhere, which is to say it is 
   a real virus. So Claim 1 doesn't make sense. 
</p><p>
<b>What is needed:</b>
   To prove this the authors would have to find another virus that is 100% identical 
   with the published partial RaBtCoV/4991 sequence but which differs from RaTG13. 
</p><hr><p>

<b>Claim 2:</b> 
   The WIV could have used transgenic hACE2 transgenic mice to improve the virus's
   ability to bind to its receptor. “This animal model 
   has been established during the study of SARS-CoV and has been available in the 
   Jackson Laboratory [a commercial supplier of transgenic mice] for many years.”
   However, hACE2 mice are “not a good model to reflect the virus' transmissibility
   and associated clinical symptoms in humans.” If they had used golden Syrian
   hamster instead, the authors say, “the highly contagious nature of SARS-CoV-2 
   would be extremely evident” and they could have released accurate information.
</p><p>
<b>Comment:</b> 
   This is a good point. If true, it would tend to exculpate the Chinese researchers.
   But we already know many techniques they could have used. No one was claiming 
   that making the virus was impossible. 
</p><p>
<b>What is needed:</b> 
   Sending live animals to another country requires tons of paperwork. They would need
   Jax's sales records or government export records (which might be available via a
   FOIA request). 
</p><hr><p>
<b>Claim 3:</b> 
   The paper provides a flow chart for how the virus could have been constructed.
   “Two restriction sites are present at either end of the RBM [receptor-binding
   motif] of SARS-CoV-2, providing convenience for replacing the RBM within the spike 
   gene.”
</p><p>
<b>Comment:</b> 
   The spike protein consists of two parts: S1, which binds to the receptor, and S2,
   which fuses the viral and cellular membranes. The point where the subunits are joined 
   is called the S1/S2 site. Proteolysis of this site is essential for infection.
   The RBM is the part of S1 that binds to the receptor. A common technique is 
   to take functional domains out of one protein and put them into another. The easiest 
   way to do this is by finding (or creating) restriction sites in the DNA that allow 
   you to cut the DNA in a specific place.
</p><p>
   The flow chart is quite reasonable, but again no one doubted that artificially 
   creating the virus is possible. So describing how someone could have done it
   doesn't tell us much; any competent molecular biologist could come up with
   a similar scheme.
</p><p>
   The article makes a big deal about the presence of restriction sites on the S1/S2 
   sequence, including an <code>EcoRI</code> site and a <code>BstEII</code> site. 
   But this does not indicate engineering. Many restriction sites occur naturally by 
   chance. Their presence is not unusual, but they are a major inconvenience for those 
   of us who try to clone DNA—many restriction sites we might wish to use are 
   ruled out by the presence of another one in an inconvenient location. The 
   probability of finding one of over a thousand known 
   <a href="http://rebase.neb.com/rebase/rebase.html">restriction sites</a> at an 
   arbitrary location in a 3800 base sequence by chance is very high.
</p><p>
<b>What is needed:</b> 
   To prove this convincingly, the authors would need to find an authentic copy 
   of the original virus sequence without the restriction sites to show what the virus 
   was like before the supposed change was made. 
</p><hr><p>
<b>Claim 4:</b> 
   The furin cleavage site contains rare codons, an unusual sequence not shared by other 
   lineage B betacoronaviruses, and a <code>FauI</code> restriction site. It 
   could not have been introduced by evolution, say the authors, and the probability 
   of successful homologous recombination ever occurring among the ancestors of these 
   viruses is low. “A  <code>FauI</code> restriction site is formulated by the codon choices 
   here, suggesting the possibility that the restriction fragment length polymorphism,
   a technique that a WIV lab is proficient at, could have been involved.”
   The authors suggest that the <code>FauI</code> site was added to monitor the presence
   of the furin-cleavage site.
</p><p>
<b>Comment:</b> 
   The furin cleavage site is known to increase the tropism of the virus, and it is 
   now known that the virus even infects the brain, but there is little evidence so
   far that it increases pathogenicity. There is as yet no good explanation for the 
   presence of the furin cleavage site. 
</p><p>
   It might make sense for a virus creator to put a restriction site in the middle of
   the furin cleavage site to make sure it didn't disappear. RFLP analysis is a simple 
   technique and any molecular biology lab could handle it easily. However, as mentioned,
   restriction sites pop up randomly all the time, so finding one proves little.
</p><p>
<b>What is needed:</b> 
   The <code>FauI</code> restriction site is a red herring. To prove that the furin cleavage
   site was added, the authors would have to find a trail of evidence showing step
   by step how the sequence was manipulated from whatever virus the WIV started from.
   It would also be helpful to have data showing that furin cleavage increases 
   pathogenicity. This is plausible but it needs to be shown experimentally.
</p><hr><p>
<b>Claim 5:</b> 
   WIV most likely used ZC45 and ZXC21, not RaTG13, to create SARS-CoV-2 because RaTG13 is 
   not real. The reasoning behind this claim is that the S1 sequence of SARS-CoV-2 
   is quite similar to these other viruses except for the receptor-binding motif and 
   furin-cleavage sites. Also, two other proteins on these viruses, the Orf8 protein 
   and E protein, are 94.2% and 100% identical to SARS-CoV-2.
</p><p>
<b>Comment:</b> 
   This is indeed strange but so far circumstantial.
</p><p>
<b>What is needed:</b> 
   The authors need to prove that RaTG13 is not real. They claim to have evidence,
   and I look forward to seeing it,  but to be convincing it would have to be more 
   than the discovery of mysterious unexplained features in the DNA sequence.
</p><hr><p>
The authors say they plan to prove that RaTG13 is fabricated in a follow-up report. 
If they can do this, it would be solid evidence of consciousness of guilt on the part 
of WIV researchers. However, the current paper doesn't say very much more than what 
other bloggers have already revealed.
</p><p>
It would be premature to draw any conclusion about the origins of the virus from this
paper. The authors have set for themselves a difficult and possibly impossible task: 
finding a signature of intel­ligent design in a virus is much like what the 
creationists have been doing without success for years. 
</p><p>
But what is not premature is that social media giants deciding for us what is 
true and what is false may turn out to be as big a threat as the virus. It is unfair 
and unscientific to dismiss ideas that one doesn't want to hear as “conspiracy 
theories” as many people are doing.

    <date>17 September 2020</date>
      <p>When I joined the Financial Times as Technical Director for FT.com, I inherited a team of around 50 engineers. One of the first things I did was meet each of them for a one-to-one. I was initially resistant, but it was extremely valuable, I’m glad I did it, and I would definitely do it again in a future role.</p>

<h2 id="my-mentors-advice-about-the-content-of-the-meeting">My mentor’s advice about the content of the meeting</h2>

<p>The idea was suggested to me by a mentor, who’d been advised to do it by <em>his</em> mentor, a Rear Admiral, who said this was something you should do whenever you have a team of fewer than 150 people. My mentor gave me some tips:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be clear about whether you will take action or whether this is for information only.</li>
  <li>This should mostly be about listening – you should talk for maybe 5 minutes and they should talk for 25.</li>
  <li>It’s to find out what’s going well and what’s not going well.</li>
  <li>It’s informal, but make sure it’s in an enclosed meeting room so that people feel they can speak freely.</li>
  <li>Sometimes it will be quite boring, sometimes you may just learn a lot about someone’s family or hobbies, but that is useful from a getting to know people/relationship-building perspective and it means that you know some things about that person.</li>
  <li>Aim is to get a bit about their background, their priorities and their pressures.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="making-time-was-hard">Making time was hard</h2>

<p>I was initially resistant because of the time commmitment. With a team of ~50, that’s a lot of hours, and I was also working four days a week so each meeting takes up a greater proportion of time. However, once I’d made the decision to do this and announced my intention, it was important to me to follow through, so I made sure to make time.</p>

<p>I scheduled four of these 1:1s a week, starting with the people reporting directly to me and then on down the management chain.</p>

<h2 id="i-ran-each-meeting-in-the-same-way">I ran each meeting in the same way</h2>

<p>Firstly I ran through everything I planned to cover, and then stepped through it.</p>


<ul>
  <li>I am asking the same questions to everyone</li>
  <li>This is information for me only to get an idea of themes and how things are going; I’m not explicitly planning to take action on anything we discuss, so if something comes up that I need to take action on, let’s make sure we discuss that after this meeting</li>
  <li>This is confidential. If you say something about someone else I’m not going to go and tell them. I may report on ‘what people are saying’, but I’ll say ‘the engineers feel’ or ‘an engineer said’; I won’t say “[Your name] said…”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-were-going-to-discuss">What we’re going to discuss</h3>

<ul>
  <li>First I’ll introduce myself, and tell you a bit about my background</li>
  <li>Then, if you like, I’d love you to tell me a bit about yourself – as much or as little as you feel like sharing</li>
  <li>Then we’ll discuss the following questions:</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>What do you think the most important things we should be doing over the next year?</li>
  <li>What will get in the way of us doing that?</li>
  <li>What’s going well, i.e. what should we make sure we don’t change?</li>
  <li>Is there anything you think I should know about?</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="is-there-anything-i-should-know-about">Is there anything I should know about?</h2>

<p>When I asked this question I talked a bit about why I was asking. I explained that I might not necessarily see or know things that may seem apparent to them, and while they should always feel able to bring things to me, now was a good opportunity to do so. It was an opportunity to make sure I’ve heard what’s important to you, what things should change and what things should stay the same.</p>

<p>This question always elicited very interesting responses, from organisational issues, to personal information people felt it was valuable for me to know about them.</p>

<h2 id="i-told-them-what-i-was-planning-to-ask-in-advance">I told them what I was planning to ask in advance</h2>

<p>I put all the information in the meeting invite.</p>

<div>
<p>I mentioned that I wanted to have a chat with everyone on FT.com to understand how things are going, does this time suit you for this?</p>

<p>The meeting agenda is the same for everyone; a quick intro and then the following questions (I'll go through this in the meeting too):</p>

<ul>
<li>What do you think the most important things we should be doing over the next year?</li>
<li>What will get in the way of us doing that?</li>
<li>What’s going well, i.e. what should we make sure we don’t change?</li>
<li>Is there anything you think I should know about?</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Anna</p>
</div>

<p>Some people did not read the meeting invite and came with no idea what the meeting was about. Some people had fully prepared and written notes that they then read out to me. Actually people having prepared sometimes was less useful, because sometimes it led the conversation to solutions rather than problems. However it was great that people had really given it some thought.</p>

<h2 id="making-notes-felt-too-much-like-a-promise">Making notes felt too much like a promise</h2>

<p>Each meeting was half an hour. In the very first one, I made notes in a notebook, but I realised that created an implicit commitment that I was going to take action on everything that was said, even though I had said it was information only.</p>

<p>However, I do not have a very good memory, so for all the subsequent ones I made a few notes after each meeting of key themes. This meant I couldn’t do more than two in a row or go straight into another meeting, so it made scheduling slightly harder. These days, people are much more aware of the shorter meeting approach so if doing this again, I’d go for the ‘therapy hour’ – 25 minutes for conversation then 5 minutes for me to make the notes.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-myself">Introducing myself</h2>

<p>In my intro, I gave a potted career history. Starting from my degree in philosophy, and my first career in <a href="https://www.barringtonstoke.co.uk/">children’s book publishing</a>, through teaching myself to code, my <a href="https://www.hw.ac.uk/study/uk/postgraduate/information-technology-software-systems.htm">masters in Software Systems</a> and then my 15+ year career in programming, infrastructure and operations, technical architecture, and my previous role as <a href="https://www.annashipman.co.uk/jfdi/a-year-in-the-life-os-lead.html">Open Source lead</a>. I also talked about what appealed to me about the job as Technical Director at the FT.</p>

<p>I said roughly the same thing to everyone. I don’t normally introduce myself and give my background, but in this case I thought that as a new Tech Director most of them would not be working closely with me, and I would not be contributing code, so it was worth giving my credentials.</p>

<p>My mentor had suggested I also say something personal. I think he intended something like “married with two children” (or whatever), but instead, I tried to give a different kind of personal detail, something about my interests. I tried to come up with a different one for each conversation, for example something about my <a href="https://twitter.com/annashipman/status/1043917006477643777">cross-stitch hobby</a>.</p>

<p>This part was the hardest part for me, because prior to this I had generally enjoyed keeping a clear boundary between work stuff and personal stuff, so that definitely didn’t cover talking about cross-stitch, or my home life, on a first meeting. However, I had been trying to bring more of my personal self to work, and this part of the intro did lead to some really interesting conversations and I think helped make a better connection.</p>

<p>Of course, these days, when we are all at home, my personal life is in meetings with me, so it’s good I’d already started on that journey!</p>

<p>Giving so much information in my introduction also allowed the other person to introduce themselves how they wanted. Some talked career history, some focused on their hobbies, others were really open about their lives and aspirations.</p>

<h2 id="i-am-so-glad-i-did-this">I am so glad I did this</h2>

<p>My mentor was wrong about one thing –&nbsp;none of the conversations were boring.</p>

<p>In my first few months in the new job, I often felt really stretched for time, but I never regretted a single one of these meetings; it was always extremely interesting, my team are brilliant and it was great to meet them one on one, and each conversation always contained some valuable information.</p>

<p>There were two very valuable things about this for me.</p>

<p>The first was getting an idea of what change was needed. These meetings gave me a brilliant insight that wasn’t available elsewhere. Patterns started emerging very quickly, and formed the basis of our <a href="https://medium.com/ft-product-technology/the-difficult-teenage-years-setting-tech-strategy-after-a-launch-7f42eb94a424">tech strategy</a>.</p>

<p>The second was building relationships. A lot of the people I had 1:1s with I would not have come into contact with during the course of the ordinary working week. It would have taken time to meet everyone at socials, and it wouldn’t have been the same quality of conversation. I still feel, two years on, that I know a bit about all the people I had those conversations with, which has felt to me like a good foundation for our subsequent conversations.</p>

<p>It was also good, as someone who is a bit shy, to have names to faces quite quickly and people to say hello to when walking round the office.</p>

<h2 id="was-it-useful-for-my-team">Was it useful for my team?</h2>

<p>About a year later, I asked some of the people with whom I’d had these conversations whether they’d been useful (in an anonymous form).</p>

<p>All of the people who responded said they found the conversation valuable, and some of their comments were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“It broke down barriers and helped me feel less intimidated about approaching you, whether to talk about work or just to have a general chit chat. You are a very busy person who I wouldn’t ever work with directly so it was good to feel that you knew I existed.”</li>
  <li>“There is hardly any opportunity for me to talk to people in higher position like you except when the team has a big problem. The 1:1 was really casual and I felt really comfortable talking to you. It was a good time to know what kind of person you are. If we didn’t do the 1:1, the answer of the question below “Do you feel able to raise issues with me?” would be “No”.”</li>
  <li>“We sat down when you first started and it was nice to get some one-to-one time because it’s not often you get to do that with a Technical Director. It was nice to raise issues but for me, it was more of an opportunity to understand if I could trust you in the future with raising issues. Raising issues can be difficult and scary so it’s important to know if the person you are raising them to is receptive.”</li>
  <li>“It really showed that you cared about us as humans, and how we fit with the rest of the team. It was also a great opportunity to get to know you”</li>
  <li>“I think often of that conversation”</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="did-it-make-them-feel-more-able-to-raise-issues-with-me">Did it make them feel more able to raise issues with me?</h2>

<![CDATA[Reasons Your Growth Startup Is Hiring Too Junior]]>

September 19, 2020 | https://staysaasy.com/management/2020/09/11/Hiring-Too-Junior.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://staysaasy.com/management/2020/09/11/Hiring-Too-Junior.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Growth startups often find themselves lacking senior team members as they scale. The problems that arise from this are plentiful, including things like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Requiring heroics to fix things</li>
  <li>Penalizing junior team members for failure to meet responsibilities well above their pay grade.</li>
  <li>Building technology that doesn’t scale</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s some reasons why companies get into this situation.</p>

<h2 id="reason-1-habit">Reason 1: Habit</h2>

<p>When you’re a tiny startup budgets are extremely lean and products don’t have a lot of users. In that environment companies often prioritize breadth of functionality (see what works) and getting that via several (more affordable) junior team members guided by a smaller group of senior team members.</p>

<p>Problems arise if that strategy exists past market fit. The add-a-junior-to-do-more strategy implodes as the team grows too large for the senior staff to manage closely and the technical challenges start to look more daunting.</p>

<h2 id="reason-2-hubris">Reason 2: Hubris</h2>

<p>Sometimes people recognize the problems are getting more difficult but still don’t hire more seniors. This can often be chalked up to hubris - surely I can just direct a bunch of juniors to execute on the genius solutions I come up with for all our problems. The problem here is that you’re not a genius and even if you were that strategy doesn’t scale.</p>

<h2 id="reason-3-fear">Reason 3: Fear</h2>

<p>The flip side of hubris is fear. New senior staff can look like a threat to the power of existing senior staff. You might have to choose between doing what’s right for the company and retaining certain kinds of power. The answer there is simple - it’s better to be part of something great than the owner of something that fails.</p>

<p>A different play on this theme is junior teammates fearing that new senior teammates will take away some of their opportunities. It’s possible, sure. But more often the opportunities they will take over are the ones juniors would have had trouble succeeding in.</p>

<p>In a growing company with reasonably difficult challenges, good seniors will do more to expand the set of opportunities than shrink them. And good senior talent will help juniors via mentorship and guidance.</p>

<h2 id="reason-4-money-issues">Reason 4: Money Issues</h2>

<p>Money issues play out in a couple ways.</p>

<p>First, the cost of senior talent can subconsciously make you concerned about the remaining budget for yourself. I haven’t seen this played out directly and blatantly, but it’s another version of the fear game - assuming compensation is a zero sum game leads to weird incentives.</p>

<p>Second, it’s easy to think 2 juniors are better than one senior. As you read about the myth of the 10x engineer you might find yourself thinking this way. Let’s talk more about how this is a misconception in reason 5…</p>

<h2 id="reason-5-miscalculation-of-necessary-skills-for-right-now">Reason 5: Miscalculation of Necessary Skills For Right Now</h2>

<p>As referenced earlier, problems get much harder when you add significant growth to a platform. It’s not uncommon to underestimate the challenges at hand. In reality, even simple products at massive scale need significant senior leadership to ensure they are being built and operated effectively. Trying to replace the leadership of senior talent with a volume of junior talent is a sure-fire way to screw this up.</p>

<h2 id="reason-6-miscalculation-of-necessary-skills-in-the-future">Reason 6: Miscalculation of Necessary Skills In the Future</h2>

<p>To make things more difficult, you don’t just have to hire for right now, you have to hire for 2 or more years in the future. The senior talent you hire now must seed the leadership ranks you need in the future. Especially in product and engineering, you can’t just hire everyone you need when you need them. For starters, the job market would laugh at that sort of just-in-time attempt at hiring. But also, these roles require much more detailed understanding of the systems at play, so you need to have people with intimate knowledge developed in advance.</p>

<p>Think of it this way - look at whatever company you’re trying to be like in 5 years. Look at their team. If you don’t start hiring towards something like that team sooner rather than later you’ll never be that company.</p>

<h2 id="reason-7-arguments-about-what-seniors-need">Reason 7: Arguments About What-Seniors-Need</h2>

<p>Another reason people hire too junior is thinking around senior talent needing explicit areas of responsibility that don’t overlap. This is the “one alpha” theory - that senior talent can’t collaborate productively and need their own pack. There might be some nuggets of truth here, but most of it is nonsense. That’s like NASA saying they couldn’t have smart people work together on getting to the moon because these great scientists need their own domains.</p>

<p>Ultimately you have to look at the problems you’re solving. If they are truly challenging they can support a number of seniors. If they aren’t you’ll probably have trouble hiring and retaining more than a few.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>There’s a lot of reasons why you might hire too junior as your company grows. Know them and hire intentionally.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="1"><span>Need to know</span></h2><div><p>People save for a variety of reasons: to put money by for unforeseen contingencies; for retirement; for holidays or other expensive purchases; to leave money for a spouse or children after death; to avoid debt. Others save only because they think it is a good idea or that they â€˜ought toâ€™. Whatever the motive, saving not only has financial benefits, it can also improve <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167487011001231">psychological wellbeing</a> and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00038-019-01214-3">emotional health</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone is in a position to save, particularly right now â€“ for people with significant debt, living on minimum wages or chronically unemployed, saving is not a realistic priority. Yet for those who do have the means to save, and given its benefits, why do so few of us do it?</p>
<p>For instance, in the United Kingdom in 2019, of more than 27 million households, nearly 13 million had no savings at all, <a href="https://themoneycharity.org.uk/media/March-2020-Money-Statistics.pdf">according</a> to the Money Charity. So, approximately half of all Britons have no money of their own to fall back on or to use either short- or long-term. In the United States, average personal saving rates (the amount of disposable income that people put by) were around 7.6 per cent in 2019, and even below 5 per cent in the decade prior, which is significantly less than required to retire comfortably, according to financial commentators.</p>
<p>There are countless articles and advice columns available online that will tell you why you need to save and that teach you the basic practicalities of saving â€“ such as how to compare interest rates or where to find the banking apps that allow you to partition your money into virtual savings pots. The trouble is, such advice fails to address the fundamental psychological reasons that impede so many peopleâ€™s intentions to save. In this Guide, weâ€™ll take you through these psychological hurdles and show you how to overcome them.</p>
<p>Underlying many of our difficulties with saving is that we evolved to cope with short-term, usually physical, threats and to prioritise satisfying our most immediate needs. For instance, rather than responding to a threatening letter from your credit card company with a long-term saving strategy, it is all too easy to react instead as you would to an acute physical threat â€“ to run, fight or freeze. These automatic survival responses narrow attention on the threat and speed up short-term decision-making at the expense of longer-term strategy. But you canâ€™t run from or kill the creditor. Likewise, freezing and hoping that the threat will go away might have saved your distant ancestor from a physical predator, but it wonâ€™t work with your bank.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s partly because of these evolved survival mechanisms that, rather than planning ahead, so many people take out instant â€˜payday loansâ€™ with punitive interest rates to tide them over until the next pay cheque. To the stressed or scared brain, such loans can seem like a good survival option, but in reality they are a long-term financial disaster.</p>
<p>We also evolved to attract mates. Status was (and still can be) a good attractor, so it might be very tempting to buy shiny things to show off, such as a new phone (despite your existing one being adequate) or new clothes and shoes (although you might not wear half the stuff you already own). Left unchecked, these impulses to keep purchasing new and impressive items can also thwart any intentions to save.</p>
<p>Youâ€™re more likely to become a successful saver and to overcome your unhelpful evolved tendencies if you do three things: take the time to consider what your overarching values and long-term goals are in life; develop a sense of balance (allowing you to weigh your current needs against your future plans); and build new monetary habits, so that saving is no longer a constant battle or test of willpower, but something you do automatically.</p>
<p>If youâ€™re in a position to save, you might feel that the middle of a pandemic, with uncertainty high and many salaries falling, is not the right time to pay attention to saving. Thatâ€™s understandable, but our advice about identifying your priorities and finding ways to make better use of the money you have is arguably more important than ever.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="2"><span>What to do</span></h2><div><p>To increase your chances of saving successfully, the first thing you need to do is to define what matters to you â€“ in other words, your values. What are you saving <em>for</em>? When it comes to your behaviour, your <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797612439069">motivation</a> is far more important to initiating change than your energy levels. Imagine youâ€™re hiking in the woods and become so tired that you feel like you canâ€™t take another step. If a bear appears and goes for you, donâ€™t you think you could run a bit more, let alone walk again? Motivation is just as critical when it comes to saving money, so think about what matters to you. Maybe youâ€™d like to run your own business, start a charity, or simply have enough money to go away next year? These are the kind of meaningful, long-term goals that you need to have at the forefront of your mind if you are to overcome short-term temptations and find the motivation to save money.</p>
<p>If youâ€™re struggling to figure out what you <em>really</em> want in the long-term (and what you want your money to do for you), there are several thought experiments you can try. Research <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0079407">suggests</a> that contemplating death can alter your financial priorities. Imagine that youâ€™ve died and that your life is being commemorated on the news: what would you like your significant achievements or experiences to have been? Or imagine youâ€™re nearing death: what would the future â€˜youâ€™ tell the current â€˜youâ€™ about what was actually important? These thought experiments are good for working out what youâ€™ll regret if you donâ€™t get started on longer-term goals, but death can be a bit depressing. An alternative is to imagine appearing on a TV show with your favourite interviewer in 15 to 20 yearsâ€™ time. What would you like to say youâ€™re grateful for â€“ what were your greatest achievements, or your happiest, most meaningful moments?</p>
<p>When youâ€™ve got a goal or value, picture it. The more detail the better. Draw it, describe it, get a clear image of it. Then get some of those little sticky dots you can find in stationery stores. Put one on the picture, or on your computer, phone, TV, mirror. Make sure you keep in mind why youâ€™re doing what youâ€™re doing. Then, when you get out your credit card to buy something, or look at your phone to pay online, youâ€™ll see the dot, think about why youâ€™re saving and how great that goal or value is, and wonâ€™t spend the money. Youâ€™ll use your dreams and motivations to change your behaviour and, each time you do, youâ€™ll take a step towards that day when youâ€™ll have achieved what youâ€™d like to celebrate in your fantasy TV interview.</p>
<p>The next thing you need to do is to create a sense of balance between your immediate needs and your more optional or discretionary desires, so that you stay happy and motivated while also having enough resources left over to put toward your overarching, long-term values and aims.</p>
<p>Only you know the things you absolutely must have (apart from food and shelter, and ideally companionship). But do bear in mind that, if youâ€™re completely honest with yourself, most material things are really optional â€“ you might think you must have the dozens of things your grandparents had never even heard of, such as dishwashers, wireless headphones, instantaneous, unlimited internet and a phone with a teleport app. Yet you donâ€™t. You need essentials for life, the rest you have to prioritise, and your priorities are up to you.</p>
<p>One important thing to consider is that there are times in life when itâ€™s unwise to save. For example, itâ€™s better to clear high-interest debt, such as credit cards, first. There is little point in putting aside savings at a 2 per cent interest rate if youâ€™re simultaneously paying 20 per cent interest or more on your credit card debt. That might sound obvious, but in the UK in 2019 credit card debt <a href="https://themoneycharity.org.uk/money-statistics/?gclid=CjwKCAjwkun1BRAIEiwA2mJRWZnvjJxcJXuKA4Cmkm8KJYTbZ63tTZiYMmXdVocn0O2F-c7LG38SrRoCObYQAvD_BwE">averaged</a> Â£2,591 per household, so itâ€™s not as obvious as it should be.</p>
<p>An inappropriate savings habit can be as bad as an inappropriate spending habit, the key is balance and planning</p>
<p>Similarly, itâ€™s all too common for people to save while neglecting urgent essentials. Consider the case of pre-pandemic winter-related deaths among people aged 65 and over â€“ which in the UK are around 379 per day in excess of the rest of the year, <a href="https://www.ageuk.org.uk/latest-press/articles/2018/november/response-to-new-excess-winter-death-figures/">according</a> to the charity Age UK, due largely to increases in respiratory illness, especially pneumonia. Yes, poor conditions, poverty and seasonal viruses play a role, but weâ€™ve also heard many stories of people continuing to try to save rather than spending sufficient money on vital heating. A lifelong habit of saving can be dangerous, when the more appropriate action is spending on self-protection.</p>
<p>Another reason that balance is so important in choosing how much, when and what to save for is that living like a monk through force of habit rather than conscious choice is actually bad for wellbeing. An inappropriate savings habit can be as bad as an inappropriate spending habit, the key is balance and planning. After all, if life under your new saving regime is too dull and arduous, youâ€™re unlikely to keep to it. So remember to set exciting short-term goals along the path to your big dreams (such as clearing out the garage to use as an office, and selling the junk to use as starting capital). And do make sure to reward yourself from time to time â€“ buy some music you love or something else that gives you joy, to celebrate your progress when you stick to your new plans.</p>
<p>To help find the balance in your spending priorities, try this exercise: imagine youâ€™ve won Â£25 million in the lottery. Write down the first 15 things youâ€™d buy in as much detail as you can. Next, read through the list (you can do this alone, or with a trusted friend) and consider where the desires came from. Categorise them: which items are driven by expectations (â€˜if Iâ€™m …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1600534200717/rO1es5pbF.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><h2 id="what-is-nextjs">What is Next.JS</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.JS</a> is an amazing React framework created by <a target="_blank" href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>. It allows the developers to create Server-side, Client-side or Static websites. Unlike the other frameworks, the rendering in Next JS is <strong>per page</strong>. That means, the "about" page can be static, while the "home" page can be server-side. Next JS is on the rise, loved by the developers, and my favorite React framework so far.</p>

<p>If you want to learn more about website rendering, read my other post <a target="_blank" href="https://nikolovlazar.com/how-to-render-your-website">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="environment">Environment</h2>
<p>This article covers the debugging process using <a target="_blank" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>. You can use the same commands in other IDEs, but you need to write them in the specific format.</p>
<p>For simplicity, we will use <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/lazarnikolov94/debugging-nextjs">this repo</a> to show the debugging process. So, go ahead and clone it on your computer, execute <code>yarn install</code> and open it in Visual Studio Code.</p>
<h2 id="debugging-nextjs">Debugging Next.JS</h2>
<p>A Next.JS page has two parts: a server-side part and a client-side part. To debug both parts you will need two VSCode launch tasks. Let's dive in.</p>
<h2 id="debugging-the-server-side">Debugging the Server-side</h2>
<p>The server-side code lives in the <code>getServerSideProps</code> method. It executes every time there's a request. To debug the server-side code we will need to add a new VSCode launch task. First, create a <code>.vscode</code> folder in the root of the project, and then inside that folder create a <code>launch.json</code> file. We will add our launch tasks here.</p>
<p>Inside the <code>launch.json</code> file add a new "Node: Launch Program" configuration. Then, you will need to add the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove the <code>skipFiles</code> property</li>
<li>Remove the <code>program</code> property</li>
<li>Add a new property <code>runtimeExecutable</code> with value <code>${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/.bin/next</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Your <code>launch.json</code> file should look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>{
    <span>"configurations"</span>: [
        {
            <span>"type"</span>: <span>"pwa-node"</span>,
            <span>"request"</span>: <span>"launch"</span>,
            <span>"name"</span>: <span>"Next: Node"</span>,
            <span>"runtimeExecutable"</span>: <span>"${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/.bin/next"</span>
        }
    ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>That's it! Now open the <code>/pages/[owner]/[repo].tsx</code> file, add a breakpoint on line 32 and hit F5. When the Next.JS server starts navigate to <a target="_blank" href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000</a> and click on one of the repos in the list. After clicking it, you should hit the breakpoint. Now you have the ability to inspect the <code>ctx</code> argument and the data received from GitHub's API.</p>
<h2 id="debugging-the-client-side">Debugging the Client-side</h2>
<p>To debug the Client-side first you need to install the <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome">Debugger for Chrome</a> extension. Open the link and click on the Install button. It will ask you to open the link in Visual Studio Code, so click on the "Open Visual Studio Code" button.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, you will need two launch tasks, so let's create the client-side one. Head to <code>launch.json</code> and add a new "Chrome: Launch" task. Then, you will only need to make one change:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the <code>url</code> value to <code>http://localhost:3000</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Your complete <code>launch.json</code> file should look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>{
    <span>"configurations"</span>: [
        {
            <span>"name"</span>: <span>"Launch Chrome"</span>,
            <span>"request"</span>: <span>"launch"</span>,
            <span>"type"</span>: <span>"pwa-chrome"</span>,
            <span>"url"</span>: <span>"http://localhost:3000"</span>,
            <span>"webRoot"</span>: <span>"${workspaceFolder}"</span>
        },
        {
            <span>"type"</span>: <span>"pwa-node"</span>,
            <span>"request"</span>: <span>"launch"</span>,
            <span>"name"</span>: <span>"Next: Node"</span>,
            <span>"runtimeExecutable"</span>: <span>"${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/.bin/next"</span>
        }
    ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>And that's it! Now, open the <code>/pages/index.tsx</code> file and add a breakpoint on line 9. You can now launch the Launch Chrome task from the debug panel. The Launch Chrome task should open a new Chrome window on the home page. Start typing into the input on the screen and you will hit the breakpoint in the <code>index.tsx</code> file. Now you have the ability to inspect the client-side properties, like the <code>repo</code> variable. Click continue and type another letter. You will hit the breakpoint every time you type something in the input. Hover on the <code>repo</code> variable to see the value changing. You're now debugging the client-side code!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Now you know how to debug both sides in a Next.JS app. The server side code is node, so you need a Node debug task for it. The client side is Chrome, so you need a Chrome debug task for it.</p>
<p>Also, debugging is a vital process in software engineering, so use it everywhere you can! Don't use only <code>console.log</code> for debugging.</p>

<p>My great-grandfather's grandparents, Martin Schlachter and Justina Tschosick, immigrated to Canada from Europe at the beginning of the 20th century. This page collects everything I know about them. I'll keep this updated when I discover something new. If you'd like to share something that I've missed, please <a href="mailto:martinandjustinaschlachter@schlachter.ca">contact me</a>!</p>

<p>I've organized this page by sources in chronological order. Click any image for the full version.</p>

<p>The one personal anecdote I have about Martin and Justina comes from a brief family history from the collection of Jacquie Doran: "A little tiny house was constructed in the back yard of [their son] Anton's house. Anton's children all had fond memories of their Grandparents living there. Grandma Justina always had candy and Grandpa Martin sat with his legs crossed, smoking his pipe."

<h2 id="passport">Russian passport (1890)</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.davidschlachter.com/misc/martin-schlachter-passport-01.jpg"><img src="https://www.davidschlachter.com/misc/martin-schlachter-passport-01-thumb.jpg" alt="Martin Schlachter Russian Empire foreign passport, page 1"></a><a href="https://www.davidschlachter.com/misc/martin-schlachter-passport-02.jpg"><img src="https://www.davidschlachter.com/misc/martin-schlachter-passport-02-thumb.jpg" alt="Martin Schlachter Russian Empire foreign passport, page 2"></a></p>

<blockquote>Source: scan (2013) of copy from collection of Jacquie Doran, from the original.</blockquote>

<p>Martin and Justina used this passport when they moved from the Russian Empire to Romania around 1890. The cover is inscribed with Martin's name, and the first page is signed by Martin. The first page indicates that the document has 24 pages (24 страницы) and is an passport (ЗАГРАНИЧНЫЙ ПАССПОРТ, literally Overseas (or Transnational) Passport, often called a <a href="http://www.doukhobor.org/Passports.html">Foreign Passport</a>). The signature block has instructions in Russian, German, and French ("Signature of the bearer").</p>

<p><a href="https://www.davidschlachter.com/misc/martin-schlachter-passport-03.jpg"><img src="https://www.davidschlachter.com/misc/martin-schlachter-passport-03-thumb.jpg" alt="Martin Schlachter Russian Empire foreign passport, page 3"></a><a href="https://www.davidschlachter.com/misc/martin-schlachter-passport-04.jpg"><img src="https://www.davidschlachter.com/misc/martin-schlachter-passport-04-thumb.jpg" alt="Martin Schlachter Russian Empire foreign passport, page 4"></a></p>

<p>The second page is a description of the bearer in Russian:</p>

<blockquote>Предъявитель сего Поселянин Мартын Іосифович Шлахтер с женой Юстиной, детьми: Антоном, Иосифом, Анной, Елизаветой и Розой отправляются за границу, во свидетельство чего и для свободного проезда дан сей паспорт с приложением печати.</blockquote>

<p>The declaration is signed at Odessa, September 18, 1890 (В Одессе, Сентябрь дня 18 1890 года). A stamp is affixed which reads "Gradonachalnik of Odessa, Counter Admiral" (Одесский градоначальник Контр-адмирал) with the signature of the official. (Note that some letters <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_alphabet">look different</a> between the font on this webpage, and the handwriting and italic script used inside the passport.)</p>

<p>The description of the bearer is subsequently repeated, in German (page 4) and then in French (page 5).</p>

<p>My translation from French: "The bearer of the present document, villager Martin Schlachter, goes abroad with his wife Justine and his children: Antoine, Joseph, Anne, Elisabeth and Rose, in faith of which this passport, confirmed by the affixed seal, is given for free passage in foreign countries." Again, the declaration is signed at Odessa, September 18, 1890. Note how "Anton" is written in German, "Antoine" in French.</p>

<p>The Russian text includes one detail that is missing in the French and German translations: in Russian, Martin's name is accompanied by a patronymic, as "Martin son of Joseph" (Іосифович, in latin script: Iosifovich). His full name in cursive in the Russian description reads: Мартын Іосифович Шлахтер; in latin script: Martin Iosifovich Schlachter; <em>i.e.</em> Martin (son of Joseph) Schlachter.</p>

<p>Passport stamps follow, along with a list of family members and other contacts in the USA and Canada. These include their son Anton (Balgonie, Saskatchewan) and their son-in-law John Leibham (Plantersville, Texas, USA, wife of their daughter Agnes).</p>

<p>I'm grateful to reddit users rsotnik and mDeltroy for their help with the Russian text.</p>



<h2 id="military">Military booklet of Anton Schlachter (1894)</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.davidschlachter.com/misc/martin-schlachter-anton-booklet.jpg"><img src="https://www.davidschlachter.com/misc/martin-schlachter-anton-booklet-thumb.jpg" alt="Page from Anton Schlachter's military booklet from 1894"></a><a href="https://www.davidschlachter.com/misc/martin-schlachter-anton-booklet-02.jpg"><img src="https://www.davidschlachter.com/misc/martin-schlachter-anton-booklet-02-thumb.jpg" alt="Page from Anton Schlachter's military booklet from 1894"></a></p>

<blockquote>Source: scan (2013) of copy from collection of Jacquie Doran.</blockquote>

<p>Martin and Justina's son Anton entered the Romanian military in January 1894, serving until some point before his departure from Europe in 1905. His service was recorded in a small booklet which begins with his biographical details. The booklet lists his parents as Anton (a mystery since this name does not appear to be used elsewhere by Martin) and Justina, apparently residing in Chirage.</p>



<h2 id="manifest">Ship manifest for the SS Koln (1902)</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.davidschlachter.com/misc/martin-schlachter-koln-manifest-1902.jpg"><img src="https://www.davidschlachter.com/misc/martin-schlachter-koln-manifest-1902-thumb.jpg" alt="Page from the passenger list of the SS Koln showing Martin Schlachter and Justina Tschosick, Dec 18, 1902"></a></p>

<blockquote>Source: Selected Passenger and Crew Lists and Manifests. National Archives, Washington, D.C., via Ancestry.com. This source was brought to my attention by <a href="https://schlachter.ca/familyweb/martin.html">Alan Schlachter</a>.</blockquote>

<p>Martin and Justina immigrated to the Americas aboard the SS Koln, a ship operated by the Norddeutscher Lloyd Steamship Company. They left Bremen in the northern German Empire (probably the port of Bremen, 50 km downstream of the city itself), arriving in Galveston, Texas, USA on December 12, 1902.</p>

<p>Martin declares himself to be 55 years old, a farmer, able to read and write. He is declared as a Romanian national, with his last residence at Constanța, Romania (roughly 2000 km from Bremen!), and he indicates that he intends to join his son in Plantersville, Texas. Justina is declared as age 50, unable to read or write. The family was travelling with their youngest daughters, Elizabeth (17) and Rosa (15). The manifest notes that Martin was carrying more than $30 (roughly $1000 USD in 2020) and had paid the fare for the family.</p>

<p>The ship, the SS Koln, was built in 1899, and was the <a href="https://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/nglloyd.shtml">second second ship of this name</a> operated by Norddeutscher Lloyd. The ship is <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080616161131/http://www.fortunecity.com/littleitaly/amalfi/13/shipik.htm">described as follows</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
	The "Koln" of 1899 was a 7409 gross ton vessel built in 1899 by J.C.Tecklenborg of Geestemunde for Norddeutscher Lloyd. Her details were - length 428.9ft x beam 54.3ft, one funnel [smoke-stack], two masts, twin screw and a speed of 13 knots [25 km/h]. There was accommodation for 120 [second]- and 1,850 [third]-class passengers. Launched on 24/7/1899, she sailed from Bremen on her maiden voyage to Galveston on 20/10/1899. On 21/12/1899 she commenced her first voyage from Bremen to Baltimore, and on 4/1/1902 her first run from Bremen to New York. Subsequently she ran from [B]remen to Baltimore or Galveston, occasionally to or via New York.<br>

<h2 id="saskhomestead">Saskatchewan homestead application (1903)</h2>

<!-- I've requested a copy of the actual application from the Saskatchewan provincial archives, 2020-09-18 -->

<p><a href="https://www.davidschlachter.com/misc/martin-schlachter-sask-homestead-01.jpg"><img src="https://www.davidschlachter.com/misc/martin-schlachter-sask-homestead-01-thumb.jpg" alt="Saskatchewan homestead grant register for Martin Schlachter"></a></p>

<blockquote>Source: Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, Canada, Homestead Grant Registers, 1872-1930 from Ancestry.com.</blockquote>

<p>Beginning with the <em>Dominion Lands Act</em> of 1872, the Canadian government <a href="https://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/land/land-grants-western-canada-1870-1930/Pages/land-grants-western-canada.aspx">offered land ownership</a> in Western Canada to those willing to settle and cultivate it. Martin and Justina formally began the application process in Saskatchewan in October of 1903. While I haven't found their actual application<!--(I've requested any relevant records from the Saskatchewan Provincial Archives)-->, this register shows that their application was received. Their original application number was 149474.</p>

<p>The plot of land was the South-West quarter-section of Section 34 in Township 1, Range 12 West of the 2nd meridian, near modern-day Torquay, SK, centred around <a href="http://www.bing.com/maps/default.aspx?cp=49.079460~-103.531347&amp;sp=Polyline.49.072172_-103.520310_49.086649_-103.520343_49.086647_-103.542302_49.072371_-103.542433_49.072172_-103.520310_34-1-12-W2_Saskatchewan_http://legallandconverter.com__%2300ff00__4px_Single_Solid&amp;lvl=13&amp;v=2&amp;sV=2&amp;style=a">49.079460, -103.531347</a> (<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/BKmR1ReFXRhfVEY77">alternate link</a>).</p>

<p>According to their next homestead application, they abandoned this plot, applying next in Alberta. They must have left the land before 1906, by which point homesteader Johanne Kroche is recorded as living there in the 1906 Census and in a homesteading file. As well, when Anton Schlachter left Bremen for America in November 1905, the passenger manifest shows that he declared his intention to join his father, Martin, in Berwick, North Dakota.</p>



<h2 id="ndhomestead">North Dakota homestead application (1904 – 1910)</h2>

<!-- Homesteading in the US also required naturalization. I've requested a copy of Martin's naturalization records from the ND Archives, 2020-09-19 -->

<!-- Homesteading records are available from the National Archives for a $50 fee. However, they are not currently processessing document requests due to the pandemic -->

</p>

<blockquote>Source: United States Bureau of Land Management Tract Books, Dakota Territory, Vol 74, page 231, via FamilySearch.org.</blockquote>

<p>After leaving Saskatchewan, Martin and Justina made a homestead application in North Dakota. Martin appears in the land tract register as Martin Schlagter, application date ('date of sale') April 15, 1904, for a homestead ("Hd."). He paid $5, presumably part of the application fee. According to the register, he was granted title to the land (a 'land patent') on September 4, 1909. This was recorded through land patent number 122219, issued March 31, 1910.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.davidschlachter.com/misc/martin-schlachter-nd-patent.jpg"><img src="https://www.davidschlachter.com/misc/martin-schlachter-nd-patent-thumb.jpg" alt="North Dakota land patent for Martin Schlachter"></a>
</p>

<blockquote>Source: United States Bureau of Land Management Land Patents database, BLM serial number NDDL 0002356, accessed through glorecords.blm.gov.</blockquote>

<p>The actual land patent shows the grant of Lot 4 of Section 3, Township 152 North of Range 74 West of the Fifth Principal Meridian, North Dakota, to Martin Schlachter. The Section is centred roughly on <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/eMV8Ejtxrr3VXmGLA">48.01399, -99.99462</a>, in modern-day Pierce County, North Dakota. The patent is dated March 31, 1910.</p>

<p>It is possible that this lot was sold, since Martin and Justina left North Dakota shortly after obtaining the land patent. Their next destination was Alberta, departing North Dakota sometime before April 1910.</p>

<!--<p>(Note: their son Joseph's nearby homestead plot is in Volume 79, p. 167, 'purchase date' date May 16, 1908, patent date Nov 13, 1908, actual patent dated Oct 14, 1909, see https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:3QS7-L9WS-ZNLK?i=166&wc=M7W7-S6K%3A356164401%2C356169401&cc=2074276)</p>-->

<p>The first form to <a href="http://archaeologyblog.treetimeservices.ca/2017/08/14/the-alberta-homestead-process/">start the homesteading process</a> was an <em>Application for entry</em>. At the time that Martin applied in Alberta in April of 1910, <a href="https://www.saskarchives.com/collections/land-records/history-and-background-administration-land-saskatchewan/homesteading">the eligibility requirements</a> were as follows:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Male over 18 years old, or female sole head of family</li>
	<li>Intention to become a British subject (if not already)</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to gain the title for the land, a plot of 160 acres often called a homestead, Martin <a href="https://www.saskarchives.com/collections/land-records/history-and-background-administration-land-saskatchewan/homesteading">would need to</a>:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Cultivate the land for three years</li>
	<li>Commence cultivation within six months of arrival</li>
	<li>Crop (harvest) at least 5 acres in the first year, and 15 in the second</li>
	<li>Build a 'habitable house' before the end of the second year, and reside in it from the beginning of the third year</li>
	<li>Reside within a distance of nine miles of the homestead</li>
	<li>Finish the naturalization process to become a British subject</li>
</ul>

<p>In his application for entry, Martin declares that he is 69 years old and a Russian subject, born in southern Russia, and the he intends to settle the homestead with his wife (age 64) and (presumably) a son aged 37 (Anton, born …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In this post, I provide a framework for how to think about building a marketing career.</p><h2><strong>Career North star: Ikigai</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>Before talking about marketing specifically, it's important to take a step back and look at what a successful career means. The Japanese have a wonderful concept called Ikigai that provides a&nbsp; framework for how to approach your career and life. Ikigai is a concept that translates to “A Reason for Being” and is typically explained through a venn diagram.</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-a3d6c5d9ff99-32481ab0"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5ea5d85d88b3bd7015481ab4/5f65173608a72e8df53b2d20_5b983488b34ddc1d0ab4c69b_1524071183-ikigai.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍<br></p><p>As you think about your career, you should be asking yourself the four Ikigai questions:</p><p>What do I love?</p><p>What am I good at?</p><p>What does the world need?&nbsp;</p><p>What can I get paid to do?&nbsp;</p><p>The intersection of the answers to these four questions is Ikgai. This intersection should be the north star that everyone follows throughout their career. Keep this in the back of your mind as you think about your place in marketing.</p><h2><strong>Framework for Marketing Careers</strong></h2><p>There’s a lot of reasons why people decide to work in marketing. Maybe you always liked ads, or took a marketing course in college&nbsp; or maybe you&nbsp; sort of fell into it (like me). Whatever your reasoning. Welcome! I’m glad you’re here.&nbsp;</p><p>Marketing is a fun job. You get to be creative. You get to work with technology. You get to always be on the bleeding edge. And if you stick around long enough, you’ll get to work on a variety of different subject matters and industries.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s a wide range of disciplines within marketing. This dynamic makes approaching a marketing career a complex puzzle. The general framework I use to think about this decision comes down to four elements:</p><p><strong>Function</strong>: the type of marketing you do (communications, creative, product, demand, etc.)</p><p><strong>Industry: </strong>the market you focus on (software, ecommerce, non-profit, cpg, etc.)</p><p><strong>In or Out: </strong>whether you work on the brand side (in-house) or work at a a service business (agency)</p><p><strong>Company Size: </strong>how big of a company you want to work for&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout your career, you’ll likely bounce back and forth between different roles across these elements. I’ve found that the only way to really understand what you prefer is by trying something for a period of time. It’s going to be an iterative process to figure out what you want to do.</p><p>Here’s how I would think about each of these elements:</p><h3><strong>Function</strong></h3><p>Marketing has a wide range of functions to choose from.</p><figure id="w-node-47ec6285e7e0-32481ab0"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5ea5d85d88b3bd7015481ab4/5f6522b720f36def48b04827_Marketing%20program%20snapshot.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>To determine your function, you should ask yourself two different questions:</p><p><strong>What am I good at?</strong> Think about the skills you’re bringing to the table and think about how those skills match to the job. For example, if you’re good at writing, perhaps communications, copywriting or content marketing is the right choice for you.</p><p><strong>What do you want to learn? </strong>Ask yourself what you’re interested in learning more about or what elements of marketing intrigue you. For example, maybe growing up you were obsessed with commercials and viral brand videos,. Then you should consider getting a job in video production and creative direction.</p><p>It can be challenging to answer these questions, especially when you’re early in your career. You likely don’t know enough about the nuances of each function to understand where you best fit. You might not even know what you want to learn.</p><p>As a result, I would tell anyone looking for entry-level jobs to get a junior marketing role. This will help you get your foot in the door, but also allow you to get a sense of what functions within marketing you enjoy and which functions you hate.</p><p>I also recommend that you should constantly be learning by osmosis and observing the people around you to figure out what you might enjoy.</p><p>As you advance in your career, the function and expertise of choice will become more clear. You’ll start to develop a set of skills that will come to define your functional area.</p><h3><strong>Industry</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>The next element to consider is what industry you want to work in. Marketing exists in every industry and looks different depending on what industry you choose. Marketing for a consumer product looks different then marketing for a software company.</p><p>To determine what industry you want to work in, you should put a mirror up to yourself and consider what you are interested in. What do you enjoy talking about? What do you spend your free time doing? What are you a nerd about?&nbsp;</p><p>The best marketers know the ins and outs of their industry and can&nbsp; understand their audience. You’ll have a leg up if you are your own audience. If you spend your free time learning/engaging with a specific industry, then you’ll be more successful in marketing to that industry. For example, if you’re a gaming nerd then you’ll know how to market to other gaming nerds, since you are one. You’ll be able to take your innate knowledge and apply that to your marketing work.</p><p>The other way to look at the Industry decision is through the lens of emerging trends. What categories are increasing? You want to be in a growing industry, so that you can grow your career with the category and become an expert.</p><p>For me, the answer to both of these questions was technology, software companies and startups. In college, I became obsessed with entrepreneurship and Silicon Valley. I wanted to learn how to build companies that make money online, so I focused my career on that theme.</p><h3><strong>In-house or Out (agency/freelancer)</strong></h3><p>The last decision you should consider is whether you want to work in-house at a company or work in a marketing service role (i.e.&nbsp; agency or freelancer). It’s common for marketers to switch back and forth between agency and in-house depending on personal preference and career stage. I started my career at an agency and then moved in-house. I enjoyed both for different reasons.</p><h4><strong>Agencies</strong></h4><p>Agencies can be a great place to sharpen your marketing skills and get exposed to a wide range of problems. Agencies have a wide range of different setups and specialize in different things. Some focus on digital marketing others make commercials. You need to pick an agency that matches your interest.</p><p>Agencies are also traditionally split between Accounts and Creative teams. The accounts team acts as a project manager and manages the client relationship. When working on the Accounts team, you get valuable project management skills. You also tend to develop a more generalist skill set and learn how to run a team. I’m biased, but I think working on an Accounts team sets you up well to run a marketing team in the future (that’s what happened to me).&nbsp;</p><p>When you’re on the Creative side, you get to specialize in your selected craft. This can range across the different functions that we discussed above. This usually depends on the agency's speciality.</p><p>Generally speaking, the benefit of working at an agency is that you get to work across a variety of different accounts. When I worked at the agency, I worked on projects for Google, California Hospital Association, Green Bay Packers and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund. I experienced a wide range of challenges that gave me a valuable breadth of experience. One day I was running a digital fundraising campaign and the next I was supporting the launch of a Google product.</p><p>There’s also some downsides to agencies. The first is that you’re constantly at the mercy of the clients. It can feel like you’re playing a game to make clients happy, rather than to do the best work for the brand. There’s also a feeling that you don’t get to take things to the finish line or own a project from end to end. Oftentimes, agencies are focusing on just one part of a campaign (ex. video in a broader product launch), but the rest of the campaign is left to internal teams or other agencies. For me, this dynamic made projects less rewarding, and at times, frustrating.&nbsp; I felt like the clients messed up our vision for whatever we were working on.</p><h4><strong>In-house</strong></h4><p>When you work in-house, the main benefit is ownership.&nbsp; You get to feel like you’re building something and owning projects from start to finish. There’s a sense of ownership and accomplishment that’s hard to get at an agency. I’m way prouder of my work building Lattice, than any of my agency work.</p><p>You become intimately familiar with the company’s brand/strategy. You get the chance to go deep and understand all the nuances of the market. You get to build a marketing strategy that captures the market's attention.&nbsp;</p><p>For me, the most rewarding part of working in-house is the ability to architect plans and watch them come to life. You get to be the strategist and the executor. You get to be the person who manages budgets, runs campaigns and hires agencies. It’s fun turning concepts into reality, and then seeing your impact on the business.</p><p>There’s also greater accountability to impact the companies goals. You have real metrics and goals that you need to hit. When you actually achieve these goals it's rewarding. (Of course, agencies have goals, but I found this dynamic to be different. Your goal is making the client happy, not the business's goal). For some people, this level of accountability and the idea of “owning a number” can be daunting. But for others, this level of ownership is inspiring and rewarding.</p><p>In-house marketers also get exposed to how (non-service) companies operate, especially cross-functional relationships. When you’re in this role, you’re able to see how Sales, Product, Customer Success, Finance, Operations and HR all interact with Marketing. You get to feel the tension between marketing and sales around leads. You experience product roadmapping and get to launch products. You work with finance to set up budgets and partner with HR to solve people challenges.</p><p>When compared to agencies, the main downside of in-house is the limited exposure to different problems and industries. It can be boring/annoying to work on the same brand year after year. You’re constantly dealing with the same challenges and it can also feel like you’re not learning anymore, which is never a good thing.</p><p>In the end, there’s no wrong answer. Working at an agency or in-house both have their pros and cons, and are the right fit for different people, at …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

      
      
<p>I’m a <strong>Senior Software Engineer</strong> at <strong>LinkedIn</strong> building <strong>Production Infrastructure</strong>. Previously, I was at <strong>Etsy</strong> leading the <strong>Machine Learning Infrastructure</strong> team.</p>


      
<p><em>May 2020</em></p><p>As developers, we can treat code review as an opportunity to build trust. There is something vulnerable about asking for feedback, and by responding with collaboration rather than confrontation, we build psychological safety. Imagine a world where you look forward to getting a review because the feedback makes the code better, shows respect for your work, and makes you glad you work with the people around you. We can choose to live in that world.</p>

<h3 id="show-gratitude">Show gratitude</h3>

<p><strong>Consider saying “thanks for putting this together!” or “thanks for reviewing this!”</strong> The reviewer and author both went to work in good faith to make an improvement to the software. No matter what feedback we might have, we should show appreciation for the effort spent on it.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratitude#Empirical_findings">body of research</a> (outside my area of expertise) that links gratitude to happiness, stress reduction, relationship satisfaction, and personal growth. When we review a piece of code, in addition to showing gratitude, we can take a few seconds to <strong>actually believe it</strong>. Isn’t it great that someone took the time to improve this software?</p>

<h3 id="language-matters">Language matters</h3>

<p>Text on code reviews lacks the expressiveness of other mediums that can help show good faith (i.e. smiling, voice tone, real time responsiveness). With this in mind, we can <strong>over</strong>compensate to make up for the limitations of text.</p>

<p><strong>Consider using “we” instead of “you”</strong>. When one developer writes code and submits it to the team for review, they may be tempted to have a “me vs them” mentality: my code is ready and good, and they just need to give approval. A comment framed as “we” shows that the reviewer and author are aligned in an effort to improve the code and release it promptly. A comment framed as “you” can come across as combative and blameful, even though that is not the intent. The “we” mentality goes beyond language. Code changes are owned by the team as a whole, and except in an emergency, no one individual should release something without the support of teammates. Effective teams succeed and fail as a group.</p>

<p><strong>Consider saying “I think.”</strong> Using the phrase “I think” shows the reader that you acknowledge your own limitations and are open to hearing their input as well. Guides for academic writing and presentations suggest avoiding the phrase “I think” in order to sound more assertive. Code reviews, on the other hand, benefit from collaboration, where increased information flow from multiple sources leads to a better result. Underrepresented people in tech sometimes hear advice to sound more assertive at work, and this places responsibility in the wrong place. Strong communicators know how to listen well and identify good ideas from anyone on the team, regardless of background, seniority, or role.</p>

<h3 id="review-to-release">Review to release</h3>

<p><strong>Consider saying “It’s ok to address this comment in a later change.”</strong> Code authors and managers want code to ship ASAP. Time spent rewriting code after code review is time where the user benefit is not in production and where the author could be working on a new task. Code reviewers can support this interest by distinguishing between changes that should be addressed before or after release. For example, it might be a good idea to refactor a long function, but if that is the only thing blocking release, then the team could agree to release the user benefit, refactor, and release again. This also leads to smaller changesets, which allows for faster feedback cycles.</p>

<h3 id="trivial-changes">Trivial changes</h3>

<p><strong>Consider applying the trivial suggestions.</strong> Choosing not to battle a nitpick can be a cheap way to build team ownership of a shared codebase. Reviewers should ideally keep comments about minor syntax changes to a minimum to prioritize discussion on impactful issues. If there is a pattern of too many nitpicks, that can be discussed in a team meeting. Still, nitpicks will inevitably come up, and while it can be tempting to push back against these, that also takes time away from bigger issues and releasing the user benefit. When implementing a nitpick is trivial and not harmful to the codebase, doing so tells your teammate that you value their input and increases their sense of ownership of the code. This helps people internalize the reality that once released, the code is owned by the team and no individual.</p>

<em>(With apologies to <a href="https://www.branson-reese.com/">Branson Reese</a>.)</em></p>

<h2 id="preword">Preword</h2>

<p>I’ve been working inside of codebases built on LLVM for a little over two years. I’m used
to (and very comfortable) reading LLVM IR.</p>

<p>Despite all that, I <em>still</em> need to stop and think about <code>getelementptr</code>’s semantics whenever I see
it. Thus: this post will serve to help myself (and maybe you, reader) feel more comfortable with
<code>getelementptr</code>.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>First of all, there’s this thing called <a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM</a>.</p>

<p>LLVM originally stood Low Level Virtual Machine, but
<a href="https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2011-December/046445.html">no longer stands for anything</a>.</p>

<p>The LLVM Project has many parts, but is perhaps best known by ordinary developers
for being the home of Clang, an optimizing C/C++ compiler<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Beyond being an impressive piece of compiler engineering, LLVM’s greatest claim to fame is
its <em>Intermediate Representation</em>, or IR. Having a (well-designed, mature, stable) IR confers
several advantages to an optimizing compiler:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Effective optimization: LLVM’s IR correctly reflects the original program semantics (including
C abstract machine semantics) while providing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form">important</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_block">optimization</a>
<a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#vector-type">primitives</a>. Optimizations happen on the IR itself
through a series of mostly independent transformations (“passes”).</li>
  <li>Rapid language development: programming language authors can target LLVM’s IR instead of native
code, giving them immediate access to
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/master/llvm/lib/Target">all of LLVM’s supported targets</a>
and in-tree optimizations.</li>
  <li>Program analysis: the same properties that make LLVM’s IR amendable to optimization also make it
amenable to program analysis, both static and dynamic. Similarly, the general stability of LLVM’s
IR and APIs has made it the go-to ecosystem for program analysis research.</li>
</ul>

<p>Broadly speaking, LLVM’s IR is divided into four (increasingly narrow) scopes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1Module.html"><em>Modules</em></a>,
corresponding (roughly) to translation units (e.g., a C source file and its headers)</li>
  <li><a href="https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1Function.html"><em>Functions</em></a>,
corresponding to (you guessed it) source functions</li>
  <li><a href="https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1BasicBlock.html"><em>Basic blocks</em></a>,
corresponding to straight-line sections of code connected to each other via
control flow</li>
  <li><a href="https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1Instruction.html"><em>Instructions</em></a>,
corresponding to individual semantics (think add, subtract, load, store, &amp;c)</li>
</ul>

<p>Instructions, in turn, take <a href="https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1Value.html"><em>Values</em></a>.
Functions, basic blocks, and instructions are themselves kinds of values<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>
(among many other kinds), completing the picture.</p>

<p>This blog post concerns a single LLVM instruction: <code>getelementptr</code>.</p>

<h2 id="first-steps">First steps</h2>

<p>Here’s how the
<a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#getelementptr-instruction">LLVM Language Reference</a> defines and
describes <code>getelementptr</code> as of LLVM 10:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&lt;result&gt; = getelementptr &lt;ty&gt;, &lt;ty&gt;* &lt;ptrval&gt;{, [inrange] &lt;ty&gt; &lt;idx&gt;}*
&lt;result&gt; = getelementptr inbounds &lt;ty&gt;, &lt;ty&gt;* &lt;ptrval&gt;{, [inrange] &lt;ty&gt; &lt;idx&gt;}*
&lt;result&gt; = getelementptr &lt;ty&gt;, &lt;ptr vector&gt; &lt;ptrval&gt;, [inrange] &lt;vector index type&gt; &lt;idx&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ‘<code>getelementptr</code>’ instruction is used to get the address of a subelement of an aggregate data
structure. It performs address calculation only and does not access memory. The instruction can
also be used to calculate a vector of such addresses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words: it’s a souped up LLVM version of x86’s
<a href="https://c9x.me/x86/html/file_module_x86_id_153.html"><code>lea</code></a>: it computes the effective address of
some field <em>without</em> actually touching any memory. I say “souped up” because it can do a few things
that (a single) <code>lea</code> can’t:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A single <code>lea</code>’s ability to compute an indirect address is constrained by
<a href="https://blog.yossarian.net/2020/06/13/How-x86_64-addresses-memory">x86’s addressing modes</a>: if an effective
address into some data structure can’t be computed by the combination of the
<em>scale</em>, <em>index</em>, <em>base</em>, and <em>displacement</em> parameters, then multiple <code>lea</code>s are necessary to get
to the ultimate address. This is <strong>not</strong> true for <code>getelementptr</code>: a single <code>getelementptr</code>
instruction can have as many nested indices as an LLVM frontend is content to generate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like most LLVM instructions, <code>getelementptr</code> has a “vector” variant: instead of returning a
single computed address, it can return a vector of addresses computed together. Consequently,
for the vectorized variant, some (or even all) of the <code>getelementptr</code>’s index arguments
must be vectors themselves.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve read this official overview <em>dozens</em> of times, and I <em>basically</em> understand it. Nonetheless,
my eyes still swim whenever I actually <em>read</em> a <code>getelementptr</code> in real IR. LLVM’s developers
are aware of how confusing <code>getelementptr</code> is: they have an
<a href="https://llvm.org/docs/GetElementPtr.html">entire separate page</a> dedicated to explaining its syntax,
why it doesn’t touch memory, and the various constraints on constructing a valid one.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, what that page <em>doesn’t</em> have is a ton of side-by-side examples with real C code.
So that’s what I’m going to do today. All examples will use global variables and
<code>-fno-discard-value-names</code> to make the generated IR a bit easier to read.</p>

<h3 id="basic-addressing">Basic addressing</h3>

<p>Let’s take a look at a trivial C function that just returns the first element in a global array:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>long</span> <span>*</span><span>nums</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>};</span>
<span>long</span> <span>index_first</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>nums</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and the generated IR (cleaned up a bit):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>@nums</span> <span>=</span> <span>dso_local</span> <span>global</span> <span>i64</span><span>*</span> <span>inttoptr</span> <span>(</span><span>i64</span> <span>1</span> <span>to</span> <span>i64</span><span>*),</span> <span>align</span> <span>8</span>

<span>define</span> <span>dso_local</span> <span>i64</span> <span>@index_first</span><span>()</span> <span>#0</span><span>{</span>
  <span>%0</span> <span>=</span> <span>load</span> <span>i64</span><span>*,</span> <span>i64</span><span>**</span> <span>@nums</span><span>,</span> <span>align</span> <span>8</span>
  <span>%arrayidx</span> <span>=</span> <span>getelementptr</span> <span>inbounds</span> <span>i64</span><span>,</span> <span>i64</span><span>*</span> <span>%0</span><span>,</span> <span>i64</span> <span>0</span>
  <span>%1</span> <span>=</span> <span>load</span> <span>i64</span><span>,</span> <span>i64</span><span>*</span> <span>%arrayidx</span><span>,</span> <span>align</span> <span>8</span>
  <span>ret</span> <span>i64</span> <span>%1</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>(View it on <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/G6G1xr">Godbolt</a>.)</em></p>

<p>Now, step by step:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We <code>load</code> our global <code>nums</code> into <code>%0</code>, with type <code>i64*</code><sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></li>
  <li>
    <p>We use <code>getelementptr</code> to calculate the address of an <code>i64</code> (the first argument), using:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code>%0</code> as our base address (the second argument)</li>
      <li><code>0</code> as our index (the third argument)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>…and we store our calculated address into <code>%arrayidx</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>We <code>load</code> an <code>i64</code> from our calculated address (<code>%arrayidx</code>) into <code>%1</code></li>
  <li>We <code>ret</code> our loaded value (<code>%1</code>)</li>
</ol>

<p>That’s not too bad at all! <code>getelementptr</code> behaves <em>exactly</em> like the simple index operation that
it models.</p>

<p>What if we change <code>nums</code> to an array? Arrays decompose to pointers in C so it should be the same, right?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>long</span> <span>nums</span><span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>};</span>
<span>long</span> <span>index_first</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>nums</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Wrong! LLVM IR isn’t C, and doesn’t play by C’s rules. In particular, it has sized array types that
can be <em>cast</em> to pointers, but that don’t decompose on their own:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>@nums</span> <span>=</span> <span>dso_local</span> <span>global</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span> <span>x</span> <span>i64</span><span>]</span> <span>[</span><span>i64</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>i64</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>i64</span> <span>3</span><span>],</span> <span>align</span> <span>16</span>

<span>define</span> <span>dso_local</span> <span>i64</span> <span>@index_first</span><span>()</span> <span>#0</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>%0</span> <span>=</span> <span>load</span> <span>i64</span><span>,</span> <span>i64</span><span>*</span> <span>getelementptr</span> <span>inbounds</span> <span>([</span><span>3</span> <span>x</span> <span>i64</span><span>],</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span> <span>x</span> <span>i64</span><span>]*</span> <span>@nums</span><span>,</span> <span>i64</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>i64</span> <span>0</span><span>),</span> <span>align</span> <span>16</span>
  <span>ret</span> <span>i64</span> <span>%0</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>(View it on <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/eYebqK">Godbolt</a>.)</em></p>

<p>This is simpler in some ways and more complicated in others: <code>getelementptr</code> is now invoked
inline within the <code>load</code><sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>, but we’ve also saved a <code>load</code> and two SSA variables.</p>

<p>Breaking the <code>getelementptr</code> down:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We’re calculating the address of an <code>[3 x i64]</code> (i.e., an array of 3 <code>i64</code>s) (first argument)</li>
  <li><code>nums</code> is our base address, which has type <code>[3 x i64]*</code> (second argument)</li>
</ul>

<p>But wait, there are <strong>two</strong> <code>i64 0</code> indexes instead of just one! What gives?</p>

<p>As best I can tell, this is a quirk of the new type of <code>nums</code>: it’s not a pointer anymore, but an
array. However, because we’re accessing it <em>through</em> a pointer (because that’s how <code>getelementptr</code>
is defined), we actually need two <code>0</code> indexes: the first to piece the pointer, and the second to
index the array itself. Same operation, slightly more indirection within the IR<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="more-indirection">More indirection</h3>

<p>What happens when we add a level of source indirection, like an index variable?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>long</span> <span>nums</span><span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>};</span>
<span>long</span> <span>i</span><span>;</span>
<span>long</span> <span>index_i</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>nums</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s nearly identical to our second trivial example! The only thing that’s changed is our
last index, going from <code>0</code> to <code>%0</code> (which corresponds to our loaded <code>i</code>). This in
turn confirms what we thought about the two <code>i64 0</code>s above: that the first (still present)
simply pierces the pointer, while the second performs the “actual” indexing.</p>

<p>Let’s try it with more <del>flavor</del> dimensionality:</p>

<p>yields:</p>

<p>Exactly as expected: all we’re doing is indexing one layer deeper into the aggregate with the same

<p>Adding a little bit of math makes it clear that the order of the indexes is as we expect:</p>

<p><span>Abstract</span></p>
<p>
Physics-based rendering algorithms generate photorealistic images by simulating the flow of light through a detailed mathematical representation of a virtual scene. In contrast, <b>physics-based differentiable rendering</b> algorithms focus on computing derivative of images exhibiting complex light transport effects (e.g., soft shadows, interreflection, and caustics) with respect to arbitrary scene parameters such as camera pose, object geometry (e.g., vertex positions) as well as spatially varying material properties expressed as 2D textures and 3D volumes. This new level of generality has made physics-based differentiable rendering a key ingredient for solving many challenging inverse-rendering problems, that is, the search of scene configurations optimizing user-specified objective functions, using gradient-based methods
</p>
<p>
Further, these techniques can be incorporated into probabilistic inference and machine learning pipelines. For instance, differentiable renderers allow "rendering losses" to be computed with complex light transport effects captured. Additionally, they can be used as generative models that synthesize photorealistic images.
</p>
<p>
<u><b>Challenges.</b></u> Compared to its "ordinary" counterpart, physics-based differentiable rendering introduces unique theoretical and practical challenges. For instance, practical problems can involve many (e.g., 10<sup>6</sup>--10<sup>10</sup>) parameters, making simple techniques for differentiation such as finite differences impractical. More advanced tools for automatic differentiation (e.g., <tt>PyTorch</tt> or <tt>Tensorflow</tt>) record a graph of intermediate computation steps that tends to become prohibitively large. Lastly, geometric derivatives involve a unique challenge: boundaries of objects introduce troublesome discontinuities during the computation of shadows and interreflections that lead to incorrect gradients if precautions are not taken. Thankfully, recent advances in physics-based differentiable rendering theory have enabled the differentiation of radiometric measurements with respect to arbitrary scene parameters as well as unbiased Monte Carlo estimators. <b>In this course, we provide an in-depth introduction to general-purpose physics-based differentiable rendering.</b>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>I had already heard of
<a href="https://fauna.com/client-serverless" title="client-serverless architecture" target="_blank" rel="noopener">client-serverless architecture</a> and read a bunch of articles about the subject when I came up with the idea of creating a
<a href="https://recept0r.com/" title="personal use recipes app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personal use recipes app</a> earlier this year - I hadn’t done anything like that before though.</p><p><img src="https://ttntm.me/img/blog/client-serverless-credit-faunadb.png" alt="client-serverless application model"></p><p>What I had in mind at this point was a minimal web application that would serve me and my wife as a recipes collection for food that we enjoy cooking. Convenient bonus features like PWA functionality (i.e. using the app on the phone or tablet when standing in the kitchen) and user authentication should be available too, making sure it’s not just functional, but also enjoyable to use.</p><p>At first, I was tempted to go for a static site + headless CMS approach that worked really well for many other projects I did - it could be considered serverless, but it wouldn’t have been a challenge, nor anything I hadn’t done before; and that’s precisely the reason I went looking for something else, eventually going for Vue.js + FaunaDB for this project.</p><h3 id="why-fauna">Why Fauna?</h3><p>The first time I came across
<a href="https://dashboard.fauna.com/accounts/register?utm_source=DevTo&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=WritewithFauna_ServerlessRecipes_TDoe" title="FaunaDB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FaunaDB</a> was when I was looking for SQL alternatives for a project at work last year. We didn’t go for it (PostgreSQL was chosen in the end), but I kept it in mind for the future. Back then, it may have sounded a little “too good to be true” for the majority of the decision makers involved, but marketing statements like “add a global datastore to your app in minutes” and “don’t worry about database correctness, sharding, provisioning, latency, or scale” left me with an overall positive impression of their service.</p><p>So, when I had to pick a database for my recipes app, I found myself looking at FaunaDB’s website again, checking out their
<a href="https://dashboard.fauna.com/accounts/register?utm_source=DevTo&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=WritewithFauna_ServerlessRecipes_TDoe" title="pricing model" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pricing model</a> this time. The “Always Free” plan seemed generous enough to support a small personal use app, so I didn’t hesitate much and signed up right away.</p><p>To be honest, I didn’t really bother looking for alternatives too much - self hosted databases or things like AWS/Azure/Firebase were not quite what I had in mind.</p><h2 id="basic-app-functionality">Basic App Functionality</h2><p>The recipes app I built can be described as a basic CRUD (create-read-update-delete) application - there’s no intense computing or sophisticated algorithms. The recipes are available in read-only mode to the public, whereas creating, editing and deleting them requires an authenticated user (i.e. the author). Other than that, there are smaller convenience features like search, filtering and a dedicated page to see your own recipes.</p><h3 id="vue-app-setup">Vue App Setup</h3><p>Vue.js was on my list of “frameworks I’d like to work with” for a while, so the decision of going for it was a rather easy one. If you’re looking for some good reasons in favor of using Vue in general, some of them can be found here:
<a href="https://michaelnthiessen.com/underdog-framework" title="michaelnthiessen.com/underdog-framework" target="_blank" rel="noopener">michaelnthiessen.com/underdog-framework</a></p><p>What I ended up building can be described as a classic SPA with multiple routes (i.e. pages) for different functions. For anonymous users, it loads a page of recipe cards that can be searched and an “About” page. Each recipe card can be clicked, which opens its respective details page containing the actual cooking instructions and a nice image. There’s a login button that can be used to both sign up and sign in - public signup is currently disabled though, as this is an invite only service at the moment.</p><p>Once logged in, registered users get 2 additional routes: “Create” and “My Recipes”. As the respective title suggests, these pages can be used to either create additional recipes or to view a sortable list of the current user’s recipes. Editing and deleting recipes is a part of each recipe’s details page when logged in as the recipe’s author.</p><p>Each of the app’s individual routes=pages was implemented as its own Vue
<a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/single-file-components.html" title="SFC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SFC</a> file, shared functionality (i.e. navbar, toast messages, etc.) makes use of reusable components. To tie it all together, Vue extensions like <code>vue-router</code> and <code>vuex</code> were used to manage rounting and application state more efficiently - you’re welcome to browse the full list of dependencies
<a href="https://github.com/ttntm/recept0r/blob/master/package.json" title="on GitHub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on GitHub</a> if you’re interested in what other packages I used.</p><h3 id="faunadb-setup">FaunaDB Setup</h3><p>Setting up a database in FaunaDB is surprisingly easy - log in to your account, create a database and finally create a collection for your data (i.e. recipes). Their
<a href="https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/start/cloud" title="documentation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documentation</a> regarding “getting started” is quite good and there’s also an interactive tutorial that provides a practical introduction once you signed up.</p><p>As FaunaDB is schema-less and close to zero-config, the structure of my app’s data organically grew from its needs. An example can probably help to clarify what I mean here: initially, I didn’t really think much about where to store the images for the recipes. FaunaDB is technically able to store Base64 encoded images inside the recipe objects, so I went for that approach initially. As images tend to be large though, this inflated my database, added a lot of bandwidth consumption and crippled loading times on top of that - I can assure you that it’s not a good idea (also
<a href="https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/api/fql/documents#limits" title="not recommended" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not recommended</a> by FaunaDB themselves).</p><p>That’s not the point though - my app wrote the Base64 images into the database without any specific configuration and later <a href="https://ttntm.me/blog/how-to-use-cloudinary-with-vue-app/">replaced them with links to the actual images</a> just like that as well. FaunaDB simply adjusts to the data you provide, even if not all data inside a collection has the same set of properties (i.e. some recipes with picture, others without).</p><p><strong>To sum it up</strong>: as far as my rather simple application is concerned, FaunaDB was quick and easy to set up and configure, no matter what data I provided or how I ended up transforming and manipulating it.</p><h2 id="serverless-functionality">Serverless Functionality</h2><p>It would have been possible to implement the necessary database operations directly in the Vue app (see
<a href="https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/drivers/javascript.html" title="Fauna's JS driver" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fauna's JS driver</a>, but that would have been a severe security concern. I decided to add a 3rd layer here, forcing database operations to go through Netlify functions. These serverless functions provide a clear separation of concerns and added security for the database access token.</p><p>But what are Netlify functions?</p><p>Here’s an explanatory paragraph from
<a href="https://functions.netlify.com/" title="their website" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their website</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Functions are scripts that you write and deploy with Netlify. The function’s code is hidden from the public, but you can interact with it just like any other API service.</p></blockquote><p>For my app, I am using a couple of these functions for what would otherwise have to be backend or server-side functionality - more specifically for all database operations and user identity management (via

<a href="https://alligator.io/nodejs/solve-cors-once-and-for-all-netlify-dev" title="Solve CORS once and for all with Netlify Dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Solve CORS once and for all with Netlify Dev</a></p><p>So, if you’re going to use Netlify functions, this is as good as it gets - really simple configuration and immediate success. Just keep in mind or bookmark&nbsp;<code>localhost:8888</code> - your terminal output (based on Vue CLI and Webpack) will continue to direct you to port 8080 instead where functions don’t work and none of the success is visible.</p><h3 id="user-authentication">User Authentication</h3><p>The user signup and login procedures I used for my app are based on a library called
<a href="https://github.com/netlify/gotrue-js" title="gotrue-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gotrue-js</a> that in itself “is a client library for the
<a href="https://github.com/netlify/gotrue" title="GoTrue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoTrue</a> API” (both by Netlify).</p><blockquote><p>GoTrue is a small open-source API written in golang, that can act as a self-standing API service for handling user registration and authentication for JAM projects.</p></blockquote><p>On top of that, large parts of the code I used for my app’s user authentication process are based on
<a href="https://github.com/chiubaca/vue-netlify-fauna-starter-kit" title="this repository" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this repository</a> where <code>gotrue-js</code> was successfully implemented for a Vue.js based application. A truly helpful resource indeed.</p><h3 id="functions">Functions</h3><p>With both the Vue app and the FaunaDB instance up and running, the following serverless functions can be considered the app’s backbone. To make them work, FaunaDB’s JavaScript Driver, the client secret and
<a href="https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/api/fql/" title="Fauna Query Language" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fauna Query Language</a> are used.</p><h4 id="read-recipes-from-the-database">Read Recipes from the Database</h4><p>Recipes are stored in the database as an array of JSON data. In order to display those recipes to the app’s users, they have to be obtained from the database when one of these things happens:</p><ol><li>User navigates to the app’s front page</li><li>User navigates to an individual recipe’s details page</li><li>User navigates to the “My Recipes” page</li></ol><p>These cases are implemented as a separate Netlify function each.

  <section id="content">

    
      
<p>———— ♦ ————</p>

<p>We widely detail attractive features of NATO strap on Esprit NATO, we are here concentrating on the myth "James Bond and NATO straps".</p>
<p>Let's start with the bad news : <strong>Sean Connery's strap in Golfinger (1964) was not a NATO strap</strong>. Many of us think the opposite, which have most likely contributed to the sucess of NATO straps, but we believe this watch strap first became famous mainly because of its characteristics and many benefits.</p>
<p>However, <strong>James Bond and NATO straps are indeniably connected</strong>. Why ? This is what we suggest to focus on this page...</p>

<p>———— ♦ ————</p>
<h3>James Bond was wearing a nylon strap in Goldfinger in 1964</h3>

<p><img src="https://www.esprit-nato.com/img/cms/James%20Bond/Sean-Connery-nylon-watch-strap-Goldfinger-1964.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="649"></p>

<p>The nylon strap was then put on the famous <strong>Rolex Submariner ref. 6538</strong>, iconic James Bond's watch.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.esprit-nato.com/img/cms/James%20Bond/Sean-Connery-nylon-watch-strap-Goldfinger-1964-focus-1.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="480"></p>

<p>It was 16 mm wide on a 20 mm lug width watch. It's a unique and surprising style as much aesthetically as functionaly. Not so British...</p>
<p>It is said that the strap <strong>belonged to a member of the production team</strong> who came to the assitance of this Submariner at the last minute. This would be an explanation of the wrong width... A mishap that would have left its mark in history ? We were unable to verify this information.</p>

<p>———— ♦ ————</p>
<h3>Why did this Submariner 6538 absolutely need a nylon strap ?</h3>
<p>Because at that time none other strap enabled to put James Bond's watch both on his wrist and on his diving suit, <strong>typical feature of nylon strap,</strong> which thereafter is part of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esprit-nato.com/content/9-l-histoire-du-bracelet-nato" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some requirements for the Royal Navy</a>...</p>

<p><img src="https://www.esprit-nato.com/img/cms/James%20Bond/Sean-Connery-nylon-watch-strap-Goldfinger-1964-focus-2.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="628"></p>

<p>———— ♦ ————</p>
<h3>Why is this Goldfinger strap not a NATO strap ?</h3>
<p>For two reasons :</p>
<p>- NATO straps and its strict requirements emerged <strong>nine years after</strong>, in 1973, further to British MOD request - <a href="https://www.esprit-nato.com/content/9-l-histoire-du-bracelet-nato" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we explain this in detail on a dedicated page</a>.</p>
<p>- Sean Connery's Submariner strap in Goldfinger has <strong>a nylon loop</strong>, whereas NATO straps have two steel loops.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.esprit-nato.com/img/cms/James%20Bond/Sean-Connery-nylon-watch-strap-Goldfinger-1964-focus-3.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="827"></p>

<p>James Bond was then wearing a single pass nylon strap with a nylon loop from the same band (same width and pattern).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.esprit-nato.com/bracelets-montre-nylon/153-le-vrai-james-bond-sean-connery-dans-goldfinger-noir-kaki-rouge.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">We are proposing a version here on Esprit NATO</a>.</p>

<p>———— ♦ ————</p>
<h3>Another nylon strap in Goldfinger</h3>
<p>Pussy Galore, Goldfinger's private pilot, was wearing a Coke Rolex GMT Master ref. 6542 on a nylon strap too. Her character was one of the first woman to wear a Rolex sport watch for men in a movie.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.esprit-nato.com/img/cms/James%20Bond/Pussy-Galore-nylon-strap-Rolex-6542-Goldfinger-1964.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="1077"></p>

<p>Was nylon strap already essential ?</p>

<p>———— ♦ ————</p>
<h3>The real NATO strap in James Bond world</h3>

<p><img src="https://www.esprit-nato.com/img/cms/James%20Bond/publicite-bracelet-NATO-James-Bond.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="360"></p>

<p>We have seen several similarities between Sean Connery's nylon strap in Goldfinger and <a href="https://www.esprit-nato.com/content/9-l-histoire-du-bracelet-nato" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the original NATO designed for British army</a>. It is probably <strong>the origin of the confusion</strong>...</p>

<p>———— ♦ ————</p>
<h3>Myth becomes reality</h3>
<p>In 2008, Daniel Craig is wearing a Rolex 6538 Submariner "Big Crown" offered by Barbara Broccoli, current producer of James Bond movies, and daughter of the original James Bond producer (Albert "Cubby" Broccoli), and he is wearing this inconic watch on ...</p>

<p><img src="https://www.esprit-nato.com/img/cms/James%20Bond/bracelet-NATO-Daniel-Craig-James-Bond-Rolex-Submariner-6538-1.jpg" alt="" width="799" height="1249"></p>

<p>No doubt, it is a real NATO strap as we clearly identify one of its typical stainless steel loops.</p>

<p>———— ♦ ————</p>
<h3>James Bond straps on Esprit NATO</h3>
<h4>The most mythical</h4>
<p>The most mythical pattern is Sean Connery's one in Goldfinger, Black 2 Green stripes and Burgundy borders. We propose it in multiple variations <strong>under the name "Bond Original"</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.esprit-nato.com/bracelets-montre-nylon/153-le-vrai-james-bond-sean-connery-dans-goldfinger-noir-kaki-rouge.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">But here is the authentic Bond Original Goldfinger strap</a> :</p>

<p><a href="https://www.esprit-nato.com/bracelets-montre-nylon/153-le-vrai-james-bond-sean-connery-dans-goldfinger-noir-kaki-rouge.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.esprit-nato.com/img/cms/James%20Bond/Bracelet-US-Military-Vrai-James-Bond-Sean-Connery-Noir-Kaki-Rouge.jpg" alt="" width="801" height="534"></a></p>

<h4>The most famous</h4>
<p>The most famous James Bond pattern is the Black 2 Grey stripes, for several reasons :</p>
<ul><li>It is Daniel Craig's one.</li>
<li>Goldfinger movie was initially in black and white, so the original pattern looked like black and grey. Confusion has existed for a long time...</li>
<li>It matches to any watch, any style and any other colours, and remains sober despite its strong character.</li>
</ul><p>We propose it <strong>under the name "Craig Bond"</strong>. It is so essential that you will find on Esprit NATO in <strong>every design and size</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.esprit-nato.com/nato-boucles-polies-bracelets-montre/276-bracelet-nylon-nato-bond-craig-noir-gris-boucle-polie.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.esprit-nato.com/img/cms/James%20Bond/Bracelet-NATO-Prestige-James-Bond-Craig-Noir-Gris.jpg" alt="" width="801" height="534"></a></p>

<h4>Others</h4>
<p>By extension, we name <a href="https://www.esprit-nato.com/6-nato-james-bond-bracelets-montre" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>"James Bond NATO straps"</strong></a> every 2 stripes strap (with or without borders).</p>

<hr><p><em>We hope you are now convinced that NATO strap and James Bond are connected forever.</em></p>
<p><em>However, if you want to watch Goldfinger again or to buy a Bond NATO, then we succeeded in our mission...</em></p>

<p><strong>This post is superseded by an <a href="https://www.timlrx.com/2020/05/10/benchmark-of-popular-graph-network-packages-v2/">updated benchmark</a></strong></p>
<p>In this post I benchmark the performance of 5 popular graph/network packages. This was inspired by two questions I had:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Recently, I have been working with large networks (millions of vertices and edges) and often wonder what is the best currently available package/tool that would scale well and handle large scale network analysis tasks. Having tried out a few (networkx in Python and igraph in R) but on different problems, I thought it would be nice to have a head to head comparison.</p></li>
<li><p>Running large scale computations is also much easier nowadays with the availability of virtual machines that could be easily spinned up thanks to the growth of cloud computing. I think the trend of powerful single machines will eliminate a lot of the need for enterprise clusters so it will be interesting to see how far we can push a single machine using optimised algorithms.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
</ol>
<p>To replicate the benchmark study and for the full codes, please refer to <a href="https://github.com/timlrx/graph-benchmarks">my github repository</a>. Instructions on how to setup and install the packages are also located in the repository.</p>
<div id="setup">
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>The benchmark was carried out using a Google Compute n1-standard-16 instance (16vCPU Haswell 2.3GHz, 60 GB memory). I compare 5 different packages:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://graph-tool.skewed.de/">graph-tool</a></li>
<li><a href="https://igraph.org/redirect.html">igraph</a></li>
<li><a href="https://networkit.github.io/">networkit</a></li>
<li><a href="https://networkx.github.io/">networkx</a></li>
<li><a href="https://snap.stanford.edu/snappy/">snap</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Networkx is written in Python while the other four packages are based on C / C++ but have Python APIs. Igraph has a R and Mathematica binding as well but to be consistent the following benchmark was based on the Python one. The other 3 libraries (snap, networkit and graph-tool) have an additional emphasis on performance with multi-processing capabilities built in.</p>
<p>Selecting what tasks to compare on is not really a trivial task with each package offering various tools and capabilities. In the end, I decided to focus on 5 specific problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>loading the data</li>
<li>single source shortest path</li>
<li>page rank</li>
<li>k-core decomposition</li>
<li>strongly connected components</li>
</ul>
<p>Loading is more of an I/O task while the other 4 are common graph algorithms. Disclaimer: I try as much as possible to specify the same parameters for each algorithm but differences in API across the packages could translate to actual differences in how the algorithm is run and the final output.</p>
<p><span>13/12/2019 Edit: Some of the observed differences in performance might be a result of different stopping criteria used - see algorithms for more information.</span></p>
<p>3 datasets from the <a href="https://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html">Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection</a> were used in the exercise:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon0302.html">amazon</a>, 262k nodes, 1.2m edges</li>
<li><a href="https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Google.html">google</a>, 875k nodes, 5.1m edges</li>
<li><a href="https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-Pokec.html">pokec</a>, 1.6m nodes, 30.6m edges</li>
</ul>
<p>While it is the easiest to rank the packages based on the run-time of the algorithms, it is only one of the many considerations of what makes a good package. I try to offer a more subjective view based on my experience with these packages.</p>
</div>

<div id="results">
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>All timings reported are normalised to reflect the run time for a single run of the task.</p>
<p>Networkx is much slower than any of the other libraries. Across all computation tasks and for all datasets it is around 10 times slower than the <em>slowest</em> library.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> For example, it took 67s to run the single source shortest path problem on the Pokec dataset compared to 6.8s for networkit (the next slowest). Page rank took more than 10 minutes to run compared to 1 minute for igraph. Hence, I left it out of the comparison plots.</p>
<p>Here are the run times of the remaining four packages:</p>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b13c3d06c53af36cafd2b861d21948ee7613dd3a/3c0f3/post/2019-05-05-benchmark-of-popular-graph-network-packages_files/figure-html/plot_all-1.png" width="672"></p>

<h3>I/O</h3>
<p>Looking at the plots above, graph-tool and networkit loads data much more slowly than the other two libraries. I was reading the datasets as a tab delimited file and graph-tool basically uses a Python code to parse the input. The other 3 packages should be using C libraries to read the files which result in better performance.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div id="algorithms">
<h3>Algorithms</h3>
<p>Networkit and graph-tool takes the top spot in most of the tests with graph-tool having the shortest run time for the single source shortest path and connected components problems and networkit winning the race for k-core and page rank.</p>
<p>When networkit is fast, it is extremely fast. On the pokec dataset it takes just 0.2s to run the page rank algorithm (graph-tool: 1.7s, igraph: 59.6s, snap: 19.5s). For the k-core decomposition it is also 10 times faster than all other competitors or 2000 times networkx. That is consistent with the findings of their research paper where they claim that using some of the latest state of the art algorithms led to their processing speed being faster by an order of magnitude. However, for the shortest path problem (not analysed in their paper) it lags behind all other packages.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p><span>13/12/2019 Edit: Matthew Galati from SAS pointed out that for the pagerank algorithm, networkit (as of version 6.0) uses L2 norm as a stopping criteria while other packages use the L1 norm. This means that it is doing fewer iterations and the speed is somewhat artificial. Thanks Matthew!</span></p>
<p>graph-tool is the most steady performer and achieves very impressive performance across all four tasks. With openMP support it betters igraph and snap across all tasks. It is 3 to 10+ times faster than those two packages.</p>
<p>igraph and snap achieves mostly similar performance across all tasks with a slight edge towards snap. This is also consistent with snap’s research findings.</p>
</div>
<div id="other-considerations">
<h3>Other Considerations</h3>
<p>There are also other important considerations when making a switch from networkx or igraph to one graph-tool or networkit.</p>
<p><strong>Packages</strong><br>
First, the algorithms available differ quite significantly across the packages. Users interested in switching to one of these packages should read the documentation on the list of features available. For example, while they all contain the basic tools needed to manipulate networks, graph-tool does not have the more usual modular clustering tools but has additional functionalities on statistical inference on graphs using stochastic block models.</p>
<p>Visualising networks is also an important part of the analytical tool chain. Igraph implements quite a few layout algorithms and renders them using the cairo library. Snap supports graphviz while graph-tool supports both graphviz and cairo. Networkit takes a different approach and relies on networkx to draw while also providing support and integration with Gephi via its streaming plugin.</p>
<p><strong>API</strong><br>
Moving away from native Python or R means that the syntax for the packages can sometimes be quite convoluted. I compare the syntax for the shortest path problem below. Writing it in networkx would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>nx.shortest_path_length(g, nodeid)</code></pre>
<p>igraph:</p>
<pre><code>g.shortest_paths([g.vs[node_index]])</code></pre>
<p>graph-tool:</p>
<pre><code>shortest_distance(g, g.vertex(node_index))</code></pre>
<p>networkit:</p>
<pre><code>distance.BFS(g, node_index).run()</code></pre>
<p>snap:</p>
<pre><code>NIdToDistH = snap.TIntH()
snap.GetShortPath(g, node_index, NIdToDistH, True)</code></pre>
<p>Of all, I find snap’s the most cumbersome since one has to define an additional variable (with the correct variable type) to store the results before running it. Running more advanced functions on graph-tool and networkit also requires a user to pre-define variables with the correct type to store results.<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Support and Documentation</strong><br>
User support and documentation is really important when one wants to use the project in an actual project setting. Networkx is by far the winner in this category with more than 4k github stars and lots of issues documented in github and stackoverflow. Igraph fairs decently as well with more than a thousand stars across its different modules.</p>
<p>graph-tool and networkit has much smaller followings though the creators seem relatively responsive to user issues and the packages are in active development.</p>
<p>snap was last updated on July 2018 but still supports only Python 2.7.x versions.</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusion">
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Overall, I am pleasantly surprised at the performance of the libraries especially graph-tool and networkit and plan to play around with them further. The fact that they breeze through the Pokec dataset is a good sign, but it will be interesting to find out what is the limit before computation becomes slow or memory issues start appearing.</p>
<p>As for recommendations on which package people should learn, I think picking up networkx is still important as it makes network science very accessible with a wide range of tools and capabilities. If analysis starts being too slow (and maybe that’s why you are here) then I will suggest taking a look at graph-tool or networkit to see if they contain the necessary algorithms for your needs.</p>

				<p>While I have nothing against Rust as such and keep writing my pet project in Rust, there are still some deficiencies I find preventing Rust from being a proper programming language. Here I’d like to present them and explain why I deem them as such even if not all of them have any impact on me.<br>
<span id="more-1971"></span></p>
<h3>Rust language problems</h3>
<p>First and foremost, <strong>Rust does not have a formal language specification</strong> and by that I mean that while some bits like grammar and objects are explained, there are no formal rules to describe what language features can and cannot be. If you’ve ever looked at ISO C standard you’ve seen that almost any entity there has three or four parts in the description: formal syntax, constraints (i.e. what is not allowed or what can’t be done with it), semantics (i.e. what it does, how it impacts the program, what implementation caveats are there), and there may be some examples to illustrate the points. The best close equivalent in Rust is <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Rust Reference</a> and e.g. structure there is described in the following way: syntax (no objections there), definition in a form of “A struct is a nominal struct type defined with the keyword <code>struct</code>.”, examples, a brief mention of empty (or unit-like) structures in the middle of examples, and “The precise memory layout of a struct is not specified.” at the end. I understand that adding new features is more important than documenting them but this is lame.</p>
<p>A proper mature language (with 1.0 in its version) should have a formal specification that should be useful both for people developing compilers and the programmers trying to understand certain intricacies of the language and why it does not work as expected (more on that later). For example, for that <code>struct</code> definition I find lacking at least these: mentioning that you can have <code>impl</code> for it (even a reference would do—even if you have to repeat it for every type), split off tuples into a separate entry because it’s very different syntactically and raises a question why you have anonymous tuples and not anonymous structs (which you also can’t find from the documentation), and of course create proper layout so that rather important information (about memory layout for example) is not lost among examples.</p>
<p>And now to the specific problems I encounter quite often and I don’t know whether I understand it wrong or the compiler understands it wrong. And since there’s no formal specification I can’t tell which one it is (even if the former is most probable).</p>
<p><strong>Function/method calling convention.</strong> Here’s a simple example:</p>
<blockquote><p>
struct Foo { a: i32 }<br>
impl Foo { fn bar(&amp;mut self, val: i32) { self.a = val + 42; } }<br>
fn main() {<br>
&nbsp; let mut foo = Foo { a: 0 };<br>
&nbsp; foo.bar(foo.a);<br>
}
</p></blockquote>
<p>For now this won’t compile because of the borrowing but shouldn’t the compiler be smart enough to create a copy of <code>foo.a</code> before call? I’m not sure but IIRC current implementation first mutably borrows object for the call and only then tries to borrow the arguments. Is it really so and if yes, why? <em>Update:</em> I’m told that newer versions of the compiler handle it just fine but the question still stands (was it just a compiler problem or the call definition has been changed?).</p>
<p>The other thing is the old C caveat of function arguments evaluation. Here’s a simple example:</p>
<blockquote><p>
let mut iter = “abc”.chars();<br>
foo(iter.next().unwrap(), iter.next().unwrap(), iter.next().unwrap());
</p></blockquote>
<p>So would it be <code>foo('a','b','c')</code> or <code>foo('c','b','a')</code> call. In C it’s undefined because it depends on how arguments are passed on the current platform (consider yourself lucky if you don’t remember <code>__pascal</code> or <code>__stdcall</code>). In Rust it’s undefined because there’s no formal specification to tell you even that much. And it would be even worse if you consider that you may use the same source for indexing the caller object like <code>handler[iter.next().unwrap() as usize].process(iter.next().unwrap());</code> in some theoretical bytecode handler (of course it’s a horrible way to write code and you should use named temporary variables but it should illustrate the problem).</p>
<p>And another source of annoyance for me is <strong>traits</strong>. I have almost no problems with owning/lifetime/borrowing concepts but traits get me almost every time. I’m vaguely aware that the answer to why the following problems exist is “because traits are implemented as a call table” but again, <em>should</em> they be implemented like that and what should be the constraints on them (after all the original object should be somehow linked to the trait pointer). So when you have a supertrait (i.e. <code>trait Foo: Bar</code>) you can’t easily cast it for subtrait (e.g. <code>&amp;Foo -&gt; &amp;Bar</code>) without writing a lot of boilerplate code. And even worse if you convert an object into <code>Box&lt;trait&gt;</code> there’s no way to get the original object back (still in boxed form of course; I remember seeing a special crate that implements a lot of boilerplate code in order to get a mutable reference though). To reiterate: the problem is not me being stupid but rather the lack of formal description on how it’s done and why what I want is so hard. Then I’d probably at least be able to realize how I should change my code to work around the limitations.</p>
<h3><code>rustc</code> problems</h3>
<p>No, I’m not going to talk about compilation speed. It’s certainly a nuisance but not a problem per se. Here I want to point rather theoretical problems that a mature language should not have. And having just one compiler is one of those problems (call that problem zero).</p>
<p>First of all, <strong>bootstrapping process</strong> is laughably bad. I realize that it’s never too easy but if you call yourself a systems programming language you should be able to bootstrap a compiler in a sane amount of steps. For instance, IIRC <code>Guix</code> has the following bootstrapping process for C compiler: simple C complier in Scheme (for which you can often write an implementation in assembly by hand) compiles TCC, TCC compiles GCC 2.95, GCC 2.95 compiles GCC 3.7, GCC 3.7 compiles GCC 4.9. For <code>rustc</code> you should either start with the original compiler written in OCaml and compile every following version with the previous one (i.e. 1.17 with 1.16) or cheat by using <code>mrustc</code> written in C++ which can compile Rust 1.19 or 1.29 (without borrow checks), then compile 1.30 with 1.29, 1.31 with 1.30 etc etc. The problem here is that you cannot skip versions and e.g. compile <code>rustc 1.46</code> with <code>rustc 1.36</code> (I’d be happy to learn that I’m wrong). IMO you should have maybe an ineffective compiler but written in a dialect that much older compiler should understand i.e. <code>rustc 1.0</code> should be able to compile a compiler for 1.10, which can be used to compile 1.20 and so forth. Of course it’s a huge waste of resources for rather theoretical problem but it may prove beneficial for compiler design itself.</p>
<p>Then there’s <strong>LLVM dependency.</strong> I understand that <code>LLVM</code> provides many advantages (like no need to worry about code generation for many platforms and optimising it) but it gives some disadvantages too. First, you don’t have a really self-hosting compiler (a theoretical problem but still a thing worth thinking about; also consider that you have to rely on a framework developed mostly by large corporations mostly in their own interests). Second, you’re limited by what it does e.g. I read complaints about debug builds being too slow mostly because of LLVM backend. And I suspect it still can’t do certain kinds of memory-related optimisations because it was designed with C++ compiler in mind which still has certain quirks regarding multiple memory access (plus IIRC there was one LLVM bug triggered by an infinite loop in Rust code that’s perfectly valid there but not according to C++ rules). I’m aware that <code>cranelift</code> exists (and Rust front-end for <code>GCC</code>) so hopefully this will be improved.</p>
<p>And finally there’s a thing related to the previous problem. Rust has poor <strong>support for assembly</strong>. Of course not so many people need standalone assembly and not inline one (which is still lacking but <code>asm!</code> is almost there) but languages oriented for systems programming support compiling assembly in addition to the higher-language code so it would be <em>proper</em> to support assembly files even with not so rich preprocessor syntax as GAS has. Fiddling with <code>build.rs</code> to invoke an external assembler is possible but not nice at all.</p>
<h3>Other Rust language problems</h3>
<p>There’s also one problem with Rust <code>std</code> library that I should mention too. It’s useless for interfacing OS. Now if I want to do something natural to any UNIX system I need to at least import <code>libc</code> crate <del datetime="2020-09-19T03:32:25+00:00">and link against an external libc</del> (it’s part of the runtime anyway). One solution would be that crate I heard of that wanted to translate <code>musl</code> into Rust so you can at least eliminate the linking step. But the proper solution would be to support at least OS-specific syscall() in <code>std</code> crate as many interesting libc functions are just a wrapper over it (like <code>open()</code>/<code>write()</code>/<code>ioctl()</code>; Windows is a different beast so I don’t mind if it’s <code>std::os::unix::syscall</code> and not something more common).</p>
<hr>
<p>I’m not a Rust language architect and I’m extremely unlikely to become one but I have an opinion on what Rust lacks in order to become a proper mature language really fit for systems development (three things essentially: being fully self-hosted, having a specification, and being able to interface low-level stuff without resorting to C compiler or assembler). Hopefully this will be rectified despite the lack of Mozilla.</p>

	<div>

		
<p>As an experienced software engineer or IT professional, you have spent many years building up your expertise and your skill-set. You’ve built many solutions and you have solved many problems for clients of various sizes. You have finally decided to turn your expertise into a proper business and escape the rat race once and for all. </p>



<p>Perhaps you’ve even put a team together and have managed to secure a client or two with some decent projects. Everything is looking promising. </p>



<p>Except you run into a little problem. </p>



<p>You have NO idea how to get more clients. </p>



<p>The B2B sales process for technology products and services is complicated, it requires reaching out to the right people who are in a position to make a decision and navigating a complex sales cycle, and you don’t even know where to begin. In fact, you hate this part You really really do. You’re a technology person after all. You’re brilliant at what you do. Surely you shouldn’t have to engage in low-life scummy sales tactics to find clients. You really hate this part. </p>



<p>But you have a business now, so you try. You send out some cold e-mails. You pitch some people on LinkedIn. You spend some money on social media ads, and it just goes down a drain. And then…. nothing. Zero. You have NO new clients. You’re in a rut. You begin to panic.</p>



<hr>



<p>But there is good news. </p>



<p>Let’s take a step back. Whenever you find yourself in a rut, always take a step back. Take a few deep breaths, calm yourself down for a moment, and try to get more general. Try to look at the big picture. You have to put the problems aside for a moment so you can clear your mind and take a fresh look.</p>



<p>The good news is that there is a clear path to what you want.</p>



<p>In fact, you already have the components in place.</p>



<p>The first step is to realise that your professional career so far has given you a valuable competitive advantage.</p>



<p>You now know certain things and can do certain things that very few people on the planet know or can do. </p>



<p>The second step is to realise there is demand for these special skills and knowledge you possess.</p>



<p>There are business owners, managers, decision makers, leaders who are, right now, in need of what you know and what you can do for them. More importantly, many of them have both the willingness and the ability to compensate you generously if you can help them solve specific challenges they are currently facing, or specific goals they are currently committed to achieving.</p>



<p>The third step is to realise that you already have direct access to most of these people. It’s called LinkedIn (or, more broadly, social media).</p>



<p>As you can see, I was not being wishy-washy when I said the components are already in place. All 3 of the above are indeed already in place.</p>



<p>The path to what you want is through aligning yourself – your internal beliefs, your presentation and the messaging you put out – so you position yourself to be the natural choice for those seeking your expertise.</p>



<p>And yes, you do have to learn to sell. But this doesn’t have to be so intimidating and you certainly don’t have to feel like a low-life doing this. So take another deep breath, and allow yourself to get friendly with sales for a moment. Soon you will be best friends – better than you know. </p>



<p>I’ll give you a blueprint to follow, right here in this post. And in the future I’ll go into many more details, but this here should be more than enough to get you started. You shouldn’t need ANYTHING else, don’t get yourself overwhelmed. It’s actually very simple and even easy. </p>



<p>First I’ll tell you what NOT to do. </p>



<p>Then I’ll give you a few basic steps to follow.</p>



<hr>



<p>First and foremost – DO NOT go hire anyone to do this for you. Trust me on this one. No one can market or sell your product for you before you’ve mastered this process yourself first. You MUST learn to sell your own products and services, there is no way around it. What’s more – no one can do it better than you. You KNOW what you’re good at. You KNOW what you’ve been able to do for other clients before. You KNOW what problems you’ve been able to solve. You’ve SEEN people and businesses struggle and make wrong decisions and regret them and you KNOW how to do this right. You know how to do it better. No one else can communicate this better than you. No one can be more convincing. No one can connect with your future clients better than you. </p>



<p>Second, avoid paid advertising before you’ve learned how to generate high-ticket sales without it. Paid ads are an amplifier. If you’re making zero sales right now, the result of putting lots and lots of money in paid ads will be lots and lots of money multiplied by zero. Don’t waste your time and money doing this. I’ve been there. It ain’t pretty. </p>



<p>Repeat after me: Paid ads and sales people are for scaling only. Once you’ve got your offer and your messaging down to a proven working system, you can then pay for ads and hire sales people to go 10x or 100x bigger. But you are not ready for this. Delay this phase as long as possible. When the time comes, you will know it. </p>



<p>Finally, for the love kittens, please don’t go spamming people left and right with your offer. Don’t send e-mails. Don’t talk to strangers on messenger. Don’t call them on the phone. Don’t ask for appointments. Just don’t, ok? Don’t do it. No one likes that. It won’t get you anywhere. </p>



<p>There IS a better way.</p>



<hr>



<p>So here is what to do.</p>



<p>You can get started today, easily. And you can see results quickly, without spending a fortune on anyone or anything.</p>



<p>Your biggest problem right now is obscurity. No one knows you exist. Simple as that.</p>



<p>To start getting more sales, you have to get out there where relevant people can see you so that A) they know you exist and B) you get an opportunity to speak directly to their current pains and frustrations.</p>



<p>As tacky as it sounds, social media turns out to be useful for this.</p>



<p>I’ve found that LinkedIn can be pretty great for B2B sales – but I’ve also seen people get good results with high-ticket sales on Facebook as well. (Once again, though – DO NOT just go spamming people on LinkedIn! Keep calm and read on.)</p>



<p>There is a structure and sequence to the approach. You have to do things in the right order  and you have to get through some things first, but it’s easy, there’s no big expenses involved, and you can start getting results in weeks or even days if you do this right.</p>



<p>The first steps go like this:</p>



<ol><li>Get as much clarity as you can on who your ideal clients are and what your main offer is. I think you already have a good idea about this, but always worth thinking harder about it and putting it in writing for yourself and your team. Make sure to think about your ideal client as A PERSON, even if we’re talking billion-dollar corporations here. At the end of the day someone has to make a decision and write a check.</li><li>Prime your LinkedIn profile. Make it look professional. Use the tag-line to speak directly to your ideal buyer (this requires some creativity and it’s a bit of a process – don’t be afraid to keep changing it, but once you find something that works, stick with it.) Use the longer “About” section to do more of the same. You have to basically turn that into a mini sales letter. Don’t go into many technical details – always write as if it’s coming out of your ideal client’s head. Think of their situation, their current struggles and challenges, the urgency of the problem, and how you can relieve that. Talk about what they will gain from working with you and the amount of time, effort and money they will save.</li><li>Start adding very targeted connections – on a daily basis. If you wish, you can pay for LinkedIn’s Sales Navigator, but I’ve found that the basic search works good enough for me. Every day run a search for people who may be in a position to make decisions about your offer (or go through your LinkedIn network recommendations) and just send out connection requests to 5 – 10 people each day day (but don’t go crazy and start adding everyone indiscriminately.) You can add a little personalisation note, but I’m not sure it makes much of a difference with most people. Your profile (and especially the tag-line) should be able to speak for itself. There are people who use LinkedIn for networking and they will usually accept your connection request. Then there are people who don’t like connecting with strangers and they will ignore you. Don’t make a big deal out of it, don’t take it personally, just stick to the process and turn it into a habit.</li><li>While you are growing your network, start making more regular posts. You should aim for once a day, on average. You can do more (but not much more) or less (but not much less). In your posts, you can do a number of different things, but the whole point is to imagine you are speaking directly to your ideal clients. Don’t be too sales-y all the time, just speak from your expertise and experience. Talk about their problems and your solution to them. Talk about what you’ve done for other similar clients and the specific benefits they’ve experienced. Talk especially about saving time – that’s a big one. </li><li>Don’t be discouraged if you get little to no interactions with your posts at first! This DOESN’T mean people aren’t reading your content. Many people (especially busy people) will not react to your content, but if it’s relevant they WILL read it. When people do start interacting with your posts, feel free to start conversations with them. Keep the conversation exploratory and see how you can be of service. If you can get them on the phone, even better. Just keep this in mind: your first job is NOT to try to sell them anything. It’s to understand whether or not you’re a good fit for working together and to genuinely give them the advice that’s best for them. If this happens to mean working with you, great – don’t be shy about it either. </li><li>Once every few weeks, make a post with a very direct offer, …</li></ol></div></article></div>

              <h4>Visual rank of your website is as important as your SEO rank.</h4>
              <p>Users make lasting judgments about a website’s appeal within a split second.  This first impression is influential enough to later affect their opinions of a site’s usability and trustworthiness.</p>

              <h4>What is Visual Mind ?</h4>
              <p>Visual Mind is an AI engine specifically designed for understanding and scoring visual appearance of a website. Visual Mind has analyzed over a million websites to achieve an accuracy rate of over 97%.</p>

              <h4>What is Visual Mind Score and why it matters ?</h4>
              <p>For too long, aesthetics of a website has been dismissed as a superficial concern. That is a mistake. As latest research demonstrates ( See recommended ref) , the visual appeal of a website is tied up with far weightier issues, such as functionality and trustworthiness.</p>
              <p>Have you “fast-tested” your website? Remember, you have only fifty milliseconds to impress your visitors. Flash your website to people for a very short period of time and then ask for their opinion. That is the opinion that matters.</p>
              <p>Visual Mind score – provides you with a qualitative score about that first impression. It can help you evaluate your website aesthetics and make improvements.</p>

As I plan to host this on Heroku, I know that IP will only be IPv4, so I can safely convert the IP address from 127.0.0.1 to its bytes equivalent by merging all 4 x Int8 parts of IP this way it will take less space in Redis memory 4 bytes instead of 15 bytes.</p><p>This is a function which extracts IP address from request.

<p>I’ve long maintained that <strong>persistence</strong> is one of the main qualities you need in order to succeed with your (software) project. In order to manage to ship a product that truly conquers the world. By continuously and never-ending keeping at it: polishing away flaws and adding good features. On and on and on.</p>



<p>Today marks the day when I landed my 15,000th commit in the <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl">master branch in curl’s git repository</a> – and we don’t do merge commits so this number doesn’t include such. Funnily enough, <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/graphs/contributors">GitHub can’t count</a> and shows a marginally lower number.</p>

<p>This is of course a totally meaningless number and I’m only mentioning it here because it’s even and an opportunity for me to celebrate something. To cross off an imaginary milestone. This is not even a year since we passed <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2019/11/29/curl-25000-commits/" data-type="post" data-id="12859">25,000 total number of commits</a>. Another meaningless number.</p>



<p>15,000 commits equals 57% of all commits done in curl so far and it makes me the only committer in the curl project with over 10% of the commits.</p>

<p>The curl git history starts on December 29 1999, so the first 19 months of commits from the early curl history are lost. 15,000 commits over this period equals a little less than 2 commits per day on average. I reached 10,000 commits  in December 2011, so the latest 5,000 commits were done at a slower pace than the first 10,000.</p>



<p>I estimate that I’ve spent more than 15,000 hours working on curl over this period, so it would mean that I spend more than one hour of “curl time” per commit on average. According to <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/gitstats/authors.html">gitstats</a>, these 15,000 commits were done on 4,271 different days.</p>



<p>We also have other curl repositories that aren’t included in this commit number. For example, I have done over 4,400 commits in curl’s website repository.</p>



<p>With these my first 15,000 commits I’ve added 627,000 lines and removed 425,000, making an average commit adding 42 and removing 28 lines. (Feels pretty big but I figure the really large ones skew the average.)</p>



<p>The largest time gap ever between two of my commits in the curl tree is almost 35 days back in June 2000. If we limit the check to “modern times”, as in 2010 or later, there was a 19 day gap in July 2015. I <em>do</em> take vacations, but I usually keep up with the most important curl development even during those.</p>



<p>On average it is one commit done by me every 12.1 hours. Every 15.9 hours since 2010. </p>



<p>I’ve been working <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2019/02/02/im-on-team-wolfssl/" data-type="post" data-id="11915">full time on curl since early 2019</a>, up until then it was a spare time project only for me. Development with pull-requests and CI and things that verify a lot of the work <em>before</em> merge is a recent thing so one explanation for a slightly higher commit frequency in the past is that we then needed more “oops” commits to rectify mistakes. These days, most of them are done in the PR branches that are squashed when subsequently merged into master. Fewer commits with higher quality.</p>



<h2>curl committers</h2>



<p>We have merged commits authored by over 833 authors into the curl master repository.  Out of these, 537 landed only a single commit (so far).</p>



<figure><a href="https://curl.haxx.se/dashboard1.html#authors"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="675" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_2020-09-15-curl-Project-status-dashboard2-1200x675.png" alt="" srcset="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_2020-09-15-curl-Project-status-dashboard2-1200x675.png 1200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_2020-09-15-curl-Project-status-dashboard2-450x253.png 450w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_2020-09-15-curl-Project-status-dashboard2-200x113.png 200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_2020-09-15-curl-Project-status-dashboard2-768x432.png 768w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_2020-09-15-curl-Project-status-dashboard2-1536x864.png 1536w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_2020-09-15-curl-Project-status-dashboard2-2048x1152.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"></a></figure>



<p>We are 48 authors who ever wrote 10 or more commits within the same year. 20 of us committed that amount of commits during more than one year.</p>



<figure><a href="https://curl.haxx.se/dashboard1.html#coreteam-per-year"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="675" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_2020-09-15-curl-Project-status-dashboard3-1200x675.png" alt="" srcset="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_2020-09-15-curl-Project-status-dashboard3-1200x675.png 1200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_2020-09-15-curl-Project-status-dashboard3-450x253.png 450w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_2020-09-15-curl-Project-status-dashboard3-200x113.png 200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_2020-09-15-curl-Project-status-dashboard3-768x432.png 768w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_2020-09-15-curl-Project-status-dashboard3-1536x864.png 1536w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot_2020-09-15-curl-Project-status-dashboard3-2048x1152.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"></a></figure>



<p>We are 9 authors who wrote more than 1% of the commits each.</p>



<p>We are 5 authors who ever wrote 10 or more commits within the same year in 10 or more years.</p>



<p>Our second-most committer (by commit count) has not merged a commit for over seven years.</p>



<p>To reach curl’s top-100 committers list right now, you only need to land 6 commits.</p>



<h2>can I keep it up?</h2>



<p>I intend to stick around in the curl project going forward as well. If things just are this great and life remains fine, I hope that I will be maintaining roughly this commit speed for years to come. My prediction is therefore that it will take longer than another twenty years to reach 30,000 commits.</p>



<p>I’ve worked on curl and its precursors for almost <em>twenty-four years</em>. In another twenty-four years I will be well into my retirement years. At some point I will probably not be fit to shoulder this job anymore!</p>



<p>I have never planned long ahead before and I won’t start now. I will instead keep focused on keeping curl top quality, an exemplary open source project and a welcoming environment for newcomers and oldies alike. I will continue to make sure the project is able to function totally independently if I’m present or not.</p>



<h2>The 15,000th commit?</h2>



<p>So what exactly did I change in the project when I merged my 15,000th ever change into the branch?</p>



<p>It was a pretty boring and <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/559ed3ca2545c56a9acc4e805970434f657bd691">non-spectacular one</a>. I removed a document (<code>RESOURCES</code>) from the docs/ folder as that has been a bit forgotten and now is just completely outdated. There’s a much better page for this provided on the web site: <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/rfc/">https://curl.haxx.se/rfc/</a></p>



<h2>Celebrations!</h2>



<p>I of coursed asked my twitter friends a few days ago on how this occasion is best celebrated:</p>

<section name="3648"><div><div><h3 name="8f02" id="8f02">Small Computing and the Security&nbsp;Mindset</h3><p name="3181" id="3181">The story of modern computing is the story of the big-computing mindset (scale, centralization, elitism, and paternalism) infecting everything it touches as programming becomes more of a profession than a craft. In the process, it creates edifices of practices — useful in big-computing situations — that get unthinkingly applied outside of their appropriate bounds, forcing small-computing projects into the strictures of big-computing design. One major domain where we must begin to think critically about the big- vs small-computing distinction is security.</p><p name="46d1" id="46d1">Small-computing systems ought to be secure. After all, they are our most personal environments! They are our diaries and our artworks and our dream journals! But computer security, as it has become professionalized, has become more and more focused on big-computing environments, and good security practices in those environments are inimical to the basic tenets of small computing.</p><p name="369b" id="369b">In a big-computing environment, valuable secrets (like credit card numbers) and desirable powers (like the ability to tweet on behalf of the president) are kept on a set of machines owned by a single entity (the corporation) on behalf of the ostensible owners of that information and power (particular end-users) and protected from illegitimate access (hacking/cracking) by an elite set of professionals (software engineers, ops teams, security consultants) who use their monopoly on legitimate access to certain power (superuser &amp; administrator privileges, commit access) to construct laws (security policies) that prohibit as many not-explicitly-allowed operations as possible. Because the adversaries are many, with infinite time and energy, and because the treasure is valuable, and because laws always have unseen loopholes, these elite professionals construct layers upon layers of rules to limit not only what users (legitimate or illegitimate) can do, but what kind of feedback they can receive.</p><p name="c145" id="c145">This mentality has even made its way into language design: Java (and C++) have a rudimentary form of access control where members can be marked private, and good style in these languages is to mark all member data as private and write accessor functions, ostensibly in order to perform validity checks on proposed modification. This boilerplate is added rather than doing the sensible thing and creating custom metatables such that assignments are implicitly passed through an integrity check (as may be done in Python and Lua). Of course, such checks are rarely implemented, and they cannot distinguish between ‘authorized’ and ‘unauthorized’ calling-classes anyhow — while C++ has ‘friend classes’ that can modify private data directly, and both support using inheritance hierarchies to control data access, there is no granularity smaller than kin/friend versus outsider, so these access controls are borderline useless for everything besides the ad-hoc plugging failures of the type system and increasing the line count of codebases.</p><p name="c4c2" id="c4c2">Systems that require big-computing style security exist. Problems that are best suited to those systems also exist — your bank ought to not only have big-computing style security, but ought to have substantially better security than it has. But, this model is not really sensible in many of the places it is used. For instance, Google Docs (which simulates a word processor with some limited support for simultaneous editing by multiple users) is locked into this model only because it is client-server, and a hypothetical local-first or peer-to-peer version should not be so professionalized and stratified; Microsoft Word, being a local application, has no legitimate excuse (though the real reason, as with most big-computing systems, is that unnecessary centralization is a very effective way to squeeze money out of users who don’t know any better).</p><p name="d95a" id="d95a">When I use Google Docs, I can modify the javascript running on my browser, modify the cookies being sent to the server, and modify URL parameters. If I do something wrong, I will get an entirely unhelpful error message from inside the black box of the remote server. This is because, by failing to fall precisely in line with the Alphabet Corporation’s desired behavior, I have become an adversary, and adversaries cannot be given information that might help them do whatever they might want to do (since some of the things they might want to do is get, for instance, the credit card numbers of everyone who has ever bought an advertisement). Of course, Google engineers writing and maintaining Google Docs face the same situation. Outside of an adversarial situation, investigating a poorly-understood piece of code by poking it and interpreting error messages is called debugging, and part of the small computing ethos is that users should not be prevented from debugging.</p><p name="05d7" id="05d7">The difference between big computing and small computing is, in essence, that in small computing, the user is never an adversary. This is because the running code is owned and controlled by the user. This goes beyond open source / free software (where the developer is no adversary, but the developer is an elite professional often working on behalf of a corporation inside a firewall, performing work that may well be detrimental to those who actually need to interact with its effects).</p><p name="bd41" id="bd41">What kinds of structures befit a small-computing system in an environment where networking exists, and what security models are appropriate for these structures?</p><p name="8df4" id="8df4">For one thing, a multi-user client-server model makes no sense. In a client-server model, whoever controls the single server functionally controls all clients. There is, therefore, incentive to hoard power by locking vital functionalities away on the shared server, making every client dependent — slowed by latency when online, shit out of luck when offline, and always under threat of sudden unilateral changes in policy or protocol.</p><p name="d853" id="d853">Instead, we should look to peer to peer systems: direct for real-time communication, and offline-first store-and-forward schemes for everything else. Asymmetric encryption for key exchange and for signing still make sense here, as does hash-based content addressing for storage. Secure Scuttlebutt and IPFS are good models for what small-computing-oriented network technologies of the future might look like: fully distributed, yet resistant to the kinds of threats that regularly take down federated systems like ActivityPub and IRC, because all nodes are equal and all nodes replicate for each other (under cryptographically-enforced anti-spoofing measures).</p><p name="32c0" id="32c0">What does a threat model for small-computing infrastructure look like?</p><p name="2535" id="2535">Well, unlike in big-computing systems, a small-computing system does not (typically) have large numbers of highly motivated dedicated attackers. Fuzzy Bear isn’t APTing your grandma’s laptop, because your grandma’s laptop has nothing on it but christmas MIDIs and questionable nudes. Our threat is really from folks doing large-scale automated sweeps for low-hanging fruit. So, small-computing threat modeling looks like everyday opsec: use encryption, don’t give strangers direct access to private spaces and limit the spaces they do have access to, distinguish between sensitive and non-sensitive data, and protect the integrity of the system from outsiders. Protect the network-facing portion of your machine, while maximizing your own access to it.</p><p name="aa5a" id="aa5a">In this context, technologies we absolutely do not need are: passwords, SSO, certificate authority hierarchies, name servers and host files, NAT firewalls, code signing, chroot jails, memory layout randomizers, executable symbol stripping, single-application containers, daemons running as ‘nobody’, web APIs for wrapping the web APIs around your web APIs, friend classes, and sudo.</p><p name="9477" id="9477">Technologies we might want to look into: distributed hash tables, chord routing, merkel trees, functional languages, JIT, fast copy-on-write, network-aware cache eviction policies, split-brain countermeasures, transitive blocking, store and forward, message passing, microversioning, journaling, and image-based environments.</p></div></div></section>

<p>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 30 Jan 2019</p>
<h2 id="vector-spaces"><a href="#vector-spaces">Vector Spaces</a></h2>
<p>
A fascinating result that appears in linear algebra is the fact that the
set of real numbers \( \mathbb{R} \) is a vector space over the set of
rational numbers \( \mathbb{Q}. \) This may appear surprising at first
but it is easy to show that it is indeed so by checking that all eight
axioms of vector spaces hold good:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Commutativity of vector addition:<br>
      \( x + y = y + x \) for all \( x, y \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Associativity of vector addition:<br>
      \( x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z \) for all \( x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}.
      \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Existence of additive identity vector:<br>
      We have \( 0 \in \mathbb{R} \) such that \( x + 0 = x \) for all
      \( x \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Existence of additive inverse vectors:<br>
      There exists \( -x \in \mathbb{R} \) for all \( x \in \mathbb{R}.
      \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Associativity of scalar multiplication:<br>
      \( a(bx) = (ab)x \) for all \( a, b \in \mathbb{Q} \) and for all
      \( x \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Distributivity of scalar multiplication over vector addition:<br>
      \( a(x + y) = ax + by \) for all \( a \in \mathbb{Q} \) and for
      all \( x, y \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Distributivity of scalar multiplication over scalar addition:<br>
      \( (a + b)x = ax + bx \) for all \( a, b \in \mathbb{Q} \) and for
      all \( x \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Existence of scalar multiplicative identity:<br>
      We have \( 1 \in \mathbb{Q} \) such that \( 1 \cdot x = x \) for
      all \( x \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  This shows that the set of real numbers \( \mathbb{R} \) forms a
  vector space over the field of rational numbers \( \mathbb{Q}. \)
  Another quick way to arrive at this fact is to observe that \(
  \mathbb{Q} \subseteq \mathbb{R}, \) that is, \( \mathbb{Q} \) is a
  subfield of \( \mathbb{R}. \) Any field is a vector space over any of
  its subfields, so \( \mathbb{R} \) must be a vector space over \(
  \mathbb{Q}. \)
</p>


<h2 id="problem"><a href="#problem">Problem</a></h2>

<p>
Here is an interesting problem related to vector spaces that I came
across recently:
</p>

<div>
<p>
Define two periodic functions \( f \) and \( g \) from \( \mathbb{R} \)
to \( \mathbb{R} \) such that their sum \( f + g \) is the identity
function. The axiom of choice is allowed.
</p>
<p>
A function \( f \) is periodic if there exists \( p \gt 0 \) such that
\( f(x + p) = f(x) \) for all \( x \) in the domain.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<em>
If you want to think about this problem, this is a good time to pause
and think about it. There are spoilers ahead.
</em>
</p>


<h2 id="solution"><a href="#solution">Solution</a></h2>

<p>
The axiom of choice is equivalent to the statement that every vector
space has a basis. Since the set of real numbers \( \mathbb{R} \) is a
vector space over the set of rational numbers \( \mathbb{Q}, \) there
must be a basis \( \mathcal{H} \subseteq \mathbb{R} \) such that every
real number \( x \) can be written uniquely as a finite linear
combination of elements of \( \mathcal{H} \) with rational coefficients,
that is,
\[
  x = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{H}} x_a a
\]
where each \( x_a \in \mathbb{Q} \) and \( \{ a \in \mathcal{H} \mid x_a
\ne 0 \} \) is finite. The set \( \mathcal{H} \) is also known as the
Hamel basis.
</p>

<p>
We know that \( b_a = 0 \) for distinct \( a, b \in \mathcal{H} \)
because \( a \) and \( b \) are basis vectors.
</p>

<p>
In the above expansion of \( x, \) each \( x_a \) is a rational number
that appears as the coefficient of the basis vector \( a. \) Therefore
\( (x + y)_{a} = x_a + y_a \) for all \( x, y \in \mathbb{R}. \) Thus \(
(x + b)_{a} = x_a + b_a = x_a + 0 = x_a. \) This shows that a function
\( f(x) = x_a \) is a periodic function with period \( b \) for any \( b
\in \mathcal{H} \setminus \{a\}. \)
</p>

<p>
Let us define two functions:
\begin{align*}
  f(x) &amp; = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{H} \setminus \{ b \}} x_a a,
  &amp;
  g(x) &amp; = x_b b.
\end{align*}
where \( b \in \mathcal{H} \) and \( x \in \mathbb{R}. \) Let us
choose \( c \in \mathcal{H} \) such that \( c \ne b. \) Then \( f(x) \)
is a periodic function with period \( b \) and \( g(x) \) is a periodic
function with period \( c. \) Further,
\[
  f(x) + g(x)
  = \left( \sum_{a \in \mathcal{H} \setminus \{ b \}} x_a a \right) + x_b b
  = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{H}} x_a a
  = x.
\]
Thus \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) are two periodic functions such that
their sum is the identity function.

        <p>In this tutorial we'll be building a simple Go package that you can run from an iOS application (Swift) and also an
Android application (Kotlin).</p>
<p>This tutorial does <strong>NOT</strong> use the <a href="https://github.com/golang/mobile">Go Mobile</a>
framework; instead it uses Cgo to build the raw static (iOS) and shared (Android) C library that can be imported into your
mobile project (which is what the Go Mobile framework does under-the-hood).</p>
<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>For this tutorial we'll create a simple monorepo with the following structure:</p>
<pre><code>.
├── android/
├── go/
│   ├── cmd/
│   │   └── libfoo/
│   │       └── main.go
│   ├── foo/
│   │   └── foo.go
│   ├── go.mod
│   └── go.sum
└── ios/
</code></pre><div><pre><code data-lang="zsh">$ mkdir -p android ios go/cmd/libfoo go/foo
</code></pre></div><p>We'll start with the Go code and come back to creating the iOS and Android projects later.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="zsh">$ <span>cd</span> go
$ go mod init rogchap.com/libfoo
</code></pre></div><h2 id="foo-package">Foo package</h2>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>// go/foo/foo.go
</span><span></span><span>package</span> foo

<span>// Reverse reverses the given string by each utf8 character
</span><span></span><span>func</span> <span>Reverse</span>(in <span>string</span>) <span>string</span> {
    n <span>:=</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>rune</span> <span>:=</span> <span>make</span>([]<span>rune</span>, <span>len</span>(in))
    <span>for</span> _, r <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> in { 
        <span>rune</span>[n] = r
        n<span>++</span>
    } 
    <span>rune</span> = <span>rune</span>[<span>0</span>:n]
    <span>for</span> i <span>:=</span> <span>0</span>; i &lt; n<span>/</span><span>2</span>; i<span>++</span> { 
        <span>rune</span>[i], <span>rune</span>[n<span>-</span><span>1</span><span>-</span>i] = <span>rune</span>[n<span>-</span><span>1</span><span>-</span>i], <span>rune</span>[i] 
    } 
    <span>return</span> <span>string</span>(<span>rune</span>)
}
</code></pre></div><p>Our <code>foo</code> package has a single function <code>Reverse</code> that has a single string argument <code>in</code> and a single string output.</p>
<h2 id="export-for-c">Export for C</h2>
<p>In order for our C library to call our <code>foo</code> package we need to export all the functions that we want to expose to C
with the special <code>export</code> comment.
This wrapper needs to be in the <code>main</code> package:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>// go/cmd/libfoo/main.go
</span><span></span>pacakge main

<span>import</span> <span>"C"</span>

<span>// other imports should be seperate from the special Cgo import
</span><span></span><span>import</span> (
    <span>"rogchap.com/libfoo/foo"</span>
)

<span>//export reverse
</span><span></span><span>func</span> <span>reverse</span>(in <span>*</span>C.char) <span>*</span>C.char {
    <span>return</span> C.<span>CString</span>(foo.<span>Reverse</span>(C.<span>GoString</span>(in)))
}

<span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {}
</code></pre></div><p>We're using the special <code>C.GoString()</code> and <code>C.CString()</code> functions to convert between Go string and a C string.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> The function that we are exporting does not need to be an exported Go function (ie. starts with a Captial
letter). Also note the empty <code>main</code> function; this is required for the Go code to compile otherwise you'll get a
<code>function main is undeclared in the main package</code> error.</p>
<p>Let's test our build by creating a static C library using the Go <code>-buildmode</code> flag:</p>
<pre><code>go build -buildmode=c-archive -o foo.a ./cmd/libfoo
</code></pre><p>This should have outputed the C library: <code>foo.a</code> and the header file: <code>foo.h</code>. You should see our exported
function at the bottom of our header file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C"><span>extern</span> <span>char</span><span>*</span> <span>reverse</span>(<span>char</span><span>*</span> in);
</code></pre></div><h2 id="building-for-ios">Building for iOS</h2>
<p>Our goal is to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_binary">fat binary</a> that can be used on iOS devices and the
iOS simulator.</p>
<p>The Go standard library includes a script for building for iOS:
<a href="https://golang.org/misc/ios/clangwrap.sh"><code>$GOROOT/misc/ios/clangwrap.sh</code></a>, however this script only builds for
<code>arm64</code>, and we need <code>x86_64</code> too for the iOS Simulator. So, we're going to create our own <code>clangwrap.sh</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span>#!/bin/sh
</span><span></span>
<span># go/clangwrap.sh</span>

<span>SDK_PATH</span><span>=</span><span>`</span>xcrun --sdk <span>$SDK</span> --show-sdk-path<span>`</span>

</code></pre></div><p>Don't forget to make it executable:</p>
<pre><code>chmod +x clangwrap.sh
</code></pre><p>Now we can build our library for each architecture and combine into a fat binary using the <code>lipo</code> tool (via a Makefile):</p>

<p>Using XCode we can create a simple single page application. I'm going to use Swift UI, but it is just as easy to do with
UIKit:</p>

        .padding(.all, <span>15</span>)
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>In XCode we can drag-and-drop our newly generated <code>foo.a</code> and <code>foo.h</code> into our project. For our Swift code to
interop with our library we need to create a bridging header:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>// ios/foobar/foobar-Bridging-Header.h
</span><span></span>
<span>#</span><span>import "foo.h"</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>In Xcode <code>Build Settings</code>, under <code>Swift Compiler - General</code> set the <code>Objective-C Bridging Header</code> to the file we just
created: <code>foobar/foobar-Bridging-Header.h</code>.</p>
<p>We also need to set the <code>Library Search Paths</code> to include the directory of our generated header file <code>foo.h</code>.
(Xcode may have done this for you when you drag-and-drop the files into the project).</p>
<p>We can now call our function from Swift, then build and run:</p>

<p>Using Android Studio, we will create a new Android project. From the Project Templates select <code>Native C++</code>, which will
create a project with an Empty Activity that is configured to use the Java Native Interface (JNI). We will still select
<code>Kotlin</code> as our language of choice for the project.</p>
<p>After creating a simple Activity with a <code>EditText</code> and a <code>Button</code> we create the basic functionality for our app:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="kotlin"><span>// android/app/src/main/java/com/rogchap/foobar/MainActivity.kt
</span><span></span>
<span>class</span> <span>MainActivity</span> : AppCompatActivity() {

        <span>super</span>.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)

        btn.setOnClickListener {
            txt.setText(reverse(txt.text.toString()))
        }
    }

    <span>/**

    <span>companion</span> <span>object</span> {
        <span>// Used to load the 'native-lib' library on application startup.
</span><span></span>        init {
            System.loadLibrary(<span>"native-lib"</span>)
        }
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>We created (and called) an external function <code>reverse</code> that we need to implement in the JNI (C++):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>// android/app/src/main/cpp/native-lib.cpp
</span><span></span>
<span>extern</span> <span></span><span>"</span><span>C</span><span>"</span> {

</span><span></span>        <span>return</span> str;
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>The JNI code has to follow the conventions to interop correctly between the Native C++ and Kotlin (JVM).</p>
<h2 id="build-for-android">Build for Android</h2>
<p>The way the JNI works with external libraries has changed over the many releases of Android and the NDK. The current
(and easiest) is to place our outputted library into a special <code>jniLibs</code> folder that is copied into our final APK file.</p>
<p>Rather than creating a Fat binary (as we did for iOS) we are going to place each architecture in the correct folder.
Again, for the JNI, conventions matter.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <div><p>The version of the Pinephone that I am reviewing is the postmarketOS</p><p>Community Edition (CE).</p><p>My first impression of the Pinephone after I unboxed the device was</p><p>very good. I enjoyed the feeling of the weight of the Pinephone in my</p><p>hand, and the overall build quality of the system still impresses</p><p>me. It is my opinion that the PINE64 hardware development and</p><p>manufacturing process is very solid. For what I paid, which was about</p><p>AUD$200 all up, I believe I have received hardware that is superior</p><p>than a phone that I could have bought from a retail store in my city</p><p>for the same price.</p><p>The screen is glossy, and the capacitive touch screen (this is a</p><p>question fellow smolnet citizen Shufei wanted answered in some detail)</p><p>responds well.</p><p>I was, however, disappointed with the stock postmarketOS software that</p><p>came flashed on the eMMC. The Software Centre was a particular</p><p>disappointment. It, by default, only showed the currently installed</p><p>software, and it was not possible to browse any other software which</p><p>was not already installed.</p><p>Also, the camera application that came installed by default, 'Cheese',</p><p>did not allow the camera to function.</p><p>I attempted to install Plasma Mobile using the command line, following</p><p>these instructions:</p><p>But it ended up completely wrecking the function of the</p><p>phone. Installing the package that the wiki article recommended did</p><p>not update LightDM, and I ended up soft-bricking the phone while</p><p>fiddling with the LightDM configuration in order to stop the phone</p><p>from (still) booting into phosh, and not Plasma Mobile.</p><p>It also disabled cell data functionality, and ended up messing with a</p><p>lot of the guts of the Linux installation. So I do not recommend</p><p>attempting to switch to Plasma Mobile on the Pinephone from inside an</p><p>already-existing postmarketOS installation. I recommend getting a</p><p>Plasma Mobile system image, and flashing that from the start if you</p><p>wish to experiment with different user interfaces.</p><div><p><span> ##</span></p><h2>Linux Software Distributions</h2></div><p>There is a great many Linux distributions available for the</p><p>Pinephone. The following link to the PINE64 wiki contains a</p><p>more-or-less exhaustive list of each of them:</p><p>The Linux distributions that I tested out are:</p><div><p><span>###</span></p><h3>postmarketOS (phosh UI)</h3></div><p>I enjoyed this system image because it came with a wizard for</p><p>NetworkManager which enabled me to make sure cell data worked most</p><p>consistently. However, the power consumption of this image was</p><p>prohibitively high, and it caused the phone to run very hot. When the</p><p>battery was at 10% charge, rebooting the phone would cause the last of</p><p>this precious charge to be used up, and the phone would run completely</p><p>out of power.</p><p>This image was basically a desktop UI, and did not have many, if any</p><p>mobile UI configurations present. It was rather fun to see the</p><p>Pinephone boot into a full GNOME desktop environment. I imagine if you</p><p>had a bigger screen connected to the Pinephone, you would be quite</p><p>impressed with what this phone could pull off.</p><div><p><span>###</span></p><h3>postmarketOS (Plasma Mobile)</h3></div><p>Slow and buggy, really.</p><p>This distribution has a major problem at the moment: the unlock/power</p><p>button is not properly debounced, and it makes it virtually impossible</p><p>sometimes to unlock the phone. Otherwise, this distribution is very,</p><p>very impressive, and I would actually like to switch to it, because</p><p>cell data works best for Optus on Ubuntu Touch.</p><p>This distribution could indeed be a daily driver for someone if they</p><p>could sort out the button debouncing problem.</p><p>This is a Linux-based operating system that uses a closed-source</p><p>UI. It was so glossy and locked-down in terms of configurability that</p><p>I was turned off using it. It has a great tutorial for teaching you</p><p>the gestures you need to learn in order to use the touch screen.</p><p>I did like the fact that it organised all your contacts and messages</p><p>into interesting metaphors, and it ran reasonably quickly, but there</p><p>is no way of configuring the UI beyond what how it arrives to you.</p><p>This image was fairly slow to run on the Pinephone, but in my opinion</p><p>it is the absolute best demonstration of KDE Plasma Mobile. It was</p><p>very visually impressive, and the menus were full-featured and</p><p>informative. It did not, however, support phone calls or SMS.</p><p>This is my current choice of Linux distribution for the phone. It has</p><p>a software centre full of different and interesting programs,</p><p>including Transmission (torrent client) and GIMP (!!! I have yet to</p><p>install this to see how or if it works well, but the fact that it is</p><p>possible to at least _run_ GIMP in some capacity on the Pinephone</p><p>would like like running Adobe Photoshop on a Samsung Galaxy).</p><p>This is merely anecdotal, and I have not performed any scientific</p><p>tests to work out if this is true, but the latest September 2020</p><p>stable release of this image seems to have the best power settings of</p><p>any of the other distributions for this phone.</p><p>I hesitate to give an estimate of exactly how long this phone will</p><p>last on a single charge, given normal use. But, I finished charging</p><p>this phone at 0700HRS this morning, and, with no other charge, it is now</p><p>on 50% charge, and the current time is 1230HRS. I think I have put the</p><p>phone through a little heavier use than I do normally, this morning,</p><p>however.</p><p>Virtually all of the functions of the phone are enabled without any</p><p>configuration in Mobian.</p><p>I highly recommend flashing the following system image to an SD card</p><p>so you can try out all the major Linux distributions for your phone:</p><p>It contains 13 different distributions, and it is trivial to switch</p><p>between each of them through the main boot menu.</p><p>I have rung a few people on the phone, and, assuming you have a</p><p>distribution flashed on the phone that supports phonecalls (like the</p><p>one I am currently using, Mobian), there should be absolutely no issue</p><p>using this fundamental feature of the Pinephone.</p><p>For the most part, the cell data modem in the Pinephone works well for</p><p>me. There is a fairly large problem with my use of the Pinephone with</p><p>its cell data, however.</p><p>I live in Australia, and the mobile phone carrier that I use is</p><p>Optus. The setup(s) that work for me with my Pinephone, running</p><p>Mobian, is:</p><p>&gt; Name: 1</p><p>&gt; APN: yesinternet</p><p>&gt; Name: Optus Yes Internet</p><p>&gt; APN: yesinternet</p><p>After about 3 or 4 hours after I boot up the phone, the cell data</p><p>stops working, and the Network Mode in the 'Mobile' submenu of</p><p>Settings changes from</p><p>&gt; 2G, 3G, 4G (Preferred)</p><p>to just</p><p>&gt; 2G, 3G, 4G</p><p>This issue is fixed for another 3 or 4 hours by rebooting the phone,</p><p>which does not actually take that long (about 10 to 15 seconds), but</p><p>it is a hassle to be cut off from mobile data if you forget about your</p><p>phone.</p><p>These two links help shed light on exactly what is happening with the</p><p>Pinephone when it tries to remain connected to the Optus network:</p><p>(A forum post. Someone using a similar, if not identical mobile data</p><p>modem as the Pinephone in Australia, with the Optus network)</p><p>(A Github post which familiarises the reader with the concepts and</p><p>command line tools involved in using Linux with 4G LTE modems on</p><p>Debian and Ubuntu)</p><p>The issue with the Pinephone is explained the forum thread (the first</p><p>link). The issue is that there are at least two modes for the Quectel</p><p>EG25 modem that the Pinephone uses, only one of which seems to be</p><p>supported by Optus. The two modes are QMI and MBIM. Optus, I assume,</p><p>only supoprts MBIM:</p><p>https://forum.gl-inet.com/t/using-rooter-on-the-gl-x750/8983/8 Forum post</p><p>The relevant sentence from the above forum post is:</p><p>&gt; Also, MBIM is buggy for Quectel modems even in OpenWRT 19.07</p><p>&gt; (snapshot), mostly sometimes modem “freezes” and I need to restart.</p><p>The issue that the original poster was having with this modem is</p><p>explained in the same post:</p><p>&gt; The reason is exactly this: user.notice Create Connection:</p><p>&gt; WDA-GET-DATA-FORMAT is “raw-ip” </p><p>&gt; When you use a modem over QMI and the data-format is “raw-ip” the</p><p>&gt; system needs to know that modem is on “raw-ip”, without that,</p><p>&gt; interface doesn’t get an IP address.</p><p>When I was using the postmarketOS version of phosh, the NetworkManager</p><p>program started a wizard which contained a lot more options about how</p><p>to configure the Pinephone's Quectel LTE modem. One activity I would</p><p>like to carry out is learning how to start this wizard from within</p><p>Mobian. I wish to keep Mobian as the primary operating system for the</p><p>Pinephone just because its Software Centre has such an amazing</p><p>quantity and quality of different programs, and the postmarketOS</p><p>Centre requires you to manually search for the programs you want, in</p><p>order for them to show up at all inside the Centre.</p><p>The GPS seems to function perfectly fine inside the default Mobian</p><p>maps program. It can show you, with reasonable accuracy (although not</p><p>to the same accuracy as, say, a proprietary maps application) exactly</p><p>where you are. I think the accuracy of the GPS on the Pinephone is</p><p>somewhere in the region of 10 square metres.</p><p>The main issue with the GPS, however, is that it does not currently</p><p>link in with the Perth public transport system. I cannot use this</p><p>program to plan public transport journeys. But I believe I should be</p><p>able to take care of this problem by either (a) adding data to</p><p>OpenStreetMap, or (b) using a web browser, where I should be able to</p><p>access the Transperth public transport trip planner webpage.</p><p>This is a feature that works without a hitch in Mobian. I was</p><p>surprised to see myself receiving SMS messages unexpectedly from</p><p>friends as I left the phone in my pocket and forgot about it.</p><p>The camera application in Mobian works. However it has a refresh rate</p><p>of around 1 FPS. The quality is passable. This is not an issue for me</p><p>because, philosophically, phone cameras should not replace the</p><p>function of proper dedicated photographic devices. Will this camera</p><p>take reasonable photos? Yes. What is the comparison of the quality of</p><p>the photos? I would venture a guess that it is about as good as a</p><p>cheap action camera, like a GoPro knock-off.</p><div><p><span> ##</span></p><h2>Flashing Different Operating Systems</h2></div><p>Compared to the arduous process that one has to go through in order to</p><p>change operating systems on an Android phone, the Pinephone is very</p><p>easy to flash. You can flash data onto both an SD card, or the phone's</p><p>internal eMMC.</p><p>For flashing an SD card, the process is as …</p></div></div></div>

<p>Prior to last month, I knew next to nothing about K-pop (Korean popular music) besides having heard a few songs in passing and the rumors of the industry’s infamous elements, most notably a string of high profile suicides over the last few years. As an American with no connection to music or South Korean culture, I wondered if I was getting an accurate picture of the industry or if I was being misled by the most lurid and morbid elements eagerly conveyed by the media.</p>
<p>So I decided to do a deep dive down the internet rabbit hole of K-pop to understand what it is, how it works, and what I think about it. For anything that’s not my personal opinion or that goes beyond basic historical knowledge, I’ll cite my sources, which are a mixture of news articles, academic articles, YouTube videos, and some content aggregators like Wikipedia and Statista. I welcome any corrections or criticisms on inaccurate sources or things I didn’t understand.</p>
<p>I’ll warn you upfront – this essay is over 30,000 words long. It is the largest post I have made on dormin.org besides my novel. Since I sympathize with anyone who doesn’t want to make such a large time investment into a subject of passing curiosity, I will present my key findings here divided between the five <strong>parts</strong> of the essay. If you’re not sure if you want to read everything, you can jump to any individual part and understand it without reading the other sections.</p>

<h3><a href="#Basics"><strong><u>Part 1</u> – <u>The Basics</u></strong></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>“K-pop” is both a genre of music and an entire industry which “manufacturers” performers and their performance output (music, dance routines, shows, merchandise, etc.) in a highly systematized top-down manner</li>
<li>The global popularity of K-pop is extraordinary considering the relatively small population of South Korea, and the relatively small size of K-pop production companies</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="#Product"><strong><u>Part 2</u> – <u>The Product</u></strong></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>K-pop’s industrial/corporate structure represents a Korean (and East-Asian) cultural alternative to Western pop and broader music production</li>
<li>K-pop stars and bands are manufactured and controlled by production companies in the same manner Western athletes are trained and traded by sports teams.</li>
<li>K-pop stars are crafted into idealized portrays of individuals by East Asian cultural standards</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="#Fans"><strong><u>Part 3</u> – <u>The Fans</u></strong></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>K-pop fandom is both more intense on average than Western fandom, and has a larger percentage of unhealthily obsessive fans</li>
<li>K-pop fandom is based on a parasocial relationship between fans and stars</li>
<li>K-pop stars are forced to abide by extremely restrictive behavioral norms to appease production companies and fans</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="#Process"><strong><u>Part 4</u>– <u>The Process</u></strong></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Trying to become a K-pop star is a terrible idea by any rational cost-benefit analysis</li>
<li>The process by which production companies train K-pop stars is abusive and depends on the ignorance of children/teenagers and clueless and/or malicious parents</li>
<li>Even after making it through the extraordinarily difficult audition and training process, the vast majority of K-pop stars will have short careers and earn little or possibly <em>no</em> money</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="#Machine"><strong><u>Part 5</u> – <u>The Machine</u></strong></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>K-pop is an extremely centralized, hierarchical industry, where structural, business, and creative decisions are almost entirely made by corporate management, rather than the performers</li>
<li>Raw creativity in the music production process is largely outsourced to Westerners who write, produce, and choreograph the music</li>
<li>The K-pop industry is subsidized and supported by the South Korean government, if not implicitly or explicitly directed, as a conscious form of soft power projection and social control.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can tell, I came away from my research with a negative view of K-pop. I don’t think it’s the worst thing in the world, but I find its fandom to be unhealthy and its production process to be exploitative. That being said, there are undoubtedly many tremendous talents in the K-pop world and the cultural power of K-pop is remarkable. I’ll give my summarized thoughts on K-pop as a whole at the conclusion of the essay.<br>

<h2><strong><u>Part 1</u> – <u>The Basics</u></strong></h2>
<h3><strong>What is K-pop?</strong></h3>
<p>“K-pop” refers to a genre of music and the industry which creates it. Both are based out of South Korea and particularly Seoul.</p>
<h3><strong>What is K-pop music?</strong></h3>
<p>K-pop is an offshoot of 90s Western pop with heavy influences from synthetics and hip hop. Lyrics are mostly Korean, but with English words and sometimes other languages thrown in. K-pop is usually sung by mono-gendered bands with members aged from their mid-teens to late 20s. Such bands typically resemble the structure and appearance of American boy bands from the 90s and 2000s (ie. NSYNC). As a representative K-pop sample, check out “DNA” by BTS:</p>
<p><span><iframe width="760" height="428" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MBdVXkSdhwU?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span></p>
<p>Properly understood, “K-pop music” is inseparable from “K-pop performance.” The music itself is one component of a larger presentation which includes dance choreography, music videos, fashion, and the personas of bands and individual band members. Though these elements are also present in Western music, they are far more important to K-pop music. K-pop fandom is considered the appreciation of all these aspects as an integrated whole.</p>
<h3><strong>What are the Origins of K-pop?</strong></h3>
<p>The Western influence on Korean music began in the 1940s with the American occupation of much of the Korean peninsula after its liberation from Imperial Japan. With the outbreak of the Korean War in the early 1950s, further American presence was added, with over 300,000 US troops at the peak.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a> After the war, the American military stayed at dozens<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a> of bases throughout South Korea as a permanent fixture of the country. Over the decades, these soldiers imported American culture and media, including American music. Presently, there are still 20,000 US soldiers in South Korea.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>The early Western musical influence in South Korea was based on folk and hippie music in the 60s and 70s, and then evolved into sappy ballads in the 80s. These genres merged with traditional Korean music to form a small, localized music industry. Creative expansion was restrained by the South Korean government’s censorship and restrictions on movement in and out of the country. In the 1970s, the government banned American rock music and Korean offshoots for their connotations with drug use.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a> Until 1983, South Korean citizens were banned from traveling abroad for tourism, and the last restrictions weren’t lifted until 1988 (year of the Seoul Summer Olympics).<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Korean music had a revolution in the early 1990s with the three-member band, Seo Taiji and the Boys. Founded in 1992, the Boys debuted on a South Korean television talent show and received the lowest ratings of the night.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[6]</a> Unexpectedly, their premiere song was a huge hit and launched the band to fame. The Boys soon became the first successful Korean rap group and redefined the Korean music industry. Leader Seo Taiji was a rare experimenter in a country still emerging from isolation and relative cultural stagnancy. Prior to forming the Boys, he had been part of an indie heavy metal band.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>Through their music, style, and appearance, Seo Taiji and the Boys inadvertently became the first K-Pop band. While their music was more hip hop-based, the Boys pioneered the mixture of Western pop and hip hop presented with intense, highly-choreographed dance routines within a refined aesthetic theme.<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8">[8]</a> For a sample, see here:</p>
<p><span><iframe width="760" height="428" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IRFfPZQeJuo?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span></p>
<p>Seo Taiji and the Boys disbanded in 1996. But by the end of its short career, mimicking boy bands had sprung up throughout South Korea. These bands were picked up by a new wave of music production companies which would become the basis of the K-pop industry. They looked to Japan and its well established “J-pop” industry as a template for the sustained production of popular musical talent. Thus, while the Boys were independent, experimental, and subversive, the bands created in their wake were more institutionalized, sanitized, and formed by top-down design.</p>
<h3><strong>How Big is K-pop?</strong></h3>
<p>In 2017, the entire K-pop industry produced $5 billion in revenue.<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9">[9]</a> For the closest American comparison I can find – in 2019, American <em>record labels</em> earned $8.7 billion in revenue.<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10">[10]</a> Unfortunately, I can’t find numbers for total music industry revenue in the US, so this isn’t quite a fair comparison. The two might be difficult to compare due to diverging industry structures;&nbsp; for instance, in South Korea, $1.2 billion of its 2017 revenues came from karaoke sales, only $250 million less than its digital music sales<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11">[11]</a></p>
<p>Nevertheless, considering that South Korea has less than 1/6<sup>th</sup> the US population and 1/14<sup>th</sup> the GDP, that’s pretty damn impressive.</p>
<p>Also of note, in 2019, South Korea was the 6<sup>th</sup> largest music market in the world, ahead of China and behind France.<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12">[12]</a> In 2017, South Korea exported $513 million worth of music and imported only $14 million worth, which is an extremely strong indicator of the country’s preference for K-pop over Western pop.<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13">[13]</a></p>
<p>BTS (AKA Bangtan Boys) is the most popular K-pop band in the world today and ever. According to the 2019 IFPI Global Music Report, BTS was the 7<sup>th</sup> most listened to artist in the world, and had the 3<sup>rd</sup> most popular album globally. Despite Spotify not streaming in South Korea, BTS was its second most popular artist in 2019.<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14">[14]</a></p>
<p>Perhaps more relevantly, a 2017 Hyundai Research Institute report claimed that BTS alone was worth $3.6 billion to the South Korean economy annually when accounting for adjacent economic activity and tourism. Supposedly 1/13th of all tourists to South Korea in 2017 came because of BTS.<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15">[15]</a> A 2019 report from Hollywood Reporter brought the figure up $4.65 billion.<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16">[16]</a></p>
<h3><strong>How Big is K-pop in America?</strong></h3>
<p>I can’t find firm figures, but the general consensus is that K-pop has been blowing up in the US since at least 2017, with articles about the genre’s American explosion popping up in the <em>New York Times</em>,<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17">[17]</a> <em>NPR</em>,<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18">[18]</a> the <em>Guardian</em>,<a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19"><em><strong>[19]</strong></em></a> etc. From 2015 to 2019, demand for K-pop concert tickets increased 1,900% in the US.<a href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20">[20]</a> This growth seems to be largely thanks to BTS, which is about 5X more popular than Blackpink, the second most popular …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				

<p>I like monitoring <em>stuff</em>. That’s what I do at work and when my home ISP started giving me random problems and I decided it would be nice to monitor my home network as well. There are a couple of ways to go around this, a very popular and OSS solution is <a href="https://oss.oetiker.ch/smokeping/">SmokePing</a>. SmokePing is written in Perl and is used to visualise network latencies. It’s quite a great solution but for my current stack which involves Prometheus and Grafana, it meant I had to deploy a standalone tool separate from my monitoring stack - something which I wanted to avoid.</p>

<p><img src="https://oss.oetiker.ch/smokeping/doc/reading_detail.png" alt="SmokePing Graphs"></p>

<p>So, I looked for other solutions and luckily happened to stumble upon <a href="https://twitter.com/oddtazz">oddtazz</a> in one of the common Telegram groups where he shared his solution for the above: Telegraf ICMP <a href="https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/ping">plugin</a> and Grafana. This is exactly what I’ve been looking for but for some reason, I had wrongly assumed Telegraf needs InfluxDB to store the data. Googling a bit more, I found Telegraf <a href="https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/release-1.15/plugins/outputs/prometheus_client/README.md">supports</a> Prometheus format (amongst a huge list of others!) but this wasn’t so clear in their docs.</p>

<p>I decided to run a Telegraf agent in my RPi connected to my home router over LAN and scrape metrics using Prometheus and visualise graphs in Grafana! For the non-patient readers, here’s what my dashboard looks like!:</p>

<p><img src="https://mrkaran.dev/images/ISP-Monitoring-Grafana2.png" alt="image"></p>

<p><img src="https://mrkaran.dev/images/ISP-Monitoring-Grafana1.png" alt="image"></p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>To get started, we need to download <a href="https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf">Telegraf</a> and configure the <a href="https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/ping">Ping</a> plugin. Telegraf has the concept of <strong>Plugins</strong> for Input, Output, Aggregating and Processing. What this basically means is that you can configure multiple input plugins like DNS, ICMP, HTTP and export the data of these plugins in a format of your choice with Output plugins.
This makes Telegraf extermely extensible, you could write a plugin (in Go) of your choice if you fancy that as well!</p>

<p>Here’s what my <code>telegraf.conf</code> looks like:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="toml"><span># Input plugins</span>

<span># Ping plugin</span>
[[<span>inputs</span>.<span>ping</span>]]
<span>urls</span> = [<span>"mrkaran.dev"</span>, <span>"tailscale.mrkaran.dev"</span>, <span>"floyd.mrkaran.dev"</span>, <span>"1.1.1.1"</span>, <span>"kite.zerodha.com"</span>, <span>"google.com"</span>, <span>"reddit.com"</span>, <span>"twitter.com"</span>, <span>"amazon.in"</span>, <span>"zerodha.com"</span>]
<span>count</span> = <span>4</span>
<span>ping_interval</span> = <span>1.0</span>
<span>timeout</span> = <span>2.0</span>

<span># DNS plugin</span>
[[<span>inputs</span>.<span>dns_query</span>]]
  <span>servers</span> = [<span>"100.101.134.59"</span>]
  <span>domains</span> = [<span>"mrkaran.dev"</span>, <span>"tailscale.mrkaran.dev"</span>, <span>"floyd.mrkaran.dev"</span>, <span>"1.1.1.1"</span>, <span>"kite.zerodha.com"</span>, <span>"google.com"</span>, <span>"reddit.com"</span>, <span>"twitter.com"</span>, <span>"amazon.in"</span>, <span>"zerodha.com"</span>]

<span># Output format plugins</span>
[[<span>outputs</span>.<span>prometheus_client</span>]]
  <span>listen</span> = <span>":9283"</span>
  <span>metric_version</span> = <span>2</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Firstly, so nice to see an <em>Ops</em> tool <strong>not</strong> using <code>YAML</code>. Kudos to Telegraf for that. I’d love to see other tools follow suit.</p>

<p>Getting back to the configuration part, <code>input.plugin</code> is a list of plugins that can be configured and I have configured the Ping and DNS plugin in my config. The <code>output</code> is in Prometheus format so it can be scraped and ingested by Prometheus’ time-series DB.</p>

<h3 id="running-telegraf">Running Telegraf</h3>

<p>With the above config in place, let’s try running the agent and see what metrics we get. I am using <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/telegraf/">official</a> Docker image to run the agent with the following config:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">docker run --name telegraf-agent --restart always -d -p <span>9283</span>:9283 -v <span>$PWD</span>/telegraf.conf:/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf:ro telegraf</code></pre></div>
<p>After running the above command, you should be able to see the metrics at <code>localhost:9283/metrics</code></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">$ curl localhost:9283/metrics | head

<p>Perfect! Now, we’re all set to configure Prometheus to scrape the metrics from this target. In order to do that you need to add a new <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/jobs_instances/">Job</a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yml">- job_name: <span>"ispmonitor"</span>
  scrape_interval: 60s
  static_configs:
    - targets: [<span>"100.94.241.54:9283"</span>] <span># RPi telegraf Agent</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the above config, I am plugging my Tailscale IP assigned to my RPi on the port where Telegraf agent is bound to. This is one of the <strong>many</strong> reasons why Tailscale is so bloody awesome! I can connect different components in my network to each other without setting up any particular firewall rules, exposing ports on a case by case basis.</p>

<p><strong>Sidenote</strong>: If you haven’t read Tailscale’s <strong>amazing</strong> <a href="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/">NAT Traversal blog post</a>, do yourself a favour and check it out after you finish reading this one ofcourse!</p>

<p>Anyway, coming back to our Prometheus setup, we can see the metrics being ingested:</p>

<p><img src="https://mrkaran.dev/images/Prometheus-Telegraf-Ingest.png" alt="image"></p>

<h2 id="show-me-the-graphs">Show me the graphs</h2>

<p>Now comes the exciting bit – making <strong>pretty</strong> graphs. First, let’s discuss what’s the most important data I can extract out of <code>Ping</code> and <code>DNS</code> plugins. These plugins export decent amount of data, but a good rule of thumb while making dashboards is to optimise signal v/s noise ratio. We’ll do that by filtering out only the metrics that we care for.</p>

<p>Let’s checkout all the metrics exported by <code>Ping</code> plugin:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">$ curl localhost:9283/metrics | grep ping | grep TYPE
<span># TYPE ping_average_response_ms untyped</span>
<span># TYPE ping_maximum_response_ms untyped</span>
<span># TYPE ping_minimum_response_ms untyped</span>
<span># TYPE ping_packets_received untyped</span>
<span># TYPE ping_packets_transmitted untyped</span>
<span># TYPE ping_percent_packet_loss untyped</span>
<span># TYPE ping_result_code untyped</span>
<span># TYPE ping_standard_deviation_ms untyped</span>
<span># TYPE ping_ttl untyped</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Perfect! So, from the above list of metrics, the most important ones for us are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>ping_average_response_ms</code>: Avg RTT for a packet</li>
<li><code>ping_maximum_response_ms</code>: Max RTT for a packet</li>
<li><code>ping_percent_packet_loss</code>: % of packets lost on the way</li>
</ul>

<p>With just the above 3 metrics, we can answer questions like:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Is my ISP suffering an outage?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>If yes, <code>ping_percent_packet_loss</code> should be unusually higher than normal. This usually happens when the ISP has routing is borked and that causes the packet to be routed in a less optimized way and as a side effect packet loss becomes one of the key metrics to measure here.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Is the upstream down?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>If yes, <code>ping_average_response_ms</code> over a recent window should be higher than a window compared to a previous time range when things were fine and dandy. This can either mean 2 things: Either your ISP isn’t routing correctly to the said upstream or the CDN/Region where your upstream is faced an outage. This is quite a handy metric for me to monitor!</p>

<p>How many times have your friends complained “<code>xyz.com</code> isn’t working for me” and when you try to load, it’s fine from your end? There are a lot of actors at play but <code>ping</code> is usually the most simple and quickest way to detect whether an issue persists or not. Of course, this doesn’t work for hosts which block ICMP packets altogether. They are not rare either, like <code>netflix.com</code> and <code>github.com</code> both block ICMP probes for example. For my use case, this wasn’t a major issue as I was able to still probe a decent amount of upstreams all over the world.</p>

<p>With that out of the way, let’s break the dashboard into different components and see what goes behind them.</p>

<h3 id="ping-response-panel">Ping Response Panel</h3>

<p><img src="https://mrkaran.dev/images/ping-row-panel3.png" alt=""></p>

<p>To plot this, simply choose a <code>Stat</code> visualisation with the query <code>ping_average_response_ms{url="$url"}</code>. Repeat this panel for the variable <code>$url</code> and you should be able to generate a nice row view like this.</p>

<p>Additonally you can choose Thresholds and the Unit to be displayed in the panel with these options.</p>

<p><img src="https://mrkaran.dev/images/ping-row-panel1.png" alt="">
<img src="https://mrkaran.dev/images/ping-row-panel2.png" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="ping-response-time-graph">Ping Response Time Graph</h3>

<p>The next graph is interesting, it lets me visualise the avg, min, max ping response time as well as the % packet loss plotted on the Y2 (right Y) axis.</p>

<p><img src="https://mrkaran.dev/images/floyd-ping.png" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="availability-panel">Availability Panel</h3>

<p>An interesting query to calculate uptime (just in the context whether the upstream is reachable) is:</p>
<div><pre>100 - avg_over_time(ping_percent_packet_loss[2m])</pre></div>
<p>Since I scrape metrics at an interval of <code>1m</code>(in order to not ping too frequently and disrupt my actual browsing experience), in this query I am averaging the data points for the metric <code>ping_percent_packet_loss</code> in a <code>[2m]</code> window.</p>

<p><img src="https://mrkaran.dev/images/ping-availability.png" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="dns-response-time-graph">DNS Response Time Graph</h3>

<p>We can similarly query the DNS response time by visualising the average response time for a DNS query. This might be useful only to people self-hosting their DNS servers.</p>

<p><img src="https://mrkaran.dev/images/telegraf-dns.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>So with a pretty simple and minimal OSS solution, I was able to setup monitoring for my home network! Over the last few days whenever my ISP had slightest of trouble, I can correlate it with my metrics! I mean I still can’t do anything about it cause the other person on ISP’s customer support is “Did you try rebooting your router”  – the quintessential solution to all tech problems. Wish we could reboot this entire damn 2020 as well, but one could hope!</p>

  <p>In the previous two posts we talked about gVisor’s
<a href="https://gvisor.dev/blog/2019/11/18/gvisor-security-basics-part-1/">security design principles</a>
as well as how those are applied in the
<a href="https://gvisor.dev/blog/2020/04/02/gvisor-networking-security/">context of networking</a>.
Recently, a new container escape vulnerability
(<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-14386">CVE-2020-14386</a>)
was announced that ties these topics well together. gVisor is
<a href="https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2020/q3/168">not vulnerable</a> to this specific
issue, but it provides an interesting case study to continue our exploration of
gVisor’s security. While gVisor is not immune to vulnerabilities,
<a href="https://gvisor.dev/security/">we take several steps</a> to minimize the impact and
remediate if a vulnerability is found.</p>

<h2 id="escaping-the-container">Escaping the Container</h2>

<p>First, let’s describe how the discovered vulnerability works. There are numerous
ways one can send and receive bytes over the network with Linux. One of the most
performant ways is to use a ring buffer, which is a memory region shared by the
application and the kernel. These rings are created by calling
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setsockopt.2.html">setsockopt(2)</a> with
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/packet.7.html"><code>PACKET_RX_RING</code></a> for
receiving and
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/packet.7.html"><code>PACKET_TX_RING</code></a> for
sending packets.</p>

<p>The vulnerability is in the code that reads packets when <code>PACKET_RX_RING</code> is
enabled. There is another option
(<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/packet.7.html"><code>PACKET_RESERVE</code></a>) that
asks the kernel to leave some space in the ring buffer before each packet for
anything the application needs, e.g. control structures. When a packet is
received, the kernel calculates where to copy the packet to, taking the amount
reserved before each packet into consideration. If the amount reserved is large,
the kernel performed an incorrect calculation which could cause an overflow
leading to an out-of-bounds write of up to 10 bytes, controlled by the attacker.
The data in the write is easily controlled using the loopback to send a crafted
packet and receiving it using a <code>PACKET_RX_RING</code> with a carefully selected
<code>PACKET_RESERVE</code> size.</p>

<span>// ...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html"><code>CAP_NET_RAW</code></a>
capability is required to create the socket above. However, in order to support
common debugging tools like <code>ping</code> and <code>tcpdump</code>, Docker containers, including
those created for Kubernetes, are given <code>CAP_NET_RAW</code> by default and thus may be
able to trigger this vulnerability to elevate privileges and escape the
container.</p>

<p>Next, we are going to explore why this vulnerability doesn’t work in gVisor, and
how gVisor could prevent the escape even if a similar vulnerability existed
inside gVisor’s kernel.</p>

<h2 id="default-protections">Default Protections</h2>

<p>gVisor does not implement <code>PACKET_RX_RING</code>, but <strong>does</strong> support raw sockets
which are required for <code>PACKET_RX_RING</code>. Raw sockets are a controversial feature
to support in a sandbox environment. While it allows great customizations for
essential tools like <code>ping</code>, it may allow packets to be written to the network
without any validation. In general, allowing an untrusted application to write
crafted packets to the network is a questionable idea and a historical source of
vulnerabilities. With that in mind, if <code>CAP_NET_RAW</code> is enabled by default, it
would not be <em>secure by default</em> to run untrusted applications.</p>

<p>After multiple discussions when raw sockets were first implemented, we decided
to disable raw sockets by default, <strong>even if <code>CAP_NET_RAW</code> is given to the
application</strong>. Instead, enabling raw sockets in gVisor requires the admin to set
<code>--net-raw</code> flag to runsc when configuring the runtime, in addition to requiring
the <code>CAP_NET_RAW</code> capability in the application. It comes at the expense that
some tools may not work out of the box, but as part of our
<a href="https://gvisor.dev/blog/2019/11/18/gvisor-security-basics-part-1/#secure-by-default">secure-by-default</a>
principle, we felt that it was important for the “less secure” configuration to
be explicit.</p>

<p>Since this bug was due to an overflow in the specific Linux implementation of
the packet ring, gVisor’s raw socket implementation is not affected. However, if
there were a vulnerability in gVisor, containers would not be allowed to exploit
it by default.</p>

<p>As an alternative way to implement this same constraint, Kubernetes allows
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/">admission controllers</a>
to be configured to customize requests. Cloud providers can use this to
implement more stringent policies. For example, GKE implements an admission
controller for gVisor that
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/sandbox-pods#capabilities">removes <code>CAP_NET_RAW</code> from gVisor pods</a>
unless it has been explicitly set in the pod spec.</p>

<h2 id="isolated-kernel">Isolated Kernel</h2>

<p>gVisor has its own application kernel, called the Sentry, that is distinct from
the host kernel. Just like what you would expect from a kernel, gVisor has a
memory management subsystem, virtual file system, and a full network stack. The
host network is only used as a transport to carry packets in and out the
sandbox<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. The loopback interface which is used in the exploit stays
completely inside the sandbox, never reaching the host.</p>

<p>Therefore, even if the Sentry was vulnerable to the attack, there would be two
factors that would prevent a container escape from happening. First, the
vulnerability would be limited to the Sentry, and the attacker would compromise
only the application kernel, bound by a restricted set of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seccomp">seccomp</a> filters, discussed more in
depth below. Second, the Sentry is a distinct implementation of the API, written
in Go, which provides bounds checking that would have likely prevented access
past the bounds of the shared region (e.g. see
<a href="https://cs.opensource.google/gvisor/gvisor/+/master:pkg/sentry/syscalls/linux/vfs2/aio.go;l=210;drc=a11061d78a58ed75b10606d1a770b035ed944b66?q=file:aio&amp;ss=gvisor%2Fgvisor">aio</a>
or
<a href="https://cs.opensource.google/gvisor/gvisor/+/master:pkg/sentry/kernel/kcov.go;l=272?q=file:kcov&amp;ss=gvisor%2Fgvisor">kcov</a>,
which have similar shared regions).</p>

<p>Here, Kubernetes warrants slightly more explanation. gVisor makes pods the unit
of isolation and a pod can run multiple containers. In other words, each pod is
a gVisor instance, and each container is a set of processes running inside
gVisor, isolated via Sentry-internal namespaces like regular containers inside a
pod. If there were a vulnerability in gVisor, the privilege escalation would
allow a container inside the pod to break out to other <strong>containers inside the
same pod</strong>, but the container still <strong>cannot break out of the pod</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="defense-in-depth">Defense in Depth</h2>

<p>gVisor follows a
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/security/infrastructure/design/resources/google_infrastructure_whitepaper_fa.pdf">common security principle used at Google</a>
that the system should have two layers of protection, and those layers should
require different compromises to be broken. We apply this principle by assuming
that the Sentry (first layer of defense)
<a href="https://gvisor.dev/blog/2019/11/18/gvisor-security-basics-part-1/#defense-in-depth">will be compromised and should not be trusted</a>.
In order to protect the host kernel from a compromised Sentry, we wrap it around
many security and isolations features to ensure only the minimal set of
functionality from the host kernel is exposed.</p>

<p><img src="https://gvisor.dev/assets/images/2020-09-18-containing-a-real-vulnerability-figure1.png" alt="Figure 1" title="Protection layers."></p>

<p>First, the sandbox runs inside a cgroup that can limit and throttle host
resources being used. Second, the sandbox joins empty namespaces, including user
and mount, to further isolate from the host. Next, it changes the process root
to a read-only directory that contains only <code>/proc</code> and nothing else. Then, it
executes with the unprivileged user/group
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobody_/(username/)"><code>nobody</code></a> with all
capabilities stripped. Last and most importantly, a seccomp filter is added to
tightly restrict what parts of the Linux syscall surface that gVisor is allowed
to access. The allowed host surface is a far smaller set of syscalls than the
Sentry implements for applications to use. Not only restricting the syscall
being called, but also checking that arguments to these syscalls are within the
expected set. Dangerous syscalls like <code>execve(2)</code>,
<code>open(2)</code>, and <code>socket(2)</code> are prohibited, thus an
attacker isn’t able to execute binaries or acquire new resources on the host.</p>

<p>if there were a vulnerability in gVisor that allowed an attacker to execute code
inside the Sentry, the attacker still has extremely limited privileges on the
host. In fact, a compromised Sentry is much more restricted than a
non-compromised regular container. For CVE-2020-14386 in particular, the attack
would be blocked by more than one security layer: non-privileged user, no
capability, and seccomp filters.</p>

<p>Although the surface is drastically reduced, there is still a chance that there
is a vulnerability in one of the allowed syscalls. That’s why it’s important to
keep the surface small and carefully consider what syscalls are allowed. You can
find the full set of allowed syscalls
<a href="https://cs.opensource.google/gvisor/gvisor/+/master:runsc/boot/filter/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Another possible attack vector is resources that are present in the Sentry, like
open file descriptors. The Sentry has file descriptors that an attacker could
potentially use, such as log files, platform files (e.g. <code>/dev/kvm</code>), an RPC
endpoint that allows external communication with the Sentry, and a Netstack
endpoint that connects the sandbox to the network. The Netstack endpoint in
particular is a concern because it gives direct access to the network. It’s an
<code>AF_PACKET</code> socket that allows arbitrary L2 packets to be written to the
network. In the normal case, Netstack assembles packets that go out the network,
giving the container control over only the payload. But if the Sentry is
compromised, an attacker can craft packets to the network. In many ways this is
similar to anyone sending random packets over the internet, but still this is a
place where the host kernel surface exposed is larger than we would like it to
be.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Security comes with many tradeoffs that are often hard to make, such as the
decision to disable raw sockets by default. However, these tradeoffs have …</p></div></div>

<h3>
  18 September 2020
</h3>


  <p>In a few months, I’ll celebrate my fifth year as a professional - understand paid - software engineer. I find this role to be a right balance of technical skills, human relationships and it fulfils my curiosity. As time goes by, I’m also starting to be disappointed by some of its negative aspects. While it doesn’t prevent me from sleeping, I think an effort could be made to challenge some lousy and short-sighted comments we see daily on social platforms.</p>
<p>Today, I’d like to talk about <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented-Addison-Wesley-Professional-ebook/dp/B000SEIBB8">Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</a>, a book written by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides, famously known as the <em>Gang of Four</em>. If you never read it: this is a fundamental programming book describing programming abstractions published in 1994. The date is essential here, but we’ll come to that later.</p>
<p>This book has recently been discussed by many, due to <a href="https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin/status/1306581616983183361">a recent tweet from Robert. C. Martin aka Uncle Bob</a>. Long story short, telling a massive audience that book X is great, and treating people who consider it outdated as “foolish” does not end well.</p>
<p>While I disagree with the tone here, I’d like to focus on the negative comments which followed, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>the book is outdated</li>
<li>its concepts are outdated</li>
<li>its authors said it’s outdated</li>
<li>the book is only focused on mid-90s C++ developers</li>
<li>no one ever used the “flyweight” design pattern</li>
<li>the book is not even readable</li>
<li>its abstractions make code unreadable</li>
</ul>
<p>First of all, let’s get back to 1994. I was two at the time. All Internet websites could probably fit on a floppy disk, Jeff Bezos founded Amazon, Rasmus Lerdorf was only starting to work on its <em>Personal Home Page/Forms Interpreter</em> CGI C program, and Larry Page and Sergey Brin would only start their research project for a web search engine two years later. The biggest technology companies were IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Motorola and Xerox, which mostly sat behind the oil, car, and food industries. Programming existed, but it wasn’t the same field as we know it today. Tech companies were a few, and I assume a lot of programmers were working in other industries. Being a professional in this sector was arguably more difficult then, and knowledge was not as easily accessible as it is today. This book was published in a world where programming started to spread in many industries. It surely was a very good resource, to try to apply its concepts, and see what works and what doesn’t. The authors were literally inventing the field at the time: Erich Gamma, for instance, teamed up with Kent Beck to create the Java JUnit test framework just a few years later, which hugely helped to popularise testing.</p>
<p>My point is: let’s remind ourselves we stand on the shoulders of many people who tried and experimented a lot at the time. We too often take for granted the knowledge and productivity we have today. On top of that, let’s not be disrespectful towards the previous generation. My father and my grandfather both work(ed) as electricians: never did my father complain about his father’s tools or habits before him. He learned them and perfected them with modern knowledge.</p>
<p>Now about the book in itself. While I agree with people saying that some design patterns are too abstract, I strongly disagree with the ones saying the whole book is outdated. Should you develop in a OO language today, such as Java, C++, Python or Ruby, or even more notably, develop a framework or a tool <em>for</em> developers, I think this book is still highly relevant today.</p>
<p>Here are my top picks from the book and why I chose them.</p>
<p><strong>Builder:</strong> because in OOP, objects often hold too much data in them, you need to control how to instantiate them properly. Even with overloaded constructors, data validation at instantiation can become messy. Do you like your testing framework using a <em>fluent interface</em> with method chaining (<code>assert(...).not().equalTo(...)</code>)? Guess what, it’s directly inspired by the builder design pattern.</p>
<p><strong>Prototype:</strong> I often hear people complaining about how complicated JavaScript is. While I don’t think this language makes it easy for the developer to write non error-prone code, I better understood the language via the lens of its prototype-based nature, precisely described by the prototype design pattern.</p>
<p><strong>Most of the structural patterns:</strong> While everyone is focused on the bad parts of OOP, namely inheritance, all those design patterns are focused on composability. If you want to be cool nowadays, you could say you prefer “composition over inheritance”. Well, if you think composition is only about embedding objects in each other, you should read the part of structural design patterns. For instance, you probably know decorators from Python or annotations in Java/C#, they derive from the decorator design pattern.</p>
<p><strong>Chain of Responsibility:</strong> I think we can all agree on how great it is to use and implement a middleware in our modern web framework. Just use or write functions which take a <em>next</em> handler, a request object. Pass it to your web framework instance via a <code>.use(...)</code> method and you’re done. This is what the Chain of Responsibility pattern is all about. All Rails, Django, and Laravel developers knew that was NIH.</p>
<p><strong>Iterator:</strong> This one seems obvious now, perhaps not so much at a time where iterating on arrays with pointer arithmetic was common. Today, iterators are even buried behind standard libraries to implement even higher abstract functionalities, but they are still there. I don’t see a more universal way to implement, with the same public API, a traversal of an array, a tree, or a graph (they are better ways of iterating those last data structures though).</p>
<p><strong>Observer:</strong> For this last one, here is the verbatim definition from the book: “Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically”. Now, if we take a look at some modern technologies, doesn’t this resonate with PubSub models or React hooks for instance?</p>
<p>To conclude, I’m not saying the book is not old, quite the opposite: you can feel it when it takes as examples from 90s user interfaces. I’m merely advocating that our industry and its workers have changed a lot in the last 30 years, dare I say even more than in any other industry. But this should not be an excuse to sweep away years of meticulous R&amp;D and documentation, on which our modern tools still rely on nowadays, and the people behind it.</p>
<p>Because a lot of people complained that they were never able to finish the book, here is an extract from the end, section “What to Expect from Design Patterns”, page 351:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s possible to argue that this book hasn’t accomplished much. After all, it doesn’t present any algorithms or programming techniques that haven’t been used before. […] it just documents existing designs. You could conclude that it makes a reasonable tutorial, perhaps, but it certainly can’t offer much to an experienced object-oriented designer.</p>
<p>We hope you think differently. Cataloging design patterns is important. It gives us standard names and definitions for the techniques we use. If we don’t study design patterns in software, we won’t be able to improve them, and it’ll be harder to come up with new ones.</p>
<p>This book is only a start.</p>

            <p>Two weeks ago, <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremyjordan" target="_blank">Jeremy</a> wrote a great post on <a href="https://www.jeremyjordan.me/testing-ml/" target="_blank">Effective Testing for Machine Learning Systems</a>. He distinguished between traditional software tests and machine learning (ML) tests; software tests check the <strong>written logic</strong> while ML tests check the <strong>learned logic</strong>.</p>

<p>ML tests can be further split into <strong>testing</strong> and <strong>evaluation</strong>. We’re familiar with ML <strong>evaluation</strong> where we train a model and evaluate its performance on an unseen validation set; this is done via metrics (e.g., accuracy, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic#Area_under_the_curve" target="_blank">Area under Curve of Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC ROC)</a>) and visuals (e.g., <a href="https://eugeneyan.com/writing/recommender-systems-baseline-pytorch/#implementation-2-matrix-factorization-with-bias" target="_blank">precision-recall curve</a>).</p>

<p>On the other hand, ML <strong>testing</strong> involves checks on model behaviour. <strong>Pre-train tests</strong>—which can be run without trained parameters—check if our <em>written logic</em> is correct. For example, is classification probability between 0 to 1? <strong>Post-train tests</strong> check if the <em>learned logic</em> is expected. For example, on the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data" target="_blank">Titanic dataset</a>, we should expect females to have a higher survival probability (relative to males).</p>

<p>Workflow for testing machine learning (<a href="https://www.jeremyjordan.me/testing-ml/" target="_blank">source</a>)</p>

<p>Taken together, here’s how the workflow might look like. To complement this, we’ll implement a machine learning model and run the following tests on it:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#pre-train-tests-to-ensure-correct-implementation">Pre-train tests to ensure correct implementation</a></li>
  <li><a href="#post-train-tests-to-ensure-expected-learned-behaviour">Post-train tests to ensure expected learned behaviour</a></li>
  <li><a href="#model-evaluation-to-ensure-satisfactory-performance">Evaluation to ensure satisfactory model performance</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="setting-up-the-context-algorithm-and-data">Setting up the context (algorithm and data)</h2>

<p>Before we can do ML testing, we’ll need an <strong>algorithm and some data</strong>. Our algorithm will be a <a href="https://numpy.org/" target="_blank"><code>numpy</code></a> implementation of <a href="https://github.com/eugeneyan/testing-ml/blob/master/src/tree/decision_tree.py" target="_blank"><code>DecisionTree</code></a> which predicts a probability for binary classification. (<a href="#try-it-for-yourself-and-break-something">Extensions to make it support regression welcome!</a>).</p>

<p>To run our tests, we’ll use the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data" target="_blank">Titanic dataset</a>. This tiny data set (~900 rows, 10 features) makes for fast testing (when model training is involved) and allows us to iterate quickly. (As part of performance evaluation, we run <code>fit()</code> and <code>predict()</code> hundreds of times to get the 99th percentile timing.) The simplicity and familiarity of the data also makes it easier to discuss the post-train (i.e., learned logic) tests.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with the Titanic dataset, here's how it looks like (scroll to the right).</p>

<h2 id="adopting-testing-habits-from-software-engineering">Adopting testing habits from software engineering</h2>

<p>We’ll adopt some good habits from software engineering. We won’t go through them in detail here though it was previously covered in another <a href="https://eugeneyan.com/writing/setting-up-python-project-for-automation-and-collaboration/" target="_blank">post</a>:</p>

<h2 id="pre-train-tests-to-ensure-correct-implementation">Pre-train tests to ensure correct implementation</h2>

<p>In pre-train tests, we want to <strong>catch errors in our implementation</strong> (i.e., written logic) before training an erroneous model. We can run these tests without a fully trained model.</p>

<p>First, we’ll test our functions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning#Gini_impurity" target="_blank">Gini impurity</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning#Information_gain" target="_blank">Gini gain</a>. These will be used to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning#General" target="_blank">split the data</a> and grow our decision tree.</p>

<p>We’ll also want to check the output ranges. Given that we’re predicting probabilities, we should expect the output to range from 0 to 1 inclusive.</p>

<p>Here, we’ll check for test set leakage (i.e., duplicate rows in train/test splits) by concatenating train and test data, dropping duplicates, and checking the number of rows.

<p>Given perfectly separable data and unlimited depth, our decision tree should be able to “memorise” the training data and <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting" target="_blank">overfit</a> completely</em>. In other words, if we train <em>and</em> evaluate on the training data, we should get 100% accuracy. (Note: the Titanic data isn’t perfectly separable so we’ll create a small data sample for this.)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
      

<p>This repository contains applications that demonstrate how to use the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/generic-sensor/">Generic Sensor API</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/generic-sensor/">Generic Sensor API</a> is a set of
interfaces which expose sensor devices to the web platform. The API consists
of the base <a href="https://w3c.github.io/sensors/#the-sensor-interface">Sensor</a>
interface and a set of concrete sensor classes built on top, such as
<a href="https://w3c.github.io/accelerometer/#accelerometer-interface">Accelerometer</a>,
<a href="https://w3c.github.io/accelerometer/#linearaccelerationsensor-interface">LinearAccelerationSensor</a>,
<a href="https://w3c.github.io/gyroscope/#gyroscope-interface">Gyroscope</a>,
<a href="https://w3c.github.io/orientation-sensor/#absoluteorientationsensor-interface">AbsoluteOrientationSensor</a>
and <a href="https://w3c.github.io/orientation-sensor/#relativeorientationsensor-interface">RelativeOrientationSensor</a>.</p>

<p>The Generic Sensor API is very simple and easy-to-use! The Sensor interface has
<a href="https://w3c.github.io/sensors/#sensor-start"><code>start()</code></a> and
<a href="https://w3c.github.io/sensors/#sensor-stop"><code>stop()</code></a> methods to control sensor state
and several event handlers for receiving notifications about sensor activation, errors and newly
available readings. The concrete sensor classes usually add their specific reading attributes to
the base class.</p>

<h2 id="launch-instructions">Launch instructions</h2>

<p>The demo apps work with Chrome 63 or later. If you have an older version of Chrome, please enable
the <a href="chrome://flags/#enable-generic-sensor">chrome://flags/#enable-generic-sensor</a> flag, before
running the demos.</p>

<p>If the demo is using environmental sensors, such as,
<a href="https://w3c.github.io/magnetometer/#magnetometer-interface">Magnetometer</a> or

While it’s well received in the community with its rich fault injection types and easy-to-use dashboard, it was difficult  to use Chaos Mesh with end-to-end testing or the continuous integration (CI) process. As a result, problems introduced during system development could not be discovered before the release.</p><p>In this article, I will share how we use chaos-mesh-action, a GitHub action to integrate Chaos Mesh into the CI process.</p><p>chaos-mesh-action is available on <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/chaos-mesh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub market</a>, and the source code is on <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>.</p><h2>Design of chaos-mesh-action</h2><p><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Action</a> is a CI/CD feature natively supported by GitHub, through which we can easily build automated and customized software development workflows in the GitHub repository. </p><p>Combined with GitHub actions, Chaos Mesh can be more easily integrated into the daily development and testing of the system, thus guaranteeing that each code submission on GitHub is bug-free and won’t damage existing code. The following figure shows chaos-mesh-action integrated into the CI workflow:</p><p><img alt="chaos-mesh-action integrate in the CI workflow" src="https://chaos-mesh.org/assets/images/chaos-mesh-action-integrate-in-the-ci-workflow-6b70ea3c8457f74cfd89305a20d9bec4.png"></p><h2>Using chaos-mesh-action in GitHub workflow</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/chaos-mesh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chaos-mesh-action</a> works in Github workflows. A GitHub workflow is a configurable automated process that you can set up in your repository to build, test, package, release, or deploy any GitHub project. To integrate Chaos Mesh in your CI, do the following:</p><ol><li>Design a workflow.</li><li>Create a workflow.</li><li>Run the workflow.</li></ol><h3>Design a workflow</h3><p>Before you design a workflow, you must consider the following issues:</p><ul><li>What functions are we going to test in this workflow?</li><li>What types of faults will we inject? </li><li>How do we verify the correctness of the system?</li></ul><p>As an example, let’s design a simple test workflow that includes the following steps: </p><ol><li>Create two Pods in a Kubernetes cluster.</li><li>Ping one pod from the other. </li><li>Use Chaos Mesh to inject network delay chaos and test whether the ping command is affected.</li></ol><h3>Create the workflow</h3><p>After you design the workflow, the next step is to create it. </p><ol><li>Navigate to the GitHub repository that contains the software you want to test.</li><li>To start creating a workflow, click <strong>Actions</strong>, and then click the <strong>"New workflow</strong>" button:</li></ol><p><img alt="Creating a workflow" src="https://chaos-mesh.org/assets/images/creating-a-workflow-17c7622de0400b1cf0d0bd091a1c0561.png"></p><p>A workflow is essentially the configuration of jobs that take place sequentially and automatically. Note that the jobs are configured in a single file.

You simply need to prepare the chaos configuration that you intend to use to get its Base64 representation.

This is consistent with the chaos configuration we injected into chaos-mesh-action.  </p><h2>Current status and next steps</h2><p>At present, we have applied chaos-mesh-action to the <a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TiDB Operator</a> project. The workflow is injected with the Pod chaos to verify the restart function of the specified instances of the operator. The purpose is to ensure that tidb-operator can work normally when the pods of the operator are randomly deleted by the injected faults. You can view the <a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/actions?query=workflow%3Achaos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TiDB Operator page</a> for more details.</p><p>In the future, we plan to apply chaos-mesh-action to more tests to ensure the stability of TiDB and related components. You are welcome to create your own workflow using chaos-mesh-action.</p><p>If you find a bug or think something is missing, feel free to file an issue, open a pull request (PR), or join us on the <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/cloud-native/shared_invite/zt-fyy3b8up-qHeDNVqbz1j8HDY6g1cY4w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#project-chaos-mesh</a> channel in the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNCF</a> slack workspace. </p></section></div>]]>
