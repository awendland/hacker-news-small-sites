							<p><span>Big name corporations with robust growth profiles are more likely to be caught up in corporate fraud than smaller, struggling firms.</span></p>
<p><span>Corporate fraud is an illegal, unethical, and highly strategized maneuver committed by a company or an individual associated with the company in order to defraud investors, and the government of millions and even billions in tax revenue. The fraud schemes involve approaches to misrepresent the company’s financial standing by use of false accounting practices.</span></p>
<p><span>In a corporate world, this type of elite, while-collar crime is not very uncommon. In fact, it’s been going on since the 15th century England.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>In the study published in <em><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07418825.2020.1853799?journalCode=rjqy20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Justice Quarterly</a></em>, the researchers zeroed in on data on more than 250 U.S. public corporations that had involvement in financial securities fraud identified in more than 1000 Securities and Exchange Commission filings from 2005 to 2013. </span></p>
<p><span>Upon comparing their characteristics to a control sample of over 500 firms (from Compustat) that were not listed in SEC fiscal evasion filings, they found growing fads in the risk of fraud including corporations that were listed in the Fortune 500, traded on the NYSE and had strong growth prospects.</span></p>
<p><span>“Prestigious companies, those that are household names, were actually more prone to engage in financial fraud, which was very surprising,” said Jennifer Schwartz, WSU sociologist and lead author on the study in <a href="https://news.wsu.edu/2021/02/02/big-name-corporations-likely-commit-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a news release</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>“We thought it would be companies that were struggling financially, that were nearing bankruptcy, but it was quite the opposite. It was the companies that thought they should be doing better than they were, the ones with strong growth imperatives–those were the firms that were most likely to cheat.”</span></p>
<p><span>Corporate financial securities frauds are usually surreptitious and nonviolent in nature. They are also understudied especially when compared with street crimes, even though they can inflict far worse devastating effects on the economy.</span></p>
<p>D<span>etection and prosecution of this type of elite crime can also be highly challenging because the individuals involved in it usually go to great lengths in order to conceal their activities.</span></p>
<p><span>“What these companies were doing was essentially fudging the numbers, lying to investors, other companies and the SEC,” said Schwartz. “Eventually, you have to make up for the money that was lost, that really never existed, so shareholders lose money, people lose retirement plans, people lose jobs. It’s very, very damaging.”</span></p>
<p><span>For the study, the team looked at the time period where a massive financial collapse that shook Wall Street to its core, took place. They also incorporated data on the fraud <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/worldcom-s-magic-trick-356121" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scandals of WorldCom</a> and <a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/other/enron-scandal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Enron</a>, and the subsequent regulatory Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.</span></p>
<p><span>The intent of the study was to figure out the operations at publicly traded companies in which there was high probability for perpetrating fraud.</span></p>
<p><span>They found that big corporations with Fortune 500 status were represented nearly four times as often among the firms that had committed fraud than the control group with no history of financial fraud. Similarly, firms that traded on NYSE were represented 2 times more among fraudulent firms compared to non-fraud, which is higher than those that trade on other exchanges like the NASDAQ or OTC.</span></p>
<p>The study also found that fraud is more prevalent when the CEO was also the chair of the board, but the potential link between the extent of fraud and position in the company is yet to be established.</p>
<p><span>“We need to look more at corporate leadership arrangements, and the responsibility of individuals in creating the culture of the company itself,” explained </span><span>Schwartz</span><span>. “How can leaders encourage companies to be more successful not only in terms of profit or growth but also in terms of corporate social responsibility?”</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <div> <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div id="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <p>While Tinybird is not a log analysis tool per se, it’s a tool that you can use as the foundation to analyze logs-like datasets at scale. Here you’ll learn:</p> <ul> <li>how to use it to analyze NGINX logs</li> <li>how to publish your SQL queries as API endpoints to be used in other tools</li> <li>and how to model your data sources and endpoints to make it 10X faster.</li> </ul> <p>An NGINX log looks like this:</p>  <p>It’s not a CSV file but a “space separated file” so in principle Tinybird wouldn’t load it because we just support CSV files. But if we analyze the file using our <a href="https://docs.tinybird.co/cli.html">CLI tool</a>:</p>  <p>The delimiter is guessed so it can be loaded.</p>  <p>The format looks like this:</p>  <p>We need to transform it to something useful. To transform data we use a pipe.</p>  <p>Now let’s query the new pipe:</p>  <p>You could now publish an endpoint:</p>  <p>So far so good. But what happens when you have millions of entries a day, the generated endpoints wouldn’t be as fast as needed. For example, for endpoints serving real time dashboards, where the user can pick different date ranges, add filters and so on, waiting for more than a second is not the best solution. So there is an easy solution: generate views as data arrives.</p> <p>So, let’s create a Materialized view (MV from now on) for the previous endpoint:</p>  <p>There are many things to notice:</p> <ul> <li>The materialized view SQL is almost the same than the endpoint but instead of count it uses countState and the same for avg. Those -State modifiers are needed when pushing data to a MV. The datasource where the MV pushes the data has two columns with a special data type to store those <code>-State</code></li> <li>The Engine is not the regular MergeTree, it’s an <code>AggregatingMergeTree</code> that tells ClickHouse to aggregate columns on merge operations (executed periodically, you don’t need to worry about that)</li> <li>The sorting key tells ClickHouse which column we are grouping by</li> </ul> <p>We push the files</p>  <p>We use <code>--push-deps</code> to upload all the dependencies and <code>--populate</code> to fill the materialized view with the data already in <code>log_transform</code></p> <p>Now we check the amount of rows in that table:</p>  <p>If we push new data with new IP addresses, the amount of rows will rise but, comparing the amount of rows in the original table with the MV datasource, you can understand why it is going to be faster. And the good thing - this table is updated when you push new data, it does not need to be recalculated.</p>  <p>The last thing is to change the endpoint to use the new table</p>   <p>Let’s test the endpoint and compare with the old one</p>  <p>Both are really fast but the last one is one order of magnitude faster.</p> <p>You could create MV for any case you can think of, for example:</p> <ul> <li>unique ip addreeses by day: <code>select toDate(time) day, uniqState(ip_address) uniq_ip from log_transform group by day</code></li> <li>percentile 95 of payload size per hour: <code>select toStartOfHour(time) hour, quantileState(0.95)(ip_address) q95 from log_transform group by hour</code></li> <li>requests per month: <code>select toStartOfMonth(time) month, countState() requests_count from log_transform group by month</code></li> </ul> <p>Materialized views are a really powerful feature specially when you are creating real time endpoints.</p> <p>We created a <a href="https://github.com/tinybirdco/log_parsing_template">github repo</a> with the data project so you can reproduce the post commands in your Tinybird account and start analysing your own logs.</p> </div>  </article>  </div> </div></div>]]>

        <p><em>Most of the time, a backend is just a layer between APIs and a database. Using the Postgrest project and
                some SQL we will build a backend without any Java, Golang, C# etc…</em></p>
        <p><em>For this Demo, we will build a chat application with channels, messages, users and user profiles.</em>
        </p>
        <p><code>March 02,2020</code></p>
        <h2 id="firstadatabase">First, a database</h2>
        <p>Database, an essential tool for every project on the web. Relationnal databases are not new… almost 50 years
            !
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database</a>
        </p>
        <p>With stored procedures, views, user management, roles and a query langage we all know we can do whatever we
            want on our data. With frameworks, ORM and other tools that makes great integration between Object langages
            and Relational Databases we spend most of time using them to access data in a simple way, so simple that we
            can do directly with SQL.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">https://www.postgresql.org/</a> is a very popular open source database
            system, so let's go with it.</p>
        <p>Now our docker-compose file starts with : </p>
        <pre><code>version: '3'
        services:
          db:
            image: postgres
            ports:
              - "5432:5432"
            environment:
              POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
        </code></pre>
        <h2 id="anauthenticationserverkeycloakwithpleaseopenit">An authentication server : keycloak with please-open.it
        </h2>
        <p>Go to <a href="https://console.please-open.it/">https://console.please-open.it</a> and subscribe to a free
            keycloak realm. It is the easiest way to start.</p>
        <p>This realm will provide JWT tokens we need to authenticate users on our DB. JWT tokens are signed with a
            private key. We need to retreive a public key in order to verify token signature.
            Go to "realm settings", "keys", and get the public key for RSA RS256 algorithm.</p>
        <p><img src="https://www.mathieupassenaud.fr/codeless_backend/_Codeless_%20backend_files/public_key.png" alt="public_key"></p>
        <p>This key is in PEM format. For postgrest, we need it in JWK.
            A simple tool online can do it for you : <a href="https://8gwifi.org/jwkconvertfunctions.jsp">https://8gwifi.org/jwkconvertfunctions.jsp</a></p>
        <p>Add "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----" and "-----END PUBLIC KEY-----" delimiters, paste your key and transform it
            to JWK.</p>
        <p><img src="https://www.mathieupassenaud.fr/codeless_backend/_Codeless_%20backend_files/pem_to_jwk.png" alt="pem to jwk"></p>
        <h3 id="createaclient">Create a client</h3>
        <p>A client for a web frontend is needed, to get an access<em>token after login. Go to "clients" and create a
                new one. This client in this example is named "frontend". Choose access type "public", and define the
                redirect</em>uri to "https://playground.please-open.it/" for now.</p>
        <p><img src="https://www.mathieupassenaud.fr/codeless_backend/_Codeless_%20backend_files/new_client.png" alt="new client"></p>
        <h3 id="roles">Roles</h3>
        <p>Go to "roles" tab in the client, we need only 2 roles : standard and admin. Create them, after we will
            associate to users.
            <img src="https://www.mathieupassenaud.fr/codeless_backend/_Codeless_%20backend_files/roles.png" alt="roles"></p>
        <h3 id="users">Users</h3>
        <p>2 users "standard" and 1 "admin". </p>
        <p>After creating a user, remove all "required user actions", go to "credentials" and attribute a new password.
            In "Role Mappings", select your client "frontend" and add a "standard", or "admin" role.</p>
        <p><img src="https://www.mathieupassenaud.fr/codeless_backend/_Codeless_%20backend_files/role_mapping.png" alt="add roles"></p>
        <h3 id="webapplication">Web application</h3>
        <p>The easiest way to obtain a token, is your (playground)[https://playground.please-open.it]. An opensource web
            application, oauth2 client for keycloak and token introspection.
            In "parameters", put your realm id and client id. Now we are ready to retreive a new token. Click on
            "login", enter a user credentials and the redirect will do the job.</p>
        <p><img src="https://www.mathieupassenaud.fr/codeless_backend/_Codeless_%20backend_files/login.png" alt="login"></p>
        <p>An access_token is retreived and decoded. The base64 encoded will be used later, in each api call.</p>
        <h2 id="restapispostgrest">REST APIs : postgrest</h2>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational<em>state</em>transfer</a>
        </p>
        <p><a href="http://postgrest.org/en/v6.0/">Postgrest</a> is a standalone app with a web server, turning a
            database directly into a RESTful API. Sometimes the only way we are using ORM for.</p>
        <h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3>
        <p>Authentication is ensured by JWT tokens. Postgrest verifies the signature with the given key (using
            "PGRST<em>JWT</em>SECRET" variable), then get a role in the token's payload.</p>
        <p>In order to verify the signature, a public key is needed. Retreive the JWK you have generated previously and
            paste is ENTIERLY in the "PGRST<em>JWT</em>SECRET" variable.</p>
        <h3 id="anonymousrole">Anonymous role</h3>
        <p>An anonymous role gives access to data without any authentication. We gives to postgrest a name of an
            anonymous role. By using this, all resources granted to this role will be accessible without a token.</p>
        <p>PGRST<em>DB</em>ANON<em>ROLE: web</em>anon</p>

        <p>Only select is permitted on web_anon.</p>
        <p>Now we register a new role "standard" which corresponds to the role we created previously in keycloak.
            With the configuration, postgrest will check in JWT token at resource<em>access.frontend.roles[0] value is

It used to autohide after 3 seconds and it was one of the most infuriating things about Google Meet.</p><figure><img src="https://neil.computer/content/images/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-11.54.00-PM.png" alt="Google Meet UI Screenshot showing the bottom bar with Mute/Unmute button always visible." srcset="https://neil.computer/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-11.54.00-PM.png 600w, https://neil.computer/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-11.54.00-PM.png 1000w, https://neil.computer/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-11.54.00-PM.png 1600w, https://neil.computer/content/images/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-11.54.00-PM.png 1918w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Bottom bar with the Mute button is always visible now.</figcaption></figure><p>Knowing if you're muted or unmuted is probably the number 1 most important interface element of any A/V conference application.

From the ground up, from fundamentals, from axioms of human behavior, from analytical standpoint, with experimental insights, and then a mandatory - "Aesthetics is secondary" course. If your knee-jerk reaction to what I just said is "But, Aesthetics sells." - yes it does, if you're selling trinkets and wind-catchers at a tourist shop. Not for business critical applications.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>UX/UI professionals need to study deeply how humans and machines interact. I remember referencing the classic High Performance HMI book many years ago in engineering college. Obviously nuclear powerplant operators and their interface needs are not exactly the same as a corporate manager trying to make a funny joke out of "Oh, I was on mute.", but I think there is some value in atleast understanding the methodologies and formalisms. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering">Engineering rigor and systems engineering</a> approach can be applied to many other fields.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Google’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReCAPTCHA">ReCAPTCHA</a> is often the first tool that many webmasters reach for when confronted with the need to stop spam and automated malicious traffic from harming their services. In this post I explain several reasons why ReCAPTCHA is usually not the best solution to use for this purpose, as it is often unnecessary, inconveniences users, and subjects users to intensive tracking and fingerprinting that they are not able to opt-out of. Several alternative solutions to ReCAPTCHA for various threat models are presented as well as best practices for implementing captchas in general. <br></p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="436" height="119" src="https://nearcyan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/recaptcha.png" alt="" srcset="https://nearcyan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/recaptcha.png 436w, https://nearcyan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/recaptcha-300x82.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px"><figcaption>The face of evil</figcaption></figure></div>







<p>ReCAPTCHA is yet another free-of-charge product offered benevolently by Google for any webmaster to implement within their own services. How does ReCAPTCHA differentiate legitimate human users from bots? ReCAPTCHA relies extensively on user fingerprinting, putting emphasis on the question of “Which human is this user?” rather than the ordinary “Is this user human?”. It’s worth noting how much easier it is to successfully solve ReCAPTCHAs when the user is logged into their Google account, thus allowing Google to associate their actions with their real identity. A <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/9vmsyp/google_recaptchas_targeting_firefox_and_other/">similar effect</a> is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20147015">often reported</a> for users of non-Google browsers, who notice ReCAPTCHAs take more time to complete in Firefox over Chrome. This is in-line with <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-mozilla-vp-says-google-intentionally-damaged-firefox/">many other anti-competitive techniques</a> that Google has used over the years to help grow their market share.</p>



<p>Although determining
exactly how ReCAPTCHA works is very difficult, with Google not only
heavily obfuscating its JavaScript, but also implementing an entire
VM in JavaScript with its own bytecode language, there have still
been many attempts to reverse-engineer some of the client-side code,
as well as to theorize about how the server-side logic operates.
<a href="https://github.com/toogle/InsideReCaptcha">Initial attempts</a>
at reverse-engineering ReCAPTCHA show copious amounts of information
belong collected, including but not limited to: plugins, user agent,
IP address, screen resolution, execution times, timezone, language,
click/keyboard/touch information within the frame of the captcha,
test results of many browser-specific functions and CSS evaluation,
information about canvas element rendering, and cookies, including
those affiliated with your Google account that were placed within the
last 6 months.</p>



<p>There is a good reason why ReCAPTCHA uses the google.com domain instead of one specific to ReCAPTCHA. This allows Google to receive any cookies that they have already set for you, effectively bypassing restrictions on setting third party cookies and allowing traffic correlation with all of Google’s other services, which most users use. ReCAPTCHA collects enough information that it could reliably de-anonymize many users that simply wish to prove that they are Not A Robot. As JavaScript is now required to even view a ReCAPTCHA, even a user running software such as TBB (Tor Browser Bundle) may find themselves giving away more information than they intend to, for example if they have resized their browser window (which is discouraged for exactly this reason).</p>



<p>Correspondingly, webmasters that use Google’s ReCAPTCHA on their websites must link to both Google’s <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en">Privacy</a> and <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en">Terms</a> pages (included in the form by default in a small 8px style that makes them appear unclickable). Although Google used to have its own privacy and terms pages for ReCAPTCHA, these links are no longer specific to ReCAPTCHA, but rather are the privacy and terms pages for all users of Google services in general, regardless of which service is being used, or if the user has (or even wants) a Google account to begin with. Therefore accepting these terms (implicitly, by attempting to prove you are Not A Robot) grants Google permission to do <strong>everything</strong> that they do to their regular users of their services to you, and little information is available as to what specifically is done (GDPR is likely to be unhelpful here, given ReCAPTCHA’s spam-stopping purpose). Not only are the unhelpful links in the ReCAPTCHA box never opened by users, but there is also no Google logo or visual reference to indicate that ReCAPTCHA is a Google service, so many users have zero indication that they have just consented to all of Google’s tracking just because they tried to leave feedback or create a ticket on your website. If you thought you could use the Internet without using Google’s services, try using the Internet without filling out a single ReCAPTCHA, which for some users is required to pay their bills, file their taxes, and sometimes even use Government websites (if you somehow manage this, next try never sending email to Gmail/Gsuite addresses or using Google APIs for a more exciting challenge). Good luck.</p>



<p>It is worth mentioning that caring about user privacy to this extent is likely to be outside of the scope of concern for most websites. Many websites are already so tightly coupled to Google’s services (commonly including Google analytics, Google ads, Google APIs, Google tag manager, Google static resources, Google OAuth, Google Compute Engine, and many others) that the addition of a Google captcha appears negligible. With that said, different websites have different values and different users, and many do not want to require users to agree to Google’s tracking and labor for basic usage. The level of centralization that ReCAPTCHA forces is not good for anyone except Google.</p>



<p>Apart from the privacy implications of ReCAPTCHA usage, the actual captcha is very tedious for many classes of users, sometimes becoming so difficult that users find themselves unable to to complete the captcha at all. <a href="https://github.com/google/recaptcha/issues/286">Users hate ReCAPTCHA</a>. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/8yezeq/fuck_recaptcha/">They</a> <a href="https://devrant.com/rants/1754031/fuck-recaptcha-fuck-google-for-making-recaptcha-fuck-it-dont-be-evil-my-foot">really</a> <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/the-select-all-images-with-a-street-sign-recaptcha-is-a-godless-creation-of-evil.1410504/">hate</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19059390">ReCAPTCHA</a>. <a href="https://recaptcha.sucks/">ReCAPTCHA</a> <a href="https://strugee.net/blog/2019/04/make-recaptchas-im-not-a-robot-accurate">is</a> <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/recaptcha-is-uxs-worst-nightmare-c28b7341e88a">so</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/9haexn/googles_recaptcha_needs_to_be_fucking_made_illegal/">hated</a> that <a href="https://www.4chan.org/pass">some websites</a> have a profit model of charging users $20 annually to disable ReCAPTCHA, which <strong>thousands </strong>of users pay for. If this sounds like a great new business model to you and now you want to add ReCAPTCHAs to every page of your website to attempt to maximize profit, I will find you. And I will force you to complete a ReCAPTCHA every time you want food or water until you die from malnutrition after the first week. I have read countless posts from users that became so frustrated with a service that used excessive ReCAPTCHAs that they swore to never use the offending website again. These are often intelligent users with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/#version-2-are-you-a-robot">no disabilities</a> who are simply tired of being treated like dirt and wasting their time. Be kind to your users and help minimize the amount of ReCAPTCHAS that they have to solve just to be allowed to use the Internet.</p>



<p>ReCAPTCHAs become significantly more difficult if the user attempts to ‘opt-out’ of Google’s services and tracking by using software that hinders it, such as VPNs, TBB, and many anti-tracking browser addons and modifications. To demonstrate what is meant by ‘very tedious’, below is a real-time recording of myself solving a single ReCAPTCHA using TBB:</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://nearcyan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/recaptcha-1.webm"></video><figcaption>Spambots are known to give up when forced to be patient</figcaption></figure>



<p>I got lucky and only needed to complete two challenges. Sometimes there are ten or more. Watching the above video, you might think to yourself “I knew the tor network was slow, but I didn’t know it was <em>that</em> slow!”. You would be correct to take note of this discrepancy. If we open up the web developer console, we can see that the HTTP requests for new captcha images only take a few hundred milliseconds. Despite this, Google’s heavily-obfuscated JavaScript intentionally delays the appearance of the new images by several seconds every time, which I’m sure has something to do with the fact that bots give up when forced to wait, probably. This is not a nice way to treat users that don’t want to perform unpaid labor and be fingerprinted by Google. Keep in mind that the above video demonstrates one of the worst possible cases of ReCAPTCHA UX (which some <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/31088-morecaptcha/code">userscripts</a> may improve), and that the average user has a significantly quicker experience, providing that they are not attempting to thwart any of Google’s tracking and don’t make many mistakes.</p>



<p>In addition to this tediousness, the actual labor that the user is performing is directly used to benefit Google. Worry not however, as Google is eager to brag about the selfless humanitarianism that you’re engaging in by choosing ReCAPTCHA, stating the following on their main ReCAPTCHA <a href="https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/">page</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>“Hundreds of millions of captchas are solved by people every day. ReCAPTCHA makes positive use of this human effort by channeling the time spent solving captchas into digitizing text, annotating images, building machine learning datasets.”</p></blockquote>



<p>This
is certainly a very rosy way of convincing
you to feel good about forcing
your users to engage in unpaid labor that directly benefits the
world’s most powerful surveillance corporation. ReCAPTCHA
is free for a reason.</p>



<p>Lastly, ReCAPTCHA is popular. Very popular. While this brings some advantages, it also means that there’s significant efforts to break ReCAPTCHA, and those efforts all potentially affect your website, with your captcha implementation being perfectly identical to a million others. As a result of this, there have been <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/docs/asia-16/materials/asia-16-Sivakorn-Im-Not-a-Human-Breaking-the-Google-reCAPTCHA-wp.pdf">many</a> <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/wangz3/publications/ccs18.pdf">papers</a> <a href="https://uncaptcha.cs.umd.edu/papers/uncaptcha_woot17.pdf">published</a> <a href="https://github.com/ecthros/uncaptcha">that</a> <a href="https://github.com/ecthros/uncaptcha2">break</a> <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/358/6368/eaag2612">ReCAPTCHA</a> over the years, generally with Google making modifications to improve their captcha afterwards. There have also been <a href="https://2captcha.com/">paid-for</a> <a href="https://www.deathbycaptcha.com/">services</a> that use human labor to solve captchas on behalf of a paying client for less than a cent each.

<p>Before implementing a captcha, it’s worth considering if one is
necessary to begin with. To help with evaluating this proposition,
consider if your threat model is concerned over <em>customized</em> or
<em>uncustomized</em> spam. Uncustomized spam is pervasive across many

<p><span>By Grant Ainsley | Tips | [comments] | Posted &nbsp;[date]</span></p>
<hr>
<h2>The Second Edition of the 20-volume Oxford Dictionary says there are 171,476 words in use in the English language and adds there are 47,156 words considered obsolete. A vocabulary of just 3,000 words will cover 95% of the words anyone needs to use. <br></h2>

<p>I have a simple question then - why do we need to invent new words?<br></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This blog is somewhat of a rant against inventing new words and taking perfectly good longer words and coming up with shorter, catchy versions. Stop doing it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>What is a Lifehack?</h3>
<p>Have you ever wondered where new words come from? We go through life and use all the words we need in certain situations and seemingly all of a sudden, we keep seeing and hearing new words being used in place of old ones.</p>

<p>Exhibit #1 is the use of the word “hacks”. I’ve wondered for the last year where the term came from? I’ve been seeing it everywhere, including from many of my counterparts. It seemed to have replaced “tips” or “strategies”, which, by the way, are perfectly fine words and don’t need to be replaced.</p>

<p>In the past, when the term hack was used, it wasn’t good. Less skilled hockey players or golfers have been called hacks. When somebody gets “hacked” it’s not a good thing. Mind you, if “being hacked” is just an excuse to cover up some embarrassing social media behavior, then I guess it is a positive.</p>

<p>I’ve also seen the term “lifehacks” appear and although I wasn’t totally sure, it seems lifehacks are tips or strategies to make your life better in some way. I was just guessing though because I must have missed the memo explaining what lifehacks really means.</p>

<p>How do these words get suddenly appear and used? Does a group of people, like a committee, sit in a room somewhere and approve these words for general use?</p>

<h3>Wiki Wins</h3>
<p>I went to the authority on everything – Wikipedia, and got the answer.&nbsp; Here’s what Wiki says about hacks:</p>
<p><em>Life hack (or life hacking) refers to any trick, shortcut, skill, or novelty method that increases productivity and efficiency, in all walks of life. The term was primarily used by computer experts who suffer from information overload, or those with a playful curiosity in the ways they can accelerate their workflow in ways other than programming.</em></p>

<p>Wiki was good enough to even tell me how this word came into existence:</p>
<p><em>The term life hack was coined in 2004 during the O’Rieilly Emerging Technology Conference in San Diego, California by technology journalist Danny O’Brien to describe the "embarrassing" scripts and shortcuts productive IT professionals use to get their work done. After his presentation, use of the term life hack spread in the tech and blogging community.</em></p>

<p><em>The American Dialect Society voted lifehack (one word) as the runner-up for "most useful word of 2005" behind podcast. The word was also added to the Oxford Dictionaries Online in June 2011.</em></p>

<p>Excuse me? Lifehack got voted the second most useful word over a decade ago? I must have missed that story. Lifehacks in now in the Oxford Dictionary? Can I demand a recount?</p>

<h3>Evil Cousins to Real Words</h3>
<p>While I’m at it, I would like to demand people stop making up words that are abbreviations for longer words that, once again, are perfectly fine and have been used for years.</p>

<p>Apparently, you no longer make reservations at restaurants or other places. You now make “resos”.</p>
<p>You don’t order appetizers, you order “appies”</p>
<p>They are no longer called journalists because they’re now “journos”.</p>
<p>You don’t have a conversation, you have a “convo”.</p>
<p>You don’t go on a holiday anymore, you go on a “vacay”.</p>
<p>It’s no longer the May Long Weekend, it’s now “May Long”. If we wanted to be really accurate, it’s actually the Victoria Day Long weekend.</p>

<h3>Just Stop It!</h3>
<p>I know cute, shortened words and phrases are being used because the actual word is too long. Reservations, as an example, has four syllables. Have we got to the point now where we can’t use four syllable words? Does it take too long? Is this like using acronyms when you text like LOL? Is it too difficult for young people?</p>

<p>There. I’ve said it. It’s an age thing. These words are invented by younger people. I don’t want this to turn into an old guy rant, but I do wish people would stop inventing words to replace other perfectly good words I’ve used all my life.</p>

<p>It’s like going to a bakery to buy a loaf of bread and you ask for one and the clerk tells you it’s now called something else. When the hell did this happen? Who renamed it?</p>

<p>Perhaps Twitter, when you could only use 140 characters, had something to do with shorter words being used. Now that we have 280 characters on Twitter, can we go back to the full words please?</p>

<p>I’ve made a pledge never to use one of these words. Quite frankly I feel stupid just typing them.</p>

<p>Now get off my lawn!</p>

 <p>Generative Art in Go is a short eBook intended to introduce novice and experienced programmers to algorithmic art, and hopefully, get non-programmers interested in the <a href="https://golang.org/">Go programming language</a>. Unlike popular choices such as <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>, <a href="https://www.nodebox.net/">NodeBox</a>, <a href="https://openframeworks.cc/">openFrameworks</a>, etc., I picked Go for two simple reasons:</p><ul><li>Go's syntax is easy enough that virtually anyone can learn it quickly.</li><li>The language is far more versatile than what most programmers use it for.</li></ul><p>Generative art is a unique form of artistic expression, building bridges between computer programming, randomness, and visual aesthetics. It has kept my imagination for over a decade. While I have never been particularly skilled at drawing, I have always been amazed by what one could achieve with a couple of lines of code.</p><p>This book will introduce readers to graphics programming in the Go programming language context through a series of concise examples. It will also guide them in implementing their version of one of my favorite generative art sketches. As a bonus, readers will learn how to turn their command-line sketches into interactive Web applications, using <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> and Web technology's latest standards.</p><p>Happy reading!</p>

		<p>Gasoline and diesel engines, which are powered by fossil fuels, will soon be sidelined by climate change. Instead, new propulsion systems will be required. One fuel with a big potential is hydrogen. Hydrogen vehicles are equipped with a reinforced tank that is fueled at a pressure of 700 bar. This tank feeds a fuel cell, which converts the hydrogen into electricity. This in turn drives an electric motor to propels the vehicle. In the case of passenger cars, this technology is well advanced, with several hundred hydrogen-powered automobiles already in operation on German roads. At the same time, the network of hydrogen stations in Germany is projected to grow from 100 to 400 over the next three years. Yet hydrogen is not currently an option for small vehicles such as electric scooters and motorcycles, since the pressure surge during refilling would be too great. Does this effectively shut out such vehicles from hydrogen technology?</p> 
<h4><b>POWERPASTE: the hydrogen technology for small vehicles</b></h4> 
<p>Not at all! Researchers from the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Technology and Advanced Materials IFAM in Dresden have now come up with a hydrogen-based fuel that is ideal for small vehicles: POWERPASTE, which is based on solid magnesium hydride. “POWERPASTE stores hydrogen in a chemical form at room temperature and atmospheric pressure to be then released on demand,” explains Dr. Marcus Vogt, research associate at Fraunhofer IFAM. And given that POWERPASTE only begins to decompose at temperatures of around 250 °C, it remains safe even when an e-scooter stands in the baking sun for hours. Moreover, refueling is extremely simple. Instead of heading to the filling station, riders merely have to replace an empty cartridge with a new one and then refill a tank with mains water. This can be done either at home or underway.</p> 
<p>The starting material of POWERPASTE is magnesium, one of the most abundant elements and, therefore, an easily available raw material. Magnesium powder is combined with hydrogen to form magnesium hydride in a process conducted at 350 °C and five to six times atmospheric pressure. An ester and a metal salt are then added in order to form the finished product. Onboard the vehicle, the POWERPASTE is released from a cartridge by means of a plunger. When water is added from an onboard tank, the ensuing reaction generates hydrogen gas in a quantity dynamically adjusted to the actual requirements of the fuel cell. In fact, only half of the hydrogen originates from the POWERPASTE; the rest comes from the added water. “POWERPASTE thus has a huge energy storage density,” says Vogt. “It is substantially higher than that of a 700 bar high-pressure tank. And compared to batteries, it has ten times the energy storage density.” This means that POWERPASTE offers a range comparable to – or even greater than – gasoline. And it also provides a higher range than compressed hydrogen at a pressure of 700 bar.</p> 
<h4><b>Suitable for e-scooters – and other applications as well</b></h4> 
<p>With its huge energy storage density, POWERPASTE is also an interesting option for cars, delivery vehicles and range extenders in battery-powered electric vehicles. Similarly, it could also significantly extend the flight time of large drones, which would thereby be able to fly for several hours rather than a mere 20 minutes. This would be especially useful for survey work, such as the inspection of forestry or power lines. In another kind of application, campers might also use POWERPASTE in a fuel cell to generate electricity to power a coffeemaker or toaster.</p> 
<h4><b>POWERPASTE helps overcome lack of infrastructure</b></h4> 
<p>In addition to providing a high operating range, POWERPASTE has another point in its favor. Unlike gaseous hydrogen, it does not require a costly infrastructure. This makes it ideal for areas lacking such an infrastructure. In places where there are no hydrogen stations, regular filling stations could therefore sell POWERPASTE in cartridges or canisters instead. The paste is fluid and pumpable. It can therefore be supplied by a standard filling line, using relatively inexpensive equipment. Initially, filling stations could supply smaller quantities of POWERPASTE – from a metal drum, for example – and then expand in line with demand. This would require capital expenditure of several tens of thousands of euros. By way of comparison, a filling station to pump hydrogen at high pressure currently costs between one and two million euros for each fuel pump. POWERPASTE is also cheap to transport, since no costly high-pressure tanks are involved nor the use of extremely cold liquid hydrogen.</p> 
<h4><b>Pilot center planned for 2021</b></h4> 
<p>Fraunhofer IFAM is currently building a production plant for POWERPASTE at the Fraunhofer Project Center for Energy Storage and Systems ZESS. Scheduled to go into operation in 2021, this new facility will be able to produce up to four tons of POWERPASTE a year – not only for e-scooters.</p></div></div>]]>

We've also released a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/privanote-extension/bmpjebghajghighjhanphoekfenjkeao" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrome extension</a> and a <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/privanote-extension/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firefox addon</a> to help you take notes as seamlessly as possible.</p><p>With that said, let's dive into how we built this!</p><h3>Overview<a href="#overview" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>PrivaNote is a <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Next.js</a> application with <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TailwindCSS</a> to make it look pretty. The editor is a reasonably customised <a href="https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slate</a> instance. Setting up these components to play nicely is a breeze thanks to modern tooling.</p><p>Without setting up the encrypted backup PrivaNote will write to your browsers IndexedDB or LocalStorage. After setting up and initialising your Portabella configuration it will read and write from there.</p><h3>Scaffolding out application<a href="#scaffolding-out-application" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Our initialisation script looked a little like this:</p><p>We took a lot of inspiration for our editor from one of the examples the <a href="https://github.com/udecode/slate-plugins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slate-plugins</a> library provides.</p><h3>Reading/writing notes from/to IndexedDB<a href="#readingwriting-notes-fromto-indexeddb" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>After scaffolding our application we needed to ensure it's offline first. That means we should be able to use it without an internet connection and without Portabella. For this we leveraged the <a href="https://github.com/localForage/localForage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">localForage</a> library. It tries to use IndexedDB and then falls back to LocalStorage if the browser doesn't have it.</p><p>We could have written this layer ourselves but it just made sense to bring in a dependency to make sure we didn't mess anything up.</p><p>To read all of our notes it looks a bit like this:</p><p>Creating a note is as easy as:</p><p>We won't show you the delete operation because, well, you get the gist.</p><h3>Reading/writing notes from/to Portabella<a href="#readingwriting-notes-fromto-portabella" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Setting up our Portabella integration is a little trickier. We have a few additional constraints here, we need to:</p><ul><li>save Portabella config in our local database</li><li>check if they have Portabella config before falling back to the local database storage</li><li>prompt users to setup their Portabella integration (after 10 seconds to not be annoying).</li></ul><p>Let's cover reading and writing data before we get to the administrative tasks. Writing a note to Portabella leveraging the <a href="https://github.com/portabellainc/privanote" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@portabella/sdk</a> is as easy as:</p><p>Reading all our notes (when we refresh the page for example looks like):</p><p>The SDK takes care of decrypting everything for us so we don't need to worry about getting data we can't read.</p><h3>Prompting for Portabella credentials<a href="#prompting-for-portabella-credentials" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Before we can do the above operations we need to ensure we actually have Portabella config so we can initialise the SDK and make requests.</p><p>To do this we want to prompt the user to setup their integration after 10 seconds on PrivaNote. Additionally we don't want to prompt them again if they've already said yes (or no).</p><p>Our React <code>useEffect</code> hook looks a bit like this:</p><p>Doing it this way allows for a seamless end user experience.</p><h3>Packaging it as a browser extension<a href="#packaging-it-as-a-browser-extension" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The final piece of the puzzle is packaging up the Next.js application for use as a browser extension. Having to manually open privanote.xyz everytime you want to take notes is a bit cumbersome, so the idea is to override the "new tab" page of your browser. That means pressing CMD (or CTRL) + N will open up PrivaNote, allowing you to jott down thoughts without thinking twice about it.</p><p>Here's our script we used to do this:</p><p>The most interesting lines are the ones that contain <code>_next</code> and <code>next</code>. Chrome won't let browser extensions import JavaScript files that start with an underscore. So trying to add a <code>&lt;script src="/_next/a.js" /&gt;</code> tag won't work out of the box, we need to replace <code>_next</code> with <code>next</code> (or any string you prefer). The <code>sed</code> command shown here works on Mac OS but you might have to fiddle with it if you're using a different OS.</p><h3>Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Thanks for taking the time to checkout this tutorial, as we said PrivaNote is one of the first applications built on top of Portabella so we'll continue to improve documentation and APIs as we go and discover what's useful to people.</p><p>If you have any questions feel free to reach on Twitter to us <a href="https://twitter.com/portabellaio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@portabellaio</a> or via email <a href="mailto:hello@portabella.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hello@portabella.io</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h3>You founded win.rar GmbH as a student. Who or what encouraged your entrepreneurial spirit?</h3><p>We started win.rar together with my cousin Öncül Kaya during a time both of us were in the first semesters of our studies. For me it was a logical continuation of my career which had began as a coach and manager at a small basketball club in Germany. I had been actively promoting our club and already at the age of 17 I was actively doing all classical work in marketing and PR. After finishing school which is 13 years in Germany plus an extra year in USA and the mandatory military or civil service I did a two year training to become a banker. That makes a total education of 17 years. Following banking I worked part-time in a company that was consulting banks on IT projects and then I moved into a company that was a local internet service provider (ISP) and Software Development company. As Marketing Assistant and later Marketing Manager, one of my tasks there was to create business around WinRAR which the company was distributing in Germany and USA.</p><p>After leaving the company I was approached by Ron Dwight the publisher of WinRAR and asked if we would like to sell WinRAR in Germany.</p><p>I thought that it would be wrong to engage in a business which would be in direct competition to my former employer and so we tried to build an international business around WinRAR aimed at consulting Ron Dwight on how to improve WinRAR, the distribution network and the brand of the product.</p><p>It was intended to generate us a little side income until the end of university.</p><p>We basically had two underlying ideas for starting our own company rather than just acting as employees or contractors:</p><p>A) We wanted to have an official business structure with a GmbH which is German for limited liability company. However the GmbH back then required a minimum capital of 25’000 Euros, so it enjoyed the respect of people since not every entrepreneur is able to put that kind of money into a bank account and is willing to risk it.</p><p>We were able to convince my father to loan the money and agreed internally not to touch the money except for paying the expenses related to registering a company. &nbsp;</p><p>That way we were planning to be able to act as &nbsp;respected entrepreneurs without risking not being able to pay back what we owed my father.</p><p>B) We wanted to prepare a future brand-transfer by putting a well recognized name on our business that everybody would know and which would give us credibility in the future in case we would move away from WinRAR.</p><p>So I asked Ron Dwight if he would allow us to call the company win.rar GmbH. He agreed with a sentence I never forgot:</p><blockquote><p>“Of course you can use the brand for your company. It will make sure you commit yourself 100% to WinRAR because you would not be able to conduct any other business under that company name.”</p></blockquote><p>It was a price we are very willing to pay. We did not have much to lose and we had a feeling that if we did our job well for a couple of years (until we are done with our studies and could commit full-time), we could convince Ron to retire and have us continue the business for him.</p><p>So to sum it up, we were young and went for an opportunity that we believed was going to fund our expenses while going to school and we felt we had an opportunity to create our own work-place when done. The costs and risks seemed very low compared to the outlook it gave us.</p><h3>Was anyone mentoring you at the very beginning of your career?</h3><p>It depends on when you define the beginning of my career. Prior to starting with win.rar I did a two year training program with the Deutsche Bank, where all we did was being monitored and coached. It was an incredible schooling or mentoring experience in all areas of business. Before I was very lucky to have very good teachers when going to school. Especially in Mathematics I was always challenged by a long line of great teachers. The same is true for my language teachers. It was only much later that I realized how valuable the lessons were that I was taught in school. After the training and before starting with WinRAR I was lucky to have Andreas Messer teach me the tricks of the trade in the consulting business. Then during the founding period I was lucky to consider Ron Dwight as a mentor. He was always happy to answer any questions I had. However after he passed away I did not have additional help except from our peers.</p><h3>What was the initial idea of win.rar GmbH? Was it difficult for it to make a success?</h3><p>In addition to the above, the basic instrument to build was a multi-lingual website. Since at that time I more or less spoke five languages, we built a simple site in English, German, Turkish, French and Spanish. I had managed to buy <a href="http://www.win-rar.com/">www.win-rar.com</a> for approximately 500 Euros from a domain-grabber and with the contract that allowed us to sell WinRAR we had put together five &nbsp;puzzle pieces:</p><ol><li>Distribution rights to a Product</li><li>A website containing the product name</li><li>A company name containing the product name</li><li>A website with an international appearance &nbsp;around the product</li><li>The necessary infrastructure (registered company and bank account) to be able to conduct business</li></ol><p>I would love to say that it was very difficult, but we were surprised by how easy it was. A couple of days after we had put the website online, we already received a fax with the first order. &nbsp;The next day the second fax came in. It felt like we had struck a mine on the first try, but what followed was more than anything we had imagined.</p><h3>What was going on with your job after Ron Dwight passed away?</h3><p>Things happened extremely fast around Easter in 2002. This is just weeks after starting the company on 20.02.2002. Ron passed away hours after explaining to me how we need to operate his platform in order to create license keys for the first two orders we had received. So basically we had only successfully created a single user license and one multi-user license when our entire business structure faced potentially becoming obsolete.</p><p>We had no idea who would follow Ron. We had no idea if that person or organisation would respect the agreements we had made with Ron, some of which had been verbal. We had no idea how we would be able to provide the product to our customers if his platform should stop working. So basically I was not only very sad about having lost a respected business partner and mentor but I was also afraid that everything we had built could become obsolete.</p><p>So we made a decision to deviate from our plan to not touch any of the money and instead use whatever we need to fly to the funeral, talk to the family and find out if there is any opportunity to continue our business. We had a head-start over anybody else including the developers around WinRAR because -as I only found out later- I was the person most involved with Ron. In order to set up everything I had pretty much been calling him on a weekly basis for months and when he passed away, his girlfriend did not know who else to call but me, so it was up to me to inform Ron’s business partners about his death.</p><p>So after booking the flight I asked some former colleagues for an emergency meeting and we mapped out a concept based on the limited knowledge we had. We agreed that they would try to develop a system to handle orders while I talk to the family and we would offer them to continue the business.</p><p>However the family was not interested in getting involved. We were able to make a deal with the creditors, with the distributors and developers and Ron’s family which made everybody happy but meant a load of work for us since it meant us being the future exclusive publisher of WinRAR taking over a business which we had only very limited knowledge of.</p><p>I quickly realized that I could not go on with school, but the healthy business we had been able to quickly create from almost nothing in just a few weeks allowed us to pay back my father and was so much more interesting than school that it was fun to spend around 100 hours per week on building win.rar to what it is now.</p><h3>Does WinRAR make life easier?</h3><p>I absolutely believe so. It was one of the reasons we got involved with it. We feel that it is a useful tool for people who either have limited bandwidth or limited storage. While today such restrictions are no longer the main reason for use of WinRAR, we still offer the most convenient way of sharing files and folders and enhance that service with safe encryption, repair functions and other features that allow ease of use when it comes to archiving your data.</p><p>Surely there are thousands of ways today to handle data, but if you are concerned about privacy and reliability, we feel confident to say that there is still no better way than using WinRAR to maintain your own data on your own system.</p><h3>There are a lot of jokes online about the WinRAR never ending trial period. What is your favorite joke about WinRAR? Do you have your own?</h3><p>Actually there are so many, it is hard to only chose one. Here is a selection:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/en.split-techcity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/02/winrar-meme-1024x646.jpg?resize=640%2C403" alt="winrar-meme" width="640" height="403" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/en.split-techcity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/02/winrarmeme.jpg?resize=640%2C967" alt="winrarmeme" width="640" height="967" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/en.split-techcity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/02/winrarmeme.jpg?w=650&amp;ssl=1 650w, https://i1.wp.com/en.split-techcity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/02/winrarmeme.jpg?resize=66%2C100&amp;ssl=1 66w, https://i1.wp.com/en.split-techcity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/02/winrarmeme.jpg?resize=132%2C200&amp;ssl=1 132w, https://i1.wp.com/en.split-techcity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/02/winrarmeme.jpg?resize=106%2C160&amp;ssl=1 106w, https://i1.wp.com/en.split-techcity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/02/winrarmeme.jpg?resize=212%2C320&amp;ssl=1 212w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lX_pF03vCSU" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p><p>Our own jokes do not come close to these I think. But we would like to ask the community of crackers:</p><blockquote><p>“Why do you bother creating a cracked version of WinRAR? The trial period never ends…thank you very much for the free marketing you gave us. We will be forever grateful!”</p></blockquote><h3>There are only five people in your company. How did that make life different for you? Would you ever scale up?</h3><p>That is a tough one to answer. It will surely depend on the project. Having only few people around you has a lot of advantages. The biggest maybe is having to constantly prioritize and focus on the immediate needs. It keeps the management and the company very centered. Any new project may require more man-power and there is no reason to not scale up when the business/project appears to be very profitable. But we believe that just employing people for the sake of growing is not the way. We like to see it the other way. Do things manually first but then immediately decide if it is possible to cut repetitions and program to make things easier. If it makes money and there …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



<p>This appendix serves as a cheat sheet for linear algebra. The subject is presented as a set of tools, their properties, and what you can use them for. If you’re interested in the theory behind all this, you can pick up any introductory linear algebra textbook.</p>
<p>The focus is exclusively 2D and 3D algebra, as that’s what’s required in this book.</p>
<h2 id="points"><a href="#points">Points</a></h2>
<p>A <em>point</em> represents a position within a coordinate system.</p>
<p>We represent a point as a sequence of numbers between parentheses—for example, <span>\((4, 3)\)</span>. We refer to points using capital letters, such as <span>\(P\)</span> or <span>\(Q\)</span>.</p>
<p>Each of the numbers in the point’s sequence is called a <em>coordinate</em>. The number of coordinates is the point’s <em>dimension</em>. A point with two coordinates is called a two-dimensional, or 2D, point.</p>
<p>The order of the numbers is important; <span>\((4, 3)\)</span> is not the same as <span>\((3, 4)\)</span>. By convention, the coordinates are called <span>\(x\)</span> and <span>\(y\)</span> in 2D, and <span>\(x\)</span>, <span>\(y\)</span>, and <span>\(z\)</span> in 3D; so the point <span>\((4, 3)\)</span> has an <span>\(x\)</span> coordinate of <span>\(4\)</span>, and a <span>\(y\)</span> coordinate of <span>\(3\)</span>. Figure&nbsp;A-1 shows <span>\(P\)</span>, a 2D point with coordinates <span>\((4, 3)\)</span>.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Figure A-1: The 2D point P has coordinates (4, 3)." src="https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/images/aa-points.png"><figcaption>Figure A-1: The 2D point <em>P</em> has coordinates (4, 3).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We can also refer to specific coordinates of a point using a subscript, like <span>\(P_x\)</span> or <span>\(Q_y\)</span>. So the point <span>\(P\)</span> can also be written as <span>\((P_x, P_y, P_z)\)</span> when convenient.</p>
<h2 id="vectors"><a href="#vectors">Vectors</a></h2>
<p>A <em>vector</em> represents the difference between two points. Intuitively, imagine a vector as an arrow that connects a point to another point; alternatively, think of it as the instructions to get from one point to another.</p>
<h3 id="representing-vectors"><a href="#representing-vectors">Representing Vectors</a></h3>
<p>We represent a vector as a set of numbers between parentheses, and refer to them using a capital letter. This is the same representation we use for points, so we add a small arrow on top to remember they’re vectors and not points. For example, <span>\((2, 1)\)</span> is a vector, which we might decide to call <span>\(\vec{A}\)</span>. Figure&nbsp;A-2 shows two equal vectors, <span>\(\vec{A}\)</span> and <span>\(\vec{B}\)</span>.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Figure A-2: The vectors \vec{A} and \vec{B} are equal. Vectors don’t have a position." src="https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/images/aa-vectors.png"><figcaption>Figure A-2: The vectors <span>\(\vec{A}\)</span> and <span>\(\vec{B}\)</span> are equal. Vectors don’t have a position.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Despite sharing their representation with points, vectors don’t represent or have a position; they are, after all, the <em>difference</em> between two positions. When you have a diagram like Figure&nbsp;A-2, you have to draw vectors somewhere; but the vectors <span>\(\vec{A}\)</span> and <span>\(\vec{B}\)</span> are equal, because they represent the same displacement.</p>
<p>In addition, the point <span>\((2, 1)\)</span> and the vector <span>\((2, 1)\)</span> are unrelated. Sure, the vector <span>\((2, 1)\)</span> goes from <span>\((0, 0)\)</span> to <span>\((2, 1)\)</span>, but it’s equally true that it goes from, say, <span>\((5, 5)\)</span> to <span>\((7, 6)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Vectors are characterized by their <em>direction</em> (the angle in which they point) and their <em>magnitude</em> (how long they are).</p>
<p>The direction can be further decomposed into <em>orientation</em> (the slope of the line they’re on) and <em>sense</em> (which of the possible two ways along that line they point). For example, a vector pointing right and a vector pointing left both have the same horizontal orientation, but they have the opposite sense. However, we rarely make this distinction throughout the book.</p>
<h3 id="vector-magnitude"><a href="#vector-magnitude">Vector Magnitude</a></h3>
<p>You can compute the magnitude of a vector from its coordinates. The magnitude is also called the <em>length</em> or <em>norm</em> of the vector. It’s denoted by putting the vector between vertical pipes, as in <span>\(|\vec{V}|\)</span>, and it’s computed as follows:</p>
<p><span>\[|\vec{V}| = \sqrt{{V_x}^2 + {V_y}^2 + {V_z}^2}\]</span></p>
<p>A vector with a magnitude equal to <span>\(1.0\)</span> is called a <em>unit vector</em>.</p>
<h2 id="point-and-vector-operations"><a href="#point-and-vector-operations">Point and Vector Operations</a></h2>
<p>Now that we’ve defined points and vectors, let’s explore what we can do with them.</p>
<h3 id="subtracting-points"><a href="#subtracting-points">Subtracting Points</a></h3>
<p>A vector is the difference between two points. In other words, you can subtract two points and get a vector:</p>
<p><span>\[\vec{V} = P - Q\]</span></p>
<p>In this case you can think of <span>\(\vec{V}\)</span> as “going” from <span>\(Q\)</span> to <span>\(P\)</span>, as in Figure&nbsp;A-3.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Figure A-3: The vector \vec{V} is the difference between P and Q." src="https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/images/aa-point-diff.png"><figcaption>Figure A-3: The vector <span>\(\vec{V}\)</span> is the difference between <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Algebraically, you subtract each of the coordinates separately:</p>
<p><span>\[(V_x, V_y, V_z) = (P_x, P_y, P_z) - (Q_x, Q_y, Q_z) = (P_x - Q_x, P_y - Q_y, P_z - Q_z)\]</span></p>
<h3 id="adding-a-point-and-a-vector"><a href="#adding-a-point-and-a-vector">Adding a Point and a Vector</a></h3>
<p>We can rewrite the equation above coordinate by coordinate:</p>
<p><span>\[V_x = P_x - Q_x\]</span> <span>\[V_y = P_y - Q_y\]</span> <span>\[V_z = P_z - Q_z\]</span></p>
<p>These are just numbers, so all the usual rules apply. This means you can do this:</p>
<p><span>\[Q_x + V_x = P_x\]</span> <span>\[Q_y + V_y = P_y\]</span> <span>\[Q_z + V_z = P_z\]</span></p>
<p>And grouping the coordinates again,</p>
<p><span>\[Q + \vec{V} = P\]</span></p>
<p>In other words, you can add a vector to a point and get a new point. This makes intuitive and geometric sense; given a starting position (a point) and a displacement (a vector), you end up in a new position (another point). Figure&nbsp;A-4 presents an example.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Figure A-4: Adding \vec{V} to Q gives us P." src="https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/images/aa-point-plus-vector.png"><figcaption>Figure A-4: Adding <span>\(\vec{V}\)</span> to <em>Q</em> gives us <em>P</em>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="adding-vectors"><a href="#adding-vectors">Adding Vectors</a></h3>
<p>You can add two vectors. Geometrically, imagine putting one vector “after” another, as in Figure&nbsp;A-5.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Figure A-5: Adding two vectors. Addition is commutative. Remember, vectors don’t have a position." src="https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/images/aa-vector-plus-vector.png"><figcaption>Figure A-5: Adding two vectors. Addition is commutative. Remember, vectors don’t have a position.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As you can see, vector addition is commutative—that is, the order of the operands doesn’t matter. In the diagram, <span>\(\vec{V} + \vec{W} = \vec{W} + \vec{V}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Algebraically, you add the coordinates individually:</p>
<p><span>\[\vec{V} + \vec{W} = (V_x, V_y, V_z) + (W_x, W_y, W_z) = (V_x + W_x, V_y + W_y, V_z + W_z)\]</span></p>
<h3 id="multiplying-a-vector-by-a-number"><a href="#multiplying-a-vector-by-a-number">Multiplying a Vector by a Number</a></h3>
<p>You can multiply a vector by a number. This is called the <em>scalar product</em>. This makes the vector shorter or longer, as you can see in Figure&nbsp;A-6.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Figure A-6: Multiplying a vector by a number" src="https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/images/aa-vector-scaling.png"><figcaption>Figure A-6: Multiplying a vector by a number</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If the number is negative, the vector will point the other way; this means it changes its sense, and therefore its direction. But multiplying a vector by a number never changes its orientation—that is, it will remain along the same line.</p>
<p>Algebraically, you multiply the coordinates individually:</p>
<p><span>\[k \cdot \vec{V} = k \cdot (V_x, V_y, V_z) = (k \cdot V_x, k \cdot V_y, k \cdot V_z)\]</span></p>
<p>You can also divide a vector by a number. Just like with numbers, dividing by <span>\(k\)</span> is equivalent to multiplying by <span>\(\frac{1}{k}\)</span>. As usual, division by zero doesn’t work.</p>
<p>One of the applications of vector multiplication and division is to <em>normalize</em> a vector—that is, to turn it into a unit vector. This changes the magnitude of the vector to <span>\(1.0\)</span>, but doesn’t change its other properties. To do this, we just need to divide the vector by its length:</p>
<p><span>\[\vec{V_{normalized}} = \frac{\vec{V}}{|\vec{V}|}\]</span></p>
<h3 id="multiplying-vectors"><a href="#multiplying-vectors">Multiplying Vectors</a></h3>
<p>You can multiply a vector by another vector. Interestingly, there are many ways in which you can define an operation like this. We’re going to focus on two kinds of multiplication that are useful to us: the dot product and the cross product.</p>
<h4 id="dot-product"><a href="#dot-product">Dot Product</a></h4>
<p>The <em>dot product</em> between two vectors (also called the <em>inner product</em>) gives you a number. It’s expressed using the dot operator, as in <span>\(\vec{V} \cdot \vec{W}\)</span>. It’s also written between angle braces, as in <span>\(\langle \vec{V}, \vec{W} \rangle\)</span>.</p>
<p>Algebraically, you multiply the coordinates individually and add them up:</p>
<p><span>\[\langle \vec{V}, \vec{W} \rangle = \langle(V_x, V_y, V_z), (W_x, W_y, W_z)\rangle = V_x \cdot W_x + V_y \cdot W_y + V_z \cdot W_z\]</span></p>
<p>Geometrically, the dot product of <span>\(\vec{V}\)</span> and <span>\(\vec{W}\)</span> is related to their lengths, and to the angle <span>\(\alpha\)</span> between them. The exact formula neatly ties together linear algebra and trigonometry:</p>
<p><span>\[\langle \vec{V}, \vec{W} \rangle = |\vec{V}| \cdot |\vec{W}| \cdot cos(\alpha)\]</span></p>
<p>Either of these formulas help us see that the dot product is commutative (that is, <span>\(\langle \vec{V}, \vec{W} \rangle\)</span> = <span>\(\langle \vec{W}, \vec{V} \rangle\)</span>), and that it’s distributive with respect to a scalar product (that is, $k ,  = k ,  $).</p>
<p>An interesting consequence of the second formula is that if <span>\(\vec{V}\)</span> and <span>\(\vec{W}\)</span> are perpendicular, then <span>\(cos(\alpha) = 0\)</span>, and therefore <span>\(\langle \vec{V}, \vec{W} \rangle\)</span> is also zero. If <span>\(\vec{V}\)</span> and <span>\(\vec{W}\)</span> are unit vectors, then <span>\(\langle \vec{V}, \vec{W} \rangle\)</span> is always between <span>\(-1.0\)</span> and <span>\(1.0\)</span>, with <span>\(1.0\)</span> meaning they’re equal and <span>\(-1.0\)</span> meaning they’re opposite.</p>
<p>The second formula also suggests the dot product can be used to calculate the angle between two vectors:</p>
<p><span>\[\alpha = cos^{-1} \left( \frac{\langle \vec{V}, \vec{W} \rangle}{|\vec{V}| \cdot |\vec{W}|} \right)\]</span></p>
<p>Note that the dot product of a vector with itself, <span>\(\langle \vec{V}, \vec{V} \rangle\)</span>, reduces to the square of its length:</p>
<p><span>\[\langle \vec{V}, \vec{V} \rangle = {V_x}^2 + {V_y}^2 + {V_z}^2 = {|\vec{V}|}^2\]</span></p>
<p>This suggests another way to compute the length of a vector, as the square root of its dot product with itself:</p>
<p><span>\[|\vec{V}| = \sqrt{\langle \vec{V}, \vec{V} \rangle}\]</span></p>
<h4 id="cross-product"><a href="#cross-product">Cross Product</a></h4>
<p>The cross product between two vectors gives you another vector. It’s expressed using the cross operator, as in <span>\(\vec{V} \times \vec{W}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The cross product of two vectors is a vector perpendicular to both of them. In this book we only use the cross product on 3D vectors, shown in Figure&nbsp;A-7.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Figure A-7: The cross product of two vectors is a vector perpendicular to both of them." src="https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/images/aa-vector-cross-product.png"><figcaption>Figure A-7: The cross product of two vectors is a vector perpendicular to both of them.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The computation is a bit more involved than the dot product. If <span>\(\vec{R} = \vec{V} \times \vec{W}\)</span>, then</p>
<p><span>\[R_x = V_y \cdot W_z - V_z \cdot W_y\]</span> <span>\[R_y = V_x \cdot W_z - V_z \cdot W_x\]</span> <span>\[R_z = V_x \cdot W_y - V_y \cdot W_x\]</span></p>
<p>The cross product is not commutative. Specifically, <span>\(\vec{V} \times \vec{W} = -(\vec{W} \times \vec{V})\)</span>.</p>
<p>We use the cross product to compute the <em>normal vector</em> of a surface—that is, a unit vector perpendicular to the surface. To do this, we take two vectors on the surface, calculate their cross product, and normalize the result.</p>
<h2 id="matrices"><a href="#matrices">Matrices</a></h2>
<p>A <em>matrix</em> is a rectangular array of numbers. For the purposes of this book, matrices represent <em>transformations</em> that can be applied to points or vectors, and we refer to them with a capital letter, such as <span>\(M\)</span>. This is the same way we refer to points, but it will be clear by the context whether we’re talking about a matrix or a point.</p>
<p>A matrix is characterized by its size in terms of rows and columns. For example, this is a <span>\(4 \times 3\)</span> matrix:</p></div></div>

		<p><b>Abstract.</b> I extended the <a href="https://pkhungurn.github.io/talking-head-anime/">animation-from-a-single-image neural network system I created in 2019</a> so that the characters can make more types of facial expressions. While the old system can only open/close the eyes and the mouth, this new version affords more eye/mouth shapes and can control the eyebrows and the irises. They allow a character to show various emotions and give more convincing impression of speech.</p>

		<h2>1 &nbsp; Motivation</h2>		

		<p>With the goal of making it easier to become a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_YouTuber">virtual YouTuber</a> (VTuber), in 2019, I created a <a href="https://pkhungurn.github.io/talking-head-anime">neural network system</a> that can animate the face of any existing anime character, given only an image of it. The system, however, cannot yet be considered practical for becoming a VTuber. The most important shortcoming is that it can only close the eyes and mouth, robbing the character the ability to make most facial expressions. Characters used by professional VTubers, on the other hand, can deform the eyebrows, eyelids, irises, and mouth into various shapes. My goal in this article is to improve my system's expressiveness by increasing the types of movements it can produce.</p>

		<h2>2 &nbsp; Summary of Approach</h2>

		<p>My neural network system takes two inputs. First is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_shot">head shot</a> of a character looking straight at the viewer, and second is a six-dimensional <i>pose vector</i> that specifies the pose the user wants the character to take. It outputs another image of the same character taking the specified pose. By varying the pose vector over time, the character can be animated. It can perform six types of movements because the pose vector is six-dimensional. However, excluding rotating the face, it can only closes its eyes and mouth.</p>

		<p>The system poses a given character in two steps, each carried out by its own separate subnetwork. The <i>face morpher</i> closes the eyes and the mouth, and the <i>face rotator</i> rotates the face.</p>

	                </td>
	            </tr>
	        </tbody></table>
	    

	    <p>To increase types of movement, I started by preparing larger datasets. From the <a href="https://pkhungun.github.io/talking-head-anime/index.html#dataset">collection of approximately 8,000 3D models</a> I collected for my last system, I identified 39 common movements of facial parts and generated new datasets containing them. (You can see the list of movements <a href="https://pkhungurn.github.io/talking-head-anime-2/full.html#face-params">here</a>.) The movements encompass all the four movable facial features (eyebrows, eyelids, irises, and mouth) that can be observed in industrial characters. The size of the pose vector increased from 6 to 42 as a result <a href="#fn_pose_vector_length">[footnote]</a>.</p>

	    

	    <p>To deal with larger pose vectors, I propose a new architecture for the face morpher network, the overview of which is depicted in Figure 2.2.</p>

	            </tr>
	        </tbody></table>
	    

	    <p>The new face morpher has two subnetworks: the <b>eyebrow morpher</b> and the <b>eye &amp; mouth morpher</b>, with each network deforming the organ(s) in its name. The pose vector is divided into parts that can be fed into the relevant subnetworks.</p>

	    <h3>2.1 &nbsp; Eyebrow Morpher</h3>

	    <p>The eyebrow morpher first segments out the eyebrows with a dedicated subnetwork called the <b>eyebrow segmenter</b>. It then uses another subnetwork called the <b>eyebrow warper</b> to deform eyebrow and then composite the result back to the original image.</p>

	    <table>
	            <tbody><tr>

	    <p>The two networks have similar structures. It contains an encoder-decoder network that turns the input image(s) and the (optional) pose vector into an intermediate feature representation, which is then used to perform several image manipulation steps. I employ three types of image manipulation, each encapsulated into a reusable neural network unit.

	    </p><ol>
	    	<li><b>Partial image change</b>. The feature tensor is used to produce an alpha mask and another image that represents changes to the original image. The mask and the change image are then used to perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_compositing">alpha blending</a> with the input image to partially modify it. I take this step from the ECCV 2018 paper by Pumarola et al., which successfully applies it to alter facial expressions in human photos <a href="#fn_pumarola_2018">[2018]</a>.</li>

	    	<li><b>Combining</b>. The feature tensor is used to produce an alpha mask, which is then used to combine two images through alpha blending.</li>

	    	<li><b>Warping.</b> The feature tensor is transformed into an <b>appearance flow</b>, a map which tells, for each pixel of the output, which input image pixel to copy from <a href="#fn_zhou_2016">[Zhou et al. 2016]</a>. The appearance flow is then used to warp another image as it tells where each pixel should be moved to.</li>
	    </ol>
	    
	    

	   	<p>The eyebrow segmenter does its job with two partial image changes. The eyebrow warper deforms the extracted eyebrows with a warp and a partial image change. It then combines them back to the face image. Their architectures are given in Figure 2.4 and 2.5.</p>

			<b>Figure 2.5</b> Architecture of the eyebrow warper.
		</p>

		<p>During research, I discovered that it was very important to process the eyebrows separately from other facial features. Network architectures that used the same network to morph all facial features blurred the eyebrows after morphing them. By having separate networks morph the eyebrows after segmenting them out, I introduced a strong bias to preserve the eyebrow pixels, yielding crisp results.</p>

		<h3>2.2 &nbsp; Eye &amp; Mouth Morpher</h3>

	    <p>The eye &amp; mouth morpher has a similar architecture to the previous two networks. After passing the input image (the output of the eyebrow morpher) and the relevant part of the pose vector to an encoder-decoder network, it performs the following image manipulation steps:
		</p><ol>
			<li>a warp to deform the mouth and the irises,</li>
			<li>a partial image change to retouch the output of the last step, and</li>
			<li>another partial image change to deform the eyelids.</li>
		</ol>

			<b>Figure 2.7</b> Architecture of the eye &amp; mouth morpher.
		</p>

		<p>The above rather complicated process was a result of my iterating on the architecture. The first warping step is required to preserve high-frequency details of the irises. If partial image change were used, iris patterns drawn by artists would be lost.</p>

		</p>
	
		

		<p>The last step is necessary to produce artifact-free closed eyelids. If I were to deform the eyelids together with other facial features, they would be covered by the first warping step. I discovered that this led to small lines near the eyes being smeared, and the eyelids would be blemished as a result.</p>

		
		<p><b>Figure 2.9</b> The effect of processing the eyelids with a partial image change in a separate step. Notice the blemish produced by the architecture with warping. It is the result of the network's dragging the eyelid down and thereby smearing the small line inside the ground truth's red box. My proposed architecture simply fills the space with a solid color, yielding an artifact-free image.

		<h2>3 &nbsp; Results</h2>

		<p>I applied my system to 200 images of VTubers and related characters to generate a short video clip for each, and I put all the videos together in the <a href="#eyecatcher">eyecatcher</a>. You can watch the individual videos in the figure below.</p>

		<p>Below is a selection of characters making the 7 facial expressions shown at the beginning of the article.</p>
	</div><div>

		<p>The above figure demonstrates the versatility of my system. It could handle both male and female characters with very different eye and face shapes. It sensibly deformed the eyes even when partially occluded by hair or seen through translucent glasses. It hallucinates plausible mouth shapes in cases where the input image has a closed mouth while my previous system would just leave the mouth as is.</p>

		<p>Another strengths of my system is its flexibility: I can combine it with any source of pose parameters. I thus use it to create a number of content creation tools and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidding">fanvids</a>.</p>

		<p>First, I created a desktop application that allows the user to manipulate an anime character's facial expression and face rotation by dragging sliders. The resulting image can be saved for later use.</p>

		</p>

		<p>Second, I wrote a program that converts motions authored for 3D models into sequences to pose parameters, allowing me use them to drive 2D character illustrations. With this tool, I created 4 music videos.</p>

		<p>Yesterday, I accidentally built a chat app. Surprisingly, it wasn't the first time it happened.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/chat/colors.jpeg" alt="colored chat screenshot"></p>
<p>Before I tell you how Hackernews turned (this blog's) <a href="https://blog.repl.it/__logs">HTTP logs</a> into chat, let me tell you about how a 12-year old user hacked the first chat app and community space on Replit right into a Python REPL.</p>
<p>In 2018 we didn't know we had such a strong community of tinkerers. We knew people make games with Replit and share it with other people. But we didn't realize we'd already been a Schelling point for young hackers. </p>
<p>One day, <a href="https://repl.it/@pyelias">@pyelias</a> created a post on our support forum saying he built a Chatroom and linked to a repl. I thought it would be a simple chatbot or something similar because I hadn't seen internet-based apps on the platform until that point. We had just opened up <a href="https://blog.repl.it/internet-access">internet access</a> to everyone, but we didn't support web hosting or any advanced features Replit has today. It was a very constrained environment.</p>
<p>When I opened up Pyelias' Chatroom, I saw a vibrant community. It was mindblowing. It was like suddenly discovering the chair you'd been sitting on was made of gold. The community was not only fun, but it was also helpful, wholesome, and inviting.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/chat/chatroom.png" alt="chatroom screenshot"></p>
<p>The way the Chatroom worked: the repl acted as a terminal client. When you run the code, it connected to a remote database and pulled for the latest messages. The entire application logic was on the client. Over the next few days, I saw rapid iteration. It went from a simple Chatroom to something like IRC. It had rooms, private messages, colors, muting, and because it's on top of the Python repl, it also had support for inline code evaluation. </p>
<p>As the room grew, it naturally had problems with spam and bad actors. So it grew moderation features, filters, etc. Other users started contributing ideas and ways to improve it. It was magnificent and a model for making Replit a magical place for serendipitous computer explorations. </p>
<p>From there, we grew our community features, and today we have a fantastic <a href="https://repl.it/talk">forum</a> where people share apps and find other people to work with. In a future post, I'll tell how they built a fully programmable "Stonk" market. </p>
<h2 id="hackernews-chats-in-http-logs">Hackernews chats in http logs</h2>
<p>In our blog's <a href="https://repl.it/@util/replit-blog#posts/internet-of-fun.md">repl</a> (where the app is hosted), I was writing something when I saw the HTTP logs in the console accelerate. For some reason, I knew it was hackernews, so I went there and saw <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25991988">the post</a> on the front page. I commented on it, saying that people can see the log stream by going to <a href="https://blog.repl.it/__logs">https://blog.repl.it/__logs</a></p>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25993765">andrewxhonson on Hackernews</a> visited the logs and saw an opportunity to chat. Because the blog was logging all the GET requests, you can effectively send "messages" to the logs by going to a path on the website (even if it doesn't exist). So for example, <code>https://blog.repl.it/hi%20my%20name%20is%20fred</code> resulted in a <code>GET hello my name is fred</code> log message. Now you have a streaming website that anyone can drop messages into -- i.e., a chat room!</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hackernews found our blog logs and are new chatting in the HTTP requests. <a href="https://t.co/jYgwmMJRDP">https://t.co/jYgwmMJRDP</a> <a href="https://t.co/OkujyM8s3N">pic.twitter.com/OkujyM8s3N</a></p>— Amjad Masad (@amasad) <a href="https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1356344510465286144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 1, 2021</a></blockquote> 

<p>I tweeted about it, and someone posted it on HN as a separate post, so it started growing. At first, people couldn't tell that Replit logs is a terminal complete with support for ANSI escape codes. I dropped that hint on HN comment, and they were off to the races. </p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/chat/colors.jpeg" alt="colored chat screenshot"></p>
<p>However, if you don't send an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code">ANSI reset</a> after your message, you're styling all the subsequent messages in the stream. I fixed that by adding a reset before each log message. I was coding live, so when I restarted the app, it broke and logged the syntax error to the console, which is actually the chatroom, and my users saw it. Not only do I have users on my accidental chatroom, they're also watching me work live and seeing my embarrassingly sloppy code (incidentally, that's why I love repl-driven coding you see the mistakes you make live and fix them quickly).</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/chat/chat_style.png" alt="colored chat screenshot"></p>
<p>Yesterday, I had many meetings (I don't code full-time anymore, sadly) so I had to fix the Chatroom (I mean blog logs lol) incrementally between calls. Naturally, with growth came the bad actors. Someone started posting 10s of thousands of messages and spamming the chat. My first reaction was: "wow it's amazing how resilient this webserver hosted on a single container!" Then I thought about implementing rate-limiting and profanity filters. However, I had a meeting in the next 5 minutes. Instead, I put Cloudflare in front of the blog, and with a couple of firewall rules, the blocking started! </p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/chat/blocking.png" alt="colored chat screenshot"></p>
<p>Finally, before the day was over, I noticed that a <a href="https://repl.it/@ConnorBrewster/blog-chat">handful</a> of <a href="http://repl.chat/">clients</a> for the chat has emerged, and things thing has a life of their own. </p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/chat/client.png" alt="cloudflare rate limiting"></p>
<p>Even as I'm writing this post in the repl, I can see the chat continue. There are now JSON messages and some weird protocol that's going on. Are people building apps on it? I'm sure that will happen before the end of the week. After all, it's a full terminal, and you can make entire UIs on it. </p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/chat/more.jpeg" alt="json messages"></p>
<p>I'm writing this story because we want to show the world that computers &amp; the internet are still fun. Hacking, tinkering, and weird experiments continue to happen on platforms like Replit. Because every repl on Replit is a full computer that comes with access to the network, a database, storage, and access to its code, user profiles, and other primitives, it makes it inherently amenable to serendipity and accidental software interactions. </p>
<p>I invite everyone to <a href="https://repl.it/">sign up</a> and check out our <a href="https://repl.it/talk">community</a> and see what fun, weird things people are <a href="https://repl.it/talk/share">building</a>. Even if you're not interested in Replit the "online IDE" you might find that Replit, the "weird internet computer" will make you giddy programming (again).</p>

<p><strong>1. Close your business while it’s working</strong></p>

<p>I opened my first business right out of high school. I had a few thousand dollars saved up and I wanted to start a business. I found a tiny office space on a busy road and shook hands with the landlord. My Dad helped me make a sign using a piece of wood and a vinyl sticker. I purchased two computer systems and set them up on folding tables. I purchased a desk and a chair and put those in the back of my space, like a small used car salesman. Suddenly, I was selling custom built computer systems using off the shelf parts.</p>

<p>A few months later I got a call from my high school. I told the caller what I was up to and he informed me that the school would receive a small grant because I was working in the industry I had aspired to less than a year after graduation.</p>

<p>Then, I fell in love. No, that’s not right, I was in love before I had even started this. But, the conversation had turned to marriage and children. The business was working okay, but I didn’t think I was doing well enough to support a family. I needed a real job making real money. After working in the store for just nine months, I applied at a local tech company and walked away from my little business.</p>

<p>Three months later I would hire an accountant to do my taxes. I handed him a shoe box full of receipts and invoices and let him figure it out. When he handed me my first <em>Schedule C</em> I nearly hit the floor. I was showing a business loss that was more money than I had ever imagined. He explained that I would be able to write this loss off, in parts, over the next seven years.</p>

<p>But, remember, I had come into this business with only a few thousand dollars. If I had <em>lost</em> that kind of money, I had also <em>made</em> that money to lose. If I were paying attention, I think the business would have been profitable. But, I wasn’t paying attention, and the business had closed months ago.</p>

<p><strong>2. Get a cease and desist from your own employer</strong></p>

<p>Remember that Tech job I landed to make real money? Turns out, that was a good move. The company I joined was Iomega and they were roaring. They had recently released the Zip drive and had gone from 100k in annual revenue to a two billion dollar company. With that kind of growth, money and promotions were all around me. I loved the job and the people I was working with. I was climbing the corporate ladder and loving it.</p>

<p>Iomega also made the higher end Jaz drive, and all of us had one (or two) on our desks. Some of my co-workers were complaining about a problem though. The Jaz drive would spin-down, after two minutes or so, to conserve energy. The next time you accessed the drive, it took 20 or 30 seconds for it to spin up.</p>

<p>I had access to an internal engineering manual for the drive, so I dived in. I concluded that the drives were designed to spin down mostly to save energy. Based on the numbers I had, I figured they would last more than 10 years, even if they were running 24/7. But, there was no way to configure them to stay spinning. The sleep was built into the firmware of the drive itself.</p>

<p>That’s when I got the idea for my first Shareware program. It was a simple Windows utility that I called JazAwake. It would write a tiny file to the Jaz drive every 60 seconds and then delete it. The file was just big enough that it would flush it to disk. Because the drive was being written too every minute or so, it would no longer spin down.</p>

<p>The program was popular both inside the company and out. All of my co-workers were using it and people were starting to pay to register it.</p>

<p>Then I got a letter from one of the lawyers at Iomega. It was addressed to my software company. It was a cease and desist asking me to stop using the Jaz trademark and remove JazAwake from the Internet. At first, I laughed. How can you remove a piece of software from the Internet? That’s impossible. But, nothing short of that would stop them from suing me.</p>

<p>Luckily, they didn’t realize I also worked there, or I imagine I would have lost my job too.</p>

<p>I went to work creating my own cease and desist letter explaining what I had done and started mailing them to every organization that had written about or linked to my software. I had to send these letters to over a hundred different companies. I went back and forth with the lawyers at Iomega for about 6 months and when they could no longer find the software online, they were satisfied.</p>

<p>I stayed at Iomega for a couple more years and I created another popular Shareware program called ButtonWiz. When Iomega started to lose steam, I left for a smaller company.</p>

<p><strong>3. Close your side business and focus on the promise of becoming CEO</strong></p>

<p>I got a job at a small technology company that served only about 100 customers. But, the owner had created something useful and he was making enough money to pay for himself and another employee. He didn’t want to make too much profit, because that meant paying more taxes and quarterly tax paperwork. He would watch the books so that his profit was less than $4k per year. If we had made too much money for the year, by October or November, he would spend some of it on new things we needed for the office or employee bonuses. It worked out really well.</p>

<p>The owner was getting up there in age and he figured he would like to retire in another 10 years or so. None of his family was interested in the business he had built and he had no real plan to exit. So, he had the idea that he would hand the business to me at some point and I would continue to pay him well into retirement. He purchased a life insurance policy and set me as the beneficiary. If he died before he was able to retire, I could pay his family and continue to run the business.</p>

<p>ButtonWiz continued to get more and more popular and was now bringing in a few hundred dollars a month. One day the boss suggested that I stop working on my side projects and double-down at the office. So, I shelved work on ButtonWiz and let it wither away over the next few years while I focused on the company I worked for.</p>

<p>Now eight years into my Career here, the company had grown from the two of us to around ten employees. Among those employees a few family members had been introduced, but I was still employee number two. Then the boss dropped a bomb that didn’t completely surprise me. There were people in the family showing interest now and he had decided to keep the business in the family. I can’t blame him. One of the reasons I’ve always wanted to build a business is to support my family and, if it’s really successful, more of those around me. But, suddenly, my career felt like another job, so I started to look elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>4. Break Googles TOS and accidentally commit click fraud while your at it</strong></p>

<p>Growing more and more frustrated with the stress of my job, I started to run. I would run at a park by my office every day on my lunch break. I also started watching my weight and I started writing software again.</p>

<p>I had tried a bunch of calorie trackers but logging all the specific foods I ate was too much for me. I decided to create a calorie tracker that was fast. I would just enter the number of calories I ate and the web app would timestamp them. No more looking up foods.</p>

<p>At the top of the app I created a search box and I pointed that to a webview that opened to Google. I modified the search a little by adding the word “calories” to the end of it. That way, I could search for something like “pizza” and it would return a set of results for “pizza calories”, often with the actual number of calories right there at the top. I also signed up for Google advertising and embedded a mobile ad unit on the page. I released it for the iPhone and published it free on the web app directory on Apple.com (the App Store didn’t exist yet).</p>

<p>The money started rolling in. Lots of users were downloading the app and using it and the ad revenue was crazy high. It made a ton of money for a couple weeks and then I started looking at my ad click rates. They were astronomical. In fact, my click through rate was so high, it had to be an error. I started digging in.</p>

<p>What I found is that the search box and the ad unit were in close proximity to each other and users were accidentally clicking on the ad when they were trying to enter calorie counts. Oops.</p>

<p>I adjusted the placement of the two UI elements to be far apart. While I was doing that, I found a piece of information in Google’s Terms of Service that said you weren’t allowed to alter the search term a user entered. I was relying on Google for all my income here, so I also updated my search box so that it didn’t add the word “calories”, even though it made the search results significantly less relevant. Hopefully users would learn to do that themselves.</p>

<p>When I released the new version, as you might expect, the ad revenue tanked. Nearly all of the advertising clicks were users clicking by mistake.</p>

<p><strong>5. Write a book about a platform that changes a lot</strong></p>

<p>Since I was writing software again, I decided to give Facebook Apps a try. The app setup process was complex and confusing so I started to take detailed notes. After creating a “Hello World” app, I followed my instructions again and repeated the process for something more interesting. I refined my notes as I went, creating several test apps along the way. When I got done, I realized I had enough information to teach other developers how to do this. At the time, the Facebook documentation was sparse and hard to find. I had learned most of it by trial and error. I was also interested in trying self publishing. So, I decided I would spend the next weekend formatting this into a small book and self-publishing it on Amazon.</p>

<p>The book was selling a few copies a week and was getting great reviews.</p>

<p>About three months later, the book suddenly started to get bad reviews. I opened the book and followed it myself. Facebook had updated the process and things were different now. I made new notes and figured out the new process and …</p></div></div>

    <blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “There’s that sort of sense that many technical people will see or feel when you see something and you know what it could be, and you know it could be important, and you see companies just doing it wrong — there’s that powerful desire to fix it and do it right and show them sort of how it’s supposed to be done”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>— <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dIUBGf1RHU&amp;t=9m17s">John Carmack at GDC 2015</a>, in what’s likely to be the most reused quote on this blog.</p>

<p>I just bought Doom Eternal. Excited to see the download has completed I fired it up and.. nothing. Just a bunch of resolution changes, then nothing - not even an error message. I’m back to the desktop right where I started. My first go-to was the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/782330/announcements/detail/1806446683757378310">Doom Eternal support article on Steam</a>, where I was greeted with this gem:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Issue: DOOM Eternal fails to launch or crashes while launching on my Laptop.
Resolution: We do not officially support laptop hardware. Laptops that conform to the supported hardware specifications may run DOOM Eternal. Make sure the laptop uses its dedicated GPU and that the laptop is plugged into power. (This may also help with some desktops that use motherboards that have integrated GPUs.)
For NVIDIA users, your NVIDIA driver needs to be setup to pick the dedicated GPU.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I did happen to be using a laptop — a Razer Blade advanced model with a GeForce RTX 2080. It’s not like it’s an alien computer from outer space, and software shouldn’t have trouble running on a laptop versus a desktop. Let’s try to read between the lines and see how iD Software might be failing here. First there’s “Make sure the laptop uses its dedicated GPU” — most users aren’t technically inclined enough to know <em>how</em> to make sure the laptop does that, and in Doom Eternal’s case being powered by a Vulkan renderer means that at one point they need to be calling <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices.html">vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices</a> to, ahem, enumerate the physical GPU devices on the system. Almost all hybrid systems will be using an Intel integrated GPU plus an NVIDIA or AMD discrete GPU — is this too hard to detect? Is a heuristic picking the non-Intel GPU when faced with two GPUs too much work? Such a heuristic would save Bethesda the effort of writing the above support message and quite a few support calls, and I’m not even going to touch upon lost sales. Direct3D users have <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/dxgi/nf-dxgi-idxgifactory-enumadapters">IDXGIFactory::EnumAdapters</a>, which does the same thing. There’s really no excuse for requiring that the user, every user, jump through hoops when GPU selection is something that can be done in a few lines of code on the application’s side.</p>

<p>As for the second part, “Make sure… that the laptop is plugged into power” — can’t someone just call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-getsystempowerstatus">GetSystemPowerStatus</a> and display a warning? There’s no reason an app shouldn’t work on battery power (that’s pure madness if you ask me), but it’s reasonable to show a warning saying you’ll either drain your battery really fast or you’ll suffer decreased performance.</p>

<p>Later down in the same support document I came across another embarrassing answer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Issue: Game crashes on launch with two AMD GPUs installed.
Resolution: Issue is caused by having multiple monitors plugged into different GPUs. Plug both monitors into the primary GPU to fix.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seriously? There’s <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/dxgi/nf-dxgi-idxgiadapter-enumoutputs">IDXGIAdapter::EnumOutputs</a>, and you can use the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.0-wsi_extensions/html/vkspec.html#VkPhysicalDeviceProperties2KHR">VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2</a> extension to map a Vulkan device’s LUID to a DXGI device’s LUID.</p>

<p>It seems like Doom Eternal’s code, as technically impressive as its core renderer is, seems to only work fine on the authors’ computers and nothing significantly different — if you even hook up your monitors differently you’re shit out of luck. There isn’t even any effort to detect the known-bad cases and show an error message, you just get a blank screen then back to the desktop and then have to go through the support document and figure out what might apply to your case. Even if you ignore the time saved for customers, the dollar-amount cost for Bethesda in terms of support effort makes detecting such situations financially worth it.</p>

<p>Fabian Giesen once wrote a <a href="https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2016/02/05/smart/">blog post</a> discussing the difference between intelligence and a high level of technical skill. There’s no doubt that the core tech in Doom Eternal is showcasing a level of technical skill unmatched by almost everyone else in the game development circles — but the end product, the thing that you can not inspect quality into as Harold F. Dodge once said, doesn’t seem like the work of someone very intelligent.</p>

<p>One of the biggest threats to a high quality end-product is highly skilled unintelligent people in a driver’s seat.</p>

    <p>I’ve spent a good deal of my professional life arguing against using protobuffers. They’re clearly written by amateurs, unbelievably ad-hoc, mired in gotchas, tricky to compile, and solve a problem that nobody but Google really has. If these problems of protobuffers remained quarantined in serialization abstractions, my complaints would end there. But unfortunately, the bad design of protobuffers is so persuasive that these problems manage to leak their way into your code as well.</p>
<h2 id="ad-hoc-and-built-by-amateurs">Ad-Hoc and Built By Amateurs</h2>
<p>Stop. Put away your email client that is half-way through writing me about how “Google is filled with the world’s best engineers,” and that “anything they build is, by definition, not built by amateurs.” I don’t want to hear it.</p>
<p>Let’s just get this out of the way. Full disclosure: I used to work at Google. It was the first (but unfortunately, not the last) place I ever used protobuffers. All of the problems I want to talk about today exist inside of Google’s codebase; it’s not just a matter of “using protobuffers wrong” or some such nonsense like that.</p>
<p>By far, the biggest problem with protobuffers is their terrible type-system. Fans of Java should feel right at home with protobuffers, but unfortunately, literally nobody considers Java to have a well-designed type-system. The dynamic typing guys complain about it being too stifling, while the static typing guys like me complain about it being too stifling without giving you any of the things you actually want in a type-system. Lose lose.</p>
<p>The ad-hoc-ness and the built-by-amateurs-itude go hand-in-hand. So much of the protobuffer spec feels bolted on as an afterthought that it clearly <em>was</em> bolted on as an afterthought. Many of its restrictions will make you stop, scratch your head and ask “wat?” But these are just symptoms of the deeper answer, which is this:</p>
<p>Protobuffers were obviously built by amateurs because they offer <em>bad solutions to widely-known and already-solved problems.</em></p>
<h3 id="no-compositionality">No Compositionality</h3>
<p>Protobuffers offer several “features”, but none of them see to work with one another. For example, look at the list of orthogonal-yet-constrained typing features that I found by skimming the <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3">documentation</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>oneof</code> fields can’t be <code>repeated</code>.</li>
<li><code>map&lt;k,v&gt;</code> fields have dedicated syntax for their keys and values, but this isn’t used for any other types.</li>
<li>Despite <code>map</code> fields being able to be parameterized, no user-defined types can be. This means you’ll be stuck hand-rolling your own specializations of common data structures.</li>
<li><code>map</code> fields cannot be <code>repeated</code>.</li>
<li><code>map</code> keys <em>can</em> be <code>string</code>s, but <em>can not</em> be <code>bytes</code>. They also can’t be <code>enum</code>s, even though <code>enum</code>s are considered to be equivalent to integers everywhere else in the protobuffer spec.</li>
<li><code>map</code> values cannot be other <code>map</code>s.</li>
</ul>
<p>This insane list of restrictions is the result of unprincipled design choices and bolting on features after the fact. For example, <code>oneof</code> fields can’t be <code>repeated</code> because rather than resulting in a coproduct type, instead the code generator will give you a product of mutually-exclusive optional fields. Such a transformation is only valid for a singular field (and, as we’ll see later, not even then.)</p>
<p>The restriction behind <code>map</code> fields being unable to be <code>repeated</code> is related, but shows off a different limitation of the type-system. Behind the scenes, a <code>map&lt;k,v&gt;</code> is desugared into something spiritually similar to <code>repeated Pair&lt;k,v&gt;</code>. And because <code>repeated</code> is a magical language keyword rather than a type in its own right, it doesn’t compose with itself.</p>
<p>Your guess is as good as mine for why an <code>enum</code> can’t be used as a <code>map</code> key.</p>
<p>What’s so frustrating about all of this is a little understanding of how modern type-systems work would be enough to <em>drastically simplify</em> the protobuffer spec and simultaneously <em>remove all of the arbitrary restrictions.</em></p>
<p>The solution is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make all fields in a message <code>required</code>. This makes messages <em>product types</em>.</li>
<li>Promote <code>oneof</code> fields to instead be standalone data types. These are <em>coproduct types</em>.</li>
<li>Give the ability to parameterize product and coproduct types by other types.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it! These three features are all you need in order to define any possible piece of data. With these simpler pieces, we can re-implement the rest of the protobuffer spec in terms of them.</p>
<p>For example, we can rebuild <code>optional</code> fields:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1">product Unit {</span>
<span id="cb1-2">  <span>// no fields</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3">}</span>
<span id="cb1-4"></span>
<span id="cb1-5">coproduct Optional&lt;t&gt; {</span>
<span id="cb1-6">  t    value = <span>0</span>;</span>
<span id="cb1-7">  Unit unset = <span>1</span>;</span>
<span id="cb1-8">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Building <code>repeated</code> fields is simple too:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1">coproduct List&lt;t&gt; {</span>
<span id="cb2-2">  Unit empty = <span>0</span>;</span>
<span id="cb2-3">  Pair&lt;t, List&lt;t&gt;&gt; cons = <span>1</span>;</span>
<span id="cb2-4">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Of course, the actual serialization logic is allowed to do something smarter than pushing linked-lists across the network—after all, <a href="https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/follow-the-denotation/">implementations and semantics don’t need to align one-to-one</a>.</p>
<h3 id="questionable-choices">Questionable Choices</h3>
<p>In the vein of Java, protobuffers make the distinction between <em>scalar</em> types and <em>message</em> types. Scalars correspond more-or-less to machine primitives—things like <code>int32</code>, <code>bool</code> and <code>string</code>. Messages, on the other hand, are everything else. All library- and user-defined types are messages.</p>
<p>The two varieties of types have completely different semantics, of course.</p>
<p>Fields with scalar types are always present. Even if you don’t set them. Did I mention that (at least in proto3<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>) all protobuffers can be zero-initialized with absolutely no data in them? Scalar fields get false-y values—<code>uint32</code> is initialized to <code>0</code> for example, and <code>string</code> is initialized as <code>""</code>.</p>
<p>It’s impossible to differentiate a field that was missing in a protobuffer from one that was assigned to the default value. Presumably this decision is in place in order to allow for an optimization of not needing to send default scalar values over the wire. Presumably, though the <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding">encoding guide</a> makes no mention of this optimization being performed, so your guess is as good as mine.</p>
<p>As we’ll see when we discuss protobuffers’ claim to being god’s gift to backwards- and forwards-compatible APIs, this inability to distinguish between unset and default values is a nightmare. Especially if indeed it’s a design decision made in order to save one bit (set or not) per field.</p>
<p>Contrast this behavior against message types. While scalar fields are dumb, the behavior for message fields is outright <em>insane.</em> Internally, message fields are either there or they’re not—but their behavior is crazy. Some pseudocode for their accessor is worth a thousand words. Pretend this is Java or something similar:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>private</span> Foo m_foo;</span>
<span id="cb3-2"></span>
<span id="cb3-3"><span>public</span> Foo foo {</span>
<span id="cb3-4">  <span>// only if `foo` is used as an expression</span></span>
<span id="cb3-5">  get {</span>
<span id="cb3-6">    <span>if</span> (m_foo != <span>null</span>)</span>
<span id="cb3-7">      <span>return</span> m_foo;</span>
<span id="cb3-8">    <span>else</span></span>
<span id="cb3-9">      <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>Foo</span>();</span>
<span id="cb3-10">  }</span>
<span id="cb3-11"></span>
<span id="cb3-12">  <span>// instead if `foo` is used as an lvalue</span></span>
<span id="cb3-13">  mutable get {</span>
<span id="cb3-14">    <span>if</span> (m_foo = <span>null</span>)</span>
<span id="cb3-15">      m_foo = <span>new</span> <span>Foo</span>();</span>
<span id="cb3-16">    <span>return</span> m_foo;</span>
<span id="cb3-17">  }</span>
<span id="cb3-18">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The idea is that if the <code>foo</code> field is unset, you’ll see a default-initialized copy whenever you ask for it, but won’t actually modify its container. But if you modify <code>foo</code>, it will modify its parent as well! All of this just to avoid using a <code>Maybe Foo</code> type and the associated “headaches” of the nuance behind needing to figure out what an unset value should mean.</p>
<p>This behavior is especially egregious, because it breaks a law! We’d expect the assignment <code>msg.foo = msg.foo;</code> to be a no-op. Instead the implementation will actually silently change <code>msg</code> to have a zero-initialized copy of <code>foo</code> if it previously didn’t have one.</p>
<p>Unlike scalar fields, at least it’s possible to detect if a message field is unset. Language bindings for protobuffers offer something along the lines of a generated <code>bool has_foo()</code> method. In the frequent case of copying a message field from one proto to another, iff it was present, you’ll need to write the following code:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>if</span> (src.has_foo(src)) {</span>
<span id="cb4-2">  dst.set_foo(src.foo());</span>
<span id="cb4-3">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Notice that, at least in statically-typed languages, this pattern <em>cannot be abstracted</em> due to the nominal relationship between the methods <code>foo()</code>, <code>set_foo()</code> and <code>has_foo()</code>. Because all of these functions are their own <em>identifiers</em>, we have no means of programmatically generating them, save for a preprocessor macro:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>#define COPY_IFF_SET</span>(src,<span> </span>dst,<span> </span>field)<span> </span>\</span>
<span id="cb5-2"><span>if</span><span> </span>(src.<span>has_</span><span>##</span>field(src))<span> </span>{<span> </span>\</span>
<span id="cb5-3"><span>  </span>dst.<span>set_</span><span>##</span>field(src.field());<span> </span>\</span>
<span id="cb5-4">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>(but preprocessor macros are verboten by the <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Preprocessor_Macros">Google style guide</a>.)</p>
<p>If instead all optional fields were implemented as <code>Maybe</code>s, you’d get abstract-able, referentially transparent call-sites for free.</p>
<p>To change tack, let’s talk about another questionable decision. While you can define <code>oneof</code> fields in protobuffers, their semantics are <em>not</em> of coproduct types! Rookie mistake my dudes! What you get instead is an optional field for each case of the <code>oneof</code>, and magic code in the setters that will just unset any other case if this one is set.</p>
<p>At first glance, this seems like it should be semantically equivalent to having a proper union type. But instead it is an accursed, unutterable source of bugs! When this behavior teams up with the law-breaking implementation of <code>msg.foo = msg.foo;</code>, it allows this benign-looking assignment to silently delete arbitrary amounts of data!</p>
<p>What this means at the end of the day is that <code>oneof</code> fields do not form law-abiding <code>Prism</code>s, nor do messages form law-abiding <code>Lens</code>es. Which is to say good luck trying to write bug-free, non-trivial manipulations of protobuffers. It is <em>literally impossible to write generic, bug-free, polymorphic code over protobuffers.</em></p>
<p>That’s not the sort of thing anybody likes to hear, let alone those of us who have grown to love parametric polymorphism—which gives us the <em>exact opposite promise.</em></p>
<h2 id="the-lie-of-backwards--and-forwards-compatibility">The Lie of Backwards- and Forwards-Compatibility</h2>
<p>One of the frequently cited killer features of protobuffers is their “hassle-free ability to write backwards- and forwards-compatible APIs.” This is the claim that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.</p>
<p>What protobuffers are is <em>permissive.</em> They manage to not shit the bed when receiving messages from the past or from the future because they make absolutely no promises about what your data will look like. Everything is optional! But if you need it anyway, protobuffers will happily cook up …</p></div></div>

<p><em>BlackRock-managed funds and accounts lead investment in Astra to launch a new generation of space services to improve life on Earth</em></p>
<p>ALAMEDA, Calif., February 2, 2021 – Astra, the fastest privately-funded company in history to demonstrate orbital launch capability, and Holicity Inc. (NASDAQ: HOL) (“Holicity”), a special purpose acquisition company (“SPAC”), today announced a definitive business combination agreement that will result in Astra becoming a publicly traded company. The transaction reflects an implied pro-forma enterprise value for Astra of approximately $2.1 billion. Upon closing, the transaction is expected to provide up to $500 million in cash proceeds, including up to $300 million of cash held in the trust account of Holicity and an upsized $200 million PIPE led by funds and accounts managed by BlackRock.</p>
<p>“This transaction takes us a step closer to our mission of improving life on Earth from space by fully funding our plan to provide daily access to low Earth orbit from anywhere on the planet,” said Chris Kemp, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Astra.</p>
<p>“I have long believed space provides an unmatched opportunity to benefit and enrich society,” said Craig McCaw, Chairman and CEO of Holicity. “Astra’s space platform will further improve our communications, help us protect our planet, and unleash entrepreneurs to launch a new generation of services to enhance our lives.”</p>
<p>In December 2020, Astra joined a small, elite group of companies that have made it to space. With over 50 launches in manifest across more than 10 private and public customers, including NASA and DOD, Astra has booked over $150 million of contracted launch revenue. Astra will begin delivering customer payloads this summer and begin monthly launches by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Following the closing of the transaction, the combined company will continue to be led by Founder and CEO Chris Kemp. It is expected that Craig McCaw will join Astra’s board of directors.</p>
<p>The proposed transaction, which is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2021, has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both Astra and Holicity and remains subject to approval by Holicity’s stockholders. Upon the closing of the transaction, the combined company will be named Astra and will be listed on NASDAQ under the symbol “ASTR.”</p>
<h3>Transaction Overview</h3>
<p>Holicity, which currently holds over $300 million of cash in trust, will combine with Astra in a</p>
<p>transaction that is estimated to result in a pro forma enterprise value of approximately $2.1 billion. Cash proceeds in connection with the transaction will be funded through a combination of Holicity’s $300 million cash in trust and a $200 million fully committed common stock PIPE at $10.00 per share, led by funds and accounts managed by BlackRock. Astra’s existing shareholders will hold approximately 78% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the combined company immediately following the consummation of the transaction, assuming no redemptions by Holicity’s existing public stockholders. Astra’s founders will hold their interest in the pro forma combined company through super-voting (10:1) common stock.</p>
<p>Completion of the proposed transaction is subject to approval of Holicity’s stockholders and other customary closing conditions, including a registration statement being declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The transaction is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2021.</p>

                    <p>To properly test and track, you need software that makes the feedback process fast and easy. However, not all software applications live up to their advertised promises. If you want a fast, smooth, and accurate bug tracking and testing process, you need the following types of software applications.</p>

                    <h2>1. Task management software that supports task grouping</h2>
                    <p>You probably have task management software already. That’s great, but does your task management program support grouping your tasks or hiding tasks that aren’t pressing for the day? And how about setting reminders and flagging tasks as high priority to ensure they get done on time?</p>
                    <p>Technically, you should have separate bug tracking software, but you’ll need to break that process down into multiple tasks and maybe even sub-tasks. That’s where things can get messy in your task management application.</p>
                    <p>Tasks related to fixing bugs are more likely to be ongoing with a future due date that changes as you progress. This means you’ll always see those tasks in your daily to-do list and that can feel overwhelming.</p>
                    <p>Working on your daily tasks can be stressful when you can’t categorize or tag tasks in a meaningful way. You’ll see every task at once and that creates pressure.</p>
                    <p>If you’re going to manage your debugging tasks, your software needs several capabilities:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The ability to hide tasks or at least separate them from your normal daily tasks.</li>
                        <li>The ability to group tasks together to organize your workspace.</li>
                        <li>The ability to track progress, set due dates and reminders.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Being able to see how a development project looks in different browsers is critical. Whether you’re launching a website or a software application, browsers will display your project differently. Slight differences may not be a problem, but when a user reports a major problem on a specific device, you’ll want to see exactly what they see.</p>

                    <h2>3. Userback for collecting specific feedback</h2>
                    <p>You need to generate specific, actionable feedback throughout the development process. It’s not enough to ask clients or end users to email you their thoughts if they run into problems. If you go that route, you’ll end up with an abundance of emails that might feel more like nit picking than usable feedback. </p>
                    <p>One of the biggest frustrations developers face is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-07-19-a-devs-eye-view-of-bugs">getting unspecific comments from users</a>. Expert game developers constantly lament over comments like, “your game is broken—please fix it.” Software developers experience the same frustration. However, when you don’t give people an opportunity to provide specific feedback, you can expect random emails with generalized demands to fix unspecified problems.</p>
                    <p>If you’re going to collect feedback productively, you need a way to provide immediate feedback as they experience the problem. Otherwise, random, unspecific feedback is all you’ll ever get.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://www.userback.io/use-cases/bug-tracking">Userback solves this problem</a> by making it effortless for clients and customers to send you detailed, specific feedback regarding bugs as they occur. All they have to do is click a button on the side of your page and give feedback by typing into a text box, recording a video of a bug, or taking a screenshot with annotations directly from the webpage.</p>

                    <h2>4. Userback for visual bug reporting software</h2>
                    <p>You’re probably already using bug tracking software to identify bugs and find repetitive issues. Hopefully, your bug tracking software prioritizes issues so you can focus on the high priority issues first. All this is absolutely necessary, but it’s not enough if your goal is to fix bugs fast.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://dzone.com/articles/why-is-bug-tracking-tool-so-important-for-the-test" target="_blank">Bug testing and reporting are critical</a>, but traditional bug reports are challenging and time-consuming to decipher. To fix a bug, you need to replicate that bug, and text summaries make that difficult. </p>
                    <p>Most people don’t have the patience or technical knowledge to describe a bug in full detail, which means you may not be able to easily replicate that bug when reported. You might need to do some guesswork, set up specific parameters, and run your program over a period of days or weeks in an attempt to replicate a bug.</p>
                    <p>When you can’t replicate a bug, you can’t solve the problem. When you can’t replicate a bug quickly, you’ll be slow to solve the problem, which will only upset your end users and your clients. Userback solves this major issue and makes bug reporting and resolution fast.</p>
                    <p>With a simple screen recording, <a href="https://www.userback.io/blog/visual-bug-tracking">Userback collects bug reports in a visual format</a>. For example, a client or customer can record a bug in action using the video screen capture feature. It’s hard to replicate a bug based on text-only summaries. When you can see a video of what the user did to initiate the bug, you’ll know exactly how to replicate it, and you’ll be one step closer to a solution.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Every few months I end up in the a shady corner of the internet, with twenty tabs open searching for variations on <em>‘why the $%^&amp;!@ does this not work’</em>. Hours later I end up re-discovering the truth: using binary libraries in <code>$CURRENT_YEAR</code> still pretty much sucks.</p><p>So let’s try and get something positive out of this, and at least write up the facts of the situation. Here’s to hoping someone comes along and shows me I missed that “one weird trick” that will make all of this make sense.</p><p>So here we are, in no particular order, a bunch of hard-learned facts about using libraries (on unix-flavored operating systems)</p><div>
<li>
<p><em>Dynamic</em> or <em>shared</em> libraries are loaded up by your program at runtime. They contain lookup tables that map symbols to shared executable code. If you give someone a binary that links a dynamic library that they don’t already have, the OS will complain about missing libraries when they try to run it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dynamic or “shared” libraries have names that start with <code>lib</code> and finish with <code>.so</code>. Unless you’re on a Mac, where they end with <code>.dylib</code>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dynamic libraries themselves can link other dynamic libraries. These are known as <em>transitive dependencies</em>. All dependencies will need to be found to successfully run your binary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to move a binary from one machine (where it was compiled) to another, you’ll almost certainly find that at least some of the shared libraries needed by your binary are no longer found. This is usually the first sign of trouble…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Linux knows how to find libraries because it has a list of known locations for shared libraries in <code>/etc/ld.so.conf</code>. Each time you run <code>ldconfig</code>, the OS updates its cache of known libraries by going through directories in this file and reading the libraries it finds. OS X works differently… see <a href="https://www.unix.com/man-page/osx/1/dyld/">dyld</a> and friends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use <code>ldd</code> (linux) or <code>otool -L</code> (OS X) to query your binary for the missing libraries. Beware that it is <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ldd.1.html">not safe</a> to do this on a binary you suspect may be malicious 😞.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can safely copy dynamic libraries from one machine to another. As long as the environments are similar enough…<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> . In a perfect world (on linux), you could just copy the library you want to use into <code>/usr/local/lib</code> (the recommended place for unstable libraries) and then run <code>ldconfig</code> to make your OS reload its library cache.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of course, on OS X things work totally differently. Dynamic libraries have an <em>install name</em> which contains the absolute path. This path is baked into your binary at compile time. You can use <a href="https://www.unix.com/man-page/osx/1/install_name_tool/">install_name_tool</a> to change it. Good luck!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On linux, Adding libraries to <code>/usr/local/lib</code> makes them visible to everything, so you may want to copy your library somewhere else so that only <em>your</em> binary knows how to find it. One way to do this is using <em>rpath</em>…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can set the <em>rpath</em> attribute of your binary to contain a directory hint for your OS to look in for libraries. This hint can be <em>relative</em> to your binary. This is especially useful if you always ship libraries in a relative directory to your binary. You can use <code>@origin</code> as a placeholder for the path of the binary itself, so an rpath of <code>@origin/lib</code> causes the OS to always look in <code>&lt;path to your binary&gt;/lib</code> for shared libraries at runtime. This can be used on both OS X and linux, and is one of the most useful tools to actually getting things working in practice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your OS isn’t finding a dynamic library that you <em>know</em> exists, you can try helping your OS by setting the environment variable <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> to the directory containing it - your OS will look there first before default system paths. Beware, this is considered <a href="http://xahlee.info/UnixResource_dir/_/ldpath.html">bad practice</a>, but it might unblock you at a pinch. OS X has <code>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>, which is similar, and also <code>DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH</code>, which is similar, but different (sorry).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dynamic libraries also have a thing called a <em>soname</em>, which is the name of the library, plus version information. You have seen this if you’ve seen <code>libfoo.so.3.1</code> or similar. This allows us to use different versions of the same library on the same OS, and to make non backwards-compatible changes to libraries. The soname is also baked into the library itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Often, your OS will have multiple symlinks to a single library in the same directory, just with different paths containing version information, e.g. <code>libfoo.so.3</code>, <code>libfoo.so.3.1</code>. This is to allow programs to find compatible libraries with slightly different versions. Everything starts to get rather messy here… if you really need to get into the weeds, <a href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO/shared-libraries.html">this article</a> will help. You probably only need to understand this if you are distributing libraries to users and need to support compatibility across versions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of course, even if your binary only depends on a single symbol in a dynamic library, it must still link that library. Now consider that the dependency itself may also link other unused transitive dependencies. Accidentally “catching a dependency” can cause your list of shared library dependencies to grow out of control, so that your simple <code>hello world</code> binary ends up depending on hundreds of megabytes of totally unused shared libraries 😞.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One solution to avoiding “dependency explosions” is to statically link symbols directly into your binary, so let’s start to look at <em>static linking</em>!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Static</em> libraries (<code>.a</code> files) contain symbol lookup table, similarly to dynamic libraries.
However, they are much more dumb and also a total PITA to use correctly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you compile your binary and link in only static dependencies, you will end up with a <em>static binary</em>. This binary will not need to load any dependencies at runtime and thus much easier to share with others!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>People On The Internet</em> will recommend that you do not not distribute static binaries, because it makes it hard to patch security flaws. With dynamic libraries, you just have to patch a single library e.g. <code>libssl.so</code>, instead of re-compiling everything on your machine that may have linked the broken library without your knowledge (i.e. everything).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People who build production systems at companies recommend static libraries because it’s wayyyy the hell easier to just deploy a single binary with zero dependencies that can basically run anywhere. No one cares about how big binaries are these days anyway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Still more people on the internet remind you that only one copy of a dynamic library is loaded into memory by the OS even when it is used by multiple processes, saving on memory pressure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The static library people remind you that modern computers have plenty of memory and library size is hardly the thing killing us right now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The OS X people point out that OS X <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/qa/qa1118/_index.html">strongly discourages</a> the use of statically linked binaries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Static libraries can’t declare any kinds of library dependencies. This means it is <em>your</em> responsibility to ensure all symbols are all baked correctly into your binary at link time - otherwise your linker will fail. This can make linking static libraries painfully error-prone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you get <em>symbol not found</em> errors but literally swear that you linked every damn thing, you probably linked a static library, and forgot a transitive dependency that is needed by it. This pretty much sucks as it’s basically impossible to figure out where that library comes from. Try having a guess by looking at the error messages. Or something?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh, and you must ensure that you link your static libraries in the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45135/why-does-the-order-in-which-libraries-are-linked-sometimes-cause-errors-in-gcc">correct order</a>, otherwise you can still get <code>symbol not found errors</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are starting to think it might be hard to keep track of static libraries, you are following along correctly. There are tools that can help you here, such as <code>pkgconfig</code>, <code>CMake</code>, <code>autotools</code>… or <code>bazel</code>. It’s quite easy to get going, and achieve deterministic platform-independent static builds with no dynamic dependencies… Said no one ever 😓.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One classic way to screw up, is to compile a static library without using the <code>-fPIC</code> flag (for “position independent code”). If you do not do this, you will be able to use the static library in a binary, but you will not be able to link it into a dynamic library. This is especially frustrating if you were provided with a static library that was compiled without this flag and you can’t easily recompile it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beware that <code>-fpic</code> is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3544035/what-is-the-difference-between-fpic-and-fpic-gcc-parameters">not the same</a> as <code>-fPIC</code>. Apparently, <code>-fPIC</code> always works but may result in a few nanoseconds of slowdown, or something. Probably you should use <code>-fPIC</code> and try not to think about it too much.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your compiler toolchain (e.g. <code>CMake</code>) usually has a one-liner way to link a bunch of static libraries into a single dynamic library with no dependencies of its own. However, should you want to link a bunch of static libraries into another static library… well I’ve never successfully found a reliable way to do this 😞. Why do this you may ask? Mostly for cffi - when I want to build a single static library from C++ and then link it into e.g. a go binary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beware that your compiler/linker is not smart! Just because the header files declare a function and your linker manages to find symbols for it in your library, doesn’t mean that the function is remotely the same. <a href="https://github.com/libspatialindex/libspatialindex/issues/93">You will discover this when you get undefined behavior at runtime.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh, and if the library you are linking was compiled with a <code>#define</code> switch set, but when you include the library’s headers, you do not set the define to the same value, welcome again to runtime <a href="https://github.com/openMVG/openMVG/issues/1474">undefined behavior land</a>! This is the same problem as the one above, where the symbols end up being incompatible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are trying to ship C++, another thing that can bite you is that the C++ standard library uses dynamic linking. This means that even the most basic <code>hello world</code> program cannot be distributed to others unless they have a compatible version of <code>libstdc++</code>. Very often you’ll end up compiling with a shiny new version of this library, only to find that your target is using an older, incompatible version.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One way to get around <code>libstdc++</code> problems is to statically link it into your binary. However, if you create a static library that statically links <code>libstdc++</code>, and your library uses C++ …</p></li></div></div>

February 3, 2021 | https://frostming.com/2021/01-22/introducing-pdm/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://frostming.com/2021/01-22/introducing-pdm/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>When you develop a Python project, you need to install the project's dependencies. For a long time, tutorials and articles have told you to use a virtual environment to isolate the project's dependencies. This way you don't contaminate the working set of other projects, or the global interpreter, to avoid possible version conflicts. We usually have to do these things:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ python3 -m venv venv  
$ <span>.</span> venv/bin/activate   
<span>(</span>venv<span>)</span> $ pip <span>install</span> -r requirements.txt  </code></pre></div>
<p>There are also workflow tools that simplify this process, such as <a href="https://pipenv.pypa.io/">Pipenv</a> and <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a>. They create virtual environments for you without perception and then install dependencies into them. They are used by a wide range of users. A virtual environment contains a Python interpreter and has the same directory structure as a normal installation so that it can be used as if it were a standalone Python installation.</p>
<h2 id="the-problems-with-virtual-environments"><a href="#the-problems-with-virtual-environments" aria-label="the problems with virtual environments permalink"></a>The problems with virtual environments</h2>
<p>Virtualenvs help us isolate project dependencies, but things get tricky when it comes to nested venvs: One installs the virtualenv manager(like Pipenv or Poetry) using a venv encapsulated Python, and creates more venvs using the tool which is based on an encapsulated Python. One day a minor release of Python is out and one has to check all those venvs and upgrade them if required before they can safely delete the out-dated Python version.</p>
<p>Another scenario is global tools. There are many tools that are not tied to any specific virtualenv and are supposed to work with each of them. Examples are profiling tools and third-party REPLs. We also wish them to be installed in their own isolated environments. It's impossible to make them work with virtualenv, even if you have activated the virtualenv of the target project you want to work on because the tool is lying in its own virtualenv and it can only see the libraries installed in it. So we have to install the tool for each project.</p>
<p>I've been maintaining the Pipenv project as a collaborator for the past two years and became a member of PyPA in early 2020. I am always thinking if the virtual environment is really a must-to-have for Python projects, just like <code>npm</code>, it doesn't need a cloned <code>node</code> binary, but just a <code>node_modules</code> directory that is unique for each project.</p>
<h2 id="pep-582----python-local-packages-directory"><a href="#pep-582----python-local-packages-directory" aria-label="pep 582    python local packages directory permalink"></a>PEP 582 -- Python local packages directory</h2>
<p>The solution has been existing for a long time. <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0582/">PEP 582</a> was originated in 2018 and is still a draft proposal till the time I wrote this article, but I found out it is exactly what <code>node_modules</code> are in Python.</p>
<p>Say you have a project with the following structure:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>.
├── __pypackages__
│   └── 3.8
│       └── lib
└── my_script.py</code></pre></div>
<p>As specified in the PEP 582, if you run <code>python3.8 /path/to/my_script.py</code>, <code>__pypackages__/3.8/lib</code> will be added to <code>sys.path</code>, and the libraries inside will become import-able in <code>my_script.py</code>.</p>
<p>Now let's review the two problems I mentioned in the last section and see how they change with the power of PEP 582. For the first problem, the main cause is that the virtual environment is bound to a cloned Python interpreter on which the subsequent library searching based. It takes advantage of Python's existing mechanisms without any other complex changes but makes the entire virtual environment to become unavailable when the Python interpreter is stale. With the local packages directory, you don't have a Python interpreter any more, the library path is directly appended to <code>sys.path</code>, so you can freely move and copy it.</p>
<p>For the second, once again, you just call the tool against the project you want to analyze, and the <code>__pypackages__</code> sitting inside the project will be loaded automatically. This way you only need to keep one copy of the global tool and make it work with multiple projects.</p>

<p>Starting from the PEP, I made <a href="https://pdm.fming.dev/">PDM</a>, a new Python package manager and workflow tool that leverages PEP 582 to get rid of virtualenv entirely. It installs dependencies into the local package directory <code>__package__</code> and makes Python interpreters aware of it with <a href="https://pdm.fming.dev/#enable-pep-582-globally">a very simple setup</a>. It is not only an implementation of PEP 582 but also the only package manager that supports <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0621/">PEP 621</a>, a new metadata format based on <code>pyproject.toml</code> which becomes the standard recently. It is foreseen that pip will also gradually support this format. Besides, PDM uses the same dependency resolver as pip and has a full-featured plugin system, allowing for community-contributed plugins to enhance the functionalities.</p>
<p>In PDM, PEP 582 is not mandatory, you can also stick with virtualenv. PDM can detect <strong>existing</strong> venvs but not create new ones.</p>
<p>Another thing that is noteworthy is its dependency resolution mechanism -- it tries to lock versions that are compatible with the <code>requires-python</code> value of the project. Say your project requires Python 2.7 or 3.6 upper and you want to add <code>pytest</code> as a development dependency, in Pipenv(ver. <code>2020.11.15</code>) you have to pin <code>pytest = "&lt;5"</code> manually in <code>Pipfile</code>. And in Poetry(ver. <code>1.1.4</code>) if you run <code>poetry add -D pytest</code> you will get:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>The current project's Python requirement <span>(</span><span>&gt;</span><span>=</span><span>2.7</span>,<span>&lt;</span><span>3.0</span> <span>||</span> <span>&gt;</span><span>=</span><span>3.6</span>,<span>&lt;</span><span>4.0</span><span>)</span> is not compatible with some of the required packages Python requirement:
    - pytest requires Python <span>&gt;</span><span>=</span><span>3.6</span>, so it will not be satisfied <span>for</span> Python <span>&gt;</span><span>=</span><span>2.7</span>,<span>&lt;</span><span>3.0</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Yes, it tells you to upgrade your Python requires version. However, in PDM, you can lock successfully:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>❯ pdm <span>add</span> -d pytest
Adding packages to dev dependencies: pytest
✔ 🔒 Lock successful
Changes are written to pdm.lock.
Changes are written to pyproject.toml.
Synchronizing working <span>set</span> with lock file: <span>11</span> to add, <span>0</span> to update, <span>0</span> to remove

  ✔ Install atomicwrites <span>1.4</span>.0 successful

  ✔ Install pytest <span>4.6</span>.11 successful
  ✔ Install six <span>1.15</span>.0 successful
  ✔ Install wcwidth <span>0.2</span>.5 successful

🎉 All complete<span>!</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, <code>pytest</code> is pinned to <code>4.*</code> that is compatible with Python 2.7 and Python 3.6+.</p>
<p>For more features and demos, please refer to the <a href="https://pdm.fming.dev/">PDM's website</a> and <a href="https://github.com/frostming/pdm">GitHub repo</a>.</p>
<h2 id="some-random-words"><a href="#some-random-words" aria-label="some random words permalink"></a>Some random words</h2>
<p>You may have seen this <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">comic</a> before, there are already so many package managers in Python's world, do we need a new one? No, I think. Gladly we have seen many improvements in the Python packaging ecosystem and the official installer pip, such as <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517/">PEP 517</a>/<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/">PEP 518</a>, and the <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/announcement-pip-20-2-release/4863">new dependency resolver</a>, more to come in the future. But before the day comes, why not try something different from the traditional, why not make something new that makes at least myself happy. If you think so, PDM should be an option, hopefully.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kubernetes, also known as k8s, is an open-source system for managing containerized applications. Since its introduction in 2014, Kubernetes has revolutionized modern application building towards containers and microservices.</p><p>It has automated the previously manual task of deploying and managing containerized applications, allowing easier scalability and simplifying the manual management required of infra teams.</p><p>As a result, Kubernetes is the go-to platform for companies scaling their applications and engineering teams.</p><p>The increased engineering efficiency and stability provided by the extensive Kubernetes platform also comes with increased complexity.</p><p>According to a recent <a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2020/03/04/2019-cncf-survey-results-are-here-deployments-are-growing-in-size-and-speed-as-cloud-native-adoption-becomes-mainstream/" target="_blank">survey</a> by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, over half of companies deploying applications on the Kubernetes platform have over 250 deployed microservices. In addition, according to a <a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2020/03/04/2019-cncf-survey-results-are-here-deployments-are-growing-in-size-and-speed-as-cloud-native-adoption-becomes-mainstream/" target="_blank">report</a> polling 950 IT leaders, over 56% of companies planned to expand their use of microservices and deployments on Kubernetes in the next 12 months.</p><p>From these numbers, it's clear that most companies using Kubernetes either already have a staggering amount of microservices or are quickly on their way there. As companies begin to scale with Kubernetes, new problems of service overload arise. With so many Kubernetes deployments, service visibility is naturally obscured and difficult to avoid.</p><p>When you're running 50 or 500 services, it's much harder to keep track of service owners, oncall information, and other important information for each service than when you're running 5 services.</p><p>That's where Cortex comes in. With the new Cortex Kubernetes integration, you can quickly and easily map and keep track of your services and their owners, so whether you're running 5 or 500 services, you know what's happening with each. You can augment each k8s service with critical pieces of context like ownership (linked to your identity provider), documentation, on-call info, latency graphs, and more.</p><figure id="w-node-462784fda960-f078b551"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/601b30f41fbfce2f0104b295_Screen_Shot_2021-02-01_at_12.55.09_PM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>While this may seem like a problem only applicable to large companies with those 500 services, it's never too soon to start cataloging and organizing your services. If your company has recently adopted or is considering adopting Kubernetes, chances are you're either already experiencing rapid growth of services and engineering or you anticipate it coming soon.</p><p>With Cortex, you can easily start mapping your Kubernetes services. Cortex grows with you as your cluster grows, making sure new services play well with the old ones and old ones don't get lost along the way. Your existing services get automatically mapped to the Kubernetes deployments, so getting started is extremely simple!</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/601b311a63ba4e69a5b356bd_Screen_Shot_2020-12-14_at_4.04.14_PM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>So what happens if all your services have already gotten lost along the way and you already have those 500 services? If you have an established cluster and many services, the new Cortex Kubernetes integration helps you un-clutter in the click of a button.</p><p>Cortex automatically detects all your Kubernetes deployments and allows you to easily import all of them in a single click. You can quickly see your services, map them to owners, and start making sense of the clutter. The best part is, as your cluster inevitably grows even more, Cortex will continue to detect all your new Kubernetes services and map them automatically.</p><p>In addition to easily importing all your Kubernetes services to Cortex, you'll also soon be able to see important Kubernetes information for each service such as replica count, restarts, status, etc. directly from your catalog. Want to also see which k8s services are not conforming to standards on your team? You can use scorecards to score and monitor each service in your cluster for deployment health and readiness.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/601b3138bb1299f5719162ee_Screen_Shot_2021-02-01_at_1.19.02_PM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Each k8s service can be graded on rules you define in a scorecard</figcaption></figure><p>Sign up for a demo <a href="https://www.getcortexapp.com/" target="_blank">here</a> and we'll send you a helm chart to try it out in your own cluster!</p></div></div>]]>

February 3, 2021 | https://wilw.dev/blog/2021/02/03/rss-rise-fall-rise/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wilw.dev/blog/2021/02/03/rss-rise-fall-rise/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Many people would consider RSS - Really Simple Syndication - to be a relic of the past. However I think it has been making a comeback.</p>
<p>RSS is a mechanism by which people can automatically receive updates from individual websites, similar to how you might follow another user on a social networking service. Software known as RSS <em>readers</em> can be used to subscribe to RSS <em>feeds</em> in order to receive these updates. As new content (e.g. a blog post) is published to an RSS-enabled website, its feed is updated and your RSS reader will show the new post the next time it refreshes. Many RSS readers have an interface similar to an email client, with read/unread states, folders, favourites, and more.</p>
<h2>The rise</h2>
<p>RSS was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">first released</a> in early 1999, and it steadily gained popularity amongst content producers and consumers, with adopters from media outlets and software implementations making their way into early Internet Eplorer and Firefox versions, amongst others. These were the days before the "real" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web 2.0</a> hit, and in which websites were very much more silos of information. Tools like RSS were powerful then because they enabled the easy <em>aggregation</em> of information from multiple sources.</p>
<p>Not too long after this (Web 2.0 'began' in the mid 2000's), and during the years ever since, mainstream social networks became ubiquitous. Many people flock(ed) to these as a way to share and subscribe (by following others) to receive updates in real time, several times a day and from lots of different people and organisations. These services enabled features far beyond aggregation by allowing easy sharing, rating (e.g. likes) and commentating such that today such services have become the primary means of information and news sharing and reception for many people.</p>
<h2>The fall(?)</h2>
<p>At that time RSS was still very much "a thing" for many people (though the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader#Discontinuation">discontinuation of the hugely popular Google Reader in 2013</a> was a bit of a bummer to these communities). However new people now joining the web scene would be far more likely to instead engage with these extremely well-funded, well-marketed, and <em>centralised</em> social platforms - <a href="https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/">perfectly engeineered to be addictive</a>, entirely driven and propagated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out">FOMO</a>, and focused on content-sharing (even if the content is often <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jan/30/facebook-letting-fake-news-spreaders-profit-investigators-claim">misinformation</a>) - where <em>you</em> are the product, rather than spend the time researching and subscribing to individual RSS feeds.</p>
<p>To some commentators in this space the concept behind all of these social platforms is known as the <em><a href="https://jackcheng.com/essays/the-slow-web/#the-fast-web">fast web</a></em> - a web that tells you when and what information to consume rather than letting you make that decision for yourself. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and others all started as just a <em>chronological</em> timeline of interesting content from friends and family. On all of these services today the "algorithm" determines what (and who) goes in your timeline, and it constantly learns what to feed you - and when - in order to get those few extra minutes from you each day. This is literally its business model.</p>
<p>What used to be an innocent bookmarking tool, Twitter's "favouriting" mechanism is now essentially a game of <strong>retweet roulette</strong> in which the algorithm will every now and again choose to include your "bookmarks" (not just retweets) on the feeds of people who follow you. If that's not anxiety-inducing or user-hostile then I don't know what is!</p>
<p>Of course this is something Facebook has done for a while too, except perhaps in a more sinister way - such as implying <a href="https://www.baekdal.com/thoughts/facebook-graph-search-privacy-woes">a user has liked something when they haven't at all</a>.</p>
<p>Other social networking tools can be more user-friendly. For example, the open-source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(software)">Mastodon</a> software powers distributed social networks that aren't fuelled by addiction and instead give you more control over what you receive and where your posts go. However these tools still have some way to go to becoming anywere near mainstream.</p>
<p>I want to caveat some of the above: I obviously don't think any of this is the fault of the individual. These social platforms are fantastically easy places to set-up a web presence. Creating an Instagram, Facebook, or Tik-Tok account for you (or your business) takes literal seconds. Within a minute you can have your profile setup and be following a dozen people, and already getting engagement and "reactions" from others (remember those "Your friend, X, is now on Instagram!" type notifications?).</p>
<p>With all of this power and efficiency at the fingertips it's no wonder that people don't create their own personal websites anymore, or feel the need to reach out to actively keep-up with other such sites. What's the point in re-inventing the wheel when I can easily create a Facebook page for myself that includes an inbuilt blog "feed", a space for links, photos, and more? And it's "free"! The barrier to creating a self-owned personal space on the internet for yourself is considered too high for most people, and is probably still seen as "geeky" even if it does come with all the benefits of privacy and control.</p>
<p>And I'm not saying that self-owned spaces, RSS, and that whole ecosystem are related, or the opposite to, mainstream social media; more that it is a useful way to compare and contrast different ways of accessing and disseminating information and the level of control one has over this.</p>
<p>This probably feels like I'm going way off-piste, and I sort of have, but my key meaning here is that for several years the concept of RSS has evaporated from popular knowledge because people haven't <em>needed</em> it - either as a tool for receiving <em>or</em> disseminating information. Ask your non-tech friends and family if they've heard of RSS (and know what it is for a bonus point) - I bet the positive response rate will be low in most cases, especially in younger respondents.</p>
<p>Also, I don't think this is solely the fault of the social giants. Online media outlets - which would have needed to rely on RSS for years before online social media became more mainstream - now often completely ignore it or treat it as a second-class citizen.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news">BBC News website</a> happily displays large friendly icons for Facebook, Twitter, and the like, but no mention of RSS (try <code>ctrl-F</code>). In fact, you'll probably need to search the web for "bbc rss" in order to find the RSS feeds that are <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10628494">listed on a page that hasn't been updated for over a decade</a> and which still lists IE7 and the long-discontinued Google Reader as sensible options (though ironically I suppose this does indicate the stability and robustness of the RSS system).</p>
<h2>The rise again</h2>
<p>Anyway, all that sounds a bit doom and gloom but I definitely think we are starting to see a shift in people's attitude towards and - importantly, trust in - these big tech companies. Facebook's recent attitiude towards information collection (and subsequent sharing) has <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/facebook-update-apple-privacy-ads-b1795916.html">hit mainstream headlines</a> and everyone must have seen <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/whatsapps-new-privacy-policy-requires-you-to-share-data-with-facebook">Whatsapp's popup about data sharing</a>. Too much uncertainty undermines the trust in these platforms, and people have understandably sought out other options. A few weeks ago Telegram reported an addition of <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/01/12/telegram-adds-25-million-new-users-in-just-72-hours-as-rival-apps-falter">25 million new users within 72 hours</a> as a result of these policy "changes".</p>
<p>My parents aren't really tech-aware at all but even they were telling me last week on a video call about this "new app Signal" they had downloaded and begun to use with their friends - without any of my input.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what it is, but people seem to <em>care</em> more about their data these days. Whether that's because of GDPR, the fact that coronavirus means people aren't endlessly scrolling through social feeds on their daily commutes anymore, or something else or a mixture of everything. And that extends to being more picky about the information they receive too.</p>
<p>Either way, I've noticed more and more <a href="https://atthis.link/blog/2021/rss.html">posts like this</a> (and the subsequent <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26014344">reactions and discussions</a>) recently, and the <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">#100DaysToOffload</a> movement has brought about a surge in people - myself included, really - creating their own longer-form content, for which RSS is a perfect distribution mechanism.</p>
<p>I think we're on a bit of a brink representing a general - but real - change in attitude from people towards data, and the time that they choose to give to now lesser-trusted platforms. It is our responsibility to help educate about the alternative options so that those around us can make their own decisions. Whilst I am relatively new to RSS in the grand scheme of things (having only really started properly engaging with it about a year ago), it already makes me feel more in control of what I view, and when.</p>
<p>Whilst this concept doesn't need to be limited to RSS, it's a great starting point as it's easy to understand. It "feels" friendly, it helps power connections to the decentralised and <a href="https://ar.al/2020/08/07/what-is-the-small-web/">small web</a>.</p>
<p>It, as a concept, has no business model. Though of course you can pay for the software you use, and websites can make money through ads, but at least you have a <em>choice</em> regarding who you subscribe to and the software you use to do it through (and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_feed_aggregators">there are lots of choices</a>). You aren't tied into anything and it respects your privacy - you don't need to "sign-up", provide your details, and sites don't know that <em>you</em> personally have subscribed.</p>
<p>RSS may be age-old, but it is an excellent way to still get the information you need as you begin to use mainstream social media less, and - although it doesn't need to be slow in itself - it is a fantastic tool to combine with the growing and user-respecting world of the <a href="https://jackcheng.com/essays/the-slow-web#timely-vs-real-time">slow web</a>, in which timeliness (where you're in control) is far more important than "real-time".</p>

<h3>Edit</h3>
<p>I've received some replies to this post that talk about the lack of mentions of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard)">Atom standard</a> and podcasts. RSS certainly is (and has been) a fantastic way to subscribe to podcasts. Its flexibility and ease of use has been a great tool for both content creators and consumers, and has helped to build the ecosystem of podcast apps and services we see today. And of course, there are other very useful distribution mechanisms and standards available for distributing information, such as Atom. This post was …</p></div></article></div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>



<div><p>Back in 2013 exactly 1 year after the first Raspberry Pi was sold RS components – One of two licenced Raspberry Pi Manufacturers at the time released a limited production run of 1000 blue Raspberry Pis. </p><p>They came with a Certificate of Authenticity signed by Eben Upton and a matching Blue case from One Nine Design in Wales.   </p></div>

<div><p>There was a pretty big catch though. They were never available to purchase. So how did you get one? </p><p>The majority of them were donated to charities involving kids educations and some were given away as competition prizes. Although it seems like a few slipped through the net!</p></div>



<div><p>I managed to get my hands on one and there are several available on eBay. I spoke to the eBay seller and he claims his Friend that used to work for RS Components gave him them. </p><p>Lets take a look at mine.</p></div>

<p>The first thing you come across as the box is opened – the Certificate of Authenticity. Each Blue Pi has a number, mine is #80. </p>

<p>Carefully opening the boxed Pi and managing to not destroy the holographic security seals I found the Blue Pi in all its glory. Also included is a quick start guide and the Regulatory information. <br></p>

<p>Other than the Colour the Blue Pi is identical to a Rev 2 Model B as can be seen above – The only other difference is that the Ethernet port is covered with a holographic RS Components logo. <br></p>

<p>It turns out the Rev 2 Model B doesn’t only come in Blue and Green. Egoman (A Chinese electronic device manufacturer) were licenced to produce a Model B for the Chinese Market with a Red PCB to make the device easy to distinguish. The reason for this was simple, the boards are missing the FCC/CE markings making it illegal to import them into the EU or USA. It seems that very few did make it into the UK although they are around, a popular Crypto mining ASIC used the Red Pi as a controller board. If anyone has one for sale I would be very interested in purchasing one to complete my collection! </p>



<h2>Conclusion </h2>



<p>The Blue Pi is a cool device however its nothing more than a collectors item at this point. I haven’t even attempted to power this one on although I fully expect it will work!</p>



<p>More information can be found in the original press release <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/blue-pi/">here</a>. </p>



<p>There are also a few for sale on eBay <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/early-raspberry-Pi-Blue-Case-Collectors-Rare-Limited-Edition/333871943231?hash=item4dbc518e3f:g:qAcAAOSwtD5gExmD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a> but be quick! They end tomorrow.  </p>

    <p>For as long as I can remember, I avoided touching SVGs when working with front-end code. Iâ€™d have no trouble with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, but SVGs always intimidated me with their bizarre syntax and those weird, indecipherable strings of letters and numbers. You know the ones:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;svg</span> <span>viewBox=</span><span>"0 0 24 24"</span> <span>width=</span><span>"24"</span> <span>height=</span><span>"24"</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;path</span> <span>d=</span><span>"M 4 4 h 16 a 2 2 0 0 1 2 2 v 14"</span> <span>/&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/svg&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If I needed icons for a project, Iâ€™d install one of the many icon libraries that are available, but that always left me unsatisfied. Sure, thereâ€™s nothing wrong with using libraries, but itâ€™s always a good idea to know how the tools you use really work under the hood. So why not also learn how to draw your own SVG icons by hand, even if you end up using a library in the end?</p>

<p>As youâ€™ll see in this tutorial, coding SVG icons by hand is actually fairly straightforward once you master the basic shapes and syntax. Weâ€™ll draw a bunch of icons to help you hone your SVG skills. Hereâ€™s a sneak peek at all of the icons weâ€™ll create:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="32" height="32">

      <polyline points="16 5.5, 20 5.5, 20 9.5"></polyline>
    </svg>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If youâ€™re curious, I took inspiration for these SVG icons from <a href="https://feathericons.com/">Feather Icons</a>, a fantastic library created by <a href="https://colebemis.com/">Cole Bemis</a>. These icons will help us learn how to draw the following shapes with SVG:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lines</li>
  <li>Polylines</li>
  <li>Circles</li>
  <li>Polygons</li>
  <li>Curved paths</li>
</ul>

<p>Once youâ€™ve learned the basics, you can draw almost anything with SVGs.</p>

<p>I hope youâ€™re excited to get started! Feel free to jump around if you want, but Iâ€™ve structured this tutorial intentionally so that each section builds on new knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-an-svg">What Is an SVG?</h2>

<p><strong>SVG</strong> stands for <strong>Scalable Vector Graphics</strong>; itâ€™s a vector image format that allows you to draw shapes using a standard markup (XML) syntax. The â€œscalableâ€� part of the name is a key characteristic of SVGsâ€”unlike other image formats, they donâ€™t lose quality when you scale them beyond their original size. Whereas images store their data using fixed-size pixels, SVGs store them as XML definitions for shapes, which can easily be scaled responsively to any size.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s also worth noting that you can animate SVGs; <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/boop/">Joshua Comeau</a> uses this to great effect on his site, creating a delightful and interactive user experience.</p>

<h3 id="how-are-svgs-drawn">How Are SVGs Drawn?</h3>

<p>There are two ways to draw SVGs: by hand, where you define the markup explicitly using HTML, or through a <strong>vector image program</strong> like <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/assets/images/posts/svg-tutorial-how-to-code-svg-icons-by-hand/inkscape.png"><picture>
    <source srcset="https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/assets/images/posts/svg-tutorial-how-to-code-svg-icons-by-hand/inkscape-placeholder.webp" type="image/webp" data-srcset="/assets/images/posts/svg-tutorial-how-to-code-svg-icons-by-hand/inkscape.webp">
    <img src="https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/assets/images/posts/svg-tutorial-how-to-code-svg-icons-by-hand/inkscape.png" alt="Inkscape's user interface consists of drawing tools on the left-hand side, page alignment and setup options on the right, and a canvas in the center." data-src="/assets/images/posts/svg-tutorial-how-to-code-svg-icons-by-hand/inkscape.png">
  </picture></a></p>

<p>These programs come with basic shapes, color pickers, drawing tools, and path manipulation, allowing you to create complex drawings with greater ease than if you were to do them by hand. Youâ€™ll typically see designers and logo artists using GUIs like Inkscape rather than coding SVGs by hand. Still, understanding how SVG markup works is a valuable learning experience. At the end of the day, these programs output <code>.svg</code> files; if you inspect those files, youâ€™ll find that their markup is just XML, and you can make sense of it if you understand how SVGs work.</p>

<h2 id="svg-101-how-to-code-svgs-by-hand">SVG 101: How to Code SVGs by Hand</h2>

<p>I know youâ€™re itching to get to the examples, but first things first!</p>

<p>All SVG shapes are defined within the SVG element itself, like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;svg&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;!-- stuff goes here --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/svg&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Of course, thereâ€™s more to it than just that. Letâ€™s explore the basic anatomy of an SVG.</p>

<h3 id="svg-namespace-declarations">SVG Namespace Declarations</h3>

<p>If youâ€™ve ever inspected the contents of an <code>.svg</code> file, like one created by Inkscape or some other vector image program, you may have seen this <code>xmlns</code> attribute on the <code>svg</code> element itself:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;svg</span> <span>xmlns=</span><span>"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is known as a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Namespaces_Crash_Course#declaring_namespaces">namespace declaration</a>. In simple terms, a namespace declaration helps a user agent like your browser to understand and parse an elementâ€™s syntax. Here, weâ€™ve declared that our namespace is SVG. A namespace declaration is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/18468348/5323344">not required if youâ€™re rendering inline SVG icons</a>, like in HTML. But if youâ€™re including SVG <em>files</em> (e.g., as an image), then the SVG does need to specify its namespace. Iâ€™ll omit the namespace in this tutorial since we donâ€™t need one.</p>

<h3 id="svg-viewbox-and-size">SVG <code>viewBox</code> and Size</h3>

<p>Youâ€™ve probably also seen these three attributes: <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, and <code>viewBox</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;svg</span>
  <span>viewBox=</span><span>"0 0 24 24"</span>
  <span>width=</span><span>"24"</span>
  <span>height=</span><span>"24"</span>
<span>&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Basically, the <code>viewBox</code> attribute defines <strong>the dimensions of the viewport (â€œcanvasâ€�) for our SVG</strong>. The first two numbers allow us to pan the SVG viewport horizontally or vertically, giving it an appearance of some sort of inner offset relative to the origin, <code>(0, 0)</code>. Here, we have an offset of <code>0 0</code>, meaning the top-left corner of the viewport <em>is</em> the origin, <code>(0, 0)</code>. The last two numbers control the base size of the viewport, before the SVG is scaled. Larger numbers lead to a larger viewport and more space to work with, while smaller numbers lead to a smaller viewport and less space to work with. Here, the viewport size is declared to be <code>24x24</code>, so our coordinates range from <code>(0, 0)</code> (top-left) to <code>(24, 24)</code> (bottom-right):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/assets/images/posts/svg-tutorial-how-to-code-svg-icons-by-hand/coordinates.png"><picture>
    <source srcset="https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/assets/images/posts/svg-tutorial-how-to-code-svg-icons-by-hand/coordinates-placeholder.webp" type="image/webp" data-srcset="/assets/images/posts/svg-tutorial-how-to-code-svg-icons-by-hand/coordinates.webp">
    <img src="https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/assets/images/posts/svg-tutorial-how-to-code-svg-icons-by-hand/coordinates.png" alt="An SVG's coordinate system has an origin of (0, 0) at the top-left corner. For an SVG whose viewBox is 0 0 24 24, the bottom-right corner is at (24, 24)." data-src="/assets/images/posts/svg-tutorial-how-to-code-svg-icons-by-hand/coordinates.png">
  </picture></a></p>

<p>The other two attributes, <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>, work just as youâ€™d expect: They define the width and height of your SVG element, in pixels. You can also change an SVGâ€™s size with CSS using <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>, so while the SVG above has a starting width and height of <code>24px</code>, it doesnâ€™t <em>always</em> have to be that size. Thatâ€™s the whole point of SVG, after allâ€”they can scale to <em>any</em> size!</p>

<p>Moreover, note that the the width and height of an SVG donâ€™t need to match the <code>viewBox</code>â€™s size. In fact, the coordinates of all SVG shapes that we draw are relative to the <code>viewBox</code>, not to the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> of the SVG.</p>

<p>For example, if our <code>viewBox</code> is <code>0 0 24 24</code> but weâ€™ve set the width and height to be <code>32</code>, or some other number, then weâ€™re still working within a base viewport size of <code>24x24</code>, so thereâ€™s no visible point like <code>(25, 25)</code>. Everything will just get scaled up by a factor of <code>1.3</code> to give us a bigger SVG drawing. This is really useful because it means we can draw all of our icons using a fixed viewport size, and if we later want to scale it up, we donâ€™t have to adjust the shapes and their coordinatesâ€”the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> will scale everything for us.</p>

<p>For this tutorial, Iâ€™ll use a <code>viewBox</code> of <code>0 0 24 24</code>, but dimensions of <code>64x64</code> so theyâ€™re easier to see. You can use any values that you want, though, so long as you adjust your markup accordingly.</p>

<h3 id="svgs-and-pixels">SVGs and â€œPixelsâ€�</h3>

<p>Before we move on, a clarifying note on pixels and SVGs: With the most basic SVG, one pixel unit maps to exactly one unit on your screen. But as noted on the MDN docs, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Positions#what_are_pixels">this isnâ€™t always the case</a>. SVGs are scalable, after all, so <code>1px</code> in the SVG definition may actually map to <code>4px</code> if the SVG has been scaled to a larger size with <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>. This is unlike the behavior of images, where one â€œpixelâ€� is always a fixed-size unit of measurement. Key takeaway: Wherever I use <code>px</code> as a unit, donâ€™t take that to mean one literal output pixel on the userâ€™s screen.</p>

<h2 id="creating-basic-shapes-with-svg">Creating Basic Shapes with SVG</h2>

<p>The best way to learn how to draw SVG icons by hand is to work with basic shapes. To get started, weâ€™ll draw some icons using lines. This will get us familiar with some of the basics of SVG before we dive into more advanced shapes.</p>

<h3 id="1-lines">1. Lines</h3>

<p>Weâ€™ll practice our line-drawing skills by recreating the three icons below. Youâ€™ll find these in lots of text editors that offer text alignment options, so while this exercise may seem trivial, itâ€™s actually very practical:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="64" height="64">
      <line x1="2" y1="4.2" x2="22" y2="4.2"></line>
      <line x1="2" y1="9.4" x2="16" y2="9.4"></line>
      <line x1="2" y1="14.6" x2="22" y2="14.6"></line>
      <line x1="2" y1="19.8" x2="16" y2="19.8"></line>
    </svg>
  </li>
  <li>
    <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="64" height="64">
      <line x1="2" y1="4.2" x2="22" y2="4.2"></line>
      <line x1="6" y1="9.4" x2="18" y2="9.4"></line>
      <line x1="2" y1="14.6" x2="22" y2="14.6"></line>
      <line x1="6" y1="19.8" x2="18" y2="19.8"></line>
    </svg>
  </li>
  <li>
    <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="64" height="64">
      <line x1="2" y1="4.2" x2="22" y2="4.2"></line>
      <line x1="8" y1="9.4" x2="22" y2="9.4"></line>
      <line x1="2" y1="14.6" x2="22" y2="14.6"></line>
      <line x1="8" y1="19.8" x2="22" y2="19.8"></line>
    </svg>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, these all consist of just four horizontal lines.</p>

<p>To draw a line in SVG, we need two things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A starting point: <code>(x1, y1)</code>.</li>
  <li>An ending point: <code>(x2, y2)</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a reminder, an SVGâ€™s coordinate system starts with <code>(0, 0)</code> at the top-left corner. The <code>x</code>-values increase as you move to the right, and the <code>y</code>-values increase as you move down.</p>

<p>SVGs allow us to specify the starting and ending points for lines using four attributes: <code>x1</code>, <code>y1</code>, <code>x2</code>, and <code>y2</code>. So, to draw a simple horizontal line, we could do the following:</p>


<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;svg</span> <span>viewBox=</span><span>"0 0 24 24"</span> <span>width=</span><span>"64"</span> <span>height=</span><span>"64"</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;line</span> <span>x1=</span><span>"0"</span> <span>y1=</span><span>"4.2"</span> <span>x2=</span><span>"24"</span> <span>y2=</span><span>"4.2"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/svg&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can think of this as telling the browser to put an imaginary pen down at <code>(0px, 4.2px)</code> and move it right until it reaches <code>(24px, 4.2px)</code>.</p>

<p>If you use this markup on your end, you wonâ€™t see anything just yet. Thatâ€™s because we havenâ€™t told the browser what color to use for the line! There are two ways we can do this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Setting the <code>stroke</code> attribute on the SVG element or any of its individual shapes.</li>
  <li>Setting the <code>stroke</code> property via CSS, on the SVG element or any of its shapes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both will do the same thing, but I prefer the CSS approach since it means writing less code. You can either pass in a hard-coded color, like a hex value, or use the magic <code>currentColor</code> value:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>svg</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>stroke</span><span>:</span> <span>currentColor</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In CSS, <code>currentColor</code> always references the current text <code>color</code>, which is either the color inherited from the parent or whatever color youâ€™ve explicitly defined for that element. I prefer <code>currentColor</code> for SVGs, as it makes it easy for me to insert my icons anywhere I want, and theyâ€™ll inherit the surrounding text color. Moreover, if that text color is set using CSS custom properties, <code>currentColor</code> will change whenever the custom property changes! This is useful for styling SVG icons in apps that have both a light and a dark mode (like this …</p></div></article></div></div>

The sensor is in the small window near the “SpotON” port.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=15&amp;v=hs0FdiTHMbc">Video explanation</a> of the principal of operation.</p></div>
<p>About a year ago, my girlfriend says, “I think we can sequence DNA in our extra room.” She showed me the website of Oxford Nanopore, which makes a USB DNA sequencer. We joked about it for a bit and that was that.</p>
<p>Until October, when I decided to buy her one for Christmas. I punched my credit card into their nice online store and waited for my shipping confirmation, which never arrived. Finally, I emailed them and found out I needed to join their “community.” At this point, I should mention that I’m not a biologist and I’m certainly not qualified to join a community of researchers. And they wanted to have a phone call. And this thing had better arrive by Dec. 25.</p>
<p>So I fessed up to my girlfriend (who has a PhD in genetics) and she wrote me a notecard with exactly what to say. I studied up. The day comes and I’m all nervous. The rep, I’ll call her Alice, phones and I proudly explain all the things I’m going to do, straight off my notecard.</p>
<p>Then Alice starts asking questions. I was not prepared for questions. Do I have a temperature controlled fridge? Duh, of course (in the kitchen)<span id="easy-footnote-1-233"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-233" title="it wasn&amp;#8217;t and we soon acquired a new fridge"><sup>1</sup></a></span> A freezer? Yes obviously<span id="easy-footnote-2-233"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-233" title="yeah we bought a new one of those too"><sup>2</sup></a></span>. A centrifuge and thermocycler? “Uh sure yeah I have that<span id="easy-footnote-3-233"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-233" title="hope that thing I just claimed to own isn&amp;#8217;t too expensive"><sup>3</sup></a></span>.” Then Alice started asking questions about my research. Uh oh. I repeat something about bacterial colonies from my card but she isn’t buying it. I manage to get out that I understand this isn’t a spit-in-the-tube-and-done thing and that’s all I’ve got. She keeps pushing and I eventually admit that I’m really buying it for my girlfriend for Christmas. Apparently that’s okay, since once Alice finishes laughing she said that it will arrive by Dec. 25 but they don’t offer a gift-wrap service.</p>
<p>The box arrives, packed in some sweet dry ice stuff. Dec. 25 comes and I get a set of pipettes and a PCR machine.</p>
<p>The obvious thing to sequence is one of us but the MinION can only do 1-2 billion bases per run<span id="easy-footnote-4-233"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-233" title="in our hands; Oxford Nanopore <a href=&quot;https://nanoporetech.com/products/minion&quot;>claims 10-20 Gb now</a>"><sup>4</sup></a></span>; to have decent quality for a human you need more like 90 billion <span id="easy-footnote-5-233"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-5-233" title="there&amp;#8217;s a lot of variables here, go read this: <a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4060&quot;>Nanopore sequencing and assembly of a human genome with ultra-long reads</a>"><sup>5</sup></a></span>. We decide to swab our mouths before brushing our teeth and find out what’s in there. My girlfriend whips up some media, we plop our swabs in, and put the tubes in the $30 chicken egg incubator she found on Amazon. Two days later I’m informed that the cultures smell like “really really bad breath,” and that I “really ought to smell them for myself,” which I studiously avoid for the next two months.</p>
<p>With the help of a <a href="https://greenbioresearch.com/product/genomic-dna-isolation-extraction-purification-kit-for-blood-bacteria-cell-tissue-samples/">$80 genomic DNA extraction kit</a>, we cut up the cells, filter all their bits out, and have genomic DNA ready to go. First we run a gel electrophoresis to prove to ourselves that we didn’t mess up the extraction too much.</p>
<p>At this step, all the real biologists out there are assuming I’m going to talk about quantifying the DNA to make sure we had the right concentration before blowing a $500 flow-cell (the consumable part of the MinION) on this. Yeah, that would be a lot of work and the line is pretty bright in the gel…</p>
<p>We open the fridge to get out the sequencer’s flow-cell and notice that everything is frozen. Oh %$@*#@#*. I set the fridge to “10” because that seemed like a good idea. Alice definitely isn’t going to buy my warranty-return story. Two days later we’ve got a new thermometer and are praying that 100 freeze-thaw cycles are, uh, totally fine.</p>
<p>Happily the MinION comes with a calibration program that doesn’t seem to notice our substandard storage: all green. At this point we discover that Oxford Nanopore helpfully sends everyone a set of sample DNA to run first. We decide that sounds like a really good idea.</p>
<p>The promotional videos for the MinION claim, “simple 10 minute setup.” About two hours later, we’ve done the library prep, and we’re pipetting into the device. There are lots of warnings on their webpage about how you really can’t let air into the thing (permanent destruction of the flow-cell, blah blah). So of course the first thing we do is introduce an air bubble. But it only covers half the sensor. I think it’s the most expensive 5µL of air I’ve ever seen.</p>
<p>It turns out the sequencer produces so much data the minimum requirements are a 1TB SSD and a quad-core CPU. My girlfriend’s laptop has 200 GB and a dual core, so that will have to suffice. We fire it up and it starts producing reads. We’re over the moon. 6-hours later the run finishes, but only 10% of the bases have been “called.” The way the system works is by reading tiny changes in electric current as the molecules pass through the nanopore. Apparently the signal processing is kind of hard because 2 days later it’s still going. I play Overwatch by myself.</p>
<p><video autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" width="99%" height="150"><source src="https://i.imgur.com/Mlg4V3f.mp4"></video><br>
<em>Sequencing. You can see the 512 ports on the laptop screen. Approximately half are green (sequencing or waiting for DNA) and the other half are blue (air-bubbled).</em></p>
<p>The Oxford Nanopore website supports automated uploading and analysis of some datasets, including the calibration run. <a href="http://www.abarry.org/likelytobeforgotten/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Selection_120.png">Our run</a> produced 983 million (aligned) base pairs, which any professionals reading this are scoffing at, but I’m pretty sure Celera circa 2000 would have been impressed. I certainly am. The last time I did anything close to this, we tested PTC tasting with a gel electrophoresis that took all day and effectively sequenced 1 base. We prep and load our mouth-bacteria genomic DNA into the sequencer. We’re reusing the flow-cell to save money and it’s hard to load correctly. We’re all paranoid about air bubbles now, but there’s a ton of them in the little fluid pipes. Eventually we look at each other, shrug, and put the sample in. It goes nowhere.</p>
<p>The library prep includes adding “loading beads” to the sample which give the liquid a ghostly white color. You can see if your sample is on the sensor by tracking the movement of that color, and ours clearly was stuck on the top of the port. Eventually we searched the forums and found someone else incompetent enough to have the same problem, with a solution that can be summarized as, “pull some liquid out of a different port and hope.” It worked great.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For a few last years I’ve been learning programming in various languages, on and off, with more or less success. Some languages that I’ve tried include Python, Java, Haskell and even JavaScript. And of course Clojure. But it has been going slowly, not because those languages (or programming in general) are hard. It’s because I lacked consistency in doing things on regular basis due to lack of time and energy; I’ve often been mentally exhausted at my regular IT work. Here’s how I finally managed to organize myself and actually started getting it!</p><h3 id="ancient-history">Ancient history</h3><p>I’ve been interested in computers for most of my life. It can be shortly described as ‘power user’ e.g. <em>system configuration, setup, various audio/video editing tools…</em>, but I’ve never really took up programming until 2017. (You can read about my contemporary views <a href="https://savo.rocks/posts/an-unexpected-toolbox-for-a-beginner-programmer/" target="_blank">here</a>). Back then I managed to learn some Python syntax, but it all came down to following the materials I have been learning from, and I gave up after some time. In the meantime I have been dabbling with various languages and technologies, but never crossed the chasm to serious work beyond tutorials and books.</p><h3 id="recent-development">Recent development</h3><p>When I wasn’t trying to learn programming I was playing guitar with various bands I had and worked in several companies on various positions in IT departments. Those positions included various tasks such as system administration &amp; maintenance, vendor coordination and even IT support call-center coordination. During that time I still managed to dabble with programming irregularly, mostly with Clojure because I liked how it doesn’t get in my way. It can be set up almost instantly and the syntax is very minimal, which lets me concentrate on shaping my ideas into code. But very often the workload was big enough to keep me from programming constantly, so I didn’t get very far. However, recently I decided to concentrate on programming, as I realized that it brings me much joy, even when I am completely lost in the process, because when I overcome obstacles it feels phenomenal.</p><h3 id="current-situation">Current situation</h3><p>I discovered a one-step-beyond-basics book that suits my needs perfectly: <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/dswdcloj3" target="_blank">Web Development with Clojure</a> and bought a copy. I’m getting serious now :) Currently, the book is in beta, but it is expected to be finished very soon. This book shows in detail how to build modern web applications using various Clojure libraries. Clojure is different from other languages in that matter: it doesn’t have a <em>web-app framework</em>. Instead, the programmers combines various libraries which suit their particular needs.</p><h3 id="the-approach">The approach</h3><p>So, how is this time different than any other when I tried to learn programming? Read on.<br></p><ul><li>Walk the unwalked path: This time, instead of just following the book, I decided to explore the documentation of libraries that were introduced, and to try to experiment with them myself. There are often multiple libraries that serve the same purpose, and the author is kind enough to mention them in his book. One such example is two libraries for HTML templating: <a href="https://github.com/yogthos/Selmer" target="_blank">Selmer</a> which uses Django-like syntax, and <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup" target="_blank">Hiccup</a> which converts Clojure vectors to html, so <code>[:h1 "Hello There"]</code> becomes <code>&lt;h1&gt;Hello There&lt;/h1&gt;</code>. Hiccup-way seemed more attractive to me, so I decided to write the whole template in in, and I have learned more doing that, than I have ever learned following book-code. I was forced to try various approaches out, read the documentation, ask around online for solutions and in the end I felt I understand what I wrote much better.</li><li>Do things regularly: There is a wise saying which goes something like: <em>it is better to perform average every day, than to be excellent once in a while</em>. OK, it probably sounds better than I wrote it, but the point is there. I try to follow it, and to program every day for 6-8 hours. I realized that sometimes can be difficult to even start, so I start my programming day by doing <u>one</u> <a href="https://www.4clojure.com/" target="_blank">4clojure</a> exercise per day. This helps me to get <em>warmed-up</em> as I can start solving the problem immediately, because the tasks usually require just using the right Clojure function (or combination of functions), so I make sure to search this awesome <a href="https://jafingerhut.github.io/cheatsheet/clojuredocs/cheatsheet-tiptip-cdocs-summary.html" target="_blank">Clojure Cheatsheet</a> for the functions that I’ll use, and usually manage to find them. After that I just open my project, the book and code away!</li><li>Revisit previous chapters: I like to come back a little after some time to re-read previous materials to see if I’ll have new insight and maybe notice something that I missed the first time when I read the chapter. Usually there are <em>a-ha</em> moments, and makes this part very valuable in the process.</li></ul><p>The book guides reader through building a microblogging platform, kind of like a social network, where multiple users can have their message boards and interact with each other, have their feeds, etc. The first few chapters deal with crash-course setting up a page where all the messages are displayed (no multiple users), and the form for entering a message is present, then it moves on to teach about core components of a web app (creating web server, request routing, handling, middleware…), another chapter deals with what <a href="https://luminusweb.com/" target="_blank">Luminus</a> templating library provides, then it moves on to using ClojureScript for SPA approach, which teaches very powerful and modern concepts. I decided to build something like a <em>beer-log</em> application, where I will keep track of craft beers that I’ve tried. I wanted to do something different, rather than following book paren-for-paren. Who knows, maybe my beer app will someday be good as, I don’t know, <a href="https://untappd.com/" target="_blank">Untappd</a> maybe?</p></div></div>]]>

<h3><strong>How our for-profit company became a nonprofit, to better tackle the digital divide.</strong></h3>



<p><em>Originally posted on the <a href="https://www.endlessos.org/blog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Endless OS Foundation blog</a>.</em></p>



<h4><strong>An 8-year journey to a nonprofit</strong></h4>



<p>On the 1st of April 2020, our for-profit Endless Mobile officially became a nonprofit as the Endless OS Foundation. Our launch as a nonprofit just as the global pandemic took hold was, predictably, hardly noticed, but for us the timing was incredible: as the world collectively asked â€œWhat can we do to help others in need?â€�, we framed our mission statement and launched our .org with the same very important question in mind. Endless always had a social impact mission at its heart, and the challenges related to students, families, and communities falling further into the digital divide during COVID-19 brought new urgency and purpose to our teamâ€™s decision to officially step in the social welfare space.</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>On April 1st 2020, our for-profit Endless Mobile officially became a nonprofit as the Endless OS Foundation, focused on the #DigitalDivide.</strong></p></blockquote>



<p>Our updated status was a long time coming: we began our transformation to a nonprofit organization in late 2019 with the realization that the true charter and passions of our team would be greatly accelerated without the constraints of for-profit goals, investors and sales strategies standing in the way of our mission of digital access and equity for all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But for 8 years we made a go of it commercially, headquartered in Silicon Valley and framing ourselves as a tech startup with access to the venture capital and partnerships on our doorstep. We believed that a successful commercial channel would be the most efficient way to scale the impact of bringing computer devices and access to communities in need. We still believe this – weâ€™ve just learned through our experience that we donâ€™t have the funding to enter the computer and OS marketplace head-on. With the social impact goal first, and the hope of any revenue a secondary goal, we have had many successes in those 8 years bridging the digital divide throughout the world, from Brazil, to Kenya, and the USA. Weâ€™ve learned a huge amount which will go on to inform our strategy as a nonprofit.</p>



<blockquote id="viewer-9s0us"><p><strong>Endless always had a social impact mission at its heart. COVID-19 brought new urgency and purpose to our teamâ€™s decision to officially step in the social welfare space</strong>.</p></blockquote>



<h4><strong>Our unique perspective</strong></h4>



<p>One thing we learned as a for-profit is that the OS and technology weâ€™ve built has some unique properties which are hugely impactful as a working solution to digital equity barriers. And our experience deploying in the field around the world for 8 years has left us uniquely informed via many iterations and incremental improvements.<br></p>

<p>With this knowledge in-hand, weâ€™ve been refining our strategy throughout 2020 and now starting to focus on what it really means to become an effective nonprofit and make that impact. In many ways it is liberating to abandon the goals and constraints of being a for-profit entity, and in other ways itâ€™s been a challenging journey for me and the team to adjust our way of thinking and let these for-profit notions and models go. Previously we exclusively built and sold a product that defined our success; and any impact we achieved was a secondary consequence of that success and seen through that lens. Now our success is defined purely in terms of social impact, and through our actions, those positive impacts can be made with <em>or without</em> our â€œproductâ€�. That means that we may develop and introduce technology to solve a problem, but it is equally as valid to find another organization’s existing offering and design a way to increase that positive impact and scale.</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>We develop technology to solve access equity issues, but it’s equally as valid to find another organization’s offering and partner in a way that increases their positive impact.</strong></p></blockquote>



<p>The analogy to Free and Open Source Software is very strong – while Endless has always used and contributed to a wide variety of FOSS projects, weâ€™ve also had a tension where weâ€™ve been trying to hold some pieces back and capture value – such as our own application or content ecosystem, our own hardware platform – necessarily making us competitors to other organisations even though they were hoping to achieve the same things as us. As a nonprofit we can let these ideas go and just pick the best partners and technologies to help the people weâ€™re trying to reach.</p>



<figure><a href="https://ramcq.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/01/231_Students_Endless-OS-Foundation_unsplash.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="347" height="231" src="https://ramcq.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/01/231_Students_Endless-OS-Foundation_unsplash.jpg" alt="School kids writing on paper" srcset="https://ramcq.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/01/231_Students_Endless-OS-Foundation_unsplash.jpg 347w, https://ramcq.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/01/231_Students_Endless-OS-Foundation_unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 347px) 100vw, 347px"></a></figure>



<h4>Digital equity â€¦ 4 barriers we need to overcome</h4>



<p>In future, our decisions around which projects to build or engage with will revolve around 4 barriers to digital equity, and how our Endless OS, Endless projects, or our partnersâ€™ offerings can help to solve them. We define these 4 equity barriers as: barriers to <strong>devices</strong>, barriers to <strong>connectivity</strong>, barriers to <strong>literacy</strong> in terms of your ability to use the technology, and barriers to <strong>engagement</strong> in terms of whether using the system is rewarding and worthwhile.</p>



<blockquote id="viewer-5r9ec"><p><strong>We define the 4 digital equity barriers we exist to impact as:</strong><br>1. barriers to <strong>devices</strong><br>2. barriers to <strong>connectivity</strong><br>3. barriers to <strong>literacy</strong><br>4. barriers to <strong>engagement</strong></p></blockquote>



<p>It doesnâ€™t matter who makes the solutions that break these barriers; what matters is how we assist in enabling people to use technology to gain access to the education and opportunities these barriers block. Our goal therefore is to simply ensure that solutions exist â€“ building them ourselves and with partners such as the FOSS community and other nonprofits â€“ proving them with real-world deployments, and sharing our results as widely as possible to allow for better adoption globally.</p>



<p>If we define our goal purely in terms of whether people are using Endless OS, we are effectively restricting the reach and scale of our solutions to the audience we can reach directly with Endless OS downloads, installs and propagation. Conversely, partnerships that scale impact are a win-win-win for us, our partners, and the communities we all serve.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Engineering impact</strong></h4>



<p>Our Endless engineering roots and capabilities feed our unique ability to build and deploy all of our solutions, and the practical experience of deploying them gives us evidence and credibility as we advocate for their use. Either activity would be weaker without the other.</p>



<blockquote id="viewer-1i0jh"><p><strong>Our engineering roots and capabilities feed our unique ability to build and deploy digital divide solutions.</strong></p></blockquote>



<p>Our partners in various engineering communities will have already seen our change in approach. Particularly, with GNOME we are working hard to invest in upstream and reconcile the long-standing differences between our experience and GNOME. If successful, many more people can benefit from our work than just users of Endless OS. Weâ€™re working with Learning Equality on Kolibri to build a better app experience for Linux desktop users and bring content publishers into our ecosystem for the first time, and weâ€™ve also taken our very own Hack, the immersive and fun destination for kids learning to code, released it for non-Endless systems <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.hack_computer.Clubhouse">on Flathub</a>, and made it fully open-source.</p>



<figure><a href="https://ramcq.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/01/231_Planning_Endless-OS-Foundation_unsplash.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="347" height="231" src="https://ramcq.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/01/231_Planning_Endless-OS-Foundation_unsplash.jpg" alt="Planning tasks with sticky notes on a whiteboard" srcset="https://ramcq.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/01/231_Planning_Endless-OS-Foundation_unsplash.jpg 347w, https://ramcq.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/01/231_Planning_Endless-OS-Foundation_unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 347px) 100vw, 347px"></a></figure>



<h4><strong>Whatâ€™s next for our OS?</strong></h4>



<p>What then is in store for the future of Endless OS, the place where we have invested so much time and planning through years of iterations? For the immediate future, we need the capacity to deploy everything weâ€™ve built â€“ all at once, to our partners. We built an OS that we feel is very unique and valuable, containing a number of world-firsts: first production OS shipped with OSTree, first Flatpak-only desktop, built-in support for updating OS and apps from USBs, while still providing a great deal of reliability and convenience for deployments in offline and educational-safe environments with great apps and content loaded on every system.</p>



<p>However, we need to find a way to deliver this Linux-based experience in a more efficient way, and weâ€™d love to talk if you have ideas about how we can do this, perhaps as partners. Can the idea of â€œEndless OSâ€� evolve to become a spec that is provided by different platforms in the future, maybe remixes of Debian, Fedora, openSUSE or Ubuntu?&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Build, Validate, Advocate</strong></h4>



<p>Beyond the OS, the Endless OS Foundation has identified multiple programs to help underserved communities, and in each case we are adopting our â€œbuild, validate, advocateâ€� strategy. This approach underpins all of our projects: can we <strong>build</strong> the technology (or assist in the making), will a community in-need <strong>validate</strong> it by adoption, and can we inspire others by telling the story and <strong>advocating</strong> for its wider use?</p>



<blockquote id="viewer-3t3do"><p><strong>We are adopting a â€œbuild, validate, advocateâ€� strategy.</strong><br>1. <strong>build</strong> the technology (or assist in the making)<br>2. <strong>validate</strong> by community adoption<br>3. <strong>advocate</strong> for its wider use</p></blockquote>



<p>As examples, we have just launched the Endless Key (link) as an offline solution for students during the COVID-19 at-home distance learning challenges. This project is also establishing a first-ever partnership of well-known online educational brands to reach an underserved offline audience with valuable learning resources. We are developing a pay-as-you-go platform and new partnerships that will allow families to own laptops via micro-payments that are built directly into the operating system, even if they cannot qualify for standard retail financing. And during the pandemic, weâ€™ve partnered with Teach For America to focus on very practical digital equity needs in the USAâ€™s urban and rural communities.</p>



<h4><strong>One part of the world-wide digital divide solution</strong></h4>



<p>We are one solution provider for the complex matrix of issues known collectively as the #DigitalDivide, and these issues will not disappear after the pandemic. Digital equity was an issue long before COVID-19, and we are not so naive to think it can be solved by any single institution, or by the time the pandemic recedes. It will take time and a coalition of partnerships to win. We are in for …</p></div></div>

              </p> <p>o what is a species? In the seventeenth century, European thinkers proposed that a group of organisms that could breed with each other could be called a species. A century on, Carl Linnaeus, the pioneering Swedish naturalist, popularised the use of combining two Latin terms: first the name of the genus,
            <a href="" onclick="return!1">
              <sup id="u7ivdfqvucs5">[8]</sup>
            </a>
           then that of the species. The yellow-eyed bush frog has the name <em>Raorchestes </em>because it signifies the genus <em>Raorchestes</em>, which encompasses almost 65 species of bush frogs mostly from South Asia; <em>flaviocularis</em>&nbsp;is its species.</p></div><p>For all this time, scientists have been having furious arguments about the best way to classify species. There are presently more than 30 approaches to define a species, variously based in ancestry, ecology, appearances, even sound. The general consensus these days is to take an “integrative” approach. So Vijay started off with <em>flaviocularis</em>’s distinct looks––its morphology––and then worked on tracing its family tree in the DNA lab. The distinctiveness of its metallic calls, as well as its geographical distribution, helped along the hypothesis that <em>flaviocularis</em> was a species that hadn’t been described previously.</p><p>“Documenting the existence of a species is the first step to understanding our biodiversity,” Shanker said. It’s an exciting field because there is so much we don’t know. Ecologists have terms of art associated with these knowledge gaps. The Linnean Shortfall refers to the problem of undescribed lineages. A Wallacean Shortfall
            <a href="" onclick="return!1">
              <sup id="wszrks8kngx3">[9]</sup>
            </a>
           refers to the lack of information about a species’ geographical distribution. “These shortfalls are the starting point for our exploration of ecology and evolution. There are lots of questions that can be answered once both these knowledge gaps are addressed,” said Shanker.</p><p>One set of questions is evolutionary in nature: Where did a species originate? If it started from Africa, how did it find its way into Asia and diversify? That’s how we got Asian elephants for instance: fossil remains indicate that the first elephant ancestors originated in Africa during the geological epoch known as the Early Pliocene.
            <a href="" onclick="return!1">
              <sup id="hfc0ff8tqwol">[10]</sup>
            </a>
           Recent genetic and fossil studies now confirm that their descendants moved into Asia 2-4 million years ago, and gave rise to the modern Asian elephant just 2.5 lakh years ago.</p><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><p>Geographic barriers such as deep gorges and wide rivers also affect dispersal, and can isolate populations. The gaps and valleys of the Western Ghats explain why there are so many different kinds of bush frogs. A species’ own ability to move around determines the kind of places it eventually gets to: birds are likelier than frogs to move from one mountain to another, for example.</p><p>Then they could ask after ecological factors such as rainfall, temperature and altitude, gradients along which species can adapt and evolve into different groups. </p></div><p>Finally, there are questions related to conservation. Research may focus on the availability of a type of plant if it appears that a species relies on it for survival. This data is analysed to help us approach answers to speculative questions like: what could happen to the species a hundred years from now; how would they adapt to climate change? </p><p>One of the things that is clear after a couple of centuries of study is that the species richness of a region increases as you move from the poles to the tropics. Within the tropics, you get “biodiversity hotspots.”

           These are sites that represent only 2.4% of the earth’s land surface, support more than 40% of endemic fauna, and are threatened by human habitation.</p><p>The Himalayas, with an estimated 10,000 species of plants including more than 3,100 endemics, is one of them. The states of north-eastern India that form part of the larger Indo-Burma hotspot are another. But easily the most well-studied hotspot in India is the Western Ghats.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><section data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><p data-v-2fd21b62=""><h3>Two</h3></p> <div data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><p>

              </p> <p>he Western Ghats stretch almost parallel to India’s west coast. They variously constitute about 1600kms of sparse and dense forests, blue mountains, steep cliffs, thorny bushes, flat plateaus, leech-ridden swamps and windy grasslands. At one end, they start as shrub-bearing hillocks about 10km north of India’s southernmost tip. Then, they become the Ashambu Hills, mighty granite mountains forming a natural border between Tamil Nadu and Kerala, and in the shadow of which lie spice gardens and homesteads.</p></div><p>Then comes the Shencottah Gap. After those 7km, the Ghats rise again to form the Meghamalai Hills, home of <em>flaviocularis</em>, the yellow-eyed bush frog. These are followed by a small plateau which leads to the hills of Palani and Anamalai. Cardamom, coffee and tea plantations blanket the slopes here. Look up, and mist permitting, you can see some of the tallest peaks in the south—“sky islands,” hosting ecosystems wildly different from those of the surrounding lowlands. In the shallow valleys of these highlands, naturally stunted forests known as the “sholas” occur alongside open grassland patches. </p><p>North of the Anamalais come the Nilgiris. But first, there’s a deep valley. At 32km wide, 100m above sea level, the Palghat Gap is the widest and lowest pass in the Ghats. A dusty national highway cuts right through it, connecting Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu and Palakkad in Kerala.</p><p>Beyond, the Ghats stretch into north Kerala and Karnataka, its high peaks separated occasionally by shallow valleys. They almost kiss the Arabian Sea before swerving east into Goa. By the time they taper off amidst the sugarcane fields of Maharashtra, they are less imposing and more climbable, now ambling along until they reach their other end in the deciduous forest tracts of south Gujarat.&nbsp; </p><p>The remarkable contiguity broken by wide gaps and valleys, the sheer range of landscapes, the distance covered: all this should indicate why the Ghats are a species discovery hotspot. They comprise less than 6% of India’s land area but are home to more than 30% of all plant, fish, amphibian, reptile, bird and mammal species found in the country. Of the 406 known frog and toad species in India, more than 200 are endemic to the Ghats. Over a hundred of these endemics have been discovered only in the last 20 years. </p></div></div></div></div></section></div><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><section data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><p data-v-2fd21b62=""><h3>Three</h3></p> <div data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><p>

              </p> <p>NA-based techniques have transformed new species research across the world. Uma Ramakrishnan, a conservation geneticist and professor at Bengaluru’s National Centre for Biological Sciences who led the genetic component of the research on sholakilis and chilappans, told me that India was still heavily reliant on morphological methods and distribution information till about a decade ago. Now there’s a whole suite of new technologies, including better computational and simulation programmes, that have popularised the use of genetic techniques to answer ecological questions. These technologies both advance and confirm the educated hunches researchers develop as they work.</p></div><p>There’s a flip side to this, too: taxonomic inflation, the over-categorisation of newly sighted animals. Some experts feel that researchers have begun claiming the tag of “new species” in cases where it is clearly unwarranted. Robin Kurian Abraham, a researcher at the University of Kansas, told me that the “overinflation” problem afflicts some Indian frog lineages too. Often, “new species” might just be sub-species, or different populations of the same species. “Why is it that we rarely hear of sub-species in frogs? There are even five extant sub-species of tigers across the world,” Abraham asked me.</p><p>The ‘species versus sub-species’ debate has been raging for years. Take the world of wolf taxonomy as an example. The grey wolf (<em>Canis lupus)</em> is found in most parts of the world. In 2018, a paper published in <em>Global Ecology and Conservation</em> by a team of researchers led by Geraldine Werhahn created a splash. DNA analysis using scat and hair samples of the Himalayan wolf had revealed a genetic adaptation to cope with the lower oxygen levels of high altitudes.</p><p>It provided a massive shot in the arm to the theory that the Himalayan wolf is evolutionarily distinct: its lineage diverged before the radiation of the modern grey wolf. But the journey to species-hood is long and arduous. In February last year, Werhahn told <em>The Guardian</em> that researchers needed to obtain one final piece of higher-quality genomic data for the separate species case to succeed with the International Union for Conservation of Nature or IUCN, the global organisation which evaluates and assesses conservation status. That quest is still on.</p></div></div></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

But, when compared to optical approaches, radar resolution is challenging, especially at orbital altitude due to the large physical antenna sizes necessary for handling electromagnetic waves 4,000x longer than visible light. To improve resolution, <a href="https://medium.com/the-downlinq/sar-101-an-introduction-to-synthetic-aperture-radar-2f0b6246c4a0" target="_blank">Synthetic Aperture Radar</a> (SAR) combines data from multiple radar pulses as a platform moves past a target, creating images with resolutions comparable to an infeasibly large <a href="http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/terrain/radariii.html" target="_blank">real aperture radar</a>. (Another way to visualize SAR is that it works similarly to <a href="https://www.radartutorial.eu/06.antennas/Phased%20Array%20Antenna.en.html" target="_blank">phased-array antennas,</a> but multiplexes a single antenna in time relative to a stationary target vs multiple antennas in space relative to a moving target.) SAR, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic-aperture_radar#History" target="_blank">first developed in the ‘50s</a> for military applications, has led to important scientific findings, such as the <a href="https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/magellan/guide5.html" target="_blank">terrain imaging of Venus</a> and the detection of liquid hydrocarbon lakes on Titan (<a href="http://lunar.earth.northwestern.edu/courses/450/titanlakes.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a>). Today’s SAR systems have increased resolution and decreased cost, leading to a boom in smallsat SAR data from multiple new providers, including <a href="https://www.ursaspace.com/" target="_blank">Ursa</a>, <a href="https://www.capellaspace.com/" target="_blank">Capella</a>, <a href="https://www.iceye.com/" target="_blank">ICEYE</a>, <a href="https://i-qps.net/" target="_blank">iQPS</a>, <a href="https://www.predasar.com/" target="_blank">PredaSAR</a>, <a href="https://synspective.com/" target="_blank">Synspective</a>, and <a href="https://umbra.space/" target="_blank">Umbra</a> (who <a href="https://spacenews.com/umbra-raises-32-million/" target="_blank">just raised $32 million in additional funding</a>). Capella Space is one of the industry leaders with resolutions of 50cm x 50cm from a 10-meter antenna deployed from a ~40kg smallsat (two of these were on Transporter-1, see below). According to Capella's lead SAR scientist, this resolution would require a real aperture radar of 49 km (yes, <em>kilo</em>meters). SAR resolution along the orbital ground track (aka “azimuth” or “cross-range” resolution) is determined by radar pulse processing frequency—and therefore doesn't degrade with altitude, unlike optical and real aperture radar—, while the side looking "range" resolution is primarily determined by the radar's wavelength (many high-res SAR platforms use the ~3 cm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_band" target="_blank">8–12 GHz X-band</a>, including Capella). SAR's drawbacks include vertical height distortion (called layover and foreshortening) and shadowing due to its side-looking orientation in relation to the craft's ground track (SAR cannot look straight down). SAR is also unable to accurately observe moving targets and can produce significant amounts of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speckle_(interference)" target="_blank">speckling</a>” and noise due to reflectance from rough surfaces and corners (a good <a href="https://youtu.be/u2bUKEi9It4" target="_blank">recent video overview</a> of SAR). But, its side-looking orientation enables its high range (or “cross-track”) resolution, and when paired with elevation maps it can be used to reconstruct 3D models of the observation area—an <a href="https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/join-mission/training/english/introduction-synthetic-aperture-radar" target="_blank">intro to SAR course from NASA</a>. Commercial applications of high-resolution SAR data have been speculated on (including your usual suspects of maritime tracking, crop monitoring, defense intelligence, and climate, with compelling all-weather natural disaster response added to the mix), but we don’t have many examples of real-world commercial use-cases just yet. Related: the <a href="https://asf.alaska.edu/#" target="_blank">Alaska Satellite Facility</a> has a good repository of SAR data available if you’d like to experiment with some yourself.</p></div><!--[if mso]> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]></table><![endif]--></div><div><table><tbody><tr><td> <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/capella-space-releases-the-highest-resolution-commercial-sar-imagery-in-the-world-876646188.html" title="" target="_blank"> <img alt="" src="https://mcusercontent.com/e215b9e6f9a105b2c34f627a3/images/c4984c9b-9c36-45b2-aaea-f57a94b357f4.jpg" width="564"> </a></td></tr><tr><td><p>A <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/capella-space-releases-the-highest-resolution-commercial-sar-imagery-in-the-world-876646188.html" target="_blank">SAR image</a> of a floating Chinese solar farm including panels, apparently laid out to resemble a fish.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div> <!--[if mso]><table align="left" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" style="width:100%;"><tr> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]><td valign="top" width="600" style="width:600px;"> <![endif]--><div><p><a href="#all-the-missions-on-transporter-1">¶</a><strong id="all-the-missions-on-transporter-1">All the missions on Transporter-1.</strong> So what was in the flotilla of 143 satellites launched on SpaceX’s Jan 24th Transporter-1 rideshare mission?

<p><strong>Pipenv</strong> is a tool that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds (bundler, composer, npm, cargo, yarn, etc.) to the Python world. <em>Windows is a first-class citizen, in our world.</em></p>
<p>It automatically creates and manages a virtualenv for your projects, as well as adds/removes packages from your <code><span>Pipfile</span></code> as you install/uninstall packages. It also generates the ever-important <code><span>Pipfile.lock</span></code>, which is used to produce deterministic builds.</p>
<p>Pipenv is primarily meant to provide users and developers of applications with an easy method to setup a working environment. For the distinction between libraries and applications and the usage of <code><span>setup.py</span></code> vs <code><span>Pipfile</span></code> to define dependencies, see <a href="https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/advanced/#pipfile-vs-setuppy"><span>☤ Pipfile vs setup.py</span></a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jlusk/855d611bbcfa2b159839db73d07f6ce9/raw/7f5743401809f7e630ee8ff458faa980e19924a0/pipenv.gif"><img alt="a short animation of pipenv at work" src="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jlusk/855d611bbcfa2b159839db73d07f6ce9/raw/7f5743401809f7e630ee8ff458faa980e19924a0/pipenv.gif"></a></p><p>The problems that Pipenv seeks to solve are multi-faceted:</p>
<ul>
<li>You no longer need to use <code><span>pip</span></code> and <code><span>virtualenv</span></code> separately. They work together.</li>
<li>Managing a <code><span>requirements.txt</span></code> file can be problematic, so Pipenv uses <code><span>Pipfile</span></code> and <code><span>Pipfile.lock</span></code> to separate abstract dependency declarations from the last tested combination.</li>
<li>Hashes are used everywhere, always. Security. Automatically expose security vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Strongly encourage the use of the latest versions of dependencies to minimize security risks <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A9-Using_Components_with_Known_Vulnerabilities">arising from outdated components</a>.</li>
<li>Give you insight into your dependency graph (e.g. <code><span>$</span> <span>pipenv</span> <span>graph</span></code>).</li>
<li>Streamline development workflow by loading <code><span>.env</span></code> files.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can quickly play with Pipenv right in your browser:</p>

<h2>Install Pipenv Today!<a href="#install-pipenv-today" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you already have Python and pip, you can easily install Pipenv into your home directory:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>$ pip install --user pipenv
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Or, if you’re using Fedora 28:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>$ sudo dnf install pipenv
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It’s possible to install Pipenv with Homebrew on MacOS, or with Linuxbrew on Linux systems. However, <strong>this is now discouraged</strong>, because updates to the brewed Python distribution will break Pipenv, and perhaps all virtual environments managed by it. You’ll then need to re-install Pipenv at least. If you want to give it a try despite this warning, use:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a name="cut"></a>
I've been using Kubernetes for almost a year now and, to be honest, I like the experience so far. Most of my use cases were rather trivial and thanks to its declarative approach, Kubernetes makes deploying and scaling stateless services pretty simple. I usually just describe my application in a YAML file as a set of interconnected services, feed it to Kubernetes, and let the built-in <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/">control loops</a> bring the state of the cluster closer to the desired state by creating or destroying some resources for me automagically.</p>
<p>However, many times I've heard that <a href="https://www.lastweekinaws.com/podcast/screaming-in-the-cloud/the-staying-power-of-kubernetes-with-kelsey-hightower/">the real power of Kubernetes comes with its extensibility</a>. Kubernetes designed for automation. It brings a lot of useful automation out of the box. But it also provides extension points that can be used to customize Kubernetes capabilities. The cleverness of the Kubernetes design is that it encourages you to keep the extensions feel native! So when I stumbled upon the first few Kubernetes Operators on my Ops way, I could not even recognize that I'm dealing with custom logic...</p>
<p>In this article, I'll try to take a closer look at the Operators pattern, see which Kubernetes parts are involved in operators implementation, and what makes operators feel like first-class Kubernetes citizens. Of course, with as many pictures as possible.
<a name="eofcut"></a></p>
<h2 id="kubernetes-objects-and-controllers">Kubernetes Objects and Controllers</h2>
<p>Everything in Kubernetes seems to revolve around <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/">objects</a> and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/">controllers</a>.</p>
<p>Kubernetes objects such as Pods, Namespaces, ConfigMaps, or Events are persistent entities in the Kubernetes system. Kubernetes uses these entities to represent the state of your cluster. Objects are also used as "records of intent." By creating (or removing) objects one can describe the <em>desired</em> state of the Kubernetes cluster.</p>
<p><i>Objects are like data structures.</i></p>
<p>On the other hand, controllers are infinite loops that watch the <em>actual</em> and the <em>desired</em> states of your cluster. When these two states diverge, controllers start making changes aiming to bring the current state of the cluster closer to the desired one.</p>
<p><i>Controllers are like algorithms.</i></p>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/kubernetes-operator-pattern/kube-control-loop-3000-opt.png" width="100%" alt="Kubernetes Control Loop">
</p>

<p>I'll get to the controllers part later in this article and now let's focus on the objects.</p>
<h2 id="kubernetes-api-architecture">Kubernetes API Architecture</h2>
<p>All interactions with Kubernetes objects, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/client-libraries/">directly</a> or <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/">indirectly</a>, happen through <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/">Kubernetes API</a> - a highly structured masterpiece of software design.</p>
<p>There is a ton of documentation written on Kubernetes API and related topics and I spent quite some time digesting it. Since we are going to talk about the Kubernetes Operator pattern which heavily depends on the capabilities of the Kubernetes API, it's important to familiarize ourselves with the API design principles first. Following is my super-condensed excerpt from the docs.</p>
<p>Kubernetes offers a RESTful declarative HTTP API. Still remember those Kubernetes objects? <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#custom-resources">A collection of objects of a certain kind form an <em>API resource</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A resource is an endpoint in the Kubernetes API that stores a collection of API objects of a certain kind; for example, the built-in pods resource contains a collection of Pod objects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can always check the list of available API resources using <code>kubectl api-resources</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>$ kubectl api-resources
NAME          SHORTNAMES   APIVERSION   NAMESPACED   KIND
namespaces    ns           v1           false        Namespace
nodes         no           v1           false        Node
pods          po           v1           true         Pod
deployments   deploy       apps/v1      true         Deployment
jobs                       batch/v1     true         Job
...</code></pre>
<p>OK, great, we've got resources. But Kubernetes evolves quickly. What if a new attribute needs to be added to an existing resource definition? API versioning is always hard. <i>&lt;speculation mode&gt;</i>Apparently, Kubernetes API started with a common prefix <code>/api/&lt;version&gt;/&lt;resource&gt;</code> for all the API resources. However, a change in a single resource would require a whole API version bump. So, with the growth in the number of available resources, the need for some sort of grouping and subversioning emerged.<i>&lt;/speculation mode&gt;</i></p>
<p>API groups to the rescue! <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-groups-and-versioning">A bunch of related resources forms an API group</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To make it easier to evolve and to extend its API, Kubernetes implements API groups that can be enabled or disabled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also check the list of available API groups and their versions using <code>kubectl api-versions</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>$ kubectl api-versions
admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1
apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1
apiregistration.k8s.io/v1
apiregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1
apps/v1
...</code></pre>
<p>Well, at this point, I should warn you - it seems that in the documentation, the term <em>resource</em> is often used in the meaning of an <em>object</em> (but not vice versa). So, context matters.</p>
<p>In Kubernetes, objects of the same kind are distinguished by their names. So, if you start two Pods, both should get a unique name. But clusters can be pretty big and since names are supposed to be unique within a cluster, we need a mechanism to prevent collisions. Something like lots of logical clusters within one physical cluster. Allow me to introduce you to <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/#when-to-use-multiple-namespaces"><em>namespaces</em></a>!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kubernetes supports multiple virtual clusters backed by the same physical cluster. These virtual clusters are called namespaces.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>...</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Namespaces provide a scope for names. Names of resources need to be unique within a namespace, but not across namespaces. Namespaces cannot be nested inside one another and each Kubernetes resource can only be in one namespace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, API objects are fully qualified by their API group, resource type, namespace (unless cluster-scoped), and name.</p>
<p>Have you become totally confused by this time? No, worries, I've got a <del>simple</del> diagram for you 🙈</p>

    <p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/kubernetes-operator-pattern/kube-api-structure-3000-opt.png" width="100%" alt="Kubernetes API structure"></p><p><i>Kubernetes API structure.</i></p>
</div>

<p>So, a quick summary - we've learned about objects, resources, groups, and namespaces. But what's up with the promised customization?</p>
<h2 id="kubernetes-custom-resources">Kubernetes Custom Resources</h2>
<p>It seems like there is <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-api-machinery/README.md">a great deal of effort</a> in keeping the Kubernetes API coherent but extensible.</p>
<p>What do I mean by <em>coherent</em> here? Kubernetes API consists of endpoints called <em>resources</em>. These API resources adhere to a set of common requirements - they are nouns and manipulated in a declarative manner (RESTful CRUD), they should be updated relatively infrequently and be reasonably small in size, their names should be <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#dns-subdomain-names">valid DNS subdomains</a>, etc.</p>
<p>These restrictions allow unifying the resource workflows. For instance, you can get, describe, or update a collection of Pods in pretty much the same way as a collection of Services, Nodes, or RBAC roles:</p>
<pre><code>$ kubectl get pods
$ kubectl get services
$ kubectl get roles

$ kubectl describe pods  # or services, or roles

$ kubectl edit pods  # or services, or roles</code></pre>
<p>Not only <code>kubectl</code> benefits from this uniformity. Here is a full list of <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#common-features">common features</a> enabled by the unified design:</p>
<div>
    <p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/kubernetes-operator-pattern/kube-api-common-features-3000-opt.png" width="100%" alt="Kubernetes API common features"></p>
</div>

<p>It's pretty handy, isn't it?</p>
<p>So, if I were to extend the API, it'd be reasonable for me to expect that my endpoints would benefit from this common functionality as well. But that would mean that the API extension should be done by adding more resources!</p>
<p>And indeed, in Kubernetes, one can easily register <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#custom-resources"><em>custom resources</em></a>. The procedure is fully dynamic and doesn't require restarting or updating the API server.</p>
<p>How such a custom resource can be added? Well, again, it's Kubernetes! Of course, by interacting with another, already existing resource! There is a special API resource called <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#customresourcedefinitions">CustomResourceDefinition (CRD)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The CustomResourceDefinition API resource allows you to define custom resources. Defining a CRD object creates a new custom resource with a name and schema that you specify.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/#create-a-customresourcedefinition">from another documentation page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you create a new CustomResourceDefinition (CRD), the Kubernetes API Server creates a new RESTful resource path for each version you specify.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="how-to-create-custom-resource">How to Create Custom Resource</h2>
<p>Let's try to create a custom resource. Remember, a resource specifies a certain kind of Kubernetes object. Canonically, objects possess some attributes. So, our CustomResourceDefinition should be mostly concerned with describing the attributes of our future resource. Additionally, it's good to know that custom resources can be either namespaced or cluster-scoped. This is specified in the CRD's scope field.</p>
<pre><code>apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1

<p><strong>Friendly tracebacks</strong> - Simplified Python tracebacks translatable into

<div id="in-a-nutshell">
<h2>In a nutshell<a href="#in-a-nutshell" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There exists many Python projects, including some listed below,
whose <strong>primary</strong> goal is to supplement the information
given by Python traceback to make them more useful for <strong>advanced</strong> programmers.
Friendly-traceback is <strong>not</strong> one of these projects.</p>
<p>While Friendly-traceback can be useful for advanced programmers,
it is aimed aimed primarily at beginners and/or at users
who would like to get information about traceback in their own language.
Friendly-traceback can give more detailed information as to
<strong>where</strong> an exception occurred, <strong>what</strong> a given exception means and
<strong>why</strong> it might have occurred (sometimes adding a way to fix it.)</p>
<p>While Friendly-traceback can be used on its own with a specially
designed console, a better option would be to use it together with
GUI-based editors/IDE including Jupyter lab and notebooks.
We explain how to do so later.
For now, we just show one quick example.</p>
</div>
<div id="a-quick-look">
<h2>A quick look<a href="#a-quick-look" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>First, we show what happens when we use Python

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p><a href="https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/">IHP</a> uses lots of <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html">GHC language extensions</a> to create the
“magic” that comes along with the framework. One the the first nonstandard language extensions
you’ll come across while developing with IHP is the fancy “@” symbol.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>action</span> <span>UsersAction</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
    users <span>&lt;-</span> query <span>@</span><span>User</span> <span>|&gt;</span> fetch
    render <span>IndexView</span> { <span>..</span> }
</code></pre></div><p><code>@User</code> appears like a normal parameter to the function, which can be highly misleading if you try and extrapolate this idea into other contexts.
When I first started working with IHP, I assumed this was the equivalent to
Swift’s <code>self</code> property on types, which gives you a <em>value</em> representing the type that can be passed around:</p><p>This is not the case however!</p><div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>let</span>
  typeOfUser <span>=</span> <span>@</span><span>User</span>
<span>in</span>
  <span>-- parse error!</span>
</code></pre></div><p>So what’s actually happening here?</p><h3 id="whats-the-type">What’s the type?</h3><p>Say we want to test the behavior of Haskell’s <code>read</code> and <code>show</code> functions, which
each have a corresponding type class which defines which values can be passed to these functions.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>read</span> <span>::</span> (<span>Read</span> a) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> a
<span>show</span> <span>::</span> (<span>Show</span> a) <span>=&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Given any value which has both <code>Read</code> and <code>Show</code> instances defined, we should be able to convert back and forth between it and its String representation.</p><p>Let’s test for integers:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>let</span> intString <span>=</span> <span>"123"</span>
<span>read</span> intString

<span>***</span> <span>Exception:</span> <span>Prelude</span><span>.</span>read<span>:</span> no parse
</code></pre></div><p>Huh? Of course <code>read</code> should know how to parse a simple integer, right?</p><p>If you think about the above code carefully, you might notice that Haskell
has no way of knowing what type <code>read intString</code> should be! Obviously to us it
represents an integer, but in Haskell’s eyes it’s given an arbitrary string
and has no way of knowing which instance of the type class <code>Read</code> it should produce.</p><h3 id="-me-bro">@ me bro</h3><p>Type application to the rescue! The “@” symbol allows us to explicity pass
a type to the function:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>let</span> intString <span>=</span> <span>"123"</span>
<span>read</span> <span>@</span><span>Int</span> intString

<span>123</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Note, <code>@Int</code> is <strong>not a regular parameter!</strong>
The regular parameters we’re used to working with are actually called
<em>value parameters</em>, and <code>read</code> only has one: a String.</p><p>Behind the scenes, Haskell also includes <em>type parameters</em> which specify
the types that satisfy a function’s <em>constraints</em>, or the stuff before
the <code>=&gt;</code> symbol in function declarations.</p><p>Normally Haskell can do this for us:</p><pre><code>readFn :: String -&gt; Int
readFn intString = read intString

readFn "123"

123
</code></pre><p>Since the function returns an Int, the type parameter can be inferred.
In the simple example earlier however, this was not the case.</p><h2 id="type-application-in-ihp">Type Application in IHP</h2><p>Say we’re writing a script that wants to print out the name of the newest user to signup for our application.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>run</span> <span>::</span> <span>Script</span>
<span>run</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
    user <span>&lt;-</span> query <span>@</span><span>User</span> <span>|&gt;</span> orderBy <span>#</span>createdAt <span>|&gt;</span> fetchOne
    print (get <span>#</span>createdAt user)
</code></pre></div><p>To understand what <code>@User</code> is doing, we need to look at the definition of <code>query</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>query</span> <span>::</span> forall model table<span>.</span> table <span>~</span> <span>GetTableName</span> model <span>=&gt;</span> <span>DefaultScope</span> table <span>=&gt;</span> <span>QueryBuilder</span> table
</code></pre></div><p><code>query</code> doesn’t take any value parameters! All the info that gets passed to the function is contained in its type constraints. So if we omitted <code>@User</code>, Haskell would have no way of knowing what the <code>model</code> type should be.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Type application is extremely powerful and is used all over both the
IHP codebase and IHP applications. Understanding what’s going on when you see
the <code>@</code> symbol is a good first step for uncovering some of the “magic” behind
the framework.</p><p>Does anything else in IHP confuse you? Let me know below and I will write about
it in a future article! Thanks for reading!</p></div></article></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[Decentralization Is a Narrative Mirage]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Technology is a concentrating force. It always has been.</p>
<p>Everybody sewed their own clothes until we built textile factories.</p>
<p>It used to take one farmer to feed four people. Now each farmer feeds 130 people.</p>
<p>Home Depot killed thousands of local hardware stores. Opendoor is replacing legions of Keller-Williams agents. Salman Khan teaches algebra to more kids than the next 10,000 math teachers combined.</p>
<p>Gold, silver, <span>USD</span>, <span>CNY</span>, and <span>EUR</span> are all converging on the blockchain.</p>
<p>Human history is a story of increasing centralization. From roaming the plains of Africa, to settling down and building homes, to buying food in central markets, to instituting courts of law. Progression is compression. <em>How can I make it so everybody isn’t making their own shirts? Deciding their own justice? Tabulating their own spreadsheets?</em></p>
<p>The internet, contrary to popular opinion, is accelerating the pace of centralization.</p>
<p>Software is centralizing in the App Store. Compute is centralizing in AWS-US-EAST-1. Culture is centralizing on TikTok. Stock trades are centralizing in Citadel’s dark pool. Politics are centralizing around personality. Work and cities are centralizing online.</p>
<p>Decentralization is a narrative mirage because three trends are frequently misinterpreted: the downfall of institutions, the death of the gatekeeper, and remote work.</p>
<p>These aren’t representative of decentralization, but instead are examples of increasing concentration.</p>
<h3 id="institutions-are-failing.">1.<span></span> <span>“</span>Institutions are failing.”</h3>
<p><a href="https://secondbreakfast.co/personality-is-the-force-majeure-of-the-internet">Personality is the force majeure of the internet</a>. In a noisy world, it’s much easier to diligence an individual than it is to understand institutional motives. <em>Who supports NPR? Who’s the <span>NYT</span><span></span><span>’</span>s customer? Advertisers? <span>PR</span> people? Me? What are we being sold?</em></p>
<p>Institutions aren’t crumbling because of decentralization, but rather the opposite: institutional power is being compressed into personalities.</p>
<p>Trump became the <span>GOP</span>. <span>AOC</span> is becoming the <span>DNC</span>. Dave Portnoy is becoming <span>ESPN</span>. Sam Harris is now <span>NPR</span>. Elon is Tesla.</p>
<p>Organizational power is inherently decentralized. Shareholders vote for board members. Boards approve plans. Plans coordinate across loosely-coupled internal orgs.</p>
<p>But individual power, like autocratic government, is singular.</p>
<p>Directives no longer need to flow through layers of hierarchy. Tesla no longer needs a network of dealers to sell cars on <a href="https://tesla.com/">tesla.com</a>, nor do they need an army of salespeople. Why listen to Bob at the local showroom when you can follow Elon on Twitter?</p>
<p>It’s the same in politics. We used to elect state representatives who would elect electors in the legislature who would elect a President. Then communication and transportation improved. We got railroads and national radio, so we put the Presidential candidates directly on the ballot.</p>
<p>Nowadays the President doesn’t even need <span>TV</span> stations: they can instantly drop messages into the pockets of <span>80M</span> followers.</p>
<p>Betting on the internet means betting against institutions,<a href="#footnote-11TX" id="ref-11TX" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> not because institutions are exploding supernovas but because institutions are imploding black holes.</p>
<h3 id="the-gatekeepers-are-dead.">2.<span></span> <span>“</span>The gatekeepers are dead.”</h3>
<p>It’s true, gatekeepers are dead. It’s a huge improvement over the pre-Internet era.</p>
<p>I never learned about Richard Dawkins growing up. Then I went down a Carl Sagan <em>Pale Blue Dot</em> rabbit hole. I discovered Christopher Hitchens talking about evolution, consumed all of his religious debates, and then came across this Oxford evolutionary biologist who wore funny ties. <em>The Selfish Gene</em> fundamentally changed the way I view the world.</p>
<p>YouTube extends far beyond space videos. There’s debates about quantum theory, <span>DIY</span> construction how-to’s, makeup tutorials, and an unbelievable amount of unboxing videos.</p>
<p>The best part? There’s no school board deciding what you can and can’t watch and there’s no <span>MTV</span> exec telling David Dobrik what he can and can’t upload.</p>
<p>It’s easy to think the unlimited nature of content is a decentralizing force. Yet the reality is that winning content in an unlimited world is watched over and over and over again.</p>
<p>Taylor Swift can reach billions of listeners, Salman Khan can teach algebra to millions of students, the best Stack Overflow answers get upvoted thousands of times.</p>
<p>Imagine if San Francisco had no zoning rules. There’d be cranes and giant skyscrapers everywhere. The city would be reaching Tokyo-level density, concentrating people in the Bay Area from across the country.</p>
<p>The internet is a supercharged no-zoning Bay Area. YouTube, TikTok, Amazon, Shopify are all limitless. Their success is exponential, like the weight of gravity, pulling in more and more eyeballs.</p>
<p>The gap between first place and second place is far more pronounced online than it ever was offline. 30-45% of all e-commerce goes through Amazon. Walmart managed to handle only 9% of physical retail at their peak.<a href="#footnote-21TX" id="ref-21TX" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Power is shifting to the dancer who can get featured by TikTok’s algorithm, to the business that can place first in Google’s results, to the reseller that pays the most to top Amazon’s catalog, to the singer that can get featured in Spotify’s <em>Discover Weeklies</em>.</p>
<p>The long tail of content is a distraction from the reality: online power is concentrating in an extreme power law. Yes, anybody can build a following. But the winners dwarf the long tail.</p>
<p>After all, audiences are so concentrated that it only took three companies to silence the sitting <span>POTUS</span>.</p>
<h3 id="but-what-about-remote-work">3.<span></span> <span>“</span>But what about remote work?”</h3>
<p>I miss going into Industrious. I’d wake up, walk to FiDi, pour myself a cup of coffee in a grey mug, sit in a mid-century modern green chair, and get to work.</p>
<p>When I flew to Chicago, I’d take a train to the Fulton Market Industrious, pour myself coffee in a grey mug, sit on a mid-century chair, and get to work.</p>
<p>Fly to Atlanta? Ride to Ponce. Coffee, grey mug, green chair, work.</p>
<p>New York? Union Square. Coffee. Chair. Work.</p>
<p>As people move their work lives online, the experience everywhere is going to be the same. Morning ride on the Peloton, get to WeWork, drink some Blue Bottle, hop on a video call, order groceries from Instacart, rinse and repeat. The only difference will be whether we see palm trees or wildfire smoke out the window.</p>
<p>The<span></span> <span>“</span>everyone is leaving <span>SF</span><span></span><span>”</span> narrative isn’t about decentralization, it’s about centralizing online. Everybody is on Zoom now.<span></span> <span>“</span>Remote work” doesn’t mean you can now live some exotic life in a faraway place, it means that people in Birmingham can live the same as those in Cow Hollow. And work for the same companies, too.</p>
<p>Not only are we all working on Zoom, but we’re all shopping on the same<span></span> <span>“</span>hip” street, the one with Warby Parker and Bonobos and Lululemon and La Colombe all lined up side by side. Sub-in Blue Bottle, and I’ll tell you if you’re east or west of the Mississippi.<a href="#footnote-31TX" id="ref-31TX" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Part of it is that capital is cheap and management can be centralized, so chains are able to grow quickly nationwide without leaning on franchise models.<a href="#footnote-41TX" id="ref-41TX" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>But the other part is that our tastes as Americans are compressing. Every town has incredible breweries, third wave coffee, Trader Joe’s, and a Costco out in the suburbs. We’re all watching Netflix and Charli D’Amelio. We’re all peddling to the same bike instructors as Biden. How much longer until we all lose our regional accents, too?</p>
<h3 id="uploading">Uploading…</h3>
<p>Everything is shifting online. From how we find office space, to get rides, to feed ourselves, to exercise, to work and to live.</p>
<p>The meme that this constitutes<span></span> <span>“</span>decentralization” is like the ocean on the edge of the Saharan horizon. It is an illusion.</p>
<p>The spectrum of opinions, of tastes, of behaviors is compressing. The platforms and personalities with power will continue to grow in size. The power law of the internet remains irrefutable.</p>
<p>Soon one farmer will feed 1,300 people, robots will sew our Nikes, there will be one nationwide math teacher and a single wealth ledger.</p>
<p>And our lives will be fully uploaded.</p>

If you’re starting with this one, you may want to have a look at: </em><a href="https://www.jlgoodwin.com/words-pictures/2020/9/17/management-the-job-of-a-manager"><span><em>https://www.jlgoodwin.com/words-pictures/2020/9/17/management-the-job-of-a-manager</em></span></a></p><p>Amazing, talented, hard-working, accomplished folks who’ve reported to me over the years have asked: “What do I need to do to get to the next level?” In most cases, because I needed them, I have to admit I have sometimes stopped short of complete candor. If I could have, I would have said: “Find the job you want to have at another company and then quit this one.” There is also the version of: “Find the job you want at this company and then transfer to that one.” I’ve never stood in the way of anyone leaving my team and getting their next job, and I’ve always helped in any way I could to make it happen. So, my career advice is “Be a quitter.” There are some dimensions to that reductionist statement…</p><p><em>My very first programming job was when I was sixteen years old, when I worked for a company creating educational games for the TRS-80, Apple II, Atari, and IBM PCs. When I had worked for them for about three years and was heading to college, they were still paying me eight dollars an hour. I was as good or better than their older programmers so I asked them for a raise to fifteen dollars an hour. They had recently started to become more of a “business” and had hired a biz school grad to manage their operations. He wouldn’t go for it. I quit and took a job cooking in a restaurant that happened to be on the ground floor of my girlfriend’s dorm building for fifteen dollars an hour. I got some good cooking experience and a few months later I got another software job with a company that did portfolio accounting for big Wall Street firms. They paid me a lot more than fifteen dollars an hour, and I later dropped out of college to work for them full time.</em></p><p>Right from the start of your career I recommend that you pay attention to what engages you about your job and what turns you off. Make pro/con lists at some regular intervals, perhaps at quarterly review time. Are you getting enough of the pros from your job vs. the cons? Are there opportunities to shift the balance in your current role? Are there things you could add that would be pros that you’re not doing at all? Are there things that you’ve only done once in that last quarter that you really enjoyed? Try to do that again. Don’t pay that much attention to what you “should” do, pay attention to what you want to do.&nbsp;</p><p>If money is on your list, find out what you’re worth by spending some time getting some other offers. Don’t try to coerce your manager into paying you more by dropping offer letters in front of them. Instead, just talk to them about what you think you should be making in your current role and why.</p><p>If you really don’t see a way to pursue the things that motivate you via your current role, then this is a signal to start looking inside and outside the company for your next role.</p><p><em>I was a principal software engineer on a large team writing business productivity software. I wanted to be a software architect. I had been working fairly autonomously on a feature that touched every damn thing in the product. So you could say I was already doing software architecture work. But, because I was young they were reluctant to promote me. I saw another team that was fucking up wildly and they desperately needed architectural guidance. So I talked to my boss and asked to help them out. It was a huge mess to unravel but I managed to create a good architecture out of it and rewrite a lot of it. I also got the team members contributing better as well. After that, when I asked for a promotion they gave it to me. Partly because they acknowledged that I was qualified, and partly because I owned two large feature areas and they couldn’t afford to lose me.</em></p><p><em>&nbsp;</em>If you want to get to the next level, ask for next level responsibilities when there is an opportunity. A new project, a new sub-team, a crisis that needs to be sorted out, etc.--any of these are places where you can volunteer to take on more scope. Essentially that is what “career growth” is: getting more scope of influence. This kind of informal tryout is good for you and for your boss. It lets you figure out if these are really the things that motivate you and whether you are any good at them. It lets your boss see you as the next level without committing to a promotion. Of course some bosses are assholes and (even if you do well) will just try to use you again in this role without a promotion. I would say that risk is worth it to get the tryout and if you have an asshole boss you should (you guessed it) quit.</p><p>I can’t tell you the number of people who have pursued me for promotions who weren’t good at their current job. I’m sure that works with incompetent managers who want to just pass their problems along to other folks while failing up themselves, but I’m not talking about them. You’ll know you’re great at your current job when the 360 feedback from peers, supervisors, and stakeholders confirms this--that’s when you should try to get the next job. A real challenge in this is that sometimes you’re good at something that you don’t like all that much. You are left with a choice: Pursue the thing you’re strong at or perhaps go for something that makes you happy that you’re just okay at. I don’t know the right answer; you have to choose.</p><p><em>After some years at a Very Large Multinational Technology Company I had reached a point where I was flying back and forth across the United States with PowerPoint decks telling “stories” to partner companies. I wasn’t learning anything except how to get the most frequent flyer points. I was not happy. I went looking for a company that was smaller, more focused, and where I could be an individual contributor again. I found a little place doing cool work that I was interested in. They were a small tight knit group of really talented folks. The interview was really hard. I learned a lot about truly collaborating on a project, taking feedback, and using asynchronous communication effectively. I got deep into Linux, Python, test automation, Windows distributed security, and about a thousand other things. I started coding for fun again during that job and haven’t really stopped since. There was a lot of blunt feedback, but in response to that, I got even better than I thought I was going in.&nbsp;</em></p><p>The worst place to learn anything is a place where you are the smartest person in the room. When you’re interviewing companies (or other teams), one of your goals should be to see if you are going to learn anything from them. That education is worth more than money. Learning is what gives drive and interest to your career. If you’re not learning, you’re sliding backwards. This is why chasing easy money, and hopping from money-wasting startup to money-wasting startup, is not a good way to develop a strong career. It isn’t always easy to be learning on the job, and it comes with stress and sometimes uncomfortable feedback, but I think it is worth it in the long run.</p><p><em>I was leading a scrum team at a small e-commerce company and as part of a project we were doing, someone had to write some deployment scripts. This involved writing some shell script and a little work in Lua on Nginx. When the task came up during planning, the task wasn’t claimed so I assigned it to one of the more senior engineers. The next several stand up meetings this engineer was in a very bad mood with me. I finally had a talk with them and they informed me that they were a “Java Engineer” and that they didn’t appreciate being given tasks that weren’t Java. I told them that their job title was “Software Engineer,” and that they would use whatever software tool was required to build the systems we needed. Needless to say, this conversation didn’t help them in their quest for advancement. I can only imagine what has happened to this person since then, with the rise of JavaScript on the backend and the long dragged out death of Java.</em></p><p>It is okay to get to a certain point and just stay there because you’re happy, challenged, and still learning. A key thing to be wary of in these contexts is to not let the market leave you behind. Don’t be a Java engineer or a Python engineer: be a Software Engineer. Be comfortable in multiple environments and idioms. In the software field, languages and tools and operating systems go out of style. It isn’t that there is really something better, it is just that people tend to herd towards new things periodically. You should pay attention and update your skills, put the new tech into your current job (or get a new job with new tech). I’ve had to lay folks off in the past and there is nothing sadder than “senior” folks, whose skills are a decade out of date, trying to attain the same level in a market that has moved on. You become at best an entry level person with commensurate lower salary expectations.</p><p>Don’t take a management role if you don’t like it and/or you don’t have any aptitude for it. There are plenty of ways to figure this out before taking a management role. Being a great engineer is not an important qualification for being a great manager. Many companies make this stupid assumption because they were founded by engineers, and they typically have a lot of crappy managers (who are former engineers) who really don’t like managing people. You are much better off solving your money problems or level problems inside the engineering track than switching over to the management track. Also, the employees that would have to suffer under you will appreciate you staying in the engineering track.</p><p>In the long run, it is better to have the right role than to always have a steadily increasing salary. Of course, this assumes that you have your finances in order and can afford to do this. I would say that being able to have this option is very useful in career progression. I’ve done it more than once, because as a great …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

February 3, 2021 | https://www.quitfacebook.org/file/google.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.quitfacebook.org/file/google.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    <p><img src="https://www.quitfacebook.org/file/media/google-sign-out.png" alt="Google warning: 'Couldn't sign you in'"></p><p>I saw the above warning using <a href="https://vivaldi.com/">Vivaldi</a>: a successful and powerful Chromium based browser. There's nothing insecure about it. I tried to fix the problem by disabling all extensions, clearing all browser data, and enabling “less secure app access” in the Google account settings. Alas. The only solution I found was reinstalling the browser. But after having done so—five times—each time when clearing the cookies, or enabling a VPN, it wouldn't let me sign in again. Then the following email found my inbox.</p>

    <p><img src="https://www.quitfacebook.org/file/media/google-warning.png" alt="Google warning: someone knows the password to your linked Google account"></p><p>“Someone knows the password to your linked Google Account”… Me. It was <em>me</em>! Obviously <em>I</em> know the password to my linked Google account. Forced to change my password I was duly annoyed. I realized how dependent I was. If Google unpredictably revokes access to your account, you can't log into anything else of their services: YouTube, Gmail, Play Store, Docs, Drive, Calendar, etc. Fortunately I already did a partial Google and social media exodus. Nevertheless, even when only using YouTube and Google Play, losing access startled me. Therefore, because I don't want to be put in this position again, I completed the exodus: discarding the need for a Google account.</p>

    <p>A quick aside, I have nothing against monopolies as a general rule. Usually they grow so big because of a significantly superior service <sup>(1)</sup>. But as convenient as they may be—even though their products aren't superior anymore—if their power goes to their head and they start pulling insidious shenanigans, like using false claims to deter people from browsers other than Chrome, then I'm out.</p>

    <p>So that's exactly what I did and I was pleasantly surprised by the results. Believe it or not but my phone is more responsive and the battery lasts longer. Although the former might be due to the factory reset, I assume the latter has to do with the decrease in background processes due to 1. removing my Google account 2. subsequently disabling Google Play Store 3. disabling everything in the settings tab called Google services &amp; preferences. Digital minimalism, it's so incredibly satisfying. You should try it. Your life was perfectly fine before you had all that extra stuff to worry about (or pay for); I learnt that from my teacher, Diogenes of Sinope, 404 – 323 BC.</p>

          </ul>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <h2>Alternatives to Google.</h2>
    <p>Diogenes would suggest living on the streets, but I'm unsure if that's feasible, and you'd still be overwhelmed by ads. So what to do? One could completely avoid Google as there is plenty competition to choose from. A quick search for “Google alternatives” or a peek at <a href="https://nomoregoogle.com/">No More Google</a> or <a href="https://degoogle.jmoore.dev/">degoogle</a> can suffice. Although, realistically, one will want to keep using some of their services, preferably without an account. As was the case for me.</p>

    <h3>YouTube.</h3>
    <p>YouTube has a lot of content nowhere else to be found. Fortunately one doesn't need an account (yet) to simply watch these videos. However, sometimes logging in is required. To <strong>circumvent logging in</strong>, use the YouTube front-end <a href="https://invidio.us/">invidio.us</a>, and select an instance such as ytprivate.com. It uses YouTube in the background, but discards the bullshit, making the website much faster. Just enter a search term, or copy-paste the YouTube URL or video ID, and you're good to go. If you require <strong>playlists</strong> or <strong>subscriptions</strong>, Invidious supports that too if you register. Importing or exporting data from other Invidious instances is possible as well.</p>

    <p>If you want to manually create a playlist on YouTube without an account, append the following URL with the YouTube video IDs separated by commas, for example: https://www.youtube.com/watch_videos?video_ids=xUozVQVt1xI,ed0fRdTma9I.</p>
    
    <p>When on <strong>mobile</strong>, <a href="https://newpipe.net/">NewPipe</a> is the way. There are other YouTube front-ends, but I strongly recommend NewPipe because: it is highly configurable, it supports background play on a locked phone, it features easy downloading, it has <em>no</em> ads, it works hand in hand with PeerTube and Invidious, it's super fast, etc.</p>
    
    <h3>Google Play Store.</h3>
    <p>The Google Play store is something I was most worried about. I assumed using “their” apps necessitated a Google account. Not necessarily. <strong>The free apps don't require an account, the paid apps do</strong>. For example, I purchased Wolfram Alpha but can't install it without Google Play Store. And even if I could, I'd need my Google account as a receipt to reactivate it. In total I have 14 apps and one digital book I paid for. But as time passed I found better and free alternatives to all of them, or I merely donated to support their decision to refuse ads, not their premium functions. However, I can understand if this is a dealbreaker to those who are dependent on non-free apps.</p>
      
    <p>Anyway, to install an app you just need an .apk file. But to avoid a time-consuming process, there are alternative app catalogues such as <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/"><strong>F-Droid</strong></a> and <a href="https://auroraoss.com/app_info.php?app_id=1"><strong>Aurora Store</strong></a>, these will serve most of your needs. I suggest perusing F-Droid first because its apps are FOSS (Free and Open Source Software); more than half of mine are on it. Here's a list of everyting I use: <a href="https://www.quitfacebook.org/file/software.html">quitfacebook.org/file/software.html</a>.</p>

    <p>Not going to lie, it feels good to release the shackles; Google Play Store is disabled and everything works just fine. However, Google Play <em>services</em> apparently needs to remain enabled for some crucial functionalities. I can live with that, for now.</p>

    <h3>Gmail.</h3>
    <p>I'm only keeping this account just in case I need the key to the dungeon. Otherwise I use <a href="https://protonmail.com/">ProtonMail</a> which is developed at CERN <sup>(2)</sup>; 'nuff said? Sure there are plenty of other providers, but man, developed at CERN, that's like a Vulcan salute to Trekkies.</p>

    <p>🖖</p>

    <h3>Google Chrome.</h3>
    <p><a href="https://vivaldi.com/">Vivaldi Browser</a>'s quality <em>does</em> match up to its name—and we all know <em>Four Seasons</em>. I could throw around superlatives all day, but I won't spoil the pleasant surprise. What got <em>me</em> to click “set as default browser” was Vivaldi's unmatched simultaneous customizability <em>and</em> speed. Not surprisingly, it has a thriving community forum.</p>


    <h3>Google Drive.</h3>
    <p>The only thing I used Google Drive for was backing up contacts. This can easily be replaced by exporting a .vcf file. Similarly, before a factory reset, I just manually use the export function of the few apps I want backups from.</p>

    <p>But what in the case of a hard drive crash? For the most important files I use a directory that's immediately synced to <a href="https://mega.nz/">MEGA</a> by default. For instance, I'm writing this page on a file that's sent to the cloud each time it's saved. This is probably commonplace and trivial information for IT enthusiasts, but I'm certain that's not most people.</p>

    <h3>Google search.</h3>
    <p>I admit I haven't found any search engine with better results than Google, despite its bias. However, you can have your cake and eat it too with <a href="https://www.startpage.com/">Startpage</a>. This search engine uses Google but adds privacy.<sup>(3)</sup> If you want to avoid Google completely, use <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>—but let's call it <a href="https://duck.com/">duck.com</a> from now on so we can say “duck it” instead of “google it”.</p>

    <p>Ideally, just be efficient and use shortcuts for multiple search engines.</p>

    <h3>Google Translate.</h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.deepl.com/">DeepL</a>. The translations it produces are astounding; single words as well as full text translations. Try it, I'm confident you'll confirm that it beats Google.</p>

    <h3>Google Ads.</h3>
    <p>Fuck ads, and I'm being polite. To find out how I block all of them I suggest you read my post “<a href="https://www.quitfacebook.org/file/adblocking.html">Ad blocking, or how to use the Web properly.</a>”</p>

    <h2>Why do I care?</h2>
    <p>I don't have a coherent answer yet; the problem is multifold and my expertise is lacking. Regardless, things don't feel right. For one, it greatly bothers me that there is a vast collection of fantastic software that doesn't get the attention it deserves. Especially the ones made by praiseworthy developers who refuse ads and trackers. Frequently they're hidden behind products of those who can spend the most on marketing, or they suffer traffic loss by biased search results. Consequently, these virtuous mindsets don't get incentivized as they earn significantly less money. Developers with a backbone deserve to be rewarded more. Additionally, the dumbing down of devices and software decreases all-around tech savviness and makes us more reliant while hypocritically increasing the attitude of taking things for granted.</p>

    <p>To add fuel to the fire, we've become addicted to convenience because monopolies handed us everything on silver plate in return for our data, all so the consumption of whatever can be increased. It sounds like a conspiracy, but it isn't; data is seen as the new oil for just that reason: manipulation. Call me old-fashioned all you want, but I consider wilful manipulation evil. The fact that Facebook is still around after all their <em>known</em> scandals proves how hollow we've become.</p>

Browsing through companies that have recently IPO’d or raised $100M+ rounds — where one would expect a company to be able to hire junior developers — all I can find are jobs that require at least three or more years of experience or are explicitly only hiring “Senior” or “Developer II” or higher.</p><p>I have been working with bootcamp graduates and community-college graduates for years. But from my vantage point, when growth companies hire people with no development job experience, they are usually hiring top-tier, four-year college graduates. (There are some exceptions! Twitter’s <a href="https://careers.twitter.com/en/university.html">internship program</a> is admirable, although I don’t know in practice how restrictive the admissions end up being).<a href="https://twitter.com/shaft/status/1355696154990628864"></a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/608682016205344768"></a>One can understand wanting to make sure that the first few hires into any department have enough experience to build and maintain high quality software, except that</p><p>a) that often doesn’t prevent terrible technical debt, and</p><p>b) no one ever changes the expectations over time.</p><p>And so the culture just becomes, “we only hire people with experience.” I am a huge fan of <a href="https://www.segment.com/">Segment</a> (and a happy customer for more than five years), but despite their senior-developer-packed engineering roster, they seem to have to rebuild their <a href="https://segment.com/blog/goodbye-microservices/">entire architecture</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/how-segment-redesigned-its-core-systems-to-solve-an-existential-scaling-crisis/">every</a> <a href="https://segment.com/blog/rebuilding-our-infrastructure/">few</a> years. Every company starts by hiring seniors; most seem to keep hiring seniors, and many have to keep throwing away code constantly.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/BsxIM1LBghJkWOwT56C-wwa7lGYJbB9sJPYjYd-A2Dq7zKkJVO98_I3qSOZazzGzxkJkx_gqA4KBK1lm0st213MAaiRfakQxgcACtziqc7hsW5z3wfbtzmbN87DR9bB4NtACKSi2" alt=""></figure><p>Everyone agrees that talent is scarce, and that hires often fail — and that failure is expensive. Why don’t companies ever take a conscious look at how to build talent instead of buying it?</p><p>Put another way, it’s ironic that an industry that tends to want to build everything instead of buying it chooses to buy the absolute most expensive thing on the market: talent.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="h-the-problems-with-senior-developers">The Problems with Senior Developers</h2><p><strong>It is a fallacy that only hiring senior developers will lead to better results than hiring many junior developers</strong>. There are bad things about senior developers that no one should want in their organization, and without juniors to counterbalance, you’ll be overindexed to these downsides.</p><h4 id="h-senior-skills-can-stagnate">Senior skills can stagnate</h4><p>The most common error I see senior developers make comes, ironically, from their prior successes, combined with the pace of technology.</p><p>Most developers at the beginning of their careers are good at knowing and using most of the best practices at that time. But there is no continuing education in software development, and compensation is tied to shipping, not learning. So once a developer is five or more years into their career, there’s a really good chance they’re still relying upon tools, libraries, and practices that are no longer the best way to build, deploy, and run software.</p><p>Case in point: Instagram, all on the public cloud, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2127343/Facebook-buys-Instagram-13-employees-share-100m-CEO-Kevin-Systrom-set-make-400m.html">sells to Facebook</a> for $1B with 13 employees in 2012; Bank of America <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2019-11-06-IBM-Developing-Worlds-First-Financial-Services-Ready-Public-Cloud-Bank-of-America-Joins-as-First-Collaborator">makes its first announcement</a> to do anything with the public cloud in November of 2019. Kevin Systrom <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-founder-kevin-systrom-has-no-formal-programming-training-2012-4">had only just learned to program</a> when he started Instagram; Bank of America’s technology organization is run by people who are decades from being practitioners. (Lest anyone try to argue Bank of America’s slowness is due to regulatory issues, <a href="https://get.acloudguru.com/capital-one-case-study">consider Capital One</a>).</p><h4 id="h-senior-developers-can-be-a-solution-in-search-of-a-problem">Senior developers can be a solution in search of a problem</h4><p>Another problem with senior-developer-only organizations is that <strong>most organizations don’t have constant flows of work that require lots of experience</strong>. A tremendous amount of software development is updating interfaces to add functionality or improve usability, not building back ends from scratch that have to scale to hundreds of millions of daily users.</p><p>And as we have better and more powerful <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/serverless-sea-change/">cloud services</a> to build on (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure, Netlify, Twilio, Stripe), more developer focus turns to interfaces. Having an organization filled with senior developers who aren’t mentoring junior developers is asking to find senior-developer problems to solve, even if they’re best solved by an existing service.</p><h2 id="h-finding-undervalued-people">Finding Undervalued People</h2><p>Many developers are systemically undervalued because they do not fit central casting for appearance or mentality. Others are undervalued because organizations typically aren’t willing to hire software developers who need some training to do the job effectively.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, whatever cargo-cult exercise an individual had to learn to become an interviewer (e.g., inverting binary trees on a whiteboard) tends to be viewed like a fraternity hazing ritual: “I had to go through it, so I’ll make everyone else after me go through it.”</p><p>There are excellent software developers who hate hackathons and would rather spend time raising their children on weekends than on coding side projects. There are people who are neuroatypical who can’t deal well with your unrealistic, on-the-spot brain teasers. There are people who need some additional training and mentorship to be able to ship software effectively for most organizations. These people are all undervalued by the standard hiring practices in tech, which means that, with some effort on your part, they’ll give the highest return on investment of any hires you can make.</p><h2 id="h-when-you-invest-in-people-people-invest-in-you">When you invest in people, people invest in you</h2><p>Over the past twenty years, I have seen a real difference between hiring software developers with the view of, “You’re a superstar and we need you to come in and kick ass” versus, “We will bring you in, teach you how we think and build, and then you’ll help us achieve our mission.”</p><p>The former attitude can lead to developers thinking they are better than other departments and other people in the organization, because no one else can do what they do. (After all, they are superstars!) The latter is fundamentally aligning to a mission and a team and a culture.</p><p>Remember, all software developers pick up bad habits. They usually don’t know all the latest best practices. They generally haven’t been given work time and space to experiment with new technologies. They won’t know all of your code or your stack or how your teams’ specific approaches to software development. These generalizations hold true for all developers, junior to senior.</p><p>You can choose to not invest any effort into training and aligning senior developers and still see things ship, but that doesn’t mean that you’re growing cohesive teams that are making the right decisions for your organization. You should invest in bringing everyone up to speed and together. When you do that, you realize that <strong>bringing junior developers onboard is not necessarily a greater effort than bringing senior developers onboard</strong>, especially if your criteria for success is successful, happy teams that are making the best decisions.</p><h2 id="h-how-to-build-undervalued-talent">How to build undervalued talent</h2><p>If you hire undervalued people and you train them to be successful for your organization, you will end up with teams that are more aligned and more loyal to your mission. The right way to do this is to onboard people in stages that end up with developers working on your codebase, as opposed to hiring everyone with the expectation that they’re working high-priority tickets on day one.</p><p>For example, at Branch, we have a multi-stage process where entry-level developers are initially granted a stipend to fund living expenses while taking online courses, working through sample exercises, and attending office hours for any questions. The end of the first stage is completing the Branch take-home developer hiring exercise that we have used to hire all developers.</p><p>The second stage is a paid internship that has the goal of learning how to work as part of the development team, but having the space to go slowly and ask lots of questions, and the expectation that there may be many PR revisions. We identify tickets in our backlog as “intern” work, so that there isn’t high pressure to complete anything in a short period of time.</p><p>This entire process does take time from the existing development staff, but it can be contained (mostly) into onboarding, office hours, code reviews, and weekly 1-on-1s. And it allows you to make hiring decisions that exclude bad cultural fits because you will find enough talent by investing in your workforce. You’ll create a massive competitive advantage over your competitors who are still stuck in their fraternity-hazing ruts.</p><h2 id="h-the-roi-of-building-talent">The ROI of building talent</h2><figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>There is a delicious irony that so many venture-backed companies seek only to hire out of expensive four-year universities or people with experience working at other VC-backed startups, yet want their teams to be dedicated to the company's mission.</p><p>1/</p></div>— Joe Emison (@JoeEmison) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeEmison/status/1343222725226209280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 27, 2020</a></blockquote> </div></figure><p>Many venture-backed companies seek people dedicated to their missions, but then shoot themselves in the foot by only looking to hire people from “elite” schools or out of “name-brand” venture-backed companies. Those hiring pools are filled with people who are ready and able to job-hop to further themselves, and are often very weakly committed to company missions. In contrast, if a company invests in undervalued people who need some mentorship, training, and experience to reach their full potential, those people are much more likely to commit to the company and the mission with their full selves.</p><p><em>Joe Emison is the CTO of Branch Insurance, which provides home and auto insurance.

<p><em>This article on NewSpace in Latin America was developed in collaboration with the <a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/exa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ecuadorian Space Agency (EXA)</a>, a participant in the <a href="https://satsearch.co/membership" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">satsearch membership program</a>.</em></p>



<p><em>It includes a discussion of Latin America’s position in the global industry along with a deeper case study investigation into two example companies from the region; <a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/exa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EXA</a> and <a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/satellogic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Satellogic</a>.</em></p>



<hr>



<p>In recent years the space economy has grown at a rapid rate. According to the <a href="https://www.spacefoundation.org/2019/03/18/space-foundation-2018-annual-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Space Foundation 2018 Annual Report</a>; in 2017 it totalled USD 383.5 billion worldwide and it is projected to keep growing.</p>



<p>In addition, the report highlights that during 2017 there was a 7% increase in orbital launch attempts around the world, a 100% increase in the total number of spacecraft deployed and a 200% increase in the number of commercial spacecraft deployed.</p>



<p>As this trend continues it is reminiscent of what transpired with the aviation industry around 50 years ago. After several years of heavy regulation and the sector being dominated by a few airlines, 1970s deregulation and lower costs resulted in a huge increase in competition. This brought in new carriers and routes, leading to an increase in passenger numbers that built the multibillion-dollar industry that connects the world today.</p>



<p>We’re see the same pattern unfold right in front of our eyes with the rapid privatization and commercialization of the space sector. A new age of space exploration is emerging; one that is no longer dominated by few countries with large and established space programs, but rather by a large group of private companies, startups and other entrepreneurs that are ready to take the next steps to push the boundaries of humanity while also benefiting and profiting from space. This is known as “<a href="https://blog.satsearch.co/2019-02-26-lets-talk-about-newspace" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NewSpace</a>”.</p>



<hr>



<h2>Beyond the traditional powers</h2>



<p>NewSpace is opening the doors for other regions and countries, aside from the traditional dominant player of the United States of America, to take a leap of faith and start shaping the future of space exploration.</p>



<p>These nations now have the potential to become a driving force, innovate, and act, or else they risk the chance of missing out on the financial and social benefits that the NewSpace sector provides.</p>



<p>This is particularly true for the Latin American region where space exploration has always been thought of as something of a luxurious enterprise. For a region comprised mainly of emerging economies, government run and financed space agencies have always been a difficult option, as funds and resources are primarily allocated to priorities such as healthcare and education.</p>



<p>Although these priorities are perfectly valid of course, not taking part in the NewSpace industry does further the position of Latin America as an ‘underdeveloped’ region. Privatization and commercialization of space technologies in the growing, connected global market is therefore key for other private and civilian enterprises, to take the burden off the government and immerse their respective countries in the NewSpace era.</p>



<p>A strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis on greater participation in the NewSpace industry in Latin America was performed in order to better characterize the prospects for the region, considering the historical, industrial, and political realities that it faces. This analysis also sets a roadmap for NewSpace integration of new actors, indicating where they can optimize their efforts and where they should be careful.</p>

<h2>Companies active in NewSpace in Latin America</h2>



<p>Two entities, <a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/exa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EXA</a> and <a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/satellogic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Satellogic</a>, have emerged as leaders in the region, proving that even for companies coming from developing countries, it is possible to be part of the global space market. These companies are an effective case study showing that achieving NewSpace integration in the region is possible.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/exa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ecuadorian Civilian Space Agency (EXA)</a> is a not-for-profit, non-governmental institution that follows a civilian space exploration model. It has become established as Ecuador’s first space agency and is tasked with executing the nation’s space program.</p>



<p><a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/satellogic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Satellogic</a> is based in Argentina and is the first vertically integrated geospatial analytics company in the country.</p>



<p>Both EXA and Satellogic were responsible for the conception, design, and manufacturing of their first and second national CubeSats; NEE-01 PEGASO and NEE-02 KRYSAOR for Ecuador, and CubeBug-1 and CubeBug-2 for Argentina. These satellites served as effective technology demonstrators that now drive the commercialization of proprietary technologies in the case of EXA, and the provision of Earth Observation and analytics services in the case of <a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/satellogic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Satellogic</a>.</p>



<p>The sections below include more information on each of these businesses.</p>



<hr>



<h2>EXA – helping Ecuador join the list of countries with space programs</h2>



<p>As a research and development institution <a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/exa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EXA</a> has trusted <a href="http://www.cubesat.market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CubeSat.Market</a>, a commercial space company, with the promotion, marketing, and commercialization of its space products.</p>



<p>These products range from power systems to all-in-one EPS, OBC, and SDR systems. <a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/exa/products" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Find out more about this portfolio here</a>.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/exa/products" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" width="683" height="582" src="https://blog-admin.satsearch.com/wp-content/uploads/210203_satsearch_exa_product_portfolio.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog-admin.satsearch.com/wp-content/uploads/210203_satsearch_exa_product_portfolio.png 683w, https://blog-admin.satsearch.com/wp-content/uploads/210203_satsearch_exa_product_portfolio-300x256.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px"></a></figure></div>







<p>EXA´s products have been chosen by several regional and international partners to fly in different missions to Earth’s orbit, to the moon and beyond.</p>



<p>One of these clients is <a href="https://www.irvinecubesat.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Irvine Cubesat STEM Program</a> which is developing a fleet of 12 satellites with <a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/exa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EXA</a> as its primary supplier. Another client is the <a href="https://www.unam.mx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM)</a> that is developing its very own K´OTO spacecraft with the EXA spacecraft bus at its core.</p>



<p>In addition, EXA has developed a <a href="https://blog.satsearch.co/2020-01-22-optical-communications-for-small-satellites-and-cubesats-product-roundup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laser communication module for CubeSats</a> capable of transmitting up to 100 mbps at a maximum power of 25 Watts. This module is looking to transform how communication is performed from space to ground and in-orbit, particularly between satellites in a constellation.</p>



<p>EXA is an excellent case study into how a Latin American country such as Ecuador can lead by example, producing commercial technology for the global space market while bringing the whole region along into NewSpace.</p>

<h2>Satellogic – global growth from Argentina</h2>



<p><a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/satellogic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Satellogic</a> has grown into a multinational company with offices and clients all over the world. They are currently building a 60-satellite constellation that will be able to remap the entire planet each week, providing customers with high-resolution images and processed analytics that will allow for daily decision-making support.</p>



<p>This constellation is made possible due to the creation of the NewSat microsatellite, a small, light, and inexpensive platform that carries both a sub-meter resolution multispectral imaging instrument and a 25-meter resolution hyperspectral camera.</p>



<p>Since 2016 <a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/satellogic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Satellogic</a> has launched 18 NewSats, with significant improvements generation to generation, totalling 21 spacecraft in orbit to date. Satellogic has also been recognized for innovative space business solutions with its dedicated satellite constellations and AI-based geospatial analytics services.</p>



<p>These achievements make <a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/satellogic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Satellogic</a> an excellent example of how ideas and services originating from Argentina and Latin America are capable of revolutionizing how we think about space.</p>

<h2>The future of NewSpace in Latin America</h2>



<p>In August 2020 the <a href="https://iaaspace.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">International Academy of Astronautics (IAA)</a> conducted <a href="https://iaaspace.org/event/4th-iaa-latin-american-cubesat-workshop-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the 4th IAA Latin American Cubesat Workshop</a> in which, on its last day, it organized a CubeSat Industry session. In this session many Latin American companies, and startups, including Satellogic and EXA, through Cubesat.Market, showcased products and services paving the way for integration of others in the region into NewSpace.</p>



<p>Some of the presenters included the University of Chile, EMSISTI, ISI-SE Senai, Orbital, CRON, Fibraforte, HORUSEYE, and Opto S&amp;D. These companies, ranging from new small startups to large established firms, are creating satellite systems for many different applications, from attitude and determination actuators for CubeSats to <a href="https://blog.satsearch.co/2020-04-03-smallsat-and-cubesat-solar-panels-on-the-global-market" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">solar panels</a>, and fuel and oxidizer tanks for large spacecraft.</p>



<p>This session showed the wide availability of space innovation in the region and inspired the possibility of future collaboration, and larger regional projects.</p>



<p>Latin America may be historically constrained as an underdeveloped region in global terms, but these case studies show that a few private institutions are leading the way, setting an example of what is possible, expanding the state-of-the-art, proposing innovative business models and not just joining the NewSpace era, but also becoming a driving force for how it is going to continue to develop in the future.</p>



<p>These companies hope to show that it is possible for Latin American space companies to achieve such success, all while bringing the financial and social benefits of space for all its people. </p>

            <p>Don’t use Homebrew Python. It’s not meant for&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>At some point Homebrew made changes that adversely affect Python development. While Homebrew’s Python formula has been the go-to choice for Python developers (including me) for a long time, that time is past — there are now <em>much</em> better options&nbsp;available.</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-problem">What’s the&nbsp;Problem?</h2>
<p>Perhaps you heard stories about why you shouldn’t use the system-bundled Python<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" title="I’ve talked about some macOS-specific reasons to eschew its bundled Python, but Ubuntu/Debian is also affected.">1</a></sup>, so instead you use Homebrew to install Python and then use its interpreter to create a virtual environment. A month later, you activate that same environment, and when you try to use it, you see this inscrutable&nbsp;error:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>dyld</span><span>:</span> <span>Library</span> <span>not</span> <span>loaded</span><span>:</span> <span>@</span><span>executable_path</span><span>/../</span><span>.</span><span>Python</span>
<span>Referenced</span> <span>from</span><span>:</span> <span>/your/home/.virtualenvs/your-env-name/bin/</span><span>python</span>
<span>Reason</span><span>:</span> <span>image</span> <span>not</span> <span>found</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>What happened? The Python interpreter referenced by the virtual environment… no longer exists. But how can that be? You didn’t change&nbsp;anything!</p>
<p><em>You</em> didn’t change anything… but Homebrew did. Of the adverse changes Homebrew made recently, two stand out as root causes of this&nbsp;problem.</p>
<p>First, Homebrew now upgrades dependent packages automatically. So if you upgrade <em>any</em> package that depends on the <code>python</code> formula<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" title="You can see which of your installed formulae depend on the python formula by running: brew uses python --installed … I have over 30 Python-dependent formulae installed on my workstation.">2</a></sup> (and there are nearly <strong>400</strong> of them), then your Python interpreter will be upgraded also — whether you like it or not. You have no control over&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>Second, Homebrew now automatically deletes previous versions every 30 days, including of course any Python interpreters you used to create virtual&nbsp;environments.</p>
<p>The havoc wrought by the combination of these two changes is considerable. Those Python virtual environments you created over the last year? All of them are now broken. Why? Just because you ran <code>brew upgrade ponysay</code>? Yup.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" title="Previously, you had to manually run brew cleanup to get yourself into this mess. Now the carnage happens automatically. Any time a new Python version is released, even patch releases such as from 3.8.6 to 3.8.7, there is the very real potential that any virtual environment that depends on the previous Python version will just break horribly and without any warning. And it’s not just your virtual environments — any software that depends on Python can have the carpet yanked out from under it, including Pipx, YouCompleteMe, and other components that you may not even realize depend on the presence of a stable Python foundation. Moreover, this problem isn’t even confined to Python. Need a specific version of Node.js to build static assets for your web application? Have an old Rails app that needs a previous Ruby version? Under the Homebrew regime, those can also be swept away at any&nbsp;time.">3</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="homebrew-python-is-not-for-you">Homebrew Python Is Not For&nbsp;You</h2>
<p>The web is littered with frustrated reports about this problem and replete with hacked-together Bash scripts that purport to repair damaged Python virtual environments. And all because of one core&nbsp;misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Homebrew’s Python is not for you. It exists to serve Homebrew, or more accurately, Homebrew’s other formulae. The primary purpose of Homebrew’s Python formula is to enable other Python-dependent Homebrew packages to work. If installing Homebrew’s Python allows you to run the occasional Python script or access the <abbr title="read-eval-print loop"><span>REPL</span></abbr><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" title="Assuming you’re okay with bundled Python caveats, there’s no reason to install Homebrew just for Python, since macOS includes Python 3 in its command-line tools (CLT) package.">4</a></sup>, that’s a nice side benefit, but anything beyond that — including developing software with Python — is squarely&nbsp;out-of-scope.</p>
<p>Once you come to this realization, it should be clear that this is the wrong tool for the job. So what is the right&nbsp;tool?</p>

<p>There are several solutions that put <strong>you</strong> back in control of when Python versions are installed, upgraded, and removed. Personally, I use <a href="https://asdf-vm.com/">asdf</a> and its <a href="https://github.com/danhper/asdf-python">Python plugin</a> to do <a href="https://hackercodex.com/guide/python-development-environment-on-mac-osx/">just that</a>. I prefer <a href="https://asdf-vm.com/">asdf</a> to similar tools such as Pyenv and Pythonz because not only can you install multiple Python versions but also multiple Node.js versions, Ruby versions, and <a href="https://asdf-vm.com/#/plugins-all?id=plugin-list">many more</a>.</p>
<p>After switching to this solution, would you like to guess how many times I’ve had something break due to a Python upgrade? Right: <em>Zero</em>. Zero times. Because <strong>I</strong> am now in control of when older Python versions are swept away, I can upgrade virtual environments at my leisure, and then, once I’ve confirmed no other environments rely on older versions, I can then uninstall those old Python versions without worrying about something&nbsp;breaking.</p>
<h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>
<p>There are hack workarounds, and I’ve tried them. None of them fix the core&nbsp;problem.</p>
<p>For example, the automatic monthly clean-up can be disabled by defining a <code>HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP</code> environment variable and setting it to “1”. But all it takes is one accidental <code>brew</code> invocation in a shell session where that variable is not set, and your environments are laid to waste. Plus, even if you avoid that footgun, there is no easy way to remove specific old versions that you may no longer need; you have no choice but to <code>rm -rf</code> directories in <code>/usr/local/Cellar/</code> and hope you don’t break&nbsp;anything.</p>
<p>I also tried to avoid installing Homebrew Python entirely, with the idea that since I’m not using it anymore, I don’t need it to be installed. But assuming you use Homebrew to install other tools, that would be a fool’s errand — Homebrew Python will almost certainly be installed anyway when some other formula requires it. But that doesn’t mean we have to use it! Let the Homebrewed Python sit there and do its job serving other formulae, and we can forget it&nbsp;exists.</p>

            <p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> is my favourite piece of software on the Mac. It's fast. It's reliable. It's unobtrusive.</p>
<p>I've been using it since I started working on macOS in 2013. In this post I would like to show you how I use it, my custom workflows and some tips and tricks. (Note: You find links to used themes and wallpapers at <a href="#themes-and-wallpapers">the end</a> of this article).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/80738e5e7573f3a72bfec04efb7b74500b8526fa/08b15/assets/images/posts/20210130-my-alfred-setup/alfred-themes.jpg" alt=""></p><h2>What is Alfred?</h2>
<p>macOS ships with <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotlight_(software)">Spotlight</a>. A system wide search. In Yosemite, Apple redesigned the UI and Spotlight got a lot smarter. (You can do calculations or webs searches too).</p>
<p>Alfred is Spotlight on steroids. It uses Spotlight's search index to search files on your Mac, can start any of your installed apps and you can extend Alfred with custom workflows. The worfklow features become available when you upgrade and buy the "Powerpack".</p>
<p>With the basic summary out of the way, let's get started by replacing Spotlight with Alfred.</p>
<h2>Use Spotlight Keyboard Shortcut for Alfred</h2>
<p>The first I thing I do, when installing Alfred on a Mac, is disabling the default keyboard shortcut for Spotlight (<code>⌘+Space</code>) and use it for Alfred.</p>
<p>To do that, open <code>System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts</code>. Click on  "Spotlight" and disable "Show Spotlight search".</p>
<figure>

  <figcaption>Disable the "Show Spotlight search" setting to free up the `⌘+Space` keyboard shortcut</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Open the Alfred settings and use the freed up <code>⌘+Space</code>-combination to launch Alfred.</p>

  <figcaption>Update the keyboard shortcut to invoke Alfred to `⌘+Space`.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Custom Web Searches</h2>
<p>Web searches are the first powerful feature we take a closer look at. I use them everyday at work; but not necessarily to search. Let me explain:</p>
<p>In summary, a custom web search allows you to set up a shortcut to start a search on any website. It just passes the given search term to a URL. For example <code>app Tony Stark</code> expands to <code>https://example.com/search?q=Tony Stark</code>. So far, so good.</p>
<p>The way I use "web searches" in Alfred, is that my input is ususally an ID for a resource in one of my most used applications and not necessarily as a search term. Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the customer details page in our app. <code>app:customer 123</code> expands to <code>https://example.com/admin/customers/123/</code>.</li>
<li>Open the invoice details page in our app. <code>app:invoice 123</code> would expand to <code>https://example.com/admin/invoices/123</code>. ("invoice" is a generic example and you can adapt this to any other "thing" you use at your job (posts, sale, product, …))</li>
<li>Open a JIRA ticket. <code>jira PROJ-123</code> expands to <code>https://jira.example.com/browse/PROJ-123</code>.</li>
<li>Quickly open a personal GitHub repository by typing <code>ghm repo_name</code>. The search url looks like this: <code>https://github.com/your-username/{query}</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course I also use it as a regular search too.Here are a few examples I use regularly. (Click "Import" to import the custom web search)</p>
<ul>
<li>Search <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://developers.mozilla.org/">MDN Web Docs</a>. <code>mdn querySelectorAll</code>. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="alfred://customsearch/Search%20MDN%20for%20%7Bquery%7D/mdn/utf8/nospace/https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fsearch%3Fq%3D%7Bquery%7D">Import</a>
</li>
<li>Search <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://caniuse.com/">caniuse.com</a>. <code>can flexbox</code>. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="alfred://customsearch/Can%20I%20Use%20X%20in%20browser%20Y/can/utf8/nospace/https%3A%2F%2Fcaniuse.com%2F%23search%3D%7Bquery%7D">Import</a>
</li>
<li>Search <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://caniemail.com/">caniemail.com</a>. <code>canemail grid</code>. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="alfred://customsearch/Search%20caniemail.com%20for%20%7Bquery%7D/canemail/utf8/nospace/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.caniemail.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Fs%3D%7Bquery%7D">Import</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I also have custom searches for different ecommerce sites I regularly visit. I can type <code>groceries Toiletpaper</code> and land on the search page of the desired online shop.</p>
<p>But I think you get the gist: The sky is the limit!<br>
If you regularly go to a website and search for something or need to look up a "details page", consider creating a custom web search for it.</p>
<h2>Clipboard History</h2>
<p>Copy and pasting is something I do everyday. Be it code, files, URLs, IDs or just text. Alfred ships with a clipboard manager, which allows you to paste previously copied text into your editor or email draft.</p>
<p>The best thing about it? It also supports images and file lists! What does this mean?
Instead of just keeping track of copied text, Alfred also stores copied files and images in a buffer. You can then browse this buffer and paste text and images in any order you like.</p>
<figure>
    <video loading="lazy" controls="" loop="" muted="">
        <source src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/34c453b619069d7ad30a7dd46befb07b0acafe4a/0aa63/assets/images/posts/20210130-my-alfred-setup/alfred_history_compressed.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <figcaption>This video shows, how I can copy multiple items into the clipboard history and retrieve them in different orders.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I've remapped the shortcut to open the Clipboard History to <code>⇧+⌘+C</code>. It's a bit more logical to me.</p>
<p>The clipboard history is something that takes some time to get used to. The first few days or weeks you forget, that it exists. But once you've understood it, are compfortable with it and know that it's available to you in every app, you don't wan't to miss it.</p>
<h2>Snippets</h2>
<p>Yet another powerful tool hidden behind "Features" in Alfreds settings are Snippets. As the name might suggest, in snippets you can store often used text snippets. Be it canned email responses, fake credit card numbers to test your Stripe integration, Emojis or Mac Symols like <code>⌘</code> or <code>⌅</code>.</p>
<p>I've updated the keyword to open the snippet search to be￼ <code>s</code>. To paste the character <code>→</code> into a document for example, I then only have to type <code>s right</code>, select the right snippet and hit enter.</p>
<h3>Markdown Fences</h3>
<p>My most used snippets do not paste readable text into the currently focused editor, but rather a set of characters. Backticks or "Markdown fences" to be exact.</p>
<p>For 20 years now, I've used keyboards with the Swiss-German layout. To denote a word or phrase as code in Markdown, you have to enclose it in backticks (`). On the Swiss-German keyboard layout you have to hit a weird combination which gets quite annoying if you have to type it a hundred times a day. I also quickly fall out of my writing flow.<br>
So I've written 2 snippets to fix that.</p>
<p>First there is the "inline Markdown code" snippet, invoked by typing <code>imdc</code>. As the name suggests it's for highlighting code inline in a sentence (Like you've seen it scattered in the article you're reading right know).
For multi-line code examples I've created a "Markdown code" snippet, invoked by typing <code>mdc</code>.</p>
<figure>
    <video loading="lazy" controls="" loop="" muted="">
        <source src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/76011772d3b86b476840af5301be7c2ccb89f1b5/a2e5d/assets/images/posts/20210130-my-alfred-setup/alfred_markdown.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <figcaption>By using a snippet to create Markdown code fences, I can easly type my code examples without breaking my writing flow.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The best thing is, that you can use the <code>{cursor}</code> variable to automatially move the cursor between the two backticks.</p>
<p>Here's is the content of those two Markdown snippets:</p>
<pre><code># Inline Markdown Code
`{$cursor}`
</code></pre>
<pre><code># Markdown Code
```
{$cursor}
```
</code></pre>
<h3>Emojis</h3>
<p>My biggest snippet collection is centered around emojis. Wether you love them or hate them, sometimes you use them.</p>
<p>Joel Califa once created an <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="http://joelcalifa.com/blog/alfred-emoji-snippet-pack/">"Emoji Snippet Pack"</a>. This collection of snippets allows you to type <code>:v:</code> to get the ✌️ emoji.
Since Joel released his pack, new emojis have been released, and I stepped up and created a build process to his open-sourced emoji pack (<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/califa/alfred-emoji-pack/pull/1">see PR #1</a>).<br>
However, my added build process relies on dependencies which very slowly update to newly released emojis (which is okay, as these dependencies are used for something different than a snippet pack).</p>
<p>That's why I've created my own project. You can find it <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/stefanzweifel/alfred-emoji-pack">on GitHub</a>.<br>
Currently it's the same as the one from Joel, but written in PHP. The goal is, to switch the source for the emojis to the official list of available characters from unicode.org.<br>
A plus would then be to also create a new release when new emojis are being released by using GitHub Actions.
I will work on that project over the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Here's a quick video on how I use the emoji snippets.</p>
<figure>
    <video loading="lazy" controls="" loop="" muted="">
        <source src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b5f4c753aa822532c8192cd048d5e90770761269/459cd/assets/images/posts/20210130-my-alfred-setup/alfred_emoji.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <figcaption>By having all emojis available as snippets, I can type them out or search them in my snippets library. No need to scroll though Apple's emoji picker.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Miscellaneous Snippets</h3>
<p>I also have snippets which actually contain text:</p>
<ul>
<li>Canned responses to support emails or unsolicited recruiter emails,</li>
<li>Templates for certain types of notes I take</li>
<li>Code snippets I regularly use</li>
<li>Shortcuts for CLI actions (like ziping a folder on UNIX as I will never remember the options for <code>tar</code> 😅)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Workflows</h2>
<p>Next let's cover the most famous and powerful feature of Alfred: Workflows.</p>
<p>Workflows allow you to write basic programs with a drag and drop editor. You define the event that triggers the workflow (a hotkey, a snippet, a file action), define its input (keyword, file filter) and then take action it (open a file, run a search or run a script).</p>
<p>They can wary between very simple and very complex. For example "search <em>this</em> folder for <em>that</em> file type and open the file in <em>that</em> app" is quite easy to accomplish. "Search and play Spotify playlists" however is quite complex and needs a lot of scripting work.</p>
<p>So first I would like to show you some of my own workflows. They are quite simple but save me a couple of seconds every day.</p>
<h3>Open Common Folders</h3>
<p>Eventhough Alfred comes with a backed in file browser, I often still use good old Finder.app. To get access to my most used folders quickly, I've created workflows which just open that folder:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>downloads</code> opens <code>~/Downloads</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>desktop</code> opens <code>~/Desktop</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>sites</code> opens <code>~/Sites</code> (where all my code projects live)</li>
<li>
<code>inbox</code> opens my <a href="https://stefanzweifel.io/posts/2020/08/04/synology-nas-setup-2020/#folder-structure--synology-drive">File Inbox</a>
</li>
</ul>

  <figcaption>The "Common Folders" workflow is simple but effective for navigating to most used folders quickly.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Workflows like these might look silly at first. But once you realize how much time you spend browsing Finder – by mouse or keyboard – you might change your mind.</p>
<h3>File Filter Workflows</h3>
<p>Not used that much anymore but still handy, is my collection of file filters. I've created several workflows to search for files with a certain extension or just folders in a directory and pass that file to an application.</p>

</figure>
<p>For example, I can type <code>phps laravel-stats</code> to open <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/stefanzweifel/laravel-stats">laravel-stats</a> in <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PhpStorm</a>.</p>
<p>Or I can type <code>unzip backup</code> and Alfred will search for <code>.zip</code> files which have "backup" in their name. Selecting the zip file will open it in <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/ch/app/the-unarchiver/id425424353?l=en&amp;mt=12">The Unarchiver</a>.</p>

<p>Here's a quick tutorial on how to set this up yourself:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new blank workflow</li>
<li>Add a new "File Filter" input</li>
<li>Set a keyword, title and subtext that matches what you want to do.</li>
<li>Drag the file types you want to search for into the "File Types" box. For example, if you want to search for Markdown files, drag a <code>.md</code>-file into it.</li>
<li>Then create and connect a "Open File" Action with your File Filter.</li>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>There’s an old saying that we can learn a lot about people by looking at their trash. The same can hold true about programming languages. More precisely, we can learn a lot about a programming language by looking at its garbage collection. This post kicks off a series of posts (and eventually a book) about Ruby’s GC.</p>

<p>Continuing with the (admitedly not great) metaphor here, we’ll start by looking at what is always in Ruby’s trash. Ruby exposes <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.0.0/GC.html"><code>GC::INTERNAL_CONSTANTS</code></a>, so we can see what is <em>constant</em> within the garbage collector.</p>

<h3 id="gcinternal_constants">GC::INTERNAL_CONSTANTS</h3>

<p>Printing out <code>GC::INTERNAL_CONSTANTS</code> in Ruby 3.0, we see the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>:DEBUG</span><span>=&gt;</span><span>false</span><span>,</span>
  <span>:RVALUE_SIZE</span><span>=&gt;</span><span>40</span><span>,</span>
  <span>:HEAP_PAGE_OBJ_LIMIT</span><span>=&gt;</span><span>409</span><span>,</span>
  <span>:HEAP_PAGE_BITMAP_SIZE</span><span>=&gt;</span><span>56</span><span>,</span>
  <span>:HEAP_PAGE_BITMAP_PLANES</span><span>=&gt;</span><span>4</span><span>,</span>
  <span>:HEAP_PAGE_SIZE</span><span>=&gt;</span><span>16384</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ll go one by one through these constants, and in defining them, learn much more about how Ruby organizes its memory.</p>

<h4 id="debug--false">:DEBUG =&gt; FALSE</h4>

<p>This <code>:DEBUG</code> constant is really more useful for debugging writing Ruby source code than writing Ruby programs. Almost every Ruby program we run will have <code>:DEBUG =&gt; FALSE</code> so we don’t have to worry about it!</p>

<p>For the extremely curious, the only way <code>:DEBUG</code> is <code>TRUE</code> is if we compile Ruby source code with a cppflag setting <code>DGC_DEBUG</code> to true (see <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/66a844fd07ca0fd652a20a1973ea242422d4ae6d/.github/workflows/compilers.yml#L110">this example</a>). But, since most of the time we’re not compiling Ruby source code, it’ll almost always be <code>FALSE</code>.</p>

<h4 id="rvalue_size--40">:RVALUE_SIZE =&gt; 40</h4>

<p>It’s important to first note that the units for all of these constants which end in <code>_SIZE</code> are bytes. So this constant is telling us that each <code>RVALUE</code> is 40 bytes.</p>

<p>Neat. But, it begs the question, what is an <code>RVALUE</code>? An <code>RVALUE</code> contains basic information about Ruby objects. <code>RVALUES</code> are C structs which are unions of various C representations of Ruby objects.</p>

<p>As part of this information, they either contain the actual values of Ruby objects, or, if the values are too large for the 40 byte limit, they contain pointers to where on the OS heap the Ruby object’s value lives.</p>

<p>(Small aside, strings with 23 characters or fewer have thier values stored inside <code>RVALUES</code>, while strings with more than 23 characters have their values stored on the OS Heap. Pat Shaughnessy has <a href="http://patshaughnessy.net/2012/1/4/never-create-ruby-strings-longer-than-23-characters">a fun blog post</a> explaining this nuance.)</p>

<h4 id="heap_page_obj_limit--409">:HEAP_PAGE_OBJ_LIMIT =&gt; 409</h4>

<p>Okay, next up, <code>HEAP_PAGE_OBJ_LIMIT</code>. 409 is the maximum number of objects per each <code>HEAP_PAGE</code>. But what is a <code>HEAP</code> and what is a <code>PAGE</code>?</p>

<p>The Ruby <code>HEAP</code> is Ruby’s entire Object Space, or memory. It is where all of our <code>RVALUES</code> live. The <code>HEAP</code> is segmented into <code>PAGES</code>. When the garbage collector needs more memory, it doesn’t request new memory for each individual object from the OS. As we learned above with the <code>RVALUE_SIZE</code>, this would mean requesting more memory in 40 byte segments, which would be wildly inefficient.</p>

<p>Instead, when the <code>HEAP</code> needs more memory, it requests an entire new <code>PAGE</code>. These pages each contain up to 409 objects. Some pages contain slightly fewer than 409 objects; Aaron Patterson has <a href="https://tenderlovemaking.com/2017/09/27/visualizing-your-ruby-heap.html">a great blog post</a> which explains why. But, as this constant tells us, 409 is the upper limit of objects (or <code>RVALUE</code>s) per page.</p>

<h4 id="heap_page_bitmap_size--56">:HEAP_PAGE_BITMAP_SIZE =&gt; 56</h4>

<p>We now know <code>HEAP</code> and <code>PAGE</code>, but what is the <code>BITMAP</code>? Well, each <code>HEAP_PAGE</code> also has a representation of its objects in a bitmap. Each object is represented by one bit.</p>

<p>Okay, so this bitmap takes up 56 bytes of memory. The math here checks out. There are 8 bits in a byte. Which means with our 56 bytes we have access to <code>56 * 8 == 448</code> objects which will safely cover all of the 409 objects we want to represent.</p>

<p>But, I still haven’t answered the question of why we need these bitmaps to represent all of the objects in the first place. This is <em>integral</em> to the actual algorithm Ruby uses for garbage collection. It’s a tri-color mark and sweep algorithm. The details of this algorithm deserve at least one of their own entire blog posts. (When I’ve written that, I’ll link it here.) For now, you’re just going to have to trust that it’s important this bitmap exists per page, and has enough space for each object within a page.</p>

<h4 id="heap_page_bitmap_planes--4">:HEAP_PAGE_BITMAP_PLANES =&gt; 4</h4>

<p>I must admit, this one stumped me. So I <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/search?q=HEAP_PAGE_BITMAP_PLANES">searched the Ruby source code</a>, found where it is set to 4, but absolutely no use of the variable itself. As far as I can tell, this value is unused. I then, admitedly, dove deep into a nostalgic-for-travel googling of airplanes.</p>

<p>Anyways, back to the matter at hand, if anyone knows what <code>HEAP_PAGE_BITMAP_PLANES</code> means, please, please let me know, I am super curious to learn! I have a hunch that it is remnants from an older Ruby version….</p>

<h4 id="heap_page_size--16384">:HEAP_PAGE_SIZE =&gt; 16384</h4>

<p>Lastly, we have the size of the pages themselves. 16384 bytes means each page is a little over 16KB. These pages have headers with some information, and then all of their <code>RVALUES</code>. The spaces where the <code>RVALUES</code> are stored are called slots. So above, when we said the <code>HEAP_PAGE_OBJECT_LIMIT</code> was 409, another way to frame this would have been that each page has a maximum of 409 slots.</p>

<p>Again, we can check the math here. There should be enough space within each page for all of its <code>RVALUES</code>, and a little extra for the header information. We know each page has a maximum of 409 <code>RVALUES</code>, and each <code>RVALUE</code> is 40 bytes. So <code>409 * 40 == 16,306 &lt; 16384</code>.</p>

<h3 id="tldr">TL;DR</h3>

<p>For any visual learners, here’s a diagram explaining the above:</p>

<p><img src="https://jemma.dev/assets/heap-diagram.png" alt="Heap diagram"></p>

<p>And here’s a quick definition-based summary:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Heap</strong> (Variable size): Ruby’s Object Space, or memory. Where Ruby stores all of its Pages.</li>
  <li><strong>Page</strong> (~16 KB): How Ruby segments its Heap. Heaps contain pages. Pages contain at most 409 slots.</li>
  <li><strong>Slot</strong> (40 bytes): A space on a Page where an RVALUE is stored</li>
  <li><strong>RVALUE</strong> (40 bytes): Ruby’s C representation of objects. Sometimes contains the value of the object, sometimes contains a pointer to where the object lives in the OS heap</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s all for this post! As I referenced earlier, I will be writing much more about garbage collection (both blog posts and a book!!). If you’re interested in following along and hearing when I have new posts, please leave your email address below.</p>

a description of some property of your system from a description of the domain
over which that property must hold. For example, if you're testing the
'addition' operation, you might what to check the <em>property</em> that it's
commutative (the output is the same, regardless of the order). The relevant
<em>domain</em> here is pairs of numbers.</p> <p><span>For the mathematically inclined, you can think of the property as being a proposition with some number of free variables, and the domains as binding each free variable with a universal quantifier.

you're new to this, I recommend trying to write at least one proptest, then
reading the advice below.</p> <p>This is not going to be a basic 'How to proptest' tutorial. There are many, many
treatments of that subject; you should probably start with the documentation for
your language's proptest library. A few of my favorites are:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://github.com/AltSysrq/proptest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proptest (Rust)</a> (We use this extensively at Auxon)</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/clojure/test.check" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">test.check (Clojure)</a></li> <li><a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hypothesis (Python)</a></li></ul> <p>Property-based testing libraries are extensively available. There's probably one
you can use in your language of choice.</p> <h3 id="why-proptest"><a href="#why-proptest">#</a> Why Proptest?</h3> <p>Testing and specification can be thought of as a spectrum of rigor. On the
least-rigorous end, we have manual testing and regular written specifications.
Moving up, we find automated unit / integration test and executable
specification languages (like Cucumber, another popular tool at Auxon). Then
there's a massive gulf, and everything gets starts getting academic and
difficult; symbolic execution, model checking, and formal proofs show up at the far end.</p> <p><img src="https://blog.auxon.io/images/posts/effective-property-based-testing-1.png" alt="property-based"></p> <p>Proptests are somewhere in the middle, just a little past the tests you're
already doing. They're a very practical way of verifying your implementation
against a rigorous, executable specification. But they're not much harder to
write than the unit tests you're already doing.</p> <h3 id="terminology-check"><a href="#terminology-check">#</a> Terminology Check</h3> <p>Different proptest libraries use different words to talk about the same thing.
In this article, I'll use 'Generator' to talk about the thing that defines the
input domain for your proptest. (Some people refer to proptests as generative
testing). This is also known as a 'Strategy' in Rust proptest / Python
hypothesis parlance.</p> <p>Code examples will be written in Rust, but the concepts and recommendations
apply to any proptest framework.</p> <h2 id="write-em-compose-em-put-em-in-a-suite"><a href="#write-em-compose-em-put-em-in-a-suite">#</a> Write 'em, Compose 'em, Put 'em in a Suite</h2> <h3 id="item-1-develop-a-generator-library"><a href="#item-1-develop-a-generator-library">#</a> Item 1: Develop a Generator Library</h3> <p>Your program probably has a bunch of classes or data structures that it cares
about deeply, that are central to its operation and passed all around the
system. You should identify theses data structures and write generators for
them. You can do this incrementally, as you begin to work with proptests.</p> <h3 id="item-2-be-a-little-suspicious-of-type-based-generators"><a href="#item-2-be-a-little-suspicious-of-type-based-generators">#</a> Item 2: Be a little suspicious of type-based generators</h3> <p>Many proptest frameworks provide a way to make a generator directly from a
structure, type, or schema definition. These are of course very convenient, and
I've used them often. But they're not as clearly good as you might think.</p> <p>First, your types may not be as precise as what you need for your generators.
Maybe you have a single type which can have two distinct data variants (maybe
both valid and invalid requests?) which you want to generate separately. Second,
event if your type definition is fully precise, you may find that practical
execution considerations require you to make size or other input domain
restrictions in the generators. This happens fairly frequently.</p> <p>For these reasons, I recommend staying away for type-based generators for all
but the most simple applications. We've found that's it's best to just start
with standalone generators; it costs a little more up front, but I always end up
converting to them later on anyways. Clojure's <code>core.spec</code>-based generators are
an exception here, as they provide an ad-hoc way to override portions of the
generated generator. But even then, it's a fairly laborious process.</p> <h3 id="item-3-touch-test-your-generators"><a href="#item-3-touch-test-your-generators">#</a> Item 3: Touch-test your generators</h3> <p>When you're writing your generators, use your language's interactive execution
facilities to try them out. It's common to find unexpected variations in
proptest-generated data, and this can help you shortcut the "WHY did my tests
fail?" process. I've had a lot of success using this technique in Clojure.</p> <h3 id="item-4-learn-your-combinators"><a href="#item-4-learn-your-combinators">#</a> Item 4: Learn your Combinators</h3> <p>Proptest libraries are built from small generators that can be combined to form
more complex structures. Some of these are language/environment dependent, but
the important ones are common:</p> <ul><li><p>Primitive types - You'll start with generators for all the primitives in your
language: integers, floats, strings, etc.</p></li> <li><p>Collection types - Look for direct support for native collections in your
framework; you can use these to generate a collection of anything else you can
generate. Note that collection size can be bounded; you'll find this necessary
when developing larger compound generators.</p></li> <li><p><code>just</code> / <code>return</code> - Proptest frameworks always have a way to 'lift' a single
value, creating a generator that just spits out that value every time.</p></li> <li><p><code>map</code> - Transform a generated value in some way. You might use this to
generate numbers that have been converted to strings.</p></li> <li><p><code>filter</code> - Throw out generated values if they don't pass some test. This is
convenient but a little dangerous; see <a href="#filtering">below</a>.</p></li> <li><p><code>tuple</code> - Get data from multiple generators together. (This is kind of like
'and')</p></li> <li><p><code>one of</code> / <code>choose</code> - Get data from one of the given generators. (This is kind
of like 'or')</p></li> <li><p>data structures - Different frameworks approach this differently, but most
provide some amount of sugar to help you generate native data structures.
Lacking that, one effective strategy is to start with a <code>tuple</code> generator with
one item for each field in your data structure, then use <code>map</code> generator to
put them all together.</p></li> <li><p>recursive structures - If you want to generate a tree or some other kind of
recursive data structure, look for direct support for that in your framework.</p></li></ul> <h3 id="item-5-prefer-constructive-generation-to-filtering"><a href="#item-5-prefer-constructive-generation-to-filtering">#</a> Item 5: Prefer Constructive Generation to Filtering</h3> <p>The <code>filter</code> combinator is really easy, and one of the first things people
reach for when writing proptests for the first time. The trouble with this
is that it's inefficient, and it can break down entirely when used broadly.</p> <p>Suppose you wanted to make a generator for even numbers. It's easy to do with <code>filter</code>:</p> <p>This works, but it's doing a lost of wasted work: half of all the numbers
generated by the first step will be thrown out. Suppose you did the same thing
to generate multiples of 10: you'll be throwing away 90% of your work. Powers of
two? That's way out of hand. Most proptest frameworks will abort execution if
they aren't able to generate a valid sample after some number of tries.</p> <p>This is not only a problem with single value generators: you'll find that as you
start to combine generators to produce more complex structures, the effects of
multiple filter-based generators will accumulate, and you'll be aborting
execution all the time.</p> <p>The solution to this is to instead build your generators constructively. Start
with a fully specified domain, then transform that to get what you want. This
can be tricky, and sometimes requires oblique thinking to get it right. In the
case of our even numbers, it's not too bad:</p> <p>This is not a hard-and-fast rule; there are plenty of times where <code>filter</code> is
the only choice. But you should beware of your <code>filter</code>'s selectivity, and be
careful of using it too much.</p> <h3 id="item-6-use-flatmap-bind-for-data-dependencies"><a href="#item-6-use-flatmap-bind-for-data-dependencies">#</a> Item 6: Use flatmap/bind for Data Dependencies</h3> <p>Many data structures have some kind of internal consistency requirement. For
example, you might have a record that contains a vector of strings, and an index
into that list representing a cursor. We'd like to only generate valid cursors.
(Sometimes you want to generate <em>invalid</em> cursors as well, of course)</p> <p>The naive way to do this might be to start with a <code>tuple</code> of the vector
generator and a cursor generator, and then use <code>filter</code> to remove all tuples
where the cursor is out of bounds:</p> <p>This is a correct and succinct way to specify the constraint, but you'll find
that your proptest framework probably gives up after generating too many
candidates that don't match. It's radically inefficient at best.</p> <p>The constructive way to do this is to start with a generator for the list of
strings, and then use <code>flatmap</code> (or <code>bind</code>, the names vary) to generate an
in-bounds index:</p> <h3 id="item-7-bound-your-collections"><a href="#item-7-bound-your-collections">#</a> Item 7: Bound your collections</h3> <p>When you're making generators for collection-typed values (Vectors, Lists,
Maps, etc), it's tempting to say "do this for ALL the possible collections!" In
terms of specification, that's correct. But in terms of execution, it can get
out of hand. Does your system <em>really</em> need to be able to handle 200 million
distinct zip codes?</p> <p>This can get especially bad if you have compound data structures with collections nested under other collections. Even if your implementation can gracefully handle the load, you may find that your proptest framework cannot.</p> <p>You should carefully consider what you actually care about verifying,
and target that. I often choose a 'reasonable' (which depends on the context)
limit to the size of straight collections of simple values. When dealing with
nested collections, the "zero, one, many" rule of thumb applies; <code>many == 2 or 3</code> typically works well.</p> <h2 id="look-it-s-a-propiphaunt"><a href="#look-it-s-a-propiphaunt">#</a> Look! It's a Propiphaunt!</h2> <h3 id="item-8-start-small"><a href="#item-8-start-small">#</a> Item 8: Start small</h3> <p>When you're bringing proptest into a code base for the first time, it's tempting
to Specify All The Things. This is unfortunately a good way to fail. If you jump
into the deep end, you'll find that your proptests are mysteriously failing or
hanging in ways you can't explain. It's important to go at this incrementally as
you develop a feel for what kinds of generators your system needs, and what
kinds of properties you can feasibly verify.</p> <p>Start by proptesting your pure …</p></div></div>

          <section>
            <p>During this global pandemic, online video calls have become essential to the way we work. Millions of workers are now accustomed to hopping on calls with their colleagues to hash things out that they would previously have done in person. Zoom has shown itself to be a reliable partner for video conferencing. However, as a company, Zoom has given <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/03/31/zoom-meeting-encryption/">plenty of</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/10/apple-silent-update-zoom-app/">reasons to</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/3/21279355/zoom-end-encryption-calls-fbi-police-free-users">avoid</a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/12/876351501/zoom-acknowledges-it-suspended-activists-accounts-at-china-s-request">its software.</a></p>

<p>The world’s new reliance on video conferencing got me thinking: <em>How hard could it be to build a video conferencing web application?</em> Like most things worth doing, the answer was <em>difficult, but fun</em>.</p>

<p>When I first started researching for this project, I discovered that there isn’t much information out there about building a WebRTC-based application from start to finish. Mozilla’s WebRTC documentation is invaluable, but it lacked answers to some of the questions I had. And tutorials that exist generally only cover connecting two users in a fairly basic way. I wanted to do something more ambitious.</p>

<h2 id="what-were-going-to-build">What we’re going to build:</h2>

<p>In this article, we’re going to build a real-time video chat application with the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The app will allow users to create video chat rooms with a unique slug, allowing any user to join.</li>
  <li>The app will keep track of which users are connected to the given room.</li>
  <li>The app will allow users to establish a group video call with eachother through WebRTC peer connections.</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, that sounds easy enough. Creating pages with central information on the fly in a web app is the bread and butter of any self-respecting web framework—and with Phoenix it’s a piece of cake. Tracking users seems a little tricky, but if you’ve heard of what LiveView and PubSub can do, you can probably guess that we’re still on the right track. WebRTC was designed for video calls, but group video calls? That might get complex. Plus, how would that even work if each of the connections is only peer-to-peer? We’ll get to that.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://littlechat.app/">We’ve wrapped up the finished product and deployed it at littlechat.app</a>. Try creating a room and hopping on it with a friend or two. That’s what we’re going to create.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/littlelines/littlechat">You can also find the source code for this project here if you’re more of the self-guided type.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>I’m going to assume that you are comfortable working with Elixir and Phoenix. I’ll assume that you might have toyed around with LiveView a few times before this article, but it doesn’t take much to get up to speed. Finally, I’ll assume you have no WebRTC experience beyond having heard about it a few times.</p>

<p>We will be using the latest versions of Elixir, Erlang, Phoenix, and Phoenix LiveView in this article, which are the following at the time of writing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Elixir 1.10.3</li>
  <li>Erlang 23.0.2</li>
  <li>Phoenix 1.5.3</li>
  <li>Phoenix LiveView 0.13.3</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-tech">The Tech</h2>

<h3 id="webrtc">WebRTC</h3>

<p>Web Real Time Communication, or WebRTC for short, is a technology that allows real-time, peer-to-peer communication between users. It provides an API for handling user video, audio, and other data via peer-to-peer connections.</p>

<p>WebRTC has been around since 2011, but implementation by the various browsers has been uneven over the years. Nowadays, each browser has a more consistent WebRTC implementation, making browser support much better, but implementing it can still be a dance.</p>

<p>What makes WebRTC so flexible—and, at times, confounding—is that it has no standardized server-side implementation. WebRTC does not care how users in a video chat learn about each other and send their connection information, it only handles how to connect those users once their information has been sent. This originally confused me, as I was not sure where the server-side <em>signaling</em> (the WebRTC term for the process of telling two users about each other for a peer connection) ended and the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> began. We’ll dig into this later.</p>

<h3 id="phoenix">Phoenix</h3>

<p>Elixir’s Phoenix framework allows us to build reliable and performant web applications built on Erlang’s rock-solid foundation. On any project, my first instinct these days is to reach for Phoenix. But the motivation goes deeper.</p>

<p>Elixir is built on Erlang’s VM, which was specifically developed for the challenges of the telecoms industry, where fault-tolerance and high-availability are essential. That sounds perfect for this project.</p>

<h3 id="liveview">LiveView</h3>

<p><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html">LiveView</a> is one of my favorite components of Phoenix. It makes real-time user interaction between the client’s UI and the server seamless, without needing to write (much) JavaScript. LiveView makes real-time user interactions much easier to build and maintain, all while working within familiar concepts: Phoenix, Elixir, and OTP.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>Have you got all your tools ready? Let’s go!</p>

<p>First, we’re going to create a new Phoenix project with LiveView already configured. If you’re trying to add video chat to an existing app without LiveView already configured, <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/installation.html#content">LiveView is pretty easy to set up from scratch too.</a> We’re going to call our project Littlechat, a portmenteau of Littlelines and chat.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>mix phx.new littlechat --live</code></pre></div>

<p>Now let’s <code>cd littlechat</code> into our brand new app and install its dependencies.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>cd </span>littlechat
<span>$ </span>mix deps.get
<span>$ </span>npm install --prefix assets</code></pre></div>

<p>Standard stuff. Let’s go a little deeper.</p>

<h2 id="creating-the-rooms">Creating the Rooms</h2>

<p>Users can’t connect to each other if they don’t have a place to meet, so let’s build them a room!</p>

<p>Let’s create a <em>context</em> called <code>Organizer</code> with a schema <code>Room</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>mix phx.gen.context Organizer Room rooms title:string slug:string</code></pre></div>

<p>That generated a few files for us, <code>lib/littlechat/organizer.ex</code>, <code>lib/littlechat/organizer/room.ex</code>, and a migration file ending in <code>XXXXX_create_rooms.exs</code> Let’s start with our Room schema.</p>

<p>Our rooms will only have two data to start, <code>slug</code> and <code>title</code>, both strings. <code>slug</code> will be the unique identifier for the room, so we’ll need to add a unique index to the database to prevent collisions. Let’s set up the database:</p>

<div><pre><code><span># priv/repo/migrations/XXXXX_create_rooms.exs</span>

<span>defmodule</span> <span>Littlechat.Repo.Migrations.CreateRooms</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>use</span> <span>Ecto.Migration</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>change</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>create</span> <span>table</span><span>(</span><span>"rooms"</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>add</span> <span>:slug</span><span>,</span> <span>:string</span>
      <span>add</span> <span>:title</span><span>,</span> <span>:string</span>

      <span>timestamps</span><span>()</span>
    <span>end</span>

    <span>create</span> <span>unique_index</span><span>(</span><span>:rooms</span><span>,</span> <span>:slug</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></div>

<p>For the schema, we’re going to create a basic changeset function with the added <code>unique_constraint</code> on slug. But we’re also going to add a private function, <code>format_slug/1</code> for the purpose of cleaning our slug input.</p>

<div><pre><code><span># lib/littlechat/room.ex</span>

<p>Great! Now we can create rooms in the database. What about getting one from the DB? Easy.</p>

<div><pre><code><span># lib/littlechat/organizer.ex</span>

<span>defmodule</span> <span>Littlechat.Organizer</span> <span>do</span>

<p>Now let’s build LiveViews for creating and viewing rooms.</p>

<p>We’re going to create two LiveViews, <code>LittlechatWeb.Room.NewLive</code> and <code>LittlechatWeb.Room.ShowLive</code>, the former for creating and the latter for showing the rooms. Let’s start with <code>NewLive</code>:</p>

  <li>Inside of this template, we create a basic form for creating a new Room. Note the reference to the <code>@changeset</code> assign.</li>
  <li>We then tell the form (via LiveView) to send the event <code>"validate"</code> to the server every time user input is added.</li>
  <li>Finally, we tell the form to send the event <code>"submit"</code>, along with the associated form data, to the server when the user makes a submit action (presses enter or clicks “Submit”).</li>

February 3, 2021 | https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-huawei-telecoms-plan/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-huawei-telecoms-plan/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
									
<p>The German government is preparing a massive investment plan to boost the development of local telecoms firms, in an effort to pivot away from dominant suppliers like China's Huawei.</p>



<p>The plan, dubbed the "joint proposal for action" by the ministries of interior, economy, research and transport, and seen by POLITICO, lays out how the government plans to spend €2 billion in funding from its larger coronavirus recovery stimulus program <a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-en/news/konjunkturpaket-1757640" target="_blank">presented in June</a>.</p>



<p>"The prosperity and competitiveness of Germany and Europe will increasingly depend on mastering new communication technologies," the proposal said, adding that this would "require a common political and industrial commitment at national and European level." </p>



<p>The plan comes as European governments increasingly take steps to box out Chinese tech giant Huawei from 5G-rollout plans due to security concerns. The restrictions mean telecoms operators have become more reliant on Sweden's Ericsson and Finland's Nokia, triggering calls from telecoms <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1578702">operators</a> and some lawmakers to open up the supply chain to new players.</p>



<p>The German draft proposal includes over €300 million of investment in Open RAN technology, €237 million for a 6G research hub and €250 million to boost demand and expand 5G networks.</p>



<p>The draft also earmarked €550 million of German public investment in Europe's microchip market through a joint project, <a href="https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/DE/Pressemitteilungen/2021/02/20210202-gemeinsames-europaeisches-grossprojekt-zu-mikroelektronik-und-kommunikationstechnologien-geht-in-die-startbloecke.html" target="_blank">announced Tuesday</a>, between the government, the EU and local industry players.</p>



<p>The draft proposal was <a href="https://www.handelsblatt.com/technik/it-internet/open-ran-geheimpapier-milliarden-fuer-neue-mobilfunktechnik-sollen-abhaengigkeit-von-huawei-verringern/26830274.html?ticket=ST-5932468-7f1AIvazemqcyVbktwbi-ap6" target="_blank">first reported by Handelsblatt</a>.</p>



<h3>Looking for new 5G</h3>



<p>The government wants to prioritize "open RAN" technologies throughout its telecoms investment plan, a concept that would chop up the 5G supply chain into smaller pieces and break the market power of large end-to-end vendors like Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia.</p>



<p>Ericsson and Nokia "for long have held a globally good position," the text said, but "China is however technological frontrunner in 5G mobile networks." </p>



<p>"Germany and Europe need to urgently strengthen their competences and develop industrial ecosystems for Open RAN and 6G technologies, including hardware and software," it said.</p>



<p>The adoption of Open RAN could mean a blow for Ericsson and Nokia, which <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1431389">have benefited</a> from the pushback against Huawei. But <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/oran-reflow-huawei-europe-telecoms-5g/">the concept is heavily favored by telecoms operators</a>, who use the equipment and complain that they are too reliant on gear from the two European suppliers.</p>



<p>The plan seeks to facilitate "Germany's entry into technologies for Open RAN solutions," with hopes to establish new companies in niche markets like network integration and edge computing software.</p>



<p>These services and products are currently part of major contracts between operators and major vendors like Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia. </p>



<p>Experts have warned that the Open RAN technology is still immature and it could take years for these new types of networks to function as well as conventional 5G systems.</p>



<p>But the concept has gained influence in countries including the U.S. and the U.K., where lawmakers sought ways to replace Huawei.</p>



<p>In the European Union, Germany so far has been among the most eager to promote the concept — which is also heavily favored by its telecoms giant Deutsche Telekom as it looks to exit its <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/deutsche-telekom-huawei-us-security-measures/">dependency on Huawei equipment</a>.</p>



<h3>Microchip plan</h3>



<p>Also on Tuesday, the German government said it wants to boost the German and European semiconductor industry with new EU, German and private investments to boost chip manufacturing and design firms.</p>



<p>“We want Germany and Europe to become more sovereign and independent of imports when it comes to microelectronics and communication technologies," Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said in a statement, announcing the <a href="https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/DE/Pressemitteilungen/2021/02/20210202-gemeinsames-europaeisches-grossprojekt-zu-mikroelektronik-und-kommunikationstechnologien-geht-in-die-startbloecke.html" target="_blank">government's plan</a> to launch a so-called Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI), elected projects that are set up to allow EU and national public funding to help private companies develop new technologies like microchips.. </p>



<p>The global semiconductor supply chain is dominated by U.S., Taiwanese, Chinese and Korean firms. Europe lags far behind in the supply of high-end chips, though it has a handful of companies that champion supply-chain niches like chip-printing machines and chips for cars.</p>



<p>The German call to launch an IPCEI project comes in the wake of <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/computer-chip-shortage-disrupts-global-car-production/a-56224486" target="_blank">warnings by its car industry</a> last month that a chip shortage was disrupting its production.</p>



<p>The European Commission is also working on a strategy to catch up on chips. It <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1572339">launched discussions</a> with Europe’s leading firms in a bid to launch an “alliance” of firms, institutes and national governments to pool investments and set up joint projects this spring, including a manufacturing plant for high-end chips.</p>



<p><em>This article was updated to reflect that Important Projects of Common European Interest are approved under EU state aid rules.</em></p>

<![CDATA[Constant Folding in Python]]>
            </title>

February 3, 2021 | https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/constant-folding-python | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/constant-folding-python">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Every programming language aims to be performant in its niche and achieving superior performance requires a lot of compiler level optimizations. One famous optimization technique is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_folding">Constant Folding</a> where during compile time the engine tries to recognize constant expressions, evaluate them, and replaces the expression with this newly evaluated value, making the runtime leaner.</p>
<p>In this essay, we dive deep and find what exactly is Constant Folding, understand the scope of it in the world of Python and finally go through Python's source code - <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/">CPython</a> - and find out how elegantly Python actually implements it.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_folding">Constant Folding</a>, the engine finds and evaluates constant expressions at compile time rather than computing them at runtime, making the runtime leaner and faster.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>day_sec = <span>24</span> * <span>60</span> * <span>60</span>
</code></pre>
<p>When the compiler encounters a constant expression, like above, it evaluates the expression and replaces it with the evaluated value. The expression is usually replaced by the evaluated value in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">Abstract Syntax Tree</a>, but the implementation is totally up to the language. Hence the above expression is effectively executed as</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>day_sec = <span>86400</span>
</code></pre>

<p>In Python, we could use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html#module-dis">Disassembler module</a> to get the CPython bytecode giving us a good peek at how things will be executed. When we disassemble the above constant expression using the <code>dis</code> module, we get the following bytecode</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>import</span> dis
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>dis.dis(<span>"day_sec = 24 * 60 * 60"</span>)

        <span>0</span> LOAD_CONST               <span>0</span> (<span>86400</span>)
        <span>2</span> STORE_NAME               <span>0</span> (day_sec)
        <span>4</span> LOAD_CONST               <span>1</span> (<span>None</span>)
        <span>6</span> RETURN_VALUE
</code></pre>
<p>We see that the bytecode, instead of having two binary multiply operations followed by one <code>LOAD_CONST</code>, is having just one <code>LOAD_CONST</code> with the already evaluated value of <code>86400</code>. This indicates that the CPython interpreter during parsing and building of Abstract Syntax Tree folded the constant expression, <code>24 * 60 * 60</code> and replaced it with the evaluated value <code>86400</code>.</p>
<h3>Scope of Constant Folding</h3>
<p>Python tries to fold every single constant expression present but there are some cases where even though the expression is constant, but Python chooses not to fold it. For example, Python does not fold <code>x = 4 ** 64</code> while it does fold <code>x = 2 ** 64</code>.</p>
<p>Apart from the arithmetic expressions, Python also folds expressions involving Strings and Tuples, where constant string expressions till the length <code>4096</code> are folded.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a = <span>"-"</span> * <span>4096</span>   
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a = <span>"-"</span> * <span>4097</span>   
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a = <span>"--"</span> * <span>4096</span>  
</code></pre>

<p>Now we shift our focus to the internals and find exactly where and how CPython implements Constant Folding. All AST optimizations, including Constant Folding, can be found in file <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Python/ast_opt.c">ast_opt.c</a>. The base function starting it all is <code>astfold_expr</code> which folds any and every expression that Python source has. The function recursively goes through the AST and tries to fold every constant expression, as seen in the snippet below.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/103898628-38922200-511b-11eb-965f-fb4d46d3c45c.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/103898628-38922200-511b-11eb-965f-fb4d46d3c45c.png"></p>
<p>The <code>astfold_expr</code> before folding the expression at hand, tries to fold its child expressions (operands) and then delegates the folding to the corresponding specific expression folding function. The operation-specific folding function evaluates the expression and returns the evaluated constant value, which is then put into the AST.</p>
<p>For example, whenever <code>astfold_expr</code> encounters a binary operation, it recursively folds the two child operands (expressions) before evaluating the expression at hand using <code>fold_binop</code>. The function <code>fold_binop</code> returns the evaluated constant value as seen in the snippet below.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/103898745-670ffd00-511b-11eb-88a9-f741157473b3.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/103898745-670ffd00-511b-11eb-88a9-f741157473b3.png"></p>
<p><code>fold_binop</code> function folds the binary operation by checking the kind of operator at hand and then invoking the corresponding evaluation function on them. For example, if the operation at hand is an addition then, to evaluate the final value, it invokes <code>PyNumber_Add</code> on both its left and right operands.</p>
<h3>What makes this elegant?</h3>
<p>Instead of writing special logic to handle certain patterns or types to fold constant expressions efficiently, CPython invokes the same general code. For example, it invokes the same usual <code>PyNumber_Add</code> function while folding that it does to perform the usual addition operation.</p>
<p>CPython has thus eradicated the need to write special functions to handle constant folding by making sure its code and evaluation process is structured in such a way that the general-purpose code itself can handle the evaluation of constant expressions.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><img alt="rails saml abstract" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/4e19e5a1a96df85fc6b0aedeb7ec10a2947d23e7/44b01/img/railssaml.jpg"><h3>SAML Background<a href="#saml-background" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>SAML SSO refers to an authentication mechanism preferred by enterprise companies. The SSO part stands for Single Sign-On. From the enterprise’s perspective, they desire a centralized service where their employees can authenticate, which then provides authenticated access to the applications they use for work. These services are called Identity Providers (IDPs), and they are the <em>Single</em> place where enterprise employees <em>Sign-On.</em> This is an alternative to employees using password-based authentication for each of the various applications they use.</p><p>The SAML part stands for Secure Assertion Markup Language. SAML utilizes a domain-specific flavor of XML that describes an authenticated user, encoded to a string and passed to your application in a query parameter. Your application decodes the <code>SAMLResponse</code> using a key that the enterprise provides to you.</p><p>The details of the SAML Response are less important than understanding the general flow. When a user wants to sign in using SAML, you must send that user to their Identity Provider with a <code>SAMLRequest</code> that identifies your application. The user signs in to their IDP, and is redirected back to you with the <code>SAMLResponse</code>. What makes this a tiny bit complicated for a multi-tenant application is routing the user to the correct IDP, as SAML SSO breaks our common understanding of a login flow.</p><p>A typical login screen might have an email and password field, then a few buttons to sign in with OAuth services, like Google or GitHub. But now, you’ll need to gather something from the user who wants to sign in such that you can send them to the correct IDP instance.  We like to say that SAML is <em>instance based</em>, especially when <a href="https://ossoapp.com/blog/saml-vs-oauth">compared to OAuth</a>, which we can think of as <em>class based</em>. Domain is a common key for this process - you can ask a user for their email, grab the domain, and use that as a key to find the correct IDP instance and redirect the user.</p><h3>Let’s Build and Iterate<a href="#lets-build-and-iterate" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Once you wrap your head around understanding the SAML flow, it’s really not challenging to implement SAML in a Rails app - IDPs themselves offer great open source libraries to help with your integration. You can definitely get very far in a day or two. But like most things in engineering, the last 10% can take 90% of the effort, and while we all love to say “I could build that in a weekend,” we often later eat our words when we realize all of the edge cases, documentation needs, scaling challenges and unknown unknowns that make this or any other project worth doing a bit more involved than a quick weekend hack.</p><p>I’m a co-founder of an open source company Osso - our microservice is a Ruby and React app that allows you to onboard SAML SSO customers, generates custom documentation for each customer to perform their onboarding tasks in their IDP, and allows your Rails app to consume Osso using OAuth - we even provide <code>omniauth-osso</code> to make consuming an Osso instance from your Rails app incredibly simple.</p><p>Osso also offers paid plans, and you can skip right to our <a href="https://ossoapp.com/pricing">pricing page</a> to learn more about hosted Osso if you need SAML yesterday. Or you can jump right in to <a href="https://ossoapp.com/docs/deploy/overview">deploying an open source Osso instance</a> from our GitHub repo. There’s certainly the possibility of using <code>osso-rb</code> in your Rails app directly — you’ll want to mount our 3 rack based apps, pull in migrations, etc. — but this post will focus instead on a microservices approach.</p><p><strong>So</strong>, if you’d like to begin from first principles, follow along here as we build up a production-ready SAML SSO integration, starting with a single tenant approach, then layering in multi-tenancy. Once we have multi-tenant support, we’ll address questions about scalability and serviceability — how can we repeatedly add additional tenants, without spending significant engineering or customer support cycles? I <em>will</em> encourage you to use Osso, and show you exactly how, but will also highlight the things you need to be considering in order to roll out a production ready SAML integration <em>without</em> Osso.</p><p>We’ll use a single Rails app repository throughout this tutorial. The <a href="https://github.com/enterprise-oss/saml-rails" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">main branch</a> is a barebones Rails 6 app with Devise and a User model, and for each of our steps below we’ll move to a feature branch so we can see a full diff. Each step adds more functionality, getting you closer to a production-ready, multi-tenant integration. Each step also uses open source software, where the library used in the previous step is a dependency of the next step’s library. Neat!</p><p>We’ll also make use of Osso’s <a href="https://github.com/enterprise-oss/sinatra-ruby-idp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mock IDP</a> and <a href="https://demo.ossoapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demo instance</a>, especially when we get into multi-tenancy. You’ll still want to register with an IDP for a developer account in order to have access to an IDP for a second tenant - we recommend an <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Okta developer account</a>.</p><h3>Base Rails application<a href="#base-rails-application" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>We’ll use the same Rails 6 application for each step - the source code is available [here] (<a href="https://github.com/enterprise-oss/saml-rails" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/enterprise-oss/saml-rails</a>). The <code>main</code> branch adds Devise with a User model to a brand new Rails app using Postgres as the database. The application doesn’t do anything - there is an index route and a logged in route that will tell you the email for the current user. This guide assumes proficiency with Rails, so it will skip some details. We’ll also use some intentionally naive approaches to demonstrate common challenges of SAML SSO. </p><h3>Single tenant<a href="#single-tenant" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><h4>With ruby-saml and mock IDP<a href="#with-ruby-saml-and-mock-idp" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>My first experience with SAML was working on <a href="https://medium.com/@tsharon/democratizing-ux-670b95fbc07f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">internal software at WeWork</a> where one of my Osso co-founders was a teammate. The IT department required us to use SAML SSO, which I at first was awfully annoyed by. Google OAuth was super easy, and could be restricted to domain, so what’s the deal with this OneLogin thing? Fortunately, single-tenant SAML was just as simple to implement, and admittedly did include some better security. This is a common situation — an enterprise company requires SAML, and it might seem silly to you, but them’s the rules.</p><p>Our project was a Rails app, and we used a Ruby gem from OneLogin to handle the actual SAML encoding and decoding. Since we were building this app for WeWork employees, we had a single tenant, and didn’t need to worry about implementing a scalable solution for multiple tenants, documenting how to set SAML up for the app or training our teammates on how it worked. We also didn’t need to change our login form - we knew every user would be sent to the same IDP instance, so we were able to use a simple <em>Sign in With OneLogin</em> button.</p><p>That’s what we’ll do here, and if you’re building internal software this will be a fine approach for your production release! We’ll use Osso’s mock IDP for this single tenant to keep things simple too.</p><p>First lets install the ruby-saml gem. We’ll include it in our Gemfile and run <code>$ bundle install</code>.</p><p>We’ll use this library in two ways:</p><p>First, when a user wishes to sign in with SAML, we use ruby-saml to generate a url with a <code>SAMLRequest</code> - the URL is where we will send the user to sign in, and the <code>SAMLRequest</code> is sent along as a query param in order to identify our application to the IDP.</p><p>When the user signs in to their IDP, they will be sent back to your application with a <code>SAMLResponse</code> query param. We then use ruby-saml to decode and validate the <code>SAMLResponse</code>, allowing us to access information describing the user, such as their email address.</p><p>Lets define a couple of routes and controller actions to handle this flow.</p><p>In the <code>saml_login</code> action, we create a <code>OneLogin::RubySaml::Authrequest</code> and redirect to the return value. Later, in the callback, we validate and decode the response, and will sign the user in and redirect them if valid. Otherwise we’ll raise the validation errors to understand where our SAML config went wrong.</p><p>This callback route will also need to accept a POST request with <code>www-url-form-encoded</code> parameters, so you will need to skip the Rails <code>verify_authenticity_token</code> <code>before_action</code>:</p><div><p>app/controllers/application_controller.rb</p></div><p>Both of these actions depend on what ruby-saml calls <code>settings</code>. These values are created via the configuration you must perform between your application and the Identity Provider. In a real-world example, your application generates a few values which you provide to your customer. The customer uses these to configure your application in their IDP and returns some data generated by the IDP. We’ll discuss this process in more detail later. Since we are using the Osso Mock IDP we can mostly skip this configuration step, but it’s worth understanding what each of these values represents, how it functions and why it might prevent your user from signing in if misconfigured.</p><p>Each of the controller actions above calls a private method <code>saml_settings</code>. Since we are dealing with a single tenant, we will essentially hardcode the SAML configuration values to support this one IDP instance.</p><div><p>app/controllers/application_controller.rb</p></div><p><strong>Values you provide</strong></p><p><strong>ACS URL</strong> - The Assertion Consumer Service URL is where the IDP will send the user with a SAMLResponse when they log in. Similar to a Redirect URI in OAuth, your application will generate this value according to how your routes are set up.</p><p><strong>SP Entity ID</strong>  - Sometimes called the Audience URI, this is a unique identifier for the tenant in your application. This can get hairy! <strong>Google</strong> requires that they be unique for a customer, so you can't just use domain, while <strong>Azure</strong> won't let you use a UUID and <strong>Ping</strong> won't let you use a url. Those are just <em>some</em> of the edge cases we've found!</p><p><strong>Values the IDP provides</strong></p><p><strong>IDP SSO Target URL</strong> - The single sign on target URL tells your application where to send a user with a <code>SAMLRequest</code> in order to sign in.</p><p><strong>IDP Certificate</strong> - An x509 certificate which includes a public key that your application uses to encode and decode the SAML request and response.</p><p>Since we are using the Mock IDP, these values can be found in the Mock IDP’s federated metadata: <a href="https://github.com/enterprise-oss/sinatra-ruby-idp/blob/main/metadata.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/enterprise-oss/sinatra-ruby-idp/blob/main/metadata.xml</a></p><p>To enforce good security practices, we put the certificate in Rails credentials. We won't show you our whole certificate here, but here's part of an …</p></section></div>

<p>Update: There was a delightful discussion about functional programming and the nature of Rust at <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/434bly/is_rust_functional_programming_language">lobste.rs</a>.
</p><div>
  <div>
    <blockquote>
<p>Functional languages take away mutability from the “mutability + aliasing = bugs” equation; Rust takes away the aliasing — or at least, the uncontrolled aliasing. To me, it then makes sense to feel comfortable using mutability (and the advantages it offers), safe in the knowledge that the compiler is helping you avoid bugs. [<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/434bly/is_rust_functional_programming_language#c_slxmwj">vfoley</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I guess I don’t really agree with all of this. I agree that Rust gets the nice properties of functional languages at least when it comes to mutation, but if someone read the body of Rust code I have written and came back and said, “it really resembles the code I typically write on Lisp/ML/Haskell,” then I would be really surprised. I rarely write higher order functions. I rarely write recursive functions or folds. I rarely use persistent data structures and instead use mutation without reservation. [<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/434bly/is_rust_functional_programming_language#c_aucsix">burntsushi</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://lobste.rs/s/434bly/is_rust_functional_programming_language#c_zbcp7s">andyc</a> pointed to <a href="https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/notes-on-a-smaller-rust/">Notes on a smaller Rust
</a> and quoted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I said once, pure functional programming is an ingenious trick to show you can code without mutation, but Rust is an even cleverer trick to show you can just have mutation.</p>
</blockquote>

  </div>
  <p><a href="">expand&nbsp;</a>
</p></div>

<hr>
<p>The book <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-rust/9781491927274/">Programming Rust</a> introduces Rust as...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>not really an object-oriented language, although it has some object-oriented characteristics. Rust is not a functional language […] It’s probably best to reserve judgement about what sort of language Rust is, and see what you think once you’ve become comfortable with the language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Time for judgement has come! In the following I will lay out my view on how Rust’s language features influence programming style. I do agree with the aforementioned quote that Rust is not a single-paradigm language. Yet, the code written in idiomatic and safe Rust shares quite some similarities with code of functional programming languages.</p>
<p>“Functional programming language” is not a clearly defined term. From the various properties that are typically associated with functional programming I only want to focus on one: “Immutability” and referential transparency. Immutability means that data structures can be treated as values - once you have them, they will not change underneath you. If you want to express modification, you can construct a new data structure, maybe reusing (unchanged) parts of existing data. This enables referential transparency: If a function (or method) cannot change anything internally, its output only depends on its input. Given some input the function evaluation and the result it returns can be treated as the same. The function is said to be pure.</p>
<p>Immutability is often regarded as a very positive property:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pure code is deterministic and considered to be easier to reason about as the number of possible state combinations is limited.</li>
<li>If a function only depends on explicitly defined parameters, testing it is often easier.</li>
<li>Immutable data can be passed to concurrent code without worrying about synchron^izing access.</li>
<li>And it is free of cycles (unless you allow <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Tying_the_Knot">lazily evaluation</a>), making it easier to serialize and deserialize.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now Rust clearly allows for data to be mutable. Rust also does not provide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure">persistent data structures</a> in its standard library (although there are <a href="https://crates.io/crates/im">third-party</a> <a href="https://crates.io/crates/rpds">options</a>) which are typically used to model immutable data efficiently. Yet, Rust’s rules around ownership require full control over what can be changed and when. To the extent that I have been working with Rust, a lot of it feels quite similar to programming Clojure from the point of view of designing programs.</p>
<h2 id="ownership-sharing-exclusivity">Ownership, sharing, exclusivity</h2>
<p>Each piece of data in (safe) Rust has exactly one owner. In the following example the variable <code>val</code> owns the String:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> val <span>=</span> <span>"Hello World"</span>.to_string();
</code></pre></div><p>Using <code>val</code> we can create references to the string:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> val_ref <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span>val;
<span>// both val and val_ref can be used to read the string value:
</span><span></span>println<span>!</span>(<span>"{}"</span>, val);
println<span>!</span>(<span>"{}"</span>, val_ref);
</code></pre></div><p>However we cannot modify either <code>val</code> or <code>val_ref</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// cannot borrow `val` as mutable, as it is not declared as mutable
</span><span></span>val.push_str(<span>" World"</span>);

<span>// error: "cannot borrow `*val_ref` as mutable, as it is behind a `&amp;` reference"
</span><span></span>val_ref.push_str(<span>" World"</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>So in order to change <code>val</code> we need to declare it <code>mut</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> val <span>=</span> <span>"Hello"</span>.to_string();
val.push_str(<span>" World"</span>); <span>// OK
</span></code></pre></div><p>But now we cannot take a reference at the same time anymore:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> val <span>=</span> <span>"Hello"</span>.to_string();
<span>// error: cannot borrow `val` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
</span><span></span><span>let</span> val_ref <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span>val;
val.push_str(<span>" World"</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>And similarly we can write to the reference if we declare it <code>mut</code> but then we cannot get another reference at the same time:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> val <span>=</span> <span>"Hello"</span>.to_string();
<span>let</span> val_ref <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span>val;
<span>// error: cannot borrow `val` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
</span><span></span><span>let</span> val_ref2 <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> val;
</code></pre></div><p>This example demonstrates Rust’s ownership rules: We can get multiple shared (read-only) references to one piece of data but as soon as we indicate to modify the data by declaring either the owning variable or a reference as <code>mut</code> we cannot hold shared references at the same time. <code>mut</code> means first and foremost <em>exclusive</em> access to the underlying data (and only secondarily <em>mutable</em>).</p>
<p>Similarly, functions that want to modify parameters (or <em>self</em> in case of methods) need to indicate that they need exclusive access. This means that the caller can only use this function it has exclusive access to the parameters to be passed as <code>mut</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>add_world</span>(val_ref: <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> String) {
    val_ref.push_str(<span>" World"</span>);
}
<span>// ...
</span><span></span>add_world(<span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> val);
</code></pre></div><p>All this is to say: Mutability in Rust needs to be explicitly declared and the rules around exclusive access are statically enforced. A thing can only change if no one is looking — reducing the number of accidental state combinations and highlighting the parts of the code base that can introduce change clearly. A Rust function that only accepts shared references and owned values (that do not provide interior mutability) and that does not use unsafe code<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, is referentially transparent.</p>
<h2 id="interior-mutability">Interior mutability</h2>
<p>There are a number of use cases where not being able to modify shared references can become very limiting. For example consider this <a href="https://gtk-rs.org/">GTK+3</a> app:</p>


  <figure>
    <img src="https://robert.kra.hn/posts/2021-02-03_is-rust-fp/interior_mutability.gif"> 
  </figure>


<p>The implementation for this looks something like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> container <span>=</span> gtk::Box::new(gtk::Orientation::Vertical, <span>2</span>);
<span>// A label that will be modified
</span><span></span><span>let</span> label <span>=</span> gtk::Label::new(Some(<span>"Button not yet clicked"</span>));
<span>let</span> button <span>=</span> gtk::Button::with_label(<span>"Click me"</span>);
<span>// We clone label so we can send it into the closure.
</span><span></span><span>let</span> label_clone <span>=</span> label.clone();
button.connect_clicked(<span>move</span> <span>|</span>_<span>|</span> {
    label_clone.set_label(<span>"Button has been clicked!"</span>);
});
container.add(<span>&amp;</span>button);
container.add(<span>&amp;</span>label);
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see the <code>label</code> is added to the container so that it gets displayed <em>and</em> is bound inside the closure where it gets modified.</p>
<p>Rust uses two mechanisms in combination for that to work: The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch15-05-interior-mutability.html#having-multiple-owners-of-mutable-data-by-combining-rct-and-refcellt"><code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> pattern</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. First, a reference counted pointer <code>std::rc::Rc</code> that is quite similar to C++’s <code>shared_ptr</code>. <code>Rc</code> takes ownership of another object. <code>Rc</code> implements <code>Clone</code> that will increase the ref count and hand out a new pointer. Those can be passed freely around. Inside of the ref-counted pointer a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html">RefCell</a> can be placed. It will allow to request exclusive access to the data owned. I.e. it will — at runtime! — produce a <code>mut</code> reference to the object wrapped and check that it is indeed not borrowed somewhere else. Should this not be the case, the borrow will fail (and possibly panic if <code>borrow_mut()</code> was used).</p>
<p>For more details about the internals of smart pointers and interior mutability I can highly highly recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O0Nt9qY_vo">this screen cast by Jon Gjengset</a> that walks you through possible implementations of (among others) <code>Rc</code> and <code>RefCell</code>.</p>
<p>So Rust provides ways<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> around the statically enforced access rules that normally restrict modification of data. This provides enough abstractions to even implement an interface to an object-oriented system such as Glib / GTK+. Following that, you might argue that Rust is supporting multiple paradigms, and I will agree. Yet, similar to Clojure that provides “interior mutability”-equivalents like <a href="https://clojure.org/reference/atoms">atoms</a> I will point out that overly relying on those features is not considered idiomatic. In Clojure the best practice is to use atoms sparingly. Mostly at the outside of the app, extracting state that is passed into the inner layers of the app that will then transform the state immutably into a new derived version. Atoms then clearly highlight where state changes can be expected. In practice, this then provides a good compromise. In case of stateful bugs, you only have to have a limited amount of possible sources to check and possible combinations of state transitions are still limited to simplify reasoning.</p>
<p>The <code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> pattern is also not all that ergonomic. Yes, you can define type aliases like Glib does, Rust still makes it easier to not have nested, cyclic relationships between objects. To say it with book Programming Rust again (from the section “Taking Arms Against a Sea of Objects”):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When everything depends on everything else like this, it’s hard to test, evolve, or even think about any component in isolation.
One fascinating thing about Rust is that the ownership model puts a speed bump on the highway to hell. […] It works unreasonably well: not only can Rust force you to understand why your program is thread-safe, it can even require some amount of high-level architectural design.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this is exactly the point I would like to convey with this article and the reason why I’m personally so fascinated with Rust: The set of features it does (not) provide are forcefully guiding the design of systems you build. This is quite contrary to how a lot of programming languages that attempt to provide a high degree of flexibility work (looking at you, Scala).</p>
<p>And then this is my claim: The ownership model, standard library, emphasize on iterators, and numerous other things do lead to code that is usually …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.opsian.com/blog/what-is-profiling/">last post</a> in our <a href="https://www.opsian.com/blog/tags/profiling-in-production/">Profiling in Production series</a> we covered instrumentation and sampling profilers. We talked about “resources of interest” but which ones are the most useful for diagnosing performance bottlenecks? The most commonly used resource is time. We’ve been deliberately vague about the concept of timing so far because when it comes to computers there’s actually two types of timing.</p>
<p>The first is <em>CPU Time</em>. This is the time that your code actually spends executing code on the CPU. The other type of time that we’re interested in measuring is <em>Wallclock time</em>. Wallclock time is the total time between starting an operation and it completing.</p>
<p><img alt="A coffee shop at lunch time" src="https://www.opsian.com/images/profiling_in_production_series/coffee_shop.png" title="A coffee shop at lunch time"></p>
<p>The way that we like to think of the difference between the two types of profiling is that it's a bit like buying a coffee. If you go to any good coffee shop, or a Starbucks at lunchtime, then you'll find they tend to be pretty busy with a queue forming at the bar. In order to drink the delightful caffeinated beverage you desire you need to both get through the queue to be served and also have the barista make your coffee. CPU Time is the time that the barista spends making coffee - it's the actual time spent performing work. The Wallclock time is the total time it takes for you to get a coffee including waiting to be served.</p>
<p>Now you maybe wondering why CPU Time and Wallclock time aren’t the same number: after all your Java process doesn't have to wait in line at Starbucks. Code may not be running on a CPU for a variety of reasons. For example, it might be blocked on a lock, not scheduled on CPU due to too many threads running or have gone to sleep.</p>
<h4>So when should you use the different types of time?</h4>
<p><em>CPU Time</em> is more useful for problems where there are few threads showing high CPU usage, as many event-loop style applications do. You may see plenty of time being spent in other threads that are waiting around performing background work but aren't actually limiting the throughput of your application. So CPU Time is useful when you know you’re bottlenecked on processing capacity. This is often the case in applications where significant processing needs to happen for each request or event. Machine learning systems are a common example.</p>
<p><em>Wallclock Time</em> is useful for problems where CPU utilisation seems low but application throughput or latency doesn't meet expectations. This is because threads are probably blocked on something, for example multiple threads contenting on a lock, times when you're waiting for downstream network IO to happen or running with too many threads so some of them don't get scheduled. The trigger for looking at Wallclock time would be low CPU usage during your period of performance issues. This tends to happen in modern microservices deployments when services spend time blocked on other services - which limits overall throughput.</p>
<p>In summary, so far in this series we’ve learnt about the relative merits of instrumentation and sampling profilers and the most common timing types and where they should be used. In the next post we’re going to cover how sampling Java profilers specifically work and how to pick one that’s suitable for production.</p>

Instead of bundling our entire application and recompiling on every code change and save, snowpack only rebuilds single files where the changes have been made.

The library is a renderer for Three, using it we can skip a lot of mundane work such as scene creation and concentrate on composing our components in a declarative way with props and states.</p><p>The renderer allows us to use all of the Three classes, objects and properties as elements in our markup. All classes constructors arguments can be accessed via an <code>args</code> prop. A simple mesh with a box class can be seen below. Don't worry if you don't understand what this means, we will go over everything shortly.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>&lt;</span><span>mesh</span><span> </span><span>visible</span><span> </span><span>position</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>rotation</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>boxGeometry</span><span> </span><span>attach</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>geometry</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>args</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>/&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>meshStandardMaterial</span><span> </span><span>attach</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>material</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>color</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>red</span><span>"</span><span>/&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>mesh</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>MDX</p><p>Our page will be rendered in <span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://mdxjs.com/">MDX</a></span>, a format which allows us to write JSX and include React components in markdown files. It's a wonderful development experience and one I hope you will fall in love with once we reach the end of the tutorial.</p><p>Install the fun</p><p>I have created a handy snowpack template that creates a project with snowpack, chakra and MDX all installed. It also comes with React Router v6 but we wont be using that so will remove that boilerplate.</p><p>Open a new terminal and navigate to your desired project folder and run the following which will create our new project. Change <code>my-new-app</code> to your apps name.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>npx create-snowpack-app my-new-app --template snowpack-mdx-chakra</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>Next we can install our projects dependencies.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>npm</span><span> i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion react-three-fiber three @react-three/drei react-particles-js</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>Now that we have our dependencies installed we can begin to tear out some of the stuff we wont need. Our landing page will encompass a single page so we can open the <code>mdx-routes.js</code> file and remove the <code>Nav</code> component and the page-two route from the <code>MDXRoutes</code> component. We'll return to this file later to add some styling but for now we can move on.</p><p>Inside the pages folder delete page-two and remove the contents from page-one. Inside the components folder delete the emoji component and add a new folder called 3d. And that's it, we are now ready to begin coding some sick 3D landing page goodness!</p><p>The layout</p><p>Open the <code>mdx-layout.js</code> file located in the components folder. This will wrap our whole app, in our case our one landing page. Our page will consist of a css grid, we'll use grid areas to get a nice visual representation of how our page will layout. Remove what is currently in there and add the following.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>import</span><span> React </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'react'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> Flex</span><span>,</span><span> Grid </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'@chakra-ui/react'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>const</span><span> desktop </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span></span></p><p><span>'edge   .       .         .'</span></p><p><span>'edge   text    product   .'</span></p><p><span></span><span>`</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>MDXLayout</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span> children </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Grid</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>templateColumns</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>10% 1fr 1fr 10%</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>templateRows</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>10% 1fr 1fr</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>templateAreas</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>desktop</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>bg</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>brand.background</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>h</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>100vh</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>{</span><span>children</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Grid</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> MDXLayout</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>Using Chakras Grid component we set the amount of columns to have a responsive padding of 10% of the viewport width on each side of two flexible one fractional units of space. This basically means that the meat of our page will live in the two fractional columns, with each taking up as much space as they need before they hit the 10% padding on each side. Our rows follow the same logic except we save 10% for our header row and the rest takes up as much space as needed. As you can see, we have a background color set on the bg (background) prop. But where does that value come from and what does it mean?</p><p>Open the <code>theme.js</code> file located in the <code>src</code> folder. This is our global theme for our app. We are importing the default theme from Chakra, which itself uses the Tailwind default preset. We are then overriding the colors with our own brand colors. The font sizes are also being overridden to allow us to use slightly different sizes to the default. Go ahead and copy the following colors object into the file instead of the current one.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>colors: </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>..</span><span>.theme.colors,</span></p><p><span>    brand: </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      red: </span><span>'#ed1c24'</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>      lightGrey: </span><span>'#D6D6D6'</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>      background: </span><span>'#090d12'</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>      text: </span><span>'#FFFfff'</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span>,</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>Components in MDX</p><p>MDX is just markdown that you can write JSX in. So that means that we can write normal markdown like so:</p><pre></pre><p>But we can also add to that React components We can even compose React components right in the MDX file! Let's open up the <code>index.js</code> file in the <code>src</code> folder and check out how we can add components to our MDX file without using imports.</p><p>Let's break down what's going on in here. If we scroll to the bottom we can see an <code>MDXProvider</code> wrapping our app. It accepts a components prop into which we have passed a components object declared above. The components object allows us to map React components to markdown elements as well as passing in custom components for use in our MDX files. As you can see, this template has set this all up for us by mapping some basic markdown elements to some Chakra components. Where there is no object key we have passed in a custom component which can be used in the MDX file without importing it as you would in a normal js or jsx file.</p><p>MDX accepts a special key called <code>wrapper</code> which will wrap the entire file with whatever is passed to it. In our case it will take our previously created layout component along with it's grid and use that to wrap our MDX file. Now that we know where the components are coming from when using them in our MDX file, let's go ahead and write some React in markdown!</p><p>The header</p><p>Opening up the <code>page-one.mdx</code> file located in the pages folder, add the following.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>&lt;</span><span>Flex</span><span> </span><span>gridArea</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>edge</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>gridRow</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>1</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>justify</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>center</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>align</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>center</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>ml</span><span>=</span><span>{6}</span><span> </span><span>as</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>header</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Image</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>w</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>100px</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>src</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>https://www.transparentpng.com/thumb/nike-logo/Blc12i-red-nike-logo-clipart-png-photos.png</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>alt</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>Red Nike Swoosh Logo</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>/&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Flex</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>We are using the Flex component provided to us from Chakra via the <code>MDXProvider</code>. This component allows us to quickly apply flex box props to the base element, a div. Even though the component is based upon a div we can give it semantic meaning by utilizing the <code>as</code> props and setting it the header. If we check our layout file again and look at our grid areas we can see that we have <code>edge</code> on the first and second rows. So we have set the grid area to edge and the row to 1.</p><p>This places our component in the top left hand corner of the page. We have given it a margin-left (ml) so that it doesn't hit the edge. As you can see from the code block above, we are inserting an image. If you navigate to <span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.transparentpng.com/search.php?q=nike">this</a></span> url you will see that it's a Nike swish (swoosh, tick? I dunno)</p><p>The copy</p><p>Let's add some copy to our page. This will be in the first column of our two middle columns. It will hold the title to our page and some copy about the Nike Air Jordan 1's, the product we are showcasing. Directly below the first Flex code block in the <code>page-one.mdx</code> file add the following:</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>&lt;</span><span>Flex</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>gridArea</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>text</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>justify</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>center</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>direction</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>column</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>h</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>100%</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>maxH</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>500px</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>w</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>90%</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>p</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>6</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Flex</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span> </span><span>color</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>brand.lightGrey</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>fontSize</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>6xl</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>            Air Jordan </span><span>1</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Flex</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Box</span><span> </span><span>h</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>80%</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>position</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>relative</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>zIndex</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>101</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span> </span><span>my</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>6</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>fontWeight</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>300</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>color</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>brand.text</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>fontSize</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>xl</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>borderTop</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>solid 1px</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>pt</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>6</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        The Air Jordan that was first produced </span><span>for</span><span> Michael Jordan </span><span>in</span><span> </span><span>1984</span><span> was designed by Peter </span><span>C</span><span>.</span><span> Moore</span><span>.</span><span> The red and black colorway </span><span>of</span><span> the Nike Air Ship</span><span>,</span><span> the prototype </span><span>for</span><span> the Jordan </span><span>I</span><span>,</span><span> was later outlawed by then</span><span>-</span><span>NBA</span><span> Commissioner David Stern </span><span>for</span><span> having very little white on </span><span>them</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span> rule</span><span>,</span><span> known </span><span>as</span><span> the </span><span>"51 percent"</span><span> rule</span><span>,</span><span> was repealed </span><span>in</span><span> the late </span><span>2000</span><span>s</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span> </span><span>my</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>6</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>fontWeight</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>300</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>color</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>brand.text</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>fontSize</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>xl</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>borderBottom</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>solid 1px</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>pb</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>6</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        After the Nike Air Ship was banned</span><span>,</span><span> Michael Jordan and Nike introduced the Jordan </span><span>I</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span> colorways </span><span>with</span><span> more white</span><span>,</span><span> such </span><span>as</span><span> the </span><span>"Chicago"</span><span> and </span><span>"Black Toe"</span><span> colorways</span><span>.</span><span> They used the Nike Air Ship</span><span>'s ban as a promotional tool in advertisements, hinting that the shoes gave an unfair competitive advantage.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>SREs are responsible for evaluating tools that can help reduce toil on their teams and make their applications more reliable for end-users. There are a lot of SRE tools out there, and it can be hard to know which ones are the most important to consider. We’ve compiled this guide to highlight the key categories of SRE tools and help you find the right fit for your team.</p><h2>Monitoring tools</h2><p>Monitoring tools are used to generate valuable metrics and insights about an application and help SREs do everything from creating benchmarks to debugging outages. Luckily, there are monitoring tools for practically anything you might want to measure relating to your application. These tools usually cover one or more of the following areas:&nbsp;<br></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Application performance monitoring (APM)</strong>: Models the response times perceived by end users of your application and compares this against performance benchmarks to detect latency and outages.</li><li><strong>Network monitoring</strong>: Examines all the incoming and outgoing traffic routed through your network to help with load balancing, debug client/server issues, and stop network attacks like DOS attacks before they occur.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Resource / infrastructure monitoring: </strong>Looks at the consumption rates and SLOs for the components of your application, like the CPU load for your Kubernetes clusters, to help with resource management.</li></ul><h3>What to look for in a monitoring tool</h3><p>No matter what type of monitoring tool you’re looking at, you’ll want to investigate the following important features:<br></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Alerts: </strong>The tool should be able to generate alerts when metrics approach and exceed the thresholds that your SRE team identifies.</li><li><strong>Automated incident response: </strong>Ideally, your tools will also try to automatically fix any detected issues where possible, helping reduce your engineering overhead.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Logging: </strong>Your monitoring tool should create detailed logs that contain all the information you would need to debug an issue, with configurable highlighting for easier consumption.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Visualizations and dashboards: </strong>Monitoring tools offer various kinds of graphics and charts to help you interpret the data at a glance or communicate with your stakeholders. Depending on your use cases, you might want to look for tools that support certain types of data round-ups and visual representations.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Supported integrations: </strong>Your tool should work seamlessly with your application components and services.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Common monitoring tools</h3><p>Here are some of the monitoring tools that we hear about often from SREs:&nbsp;</p><h4>Open-source tools</h4><p><a href="https://prometheus.io/" target="_blank">Prometheus</a>: A popular monitoring tool with an active community and broad range of features.</p><p><a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank">Grafana</a>: Helps you make dashboards and visualizations by integrating with other monitoring tools (often combined with Prometheus).&nbsp;</p><h4>Tools you can purchase</h4><p><a href="https://www.appdynamics.com/" target="_blank">AppDynamics</a>: A platform focusing on APM (though it also offers network and resource monitoring).</p><p><a href="https://www.appdynamics.com/" target="_blank">DataDog</a>: Offers a suite of monitoring tools to cover many different use cases.</p><p><a href="https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/splunk-enterprise.html?utm_campaign=google_amer_en_search_brand&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_content=Splunk_Enterprise_Demo&amp;utm_term=splunk&amp;_bk=splunk&amp;_bt=386199173970&amp;_bm=e&amp;_bn=g&amp;_bg=43997962767&amp;device=c&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAq8f-BRBtEiwAGr3DgVfR2eqnx8gp6gDbtDTiPEVAcjJaAjRnT_mHhy8nUGRst6ycdQC_RBoCwmkQAvD_BwE">Splunk</a>: A generalized tool for managing large-scale data and deriving actionable insights.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>On-call management tools</h2><p>SREs and engineers are often responsible for being on call during working and non-working hours, prepared to react immediately to resolve any issue that might threaten the system’s health. Being on call can be stressful, and you want to be careful not to burn out your team. Fortunately, there are many tools SREs can use to help reduce the burden and make being on-call a bit less painful.&nbsp;</p><h3>What to look for in an on-call management tool</h3><p>While most on-call tools also help your team manage the incident itself, we’ll be covering incident management in the next section. Here are some on-call rotation specific features to help you prioritize your assessment:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Scheduling on-call rotations</strong>: Your tool should help you distribute the on-call duty equally and fairly across your team, with flexibility in case someone needs to trade on-call rotations at the last minute.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Sharing on-call calendars</strong>: Sometimes an issue touches multiple components, and several on-call engineers need to be involved in the incident response. For that reason, it’s important that your tool provides a centralized way to view the on-call calendars across your organization.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Alerting on-call engineers: </strong>This one is pretty obvious, but it’s absolutely essential. Your on-call tool needs to integrate with your monitoring tools to deliver alerts, and it must provide a payload with enough context so that the on-call engineer can address the issue. Your tool should also give you rules-based configurations for alert routing and controls to combat spammy alerts, which lead to burnout.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Common tools for on-call management</h3><p>Popular on-call management tools include <a href="https://www.splunk.com/en_us/software/splunk-on-call.html" target="_blank">PagerDuty</a>, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/opsgenie" target="_blank">Splunk OnCall</a> (formerly VictorOps), and Atlassian’s <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/opsgenie" target="_blank">Opsgenie</a>.</p><h2>Incident management tools</h2><p>Inevitably, failures will occur in your system, and the person on-call is going to need powerful tools to help fix issues in the moment and make sure that they don’t happen again. According to <a href="https://sre.google/sre-book/being-on-call/" target="_blank">Google’s SRE Book</a>, managing an incident successfully comes down to three things: (1) clear escalation paths, (2) well-defined response procedures, and (3) a blameless post-mortem culture. SREs can find tools to codify these practices and help your team communicate better and resolve incidents faster.&nbsp;</p><h3>What to look for in an incident management tool</h3><ul role="list"><li><strong>Issue triage: </strong>Your tool should help you configure issue types and severity levels so that you know how to prioritize and when to escalate.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Escalation pathways: </strong>Whether issues are manually or automatically escalated, you should be able to quickly get the right people involved and easily share all of the context they need to understand the issue.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Runbooks / workflows: </strong>Depending on the issue classification, your tool should hand over the runbook of predefined steps the on-call engineers need to follow. Your tool should also be able to automatically execute workflows if certain conditions are met.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Real-time communication: </strong>Your tool should integrate with the apps your team uses to communicate, like Slack, Jira, or even Zoom, to share information automatically and free you up to focus on the issue at hand. It should also create a historical document of the incident response that your team can refer to later on.</li><li><strong>Data-driven issue analysis: </strong>Ideally, your tool will give you all the data you need to understand what happened and focus on how it can be avoided next time, instead of placing blame on individuals.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Common incident management tools</h3><p>All of the on-call management tools previously mentioned also feature some form of incident management. Additional dedicated tools for this purpose include <a href="http://servicenow.com/" target="_blank">Blameless</a>, <a href="http://servicenow.com/" target="_blank">ServiceNow</a>, and Netflix’s open source crisis management tool, <a href="http://blameless.com/" target="_blank">Dispatch</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><h2>Configuration/Automation tools</h2><p>A main function of the SRE role is to automate away the mindless and busywork tasks of software development. Automated configurations can be used to ensure that toil is reduced and the same steps are always repeated when provisioning, managing, and destroying resources.&nbsp;</p><h3>What to look for in an configuration tool</h3><ul role="list"><li><strong>Infrastructure as code: </strong>This paradigm means that your infrastructure specifications live in a file, which can be run to recreate your configuration in the event of an outage. Most automation tools will have their own language for declaring the desired configuration.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Execution planning: </strong>Your tool should offer a preview of the effects of your changes before you run the automation, to make sure there are no unanticipated consequences.</li><li><strong>Automated workflows:</strong> The tool should allow you to enforce steps that are always followed when performing a task, like deploying an application, and let you run these workflows automatically.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Supports container orchestration: </strong>If you use a container orchestration service like <a href="https://www.ansible.com/" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a> to deploy your services, your configuration tool should be compatible.</li></ul><h3>Common configuration tools</h3><p>Popular tools for automating your infrastructure configurations are <a href="http://terraform.io/" target="_blank">Terraform</a> and <a href="http://terraform.io/" target="_blank">Ansible</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Microservice catalog tools</h2><p>To make sure that incidents are avoided in the first place, SRE teams should look for tools that help them enforce high-level policies and best practices. A key tenet of microservice catalog tools should be governance over your service oriented architecture. Governance refers to <em>what </em>rules and processes the team follows, as well as <em>who </em>is responsible for reliability across different services and applications. This helps avoid tribal knowledge, and is especially important when teams work remotely and manage many different microservices.&nbsp;</p><h3>What to look for in a microservice catalog tool</h3><ul role="list"><li><strong>Supports a production readiness review (PRR): </strong>A key process for SREs is a PRR: stepping through a predefined checklist to make sure that the software is ready to deploy. This might include things like ensuring that you’ve set up load balancing and end-to-end testing.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>Transparent ownership: </strong>This tool should create a catalog of services with their owners clearly identified, so it’s easy to look up who is responsible for what.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Integrates with your </strong><a href="https://www.getcortexapp.com/list/integrations" target="_blank"><strong>existing tools</strong></a><strong>: </strong>All the best practices you’re trying to enforce should be visible within one tool. This means, for example, that your APM set-up and on-call rotations should appear alongside the catalog of your services, so you don’t have to refer to multiple tools to know where to find important data.</li><li><strong>Automatic updates: </strong>When your configurations or policies change, you shouldn’t need to make manual edits in the tool.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Common microservice catalog tools</h3><p>The most common governance tool we’ve seen is unfortunately a giant spreadsheet (or, worse, several spreadsheets!). Since this is the opposite of the SRE philosophy, we’ve created Cortex to fill the gap. Our <a href="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad1413d6c1261e587937/5f727be73405af82f83b0972_Screen%20Shot%202020-09-28%20at%205.01.49%20PM-p-1080.png" target="_blank"><strong>microservice catalog</strong></a><strong> </strong>makes it easy to see your services and owners in one place, and we foster accountability and show you how to improve using a gamified <a href="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad1413d6c1261e587937/5ecc28b2e9133b2ab44992a2_Screen%20Shot%202020-05-25%20at%201.20.53%20PM-p-1080.png" target="_blank"><strong>scorecard</strong></a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>With the right tools, your SRE team will be able to spend their energies improving your product’s reliability and performance instead of dealing with toil and overhead.

<p>I thank Daniele F. for donating this terminal. He contacted me from&nbsp;the <a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/donate/">donation page</a>&nbsp;at the end of May but I couldn’t&nbsp;retrieve it until&nbsp;the beginning of October, when I passed through&nbsp;Verona while I was going to Brusaporto (a few kilometres from Bergamo) where I attended an annual <a href="http://www.brusaretro.it/">retrocomputing meeting</a>.</p>

<p>The terminal, after a thorough cleaning and an accurate inspection, turned on without any problems. It was just dusty and dirty.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-dirty-7240.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-dirty-7240.jpg" alt="Digital VT100 - dirty" width="1080" height="720" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-dirty-7240.jpg 1080w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-dirty-7240-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-dirty-7240-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-dirty-7240-624x416.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"></a></p>
<p>The first item I started to clean was the keyboard. The next picture shows it before and after the cleaning process.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-keys_before-after-7241.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-keys_before-after-7241.jpg" alt="Digital VT100 - keys before / after" width="1080" height="889" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-keys_before-after-7241.jpg 1080w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-keys_before-after-7241-300x247.jpg 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-keys_before-after-7241-1024x843.jpg 1024w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-keys_before-after-7241-624x514.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"></a></p>
<p>I know that I’ve said it before… detaching and cleaning every single key is boring. But it is a manual and repetitive task&nbsp;that frees&nbsp;my mind, I find it quite&nbsp;relaxing, and the final result is always&nbsp;worth the time spent. Look at the next photo: beautiful, clean, shiny keys, with that mechanical feeling&nbsp;I sometimes miss on modern keyboards.</p>

<p>Here’s the keyboard board without the keys, after being cleaned:</p>

<p>The next picture shows the detail of the key.</p>

<p>There was no need for a “keycap puller”, the keys came off easily – so easily that I was lucky that no key was lost in all these years. This image is taken from the technical manual I found on the net.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key.png" alt="Digital VT100 - key exploded view" width="800" height="997" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key.png 800w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key-300x374.png 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key-241x300.png 241w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key-624x778.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a></p>
<p>After the keyboard I cleaned the main unit. The “Lunar” badge was probably&nbsp;added by the seller or the distributor, but I couldn’t find any information about it. Under the badge you can see the original colour of the case. If you look closely, you can see that the CRT monitor has a ghost image caused by showing the same static text many hours a day for years.&nbsp;Here’s the teardown picture.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown.jpg" alt="Digital VT100 - teardown" width="1248" height="5816" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown.jpg 1248w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown-300x1398.jpg 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown-220x1024.jpg 220w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown-624x2908.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1248px) 100vw, 1248px"></a></p>
<p>There’s a sticker under the keyboard, used to keep track of the terminal settings. In the setup screen that you can see in the first picture there are 4 series of 4 bits: each one sets an option, explained in the manual and summed up on the sticker.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370.png" alt="Digital VT100 - setup" width="1248" height="593" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370.png 1248w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370-300x143.png 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370-1024x487.png 1024w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370-624x297.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1248px) 100vw, 1248px"></a></p>
<p>The unit was designed with easy reparability in mind. The top and bottom case are kept together with just four clips; a few other clips keep the main unit attached to the bottom case.</p>
<p>The motherboard and the graphic board can be pulled out by unscrewing a panel on the back.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363.jpg" alt="Digital VT100 - back" width="1248" height="858" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363.jpg 1248w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363-300x206.jpg 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363-1024x704.jpg 1024w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363-624x429.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1248px) 100vw, 1248px"></a></p>
<p>The power supply unit can be pulled from the main by lifting –&nbsp;you’ve already guessed – some clips.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-power_supply_unit-insertion-7330.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-power_supply_unit-insertion-7330.jpg" alt="Digital VT100 - power supply unit - insertion" width="1080" height="817" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-power_supply_unit-insertion-7330.jpg 1080w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-power_supply_unit-insertion-7330-300x227.jpg 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-power_supply_unit-insertion-7330-1024x775.jpg 1024w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-power_supply_unit-insertion-7330-624x472.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"></a></p>

<p>The Selanar Graphics 100 is an additional third party board that lets the terminal show&nbsp;132 columns on screen and use advanced character formatting. It’s based on an Intel 8085 processor.</p>

<p>The most useful site I found about the VT100 is <a href="http://vt100.net/">VT100.net</a>; you can find the technical manual on the <a href="https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_decterminaT100TechnicalManualJul82_24218672">Internet Archive</a>. The only information about the Selanar Graphics 100 came from a Google Book scan of <a href="https://books.google.it/books?id=I_GaHXKwFpMC&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;pg=PA48#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Computerword magazine</a> from August 1980. It cost $1195, and on the same page there’s an ad for the VT100 at $1550. That makes a total of $2745, that according to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/">usinflationcalculator.com</a>&nbsp;corresponds to $7926 in 2015. For a terminal!</p>

<h2 id="announcing-krator">Announcing Krator</h2>

<p>Last September the Krustlet project refactored our API to employ a state
machine pattern for describing the lifecycle of Pods. The design of this API
was covered in depth in my
<a href="https://deislabs.io/posts/a-fistful-of-states/">previous blog post</a>.
Since then we have made a number of refinements to this interface and extended
our use of the pattern to individual containers within each Pod. These changes
also served to simplify and make more generic our API, and were done in part as
a stepping stone to the crate we are announcing today.</p>

<p>Since introducing this API, we have experienced positive feedback from the
community, including a number of requests to generalize this state machine
architecture so that it can be used to build Kubernetes Operators. It turned
out to be fairly straightforward to extract the “operator” portion of Krustlet
to a new crate, and today we are pleased to announce Krator (pronounced
crater), which stands for [K]ubernetes [R]ust st[at]e machine Operat[or].
Krator was released alongside the latest release of Krustlet, <code>0.6.0</code>, and
Krustlet now uses Krator internally to watch Pods and manage their state
machines.</p>

<p>Implementing an Operator involves a number of moving parts, so I have put
together a fairly minimal example, which I will walk through in the rest of
this post. If you just want to browse the code, it currently lives in the
Krustlet GitHub repository
<a href="https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet/tree/master/crates/krator">here</a>, and
documentation can be found on <a href="https://docs.rs/krator">docs.rs</a> (once Krustlet
<code>0.6.0</code> is released).</p>

<h2 id="writing-an-operator">Writing an Operator</h2>

<p>As an example, we will create an operator to manage <code>Moose</code> custom resources.
Using Krator, we will write a state machine that will describe the possible
states of a <code>Moose</code>, and how it should transition between these states. First,
we must write a custom resource definition, which is very easy using the
<code>CustomResource</code> derive macro from the <code>kube</code> crate!</p>

<pre><code>use kube_derive::CustomResource;
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(CustomResource, Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Default)]
#[kube(
    group = "animals.com",
    version = "v1",
    kind = "Moose",
    derive = "Default",
    status = "MooseStatus",
    namespaced
)]
struct MooseSpec {
    /// Shoulder height in meters.
    height: f64,
    /// Body weight in kilograms.
    weight: f64,
    antlers: bool,
}
</code></pre>

<p>Each <code>Moose</code> has a spec which includes height, weight, and whether it has
antlers. <code>CustomResource</code> lets us also specify that a resource should support
the Kubernetes <code>status</code> API, which is required for a Krator Operator. We
specified that our status type was <code>MooseStatus</code> which we will define as
follows:</p>

<pre><code>#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, Clone)]
enum MoosePhase {
    Asleep,
    Hungry,
    Roaming,
}

#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, Clone)]
struct MooseStatus {
    phase: Option&lt;MoosePhase&gt;,
    /// ~ Moose noises ~
    message: Option&lt;String&gt;,
}
</code></pre>

<p>As our state machine transitions to new states, Krator will automatically
update the object’s status with the Kubernetes API. To do this, Krator requires
that this status type implement a trait, <code>ObjectStatus</code>:</p>

<pre><code>impl ObjectStatus for MooseStatus {
    /// Use to generate an error status if an unhandled error occurs.
    fn failed(e: &amp;str) -&gt; MooseStatus {
        MooseStatus {
            message: Some(format!("Error tracking moose: {}.", e)),
            phase: None,
        }
    }

    /// Converts the arbitrary status type to a JSON patch to send to
    /// Kubernetes.
    fn json_patch(&amp;self) -&gt; serde_json::Value {
        // Generate a map containing only set fields.
        let mut status = serde_json::Map::new();

        if let Some(phase) = self.phase.clone() {
            status.insert("phase".to_string(), serde_json::json!(phase));
        };

        if let Some(message) = self.message.clone() {
            status.insert("message".to_string(), serde_json::Value::String(message));
        };

        // Create status patch with map.
        serde_json::json!({ "status": serde_json::Value::Object(status) })
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Next we need to define data types for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Data that is shared across state handlers for a single object (moose in this
case)</li>
<li>Data that is shared across state machines (shared between objects)</li>
</ul>

<p>We must also implement a trait, <code>ObjectState</code> which lets Krator know how all
of these types relate to the state machine.</p>

<pre><code>struct MooseState {
    /// All moose names start with 'M'
    name: String,
    /// Food mass in kilograms.
    food: f64,
}

struct SharedMooseState {
    /// Map moose name to set of moose friend's names (moose friendships are directed).
    friends: HashMap&lt;String, HashSet&lt;String&gt;&gt;,
}

#[async_trait::async_trait]
impl ObjectState for MooseState {
    type Manifest = Moose;
    type Status = MooseStatus;
    type SharedState = SharedMooseState;

    /// Clean up data related to a specific object.
    async fn async_drop(self, shared: &amp;mut Self::SharedState) {
        shared.friends.remove(&amp;self.name);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>We are now ready to implement our state machine. Below is a diagram of the
states we will represent. When a <code>Moose</code> object is first created, Krator will
initialize the state machine in the <code>Tagged</code> state. This will populate our
shared state and then transition to the <code>Roam</code> state. The moose will roam the
wilderness and with some probability encounter other moose and become friends.
Eventually, the moose will get hungry and transition to the <code>Eat</code> state, which
will replenish its <code>food</code> level but also make it tired. It will then transition
to the <code>Sleep</code> state for 60 seconds before returning to the <code>Roam</code> state. Note
that the final state, <code>Released</code>, is only reached when the <code>Moose</code> object is
marked for deletion in the Kubernetes API and Krator interrupts the state
machine and transitions to <code>Released</code>. In some operators, end states are also
reachable under certain conditions from within the state machine graph, such as
a Pod transitioning to <code>Completed</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://deislabs.io/images/moose-state-machine.svg" alt="Moose State Machine"></p>

<p>State implementations are currently a little verbose, so I will include a
single state implementation here. The rest can be found in
<a href="https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet/blob/master/crates/krator/examples/moose.rs">the complete example</a>.
The important information is within the <code>next</code> and <code>status</code> methods of each
trait implementation. The <code>status</code> method is called when each state is
<em>entered</em>, so it should describe the state it is associated with. We have
considered using macros for implementing <code>State</code>, but have not been satisfied
with Rust’s error messages for errors originating from within these macros. If
you have any experience with macros and think you can come up with something
nice, please let us know!</p>

<p>The <code>next</code> method is the main code block for each state, sometimes referred to
as the state handler. This method has a number of important arguments:</p>

<ul>
<li>It takes ownership of <code>self</code>.</li>
<li>An <code>Arc&lt;RwLock&lt;_&gt;&gt;</code> to access shared state. For more information on this API,
see the
<a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/1.0.2/tokio/sync/struct.RwLock.html">Tokio documentation</a>.</li>
<li>A mutable reference to the object state.</li>
<li>A <code>Manifest&lt;_&gt;</code> which acts as a
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#efficient-detection-of-changes">reflector</a>.
This type implements the <code>Stream</code> API for detecting changes to the object
manifest within a state handler, or you can simply call <code>latest</code> to obtain
a clone of the current object manifest.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>#[derive(Debug, Default)]
/// Moose is roaming the wilderness.
struct Roam;

async fn make_friend(
    name: &amp;str,
    shared: &amp;Arc&lt;RwLock&lt;SharedMooseState&gt;&gt;
) -&gt; Option&lt;String&gt; {
    let mut mooses = shared.write().await;
    for (other_moose, friends) in mooses.friends.iter_mut() {
        if name == other_moose {
            continue;
        }
        if !friends.contains(name) {
            friends.insert(name.to_string());
            return Some(other_moose.to_string());
        }
    }
    return None;
}

#[async_trait::async_trait]
impl State&lt;MooseState&gt; for Roam {
    async fn next(
        self: Box&lt;Self&gt;,
        shared: Arc&lt;RwLock&lt;SharedMooseState&gt;&gt;,
        state: &amp;mut MooseState,
        _manifest: Manifest&lt;Moose&gt;,
    ) -&gt; Transition&lt;MooseState&gt; {
        loop {
            tokio::time::delay_for(std::time::Duration::from_secs(5)).await;
            state.food -= 5.0;
            if state.food &lt;= 50.0 {
                return Transition::next(self, Eat);
            }
            let r: f64 = {
                let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
                rng.gen()
            };
            if r &lt; 0.05 {
                if let Some(other_moose) = make_friend(&amp;state.name, &amp;shared).await {
                    info!("{} made friends with {}!", state.name, other_moose);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    async fn status(
        &amp;self,
        _state: &amp;mut MooseState,
        _manifest: &amp;Moose,
    ) -&gt; anyhow::Result&lt;MooseStatus&gt; {
        Ok(MooseStatus {
            phase: Some(MoosePhase::Roaming),
            message: Some("Gahrooo!".to_string()),
        })
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>To finish our state machine, we must define valid transitions between states.
The compiler will ensure that we do not make invalid transitions, which helps
us to avoid undefined behavior.</p>

<pre><code>impl TransitionTo&lt;Roam&gt; for Tagged {}
impl TransitionTo&lt;Eat&gt; for Roam {}
impl TransitionTo&lt;Sleep&gt; for Eat {}
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, Krator provides a macro for deriving this trait:</p>

<pre><code>#[derive(Debug, Default, TransitionTo)]
#[transition_to(Roam)]
/// Moose is sleeping.
struct Sleep;
</code></pre>

<p>Finally we must implement the <code>Operator</code> trait to tie this all together. Note
that the state machine API itself does not require that the <code>Manifest</code> is a
valid Kubernetes API resource. This allows the state machine pattern to be used
with a broader set of types (we used it for containers, which are not a
Kubernetes resource type). This, however, will require you to reimplement the
function which drives the state machine, as we did for
<a href="https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet/blob/3b120ec6a00123afd1407d049b61282c67e71676/crates/kubelet/src/container/state.rs#L18">containers</a>.</p>

<p>To get the full benefit of Krator, which watches for changes to your API
resource, spawns state machines, and handles status updates, you will need to
satisfy additional trait bounds which are placed on associated types of the
<code>Operator</code> trait. Namely, <code>Manifest</code> must be
<a href="https://docs.rs/k8s-openapi/0.10.0/k8s_openapi/trait.Metadata.html"><code>Metadata&lt;Ty = ObjectMeta&gt;</code></a>,
<code>DeserializeOwned</code>, and <code>Default</code>. <code>Status</code> must be <code>ObjectStatus</code> (as
described above).</p>

<h2 id="forward-kinematics">Forward kinematics</h2>
<p>Calculating the current coordinates of a robot’s hand is easy.</p>
<p>We just need to look at each segment of a robot’s arm–the coordinates of the segment’s base, the direction of the joint’s axis, the angle between this segment and the next one, and the length of the segment–in order to calculate where the end of this segment is. Repeat this with each segment, until we arrive at the robot’s hand. Et voilà: we determined the hand’s position.</p>
<p>This is called forward kinematics.</p>
<h2 id="inverse-kinematics">Inverse kinematics</h2>
<p>Now the robot’s arm must adjust each joint’s angle in order to move its hand over the cup. This is quite the opposite of the previous calculation - here, we start with a given position and want to know how to rotate each segment of the arm.</p>
<p>It turns out that this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm_solution">much harder</a> than the forward case. And whenever something is hard to solve, there are usually several different approaches available for solving that problem. For inverse kinematics, there are three of them:</p>
<ol>
<li>The algebraic approach: This basically works by solving (frankly, rather complex) matrix equations.</li>
<li>The geometric approach: The idea is to combine knowledge about the robotic arm’s geometry with suitable trigonometric formulas.</li>
<li>The numeric approach: Take a guess and look how far we are off. Move one or more segments to locally minimize the error. Repeat.</li>
</ol>
<p>Which one to pick? After all, each of them has its raison d’être.</p>
<p>For the sake of brevity, let’s drop the first one. It involves a lot of matrix calculations, and frankly, I haven’t done any since the last millennium or so.</p>
<p>The second one, the geometric approach, can become quite complex when the robot’s arm consists of many segments and joints. Luckily, all complexity vanishes in the case of a simple robotic arm with only two segments, so let’s go with this approach. (In a future article, I’ll give the numeric approach a try.)</p>
<p>At this point, I must admit that when I started working on this article, I expected that the formulas for the simple two-segment arm could easily be generalized to multi-segment, multi-joint robotic arms, but I found that this is not the case. So for this article, we’ll stick with what is probably the most simple robotic arm with rotary joints.</p>
<h2 id="the-scara-robot">The SCARA robot</h2>
<p>Our robotic arm shall meet the following requirements.</p>
<ul>
<li>The arm has only two segments of fixed length.</li>
<li>The segments can only rotate around their base joint; there is no sliding movement.</li>
<li>The axes of both joints have the same direction.</li>
<li>There is no hand attached to the end of the arm. (Robot hands would have additional degrees of freedom, and remember that we want to keep things simple. Now you know why our robot just serves tea.)</li>
</ul>
<p>A robot of this kind is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCARA">SCARA robot</a>.</p>
<p>Here is a schematic diagram of our robot:</p>

<p>Let me just tweak the diagram a little by replacing some of the labels and adding one line and two angles:</p>
<p><img src="https://appliedgo.net/media/roboticarm/robotarm.png" alt="The SCARA robotic arm as a triangle"></p>
<p>This diagram tells us a couple of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The segments have the length <em>len1</em> and <em>len2</em>, respectively.</li>
<li>The root joint describes an angle <em>A1</em> measured from the x axis.</li>
<li>The second joint describes an angle <em>A2</em> measured from the first segment (counterclockwise in both cases).</li>
<li>The tip of segment 2 points to <em>(x,y)</em>, and we want to calculate back from that point to the yet unknown values of <em>A1</em> and <em>A2</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the diagram you also see a new dotted line named <code>dist</code>. It points from <em>(0,0)</em> to <em>(x,y)</em>, and as you can easily see, the three lines <code>dist</code>, <em>len1</em>, and <em>len2</em> define a triangle. Furthermore, <em>dist</em> divides angle <em>A1</em> into two angles <em>D1</em> and <em>D2</em>.</p>
<p>Now is a good moment to dig out an old trig formula you may remember from school: The law of cosines.</p>
<p><img src="https://appliedgo.net/media/roboticarm/lawofcosines.png" alt="The Law of Cosines"></p>
<p>The law of cosines (see the first formula in the figure above) is a generalization of the Pythagorean theorem (c<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> for right(-angled) triangles) to arbitrary triangles. We do not need the basic form, but rather the transformed version that you can see below the original formula. With this version, we can calculate angle <em>C</em> from the triangle’s sides <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, and <em>c</em>. This comes handy in two places, as we’ll see shortly.</p>
<p>So how do we calculate <em>A1</em> and <em>A2</em>?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>From the robotic arm diagram above (the one with <em>D1</em>, <em>D2</em>, <em>dist</em>, etc), we can directly derive the first formula:</p>
<pre><code>A1 = D1 + D2
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>D1</em> is fairly easy to calculate. In the following diagram, <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, and <em>dist</em> define a right-angled triangle. Here, <em>D1</em> can be calculated in two ways: The arcsine of <em>y/dist</em> or the arctangent of <em>y/x</em>. As we have x and y readily available, let’s choose the arctangent formula.</p>
<p>However, there is a problem hidden here. The formulas certainly are correct if x and y are positive, but what if either of the two, or even both, are negative? Luckily, a solution is available in form of a method from the standard library: <code>math.Atan2(y, x)</code>. It delivers the correct result for all possible combinations of x and y. (More details <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_trigonometric_functions#Application:_finding_the_angle_of_a_right_triangle">on Wikipedia</a>.)</p>
<p><img src="https://appliedgo.net/media/roboticarm/arctan.png" alt="D1 is calculated as arctangent of y/x"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>D2</em> requires the law of cosines.
Basically, we just map our “robot triangle” to the “law of cosines” triangle by using <em>dist</em> as <em>a</em>,
<em>len1</em> as <em>b</em>, and <em>len2</em> as <em>c</em>. The resulting angle <em>C</em> is our <em>D2</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://appliedgo.net/media/roboticarm/calcd2.png" alt="D2 and the law of cosines"></p>
<ul>
<li>Now only <em>A2</em> is left. Luckily, we can reuse the law of cosines for this. We only need to map our triangle to the one from the law of cosines with different parameter mappings than for <em>D2</em>: <em>len1</em> as <em>a</em>, <em>len2</em> as <em>b</em>, and <em>dist</em> as <em>c</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://appliedgo.net/media/roboticarm/calca2.png" alt="Calculating A2"></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And that’s it. Let’s pour this into code now.</p>
<h2 id="the-code">The code</h2>
</div><div>
<h2 id="homework-assignment">“Homework assignment”</h2>
<p>Why does <em>A1</em> evaluate to <code>NaN</code> (“Not a Number”) when we try moving the arm to (0,0)?</p>
<p>Hint 1: It is about the law of cosines function.</p>
<p>Hint 2: The arm does not form a triangle in this case. (Yes, this hint is actually a spoiler, sorry…)</p>
<h2 id="outlook">Outlook</h2>
<p>In a future article we’ll look into the numeric approach. That is, we let the robot iteratively move its arm in small steps until it reaches the target.</p>
<p>Next week’s article is a lightweight take on Dependency Injection.</p>
<p>Until then, have fun!</p>

<p>Updates</p>
<p>2017-01-13: Fixed: The code uses Atan2 to calculate D1, but the text used Pythagoras.

<p><span>Y</span>esterday, I got into a verbal altercation at Starbucks.</p>
<p><span>An older man, talking very loudly, said something along the lines of “My son is golden because he has a degree from Stanford University.”</span></p>
<p><span>This comment really infuriated me because this type of outdated thinking—that a college degree from an elite, pricey university means you’re set for life—must die immediately. It falsely </span><b>signals</b><span> to employers that you’re better than the average Jane just because you have a piece of paper. In reality,</span><a href="https://www.americaspromise.org/news/pbs-newshour-biggest-predictor-college-success-family-income"> <span>all it really signals is your family’s socioeconomic status</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>So I interjected and said, “Let me guess… You paid for your son’s education.”</span></p>
<p><span>“I did,” he said. “My son’s grandfather was Herbert Hoover, and my son’s degree is like gold.”</span></p>
<p><span>[Eye roll]</span></p>
<p><span>I preceded to tell him that it doesn’t matter if you have a college degree anymore to do today’s jobs and that he was basically bragging about his family’s socioeconomic status, not his son’s actual achievements. I tried to elaborate about the inequalities of higher education and why it’s an outdated metric of future success. I explained why employers are absolutely wrong for thinking his son is better than someone without a degree or a degree from a public university.</span></p>
<p><span>Then he told me to go fly a kite, because that’s usually what happens when people are wrong and have zero evidence that their stance is right and yours is wrong. (I’m always open to new ideas, SO LONG AS you present trustworthy facts, stats, and research.)</span></p>
<p><span>For the record, this man is an out-of-touch elitist, and I stand by everything I said to him.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/college-mobility/stanford-university"><b>Fun fact</b></a><b>: The median family income of a student from Stanford is $167,500, and 66% come from the top 20%.

<h2><span id="Degree_requirements_lead_to_less_diversity"></span><b>Degree requirements lead to less diversity</b><span></span></h2>
<p><span>Recruiters use software, known as Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), which I discuss in detail in a </span><a href="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online/"><span>previous article</span></a><span>. ATS collect, sort, and filter job applicants who apply through an online form.</span></p>
<p><span>They use this tool because the average job post receives 250 applications today, and they need a way to save time filtering down candidates.</span></p>
<p><span>Sometimes, online application forms will feature “knockout questions,” like “Where did you graduate from?” “What year did you graduate?” and “What did you major in?” These are meant to automatically weed out candidates who don’t meet certain criteria.</span></p>
<p><span>For instance, if I—a college dropout—were to apply to a job with these knockout questions, I’d automatically be filtered to the rejection pile, with not one human actually taking the time to even scan my resume. All because I don’t have a Bachelor’s degree, despite my 10 years of professional, proven experience.</span></p>
<p><span>Even if application forms don’t feature knockout questions, recruiters are likely inputting “keywords” into their ATS, searching for words like, “Bachelor’s,” “Harvard,” etc., just to quickly filter down the amount of resumes they have to review.</span></p>
<p><span>Let me be clear: Filtering candidates by degree is the epitome of wrong and legally,</span><a href="https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/is-discriminatory-require-applicants-college-degree.html"> <span>it’s actually discriminatory</span></a><span>, which could be a massive liability for companies requiring a Bachelor’s degree or higher to even be considered for employment.</span></p>
<p><span>This sounds like crazy fake news, but according to an article on the reputable legal encyclopedia,</span><a href="https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/is-discriminatory-require-applicants-college-degree.html"> <span>NOLO</span></a><span>, I’m right.</span></p>
<p><span>In the post, a reader asks if requiring a college degree for employment is illegal:</span></p>
<div>
<p><b>I work for a large nonprofit employer whose mission is to help inner-city children finish high school and go on to college.</b></p>
<p><span>We do fundraising, provide tutors and coaches, work with teachers and parents, and help school districts come up with strategies and resources to reduce dropout rates, among many other things. Our employees do everything from sending out mailings and answering phones to lobbying Congress to helping kids with their math homework and college applications.*</span></p>
<p><span>Recently, the Board decided to require all new employees to have a college degree. </span><b>The Board feels that it would be great for the kids and their families we work with to see the benefits of staying in school; the Board has also said that having employees who never finished high school or college runs counter to the message we’re trying to send about the importance of education.</b></p>
<p><span>I can see their point, but I’m concerned that this requirement might screen out large numbers of applicants of color. Is it legal for us to adopt this hiring requirement?*</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>*Side-note:</b><span> Why are so many entities STILL preaching college as the only way to get a job and succeed in life, when 50% of grads are underemployed or unemployed today? See chart below.</span></p>

<p><b>NOLO’s answer:</b></p>
<div>
<p><span>Whether or not a hiring requirement is discriminatory depends on its intent and its effect. Some employers adopt screening tests or criteria with the purpose of screening out certain applicants. For example, imposing a strength test would have the effect of screening out larger numbers of women. If an employer’s intent is to discriminate, and its hiring criteria are simply a smokescreen for this true purpose, then the employer is discriminating. </span><b>But even if an employer has no intent to discriminate, its hiring criteria may have that effect.</b><span> If a selection test or requirement has a disproportionate effect on applicants in a particular protected category, that might be illegal discrimination. </span><b>The key is whether the requirement is truly necessary to do the job.</b><span> For example, a strength test might screen out disproportionate numbers of female applicants, but might also be necessary for a job as a firefighter, construction worker, or logger.</span></p>
<p><b>An employer whose screening test or requirement has a disparate impact on a protected group must show that the requirement is job-related and consistent with business necessity.</b><span> This is intended to be a difficult hurdle, but not an impossible one. For example, an attorney needs to pass the bar exam to practice law, so requiring applicants for an associate position at a law firm to be admitted to the bar would meet this test. Similarly, </span><b>many skills tests</b><span> would pass legal muster, as long as the exam tested skills that truly were necessary to do the job.</span></p>
<p><b>Degree requirements are more slippery, in part because it isn’t clear exactly what particular skills, aptitudes, or abilities a degree confers</b><span> (unless a particular degree is required for licensing, like a law degree or medical degree generally is). </span><b>And, degree requirements often do have a disparate impact against African American and Latino applicants.</b></p>
<p><span>…</span></p>
<p><span>Your Board has expressed a nondiscriminatory reason for its new requirement. </span><b>But a court would look at whether it really is necessary to have a college degree to do every job at your company.</b> <b>The variety of jobs employees hold is going to be a major strike against the requirement: It seems pretty evident that someone can stuff envelopes, answer phones, manage databases, and do a wide variety of other work without a college degree.</b></p>
<p><span>And, </span><b>even if a court were to accept the employer’s “role model” argument for certain positions, an applicant could still win a discrimination lawsuit by showing that there are less discriminatory alternatives available.</b><span> For example, an employee might be an even more effective advocate for staying in school if he or she can share how difficult it has been to succeed without a degree. An employee who has dropped out might be better able to relate to the decisions facing at-risk kids and better able to help them make a different choice. </span><b>In short, if a degree requirement has the effect of screening out larger numbers of African American and Latino applicants, your employer will face a very difficult task in trying to justify the disparity.</b></p>
</div>
<p><span>That last sentence is key. Today, the hot topic in HR today is “diversity.” Diversity for women, for latinos, for African-Americans, etc. But these are actually vanity metrics at best (or total lies at worst) if the company requires a college degree for employment—whether or not they realize it.</span></p>
<p><b>Degree requirements actually lead to less diversity.</b></p>

Did that there may be a effective bond among animals and human beings?<br>

one of the more stunning and unifying factors of humanity is witnessing the super lengths a few animal lovers will go to for his or her animal partners.<br>

Non animal lovers won't get it in any respect... yet.<br>

So right here's the aspect: They enjoy a mutual, deep bond and connection that is tough to provide an explanation for or define, however it would not make it any much less real or tangible.<br>

one of the many advantages of having pets is when they show you who you certainly are. They do this by reflecting, mirroring and appearing out aspects of your inner self. And while you be aware of their messages they will let you become a better character.<br>
that is the phenomenon I name The Human Animal BodyMind Connection and it's an exquisite thing that after you understand it, it'll alternate your lifestyles.<br>
They haven't any capacity for spite or guile.<br>
while you concentrate to them, what are they announcing about how you are worrying for yourself... and them?<br>
they will innately reflect your feel of fitness and well-being. they may be attuned in your power - mind, frame and feelings - and might ship you messages about brewing troubles long before others can understand symptoms of trouble.<br>
And, they may be a tremendous comfort at some point of times of pressure, isolation or loneliness.</p><blockquote><b>Health benefits of having pets</b></blockquote>

we've got all heard clichés like, "puppies are guy's satisfactory pal."
but have you ever puzzled why? i will tell you my belief...<br>
dogs are loyal to a fault.<br>
Animals locate joy within the simplest, smallest matters.<br>
They don't have any want for excuses or pretense, they are handiest ever being themselves.
They doze off unencumbered with the aid of daily concerns and wake up each morning with a clean slate, geared up to take on the sector with sparkling eyes and spirits.<br>
Their buoyancy, resilience, devotion, willpower, and optimism are infectious.<br>
yet, many animals also have an innate feel when a person is in want of guide. They don't always take on the fear... they honestly attain out to consolation a person in ache.
now not each dog, cat, or horse can be a therapy animal who trains for care in a health center, as a provider animal or accomplice all through instances of crisis...<br>
but you ought to know that your pet is choosing up alerts from you always.
Your horse will experience the tension in you and attempt to make feel of it, then determine how to help you with that.<br>
Your canine will comply with you around the house when they examine bad strength trying to discern out what is wrong and the way to help you.<br>
you might assume they're being a pest - particularly while you're feeling agitated. stop and receive the present of their love for what it is, and have a conversation with them about what's bothering you. you'll feel better for it, and when you recognise how to talk with animals they may have the ability to inform you what they think too.</p><blockquote><b>Animals understand when things are going wrong, but they lack the power to fix them... or do they?</b></blockquote>

Pets might not will let you withdraw, isolate, or cocoon all on my own

it's very tough to socialize in trendy international... and that may magnify despair, tension, and a sense of isolation.<br>

Your pet needs your care and attention all through desirable times. They need to play games with you, pass for walks with you, study from you. And, at some point of horrific instances they nonetheless need all those things, but can sense that things are not right, when you're in pain.<br>

whilst your canine turns into obsessed on bringing you a toy, or appears to be nagging you to go for a stroll, pay attention to them.<br>

Your cat might be circling your house office chair, pouncing for your computer, intent on distracting you... however absolutely, they're in all likelihood telling you it's time to alternate your consciousness.<br>

often they will word that your respiration has end up shallow, your flow is weakening, and your strength is faltering... it worries them. Time to take a spoil!<br>

Time spent caring for a pet releases serotonin and dopamine, two hormones that cause a pleasure reaction.<br>

Pets are relatively intuitive creatures. And the more time they spend with you, the better they get to realize you and end up attuned for your lows and highs.</p><blockquote><b>The benefits of having pets go beyond heroic rescue dogs</b></blockquote>

<p>For an author whose natural range tends to settle somewhere north of 500 pages of beautifully crafted fiction – his sixth, highly anticipated novel, <em>Crossroads</em>, is due later this year and promises to be another discursive, immersive classic – you could easily write off <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/What-If-We-Stopped-Pretending/dp/0008434042/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=franzen&amp;qid=1612359830&amp;sr=8-1"><em>What If We Stopped Pretending</em></a> as a non-fiction amuse bouche to turn your nose up at while you impatiently wait for the main course to arrive. Especially so, when the material involved is reissued work.</p> 
<p>Fans of the author will tell you, however, that his non-fiction volumes – old, new or reissued – are just as compelling as his novels. And so it is with this release, too.</p>

</div> 
<p>Franzen being Franzen means that <em>What If We Stopped Pretending</em> is an exquisitely rendered discussion on one of the most difficult conversations of our age.</p> 
<p>The author has previously angered both sides of the climate debate and been accused of being either too forceful or too weak. What emerges here is an accidental polemic and one that's worth re-evaluating, especially because our world has changed so dramatically in the past 12 months.</p> 

<p>He believes that the world is too far down the track to avoid a climate change catastrophe. It is a case of when, not if, the whole system collapses in on itself. The goal has been clear for decades, the evidence to support it is indisputable but, he writes, we have made no progress towards reaching it.</p> 
<p>He paints a bleak portrait of collective failure to solve the puzzle, imagining any future reckoning as a sequence of “severe crises … things will get very bad, but maybe not too soon, and maybe not for everyone. Maybe not to me”.</p> 
<p>This is where the work begins to intersect with our lives today.</p> 
<p>It is a little over a year since the <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/opinion">Covid-19 crisis</a> began to rain down on us. The first cases were identified in the UAE at the end of January 2020. By the end of February, schools across the country were cancelling trips. By March 8, schools were closed. Within days, the World Health Organisation had declared a pandemic. Within a week, the UAE’s borders were closed. And so it went on, locally, nationally, regionally and internationally.</p> 
<p>The crisis, which we all may have initially imagined as a short, sharp shock, punctuated by short-term stay-at-home orders, movement permits and night-time street sterilisation campaigns, became a long and intricate fight – a sequence of severe crises, which were delivered unevenly and in complicated waves.</p>

<p>Most of us have endured some form of pain during the pandemic – of separation, loss, complication or even infection – but we have also been made more profoundly aware of how the actions of the individual and the community can truly make a difference. Governments may introduce and revise guidelines for containing the spread of the virus, but ultimately action is most effectively driven by each one of us acting responsibly and in the interests of the wider community in which we live.</p> 
<p>The distribution of vaccines in the UAE shows the power of what can be achieved by working together. By midweek, the National Emergency Crisis and Disasters Management Authority recorded that more than <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/gulf-news/coronavirus-vaccine-in-the-gulf-what-we-know-so-far-1.1158405">3.5 million vaccine doses</a> had been administered in the country.</p> 
<p>Health official Dr Farida Al Hosani said this week that “we are seeing good progress on a daily basis”. The reasons for that progress are many, including the liberal use of public awareness campaigns, the establishment of vaccine distribution centres in accessible places, the ease of registration to receive the vaccine and so on. But ultimately for the drive to be as successful as it has been to date, it also requires each individual to understand that they have a role to play by <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/opinion/comment/to-get-the-jab-done-governments-must-show-patience-and-empathy-1.1121842">taking the jab</a>.</p>

<p>Returning to Franzen, the climate change crisis requires collective action as well, but it also needs each individual to make the right choices about how they lead their lives and to understand how even small changes to their lifestyles can still make a difference. Each of us, he says, has an ethical choice to make. “If collective action resulted in just one fewer devastating hurricane … it would be a goal worth pursuing,” he adds.</p> 
<p>The pandemic has also made it clear that generational crises are not abstract concepts but visceral realities. It has spurred some multilateral movement to combat coronavirus and given us a greater sense of the vast amount of effort, resource and capital that is required to turn the tide. We cannot just rebuild, we must regenerate. We cannot return to normal or even the so-called new normal. The challenges are too urgent and too complex to snap back into an approximation of the old order.</p> 
<p>Earlier this week, John Kerry, who is the Biden administration’s climate change envoy, <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/uae/environment/us-climate-envoy-john-kerry-to-build-ties-with-uae-to-boost-green-agenda-1.1157382">held talks with Dr Sultan Al Jaber</a>, his UAE counterpart. Mr Kerry said the US was prepared to re-energise the battle to protect the environment and spoke about making up for “lost years with humility and ambition”. That is precisely the prescription that it required to bring about a better, less calamitous future.</p>

			<p><strong>[INTERVIEW]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[00:01:31] Guy Podjarny:</strong> Hello, everybody. Thanks for tuning back in to The Secure Developer. Today, we’re going to have a DevOps-flavored episode here. I’m really happy to have with us James Turnbull, who is a VP of Engineering at Timber and also kind of a long time DevOps thought leader. He has been the chair of Velocity, has sort of been very much a core part of the DevOps journey, making him especially qualified to discuss a little bit about how it’s similar or different to the DevSecOps journey. James, thanks for coming on to the show.</p>
<p><strong>[00:02:01] James Turnbull:</strong> Thank you for having me.</p>
<p><strong>[00:02:02] Guy Podjarny:</strong> James, before we dig into the topic of substance, tell us a little bit about what is it that you do and maybe your journey and how we touch security?</p>
<p><strong>[00:02:10] James Turnbull:</strong> Sure. I lead engineering product teams. At the moment, I’m working a product called Vector, which is an open source observability tool. I’ve been an engineer for about 25 years. I think it’s too many years to start citing that, and I started my career off largely in sort of enterprise, banking finance, as a security engineer and a security architect for a few years in a retail bank, I built perimeter systems and ATM networks and stuff like that. In the last 10 years or so, I’ve largely worked in high-growth startups. I was an early employee at Puppet, configuration management tool. I was an early employee at Docker obviously doing containerization. I was a CTO at Kickstarter and I have done similar sorts of roles over the last few years. As you said, I was the chair of the Velocity conference for a couple years and also I write technology books. I’ve written 11 books about engineering and infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>[00:03:00] Guy Podjarny:</strong> 11 books is impressive. I have a few under my belt but 11 books is definitely a notable number there.</p>
<p><strong>[00:03:06] James Turnbull:</strong> No kids I think is probably an advantage.</p>
<p><strong>[00:03:08] Guy Podjarny:</strong> It makes for some free time. So, I’m curious a little bit. Quite a few guests that came onto the show have gone into security from maybe the operations, and you actually were in security but then you moved outwards. Do you remember that transition, that decision point of whether you want to leave security and go to a role that doesn’t have security in the title?</p>
<p><strong>[00:03:29] James Turnbull:</strong> Yeah. I was managing a CERT team, a Computer Emergency Response Team, at a retail bank, and one of the things I’ve been thinking about last three or four years before that was sort of large scale infrastructure management. One of the very frustrating things about being a security person in a large organization is you don’t control the infrastructure. You are largely dependent on infrastructure teams to provide you with information about vulnerabilities, about the state of the infrastructure. You’re largely reliant on them to do remediation for you. They would obviously come to me and say, “We don’t have any tools that allow us to mass maintain, mass patch all of these systems. We don’t use large-scale package management. We don’t have any configuration management tools.”</p>
<p>I sort of started to look in that area, about the same time I found Puppet. I started working on the open source Puppet tool. When they raised some money, I thought I can see the viability of this tool. I work in the environments where this is a desperate need. So, I came on board at Puppet to try and bring some of that experience, and I think I was probably our first pre-sales person, as well as being head of community and professional services, and a bunch of other things along the way. I tried to inject that flavor of this is what a large enterprise looks like. This is their experience. This is the empathy I have for their problems. The very first customer, I was involved in the New York Stock Exchange, customers that sort of flavor where my experience resonated.</p>
<p><strong>[00:04:47] Guy Podjarny:</strong> That’s a great story, and it’s interesting around this, taking ownership basically or being frustrated about not being able to control and address those issues. You very much scratched your own itch with the move to the solution itself in the world of Puppet. That’s pretty good.</p>
<p>It’s actually interesting that Puppet, I think, recently, maybe in the last couple of years, have actually launched a remediation-focused solution that indeed focuses. It sounds maybe like on the same problem space that you’ve just been describing as [inaudible 00:05:15].</p>
<p><strong>[00:05:15] James Turnbull:</strong> Yeah. I’ve had a couple of steps at it. [inaudible 00:05:17] was a product manager there for a while, originally built a sort of patch management, vulnerability management system like 2012 or 2013 but it proved to be – It’s a non-trivial problem to solve. But, yes, it’s definitely one of those areas where we have a lot of information about vulnerabilities. We have a lot more ability to interrogate hosts and work out what’s wrong. We still have the challenge of how do you remediate those in a safe and reliable way? How do you ensure that there’s no downtime?</p>
<p>I think those problems are the ones that Puppet is trying to work out, how do we solve? How do we take these feeds of data and turn them into actions or execution that organizations can undertake?</p>
<p><strong>[00:05:55] Guy Podjarny:</strong> Yeah, very much. I mean, there’s also been some surrounding changes with the adoption of Kubernetes, as you pointed out, the ability to interrogate environments and ask for more information.</p>
<p>Let’s indeed maybe go down this path of the DevOps analogy and maybe a reverse path of your journey and talk a little bit about the analogies in the DevOps journey and in these changes of tools. Where is it that we can learn from them in security versus where do they defer and should be defined differently?</p>
<p>I thought maybe a helpful model for us to try and follow here is this people process technology type trial. Let’s start from that first one there, people. Maybe I’ll start by having you describe because people have different definitions of the people aspect of DevOps. When you think about people change is required to do DevOps successfully, how do you answer that?</p>
<p><strong>[00:06:45] James Turnbull:</strong> I mean, I think the people aspect of DevOps to me is probably the most important aspect of it. My best interactions or my best successes in building things or working on things or operating things was because I had good relationships with the folks all part of the process, whether they be software engineers, DBAs, or security people, or audit risk people. It’s a relationship-driven process.</p>
<p>To me, the DevOps thing is really about building a bridge between folks who previously perhaps didn’t have a conversation. There wasn’t necessarily any antagonism there. It was literally like, I do a job. I build an artifact. I give that artifact to some other people. Those other people do something with it, and sometimes they come and tell me that it’s broken.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously there’s a little bit of friction in there with regards to like the op side of things, get other people that live with the outage and so forth, but it’s really about like, okay, the Ops people have a set of expectations and constraints, and they have some needs. If they had a conversation with the people building the thing in the first place at first principles, would some of that process be smoother? Would the friction be reduced? Would the potential for outages be reduced?</p>
<p>To me, having a conversation, having a good relationship, understanding everybody’s needs is the key to that sort of DevOps thing. Obviously, there’s lots of tools and those bits and pieces in that automate a number of those processes and sort of reduce the human effort requirement, but it all stems from having that conversation in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>[00:08:12] Guy Podjarny:</strong> Yeah. I very much relate to this but I guess maybe let me ask you, from a security change perspective. Now, when you think, okay, we’re going to do DevSecOps, and I’m using this buzzword fairly loosely over here, it’s just a simple way of saying embed security into the DevOps existence if you will, or processes, do you see the same? Do you also think really the most important piece is the people piece?</p>
<p><strong>[00:08:35] James Turnbull:</strong> I think so. I think there’s a couple of levels of this. When I started out in security, there was a generation or even a couple of generations before me who saw their role as saying no to things. They really saw themselves as guardians of the business and the enterprise. The easiest way to safeguard those organizations was to say, “No, we shouldn’t do this.”</p>
<p>I probably belong to the next generation that came along. I left security about the same time as this was becoming more sort of status quo, but a bunch of people who really said that our job is not to say no. Our job is to say present the risk, present options about how you might mediate the risk in some way, with a view to like allowing the business to do what it needs to do to make money in a fast and efficient and safest way possible. It’s their risk appetite and not our risk appetite. Our job is to explain to them the decisions they’re making and what the impact is, but it’s really their ownership. They own the business risk in a way that we don’t.</p>
<p>I feel like this resonates really strongly with me in this sort of DevOps sort of the world is ultimately the outcome is you want to move fast and ship things, right? You want to be able to take the time from code, not earning you any money on a developer’s desktop, to code running in production, and making your business money. One of the sort of caveats in there, one of the things in there, is you want to do that in a secure way, as well as an efficient set of ways. Security becomes another stakeholder in that DevOps life cycle, and their job is really to say, “Okay. We have policy or we have process, or we have information we need from you that bubbles up and allows us to do our jobs. If we give you that …</p></div></div></div>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>State-of-the-art neural networks nowadays have become extremely parameterized in order to maximize the prediction accuracy. However, the model also becomes costly to run and the inference latency becomes a bottleneck. On resource-constrained edge devices, the model has a lot of restrictions and cannot be parameterized as much as we can.</p>



<p>Sparse neural networks could perform as good as dense neural network with respect to the prediction accuracy, and the inference latency becomes much lower theoretically due to its small model size. Neural network pruning is a method to create sparse neural networks from pre-trained dense neural networks.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to show how to use PyTorch to do pruning. More details about the mathematical foundations of pruning for neural networks could be found in my article <a href="https://leimao.github.io/article/Neural-Networks-Pruning/">â€œPruning for Neural Networksâ€�</a>.</p>

<h3 id="pytorch-pruning">PyTorch Pruning</h3>

<p>To demonstrate the effectiveness of pruning, a ResNet18 model is first pre-trained on CIFAR-10 dataset, achieving a prediction accuracy of $86.9\%$. The pre-trained is further pruned and fine-tuned. The number of parameters could be reduced by $98\%$, i.e., $50\times$ compression , while maintaining the prediction accuracy within $1\%$ of the original model. The source code could be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/leimao/PyTorch-Pruning-Example">GitHub</a>.</p>



<p>The pruning is overall straightforward to do if we donâ€™t need to <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/pruning_tutorial.html#extending-torch-nn-utils-prune-with-custom-pruning-functions">customize the pruning algorithm</a>. In this case, ResNet18 is able to achieve $50\times$ compression by using L1 unstructured pruning on weights, i.e., prune the weights that have the smallest absolute values.</p>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/thesephist/blocks.css">blocks.css</a> adds a layer of dimension to your web elements.
        It's light enough that it takes no time to set up or load, but interesting enough that it can serve as the only
        major CSS on the page.</p>

    <h2>Basics</h2>

    <p>blocks.css is a single stylesheet. Get started by adding the stylesheet to your page's head.</p>

    <pre>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/blocks.css/dist/blocks.min.css" /&gt;</pre>

    <p>This is a blocky button. It's interactive â€“â€“ try hovering and clicking on it.</p>
    

    <p>You can make any element blocky by giving it the class <code>block</code>.</p>

    <pre>&lt;button class="block"&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/button&gt;</pre>

    <h3>Accents</h3>

    <p>This is an <em>accent</em> button. You can make a block accented with the class <code>accent</code>.</p>
    

    <h3>Pills</h3>

    <p>This is a <em>round</em> button, also sometimes called a "pill". You can make a box round with the class <code>round</code>.</p>
    

    <h3>Fixed blocks</h3>

    <p>This is a <em>fixed</em> button, which means it won't respond to any of your inputs or interactions. You can make
        a block fixed with the class <code>fixed</code>.</p>
    

    <h3>Wrapper blocks</h3>

    <p>Sometimes, you want to blockify an element like <code>img</code> or <code>input</code>. But these elements can't
        have children like <code>::before</code> and <code>::after</code> elements, so blocks.css can't work its magic.
        Instead you'll have to wrap them in a <em>wrapper block</em>, using the <code>wrapper</code> class, like this.
        (The wrapper class removes padding in the block.)</p>
    <p><img src="https://linus.zone/pic" alt="Linus's picture">
    </p>

    <h3>Inline blocks</h3>

    <p>Lastly, sometimes you may want to place a block <em>inline</em>, or in the middle of a line of text. You can do
        so with an <em>inline</em> block, by adding the class <code>inline</code>. Then your blocks can be in the middle
        of text, <span>like this</span>.</p>

    <h2>Core components</h2>

    <p>We've only looked at buttons so far, but anything can be blocky. Here are a few examples.</p>

    <p>These are all just created by either adding the <code>block</code> class on a normal HTML element, or by wrapping
        normal HTML elements in <code>&lt;div class="wrapper block"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>.</p>

    

    <div>
        <pre>This is a blocky code block (inside a wrapper)</pre>
    </div>

    </p>

    <div>
        <h2>This is a blocky card</h2>

        </div>

    <h2>Theming</h2>

    <p>You can theme button styles by customizing the colors, using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*">CSS custom properties</a>.</p>

    <p>There are four variables that blocks.css uses:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><code>--block-text-color</code> determines the color of text, and the border around the block and its
                shadow</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><code>--block-background-color</code> is the color of the button background</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><code>--block-accent-color</code> is the background color of accented buttons</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><code>--block-shadow-color</code> is the fill color of the shadow</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here's a more colorful palette, by changing the <code>--block-accent-color</code> within just this div.</p>

    <div>
        

        <div>
            <h2>This is a blocky card</h2>
            <p>... that contains many other elements</p>
            </div>

    </div>

    <p>This is a dark theme, made possible by setting the text, background, and shadow colors to be their inverses.</p>

    <div>
        

        <div>
            <h2>This is a blocky card</h2>
            <p>... that contains many other elements</p>
            </div>

  <article>
    

    <p><strong>Monday, February  1, 2021</strong></p>

    <p>It seems like everyone these days is developing in containers. Specifically, I mean running your local development environment almost entirely in containers. There's a lot to be said for it, especially when you're bringing new developers into a project: it can be an invaluable way for anyone new to the project to quickly get all the tooling set up with a lot fewer "works on my machine" issues. But everything involves tradeoffs, so today we're going to focus on what some of the drawbacks of containers are. Also because it's my blog, so I write about what I want, dammit, and containers have been bugging me a little lately!</p>
<p>Here are some of the things that have been bugging me, and that make me just want to run processes directly on my host.</p>
<p><strong>Installing and managing packages takes extra work.</strong> Using Python as an example, it's pretty easy to get packages installed for any project that's using a modern dependency manager like <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">poetry</a> or <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/">pipenv</a>. You just run something like <code>poetry install</code> and it will setup a virtualenv for you (essential to have reproducible builds, isolated between projects). The tool is there, and you just use it, but you can wrap it in a Makefile for convenience if you like. But if you're using Docker, you get a lot of extra steps. For one, you have to make sure that the dependency manager's generated virtualenv is persisted on your host, not just in the container, else you will be reinstalling those dependencies every time you start a container. (Or you can install the dependencies into the <em>image</em>, but then you have to rebuild the entire image and install <em>every</em> dependency to just add one for testing something out, adding unnecessary friction.)</p>
<p><strong>Actually, everything takes extra commands.</strong> You want to install a new package? Oh, open a shell into your container, <em>then</em> install it. You want to compile your program? Open a shell into your container, <em>then</em> install it. You want to launch the development server? You guessed it... And yes, I know the pedantic comments are going to be "well, actually you can do this in one command with <code>docker run</code>"—okay, but that's not better: now you've just made the one command you need to run <em>far</em> longer.</p>
<p><strong>File permissions are a pain in the butt.</strong> If you have a directory mounted on the host and in the container (<code>node_modules</code>, for example) then in all likelihood the files created inside the container are going to be owned by <code>root</code> since everything runs as <code>root</code> by default. When you're your normal user outside the container, you now will have challenges doing things like deleting that directory—and it produces a lot of really noisy output when you use something like <code>grep</code>, because suddenly there are a lot of files you cannot read! There are solutions to this, making the container use the same userid as your user on the system, but I have not found anything that worked well. It's just not worth the effort, and you're left with a nuisance every time you generate files inside a container.</p>
<p><strong>Retaining history is difficult.</strong> Getting your bash history retained between containers is a challenge, but I understand it's doable. Now you use a Python shell, so you need to configure that one for history as well.  Then you start using Elixir, so you need to configure history for it as well. Everything that normally works out of the box when you're developing on your host directly? You have to configure it and figure out which files you need to share between containers and the host to make it work. You usually figure this out by the pain of <em>not</em> having the history, and eventually someone on the team will patch it to make it work (mostly). But... at what cost? You get this for free by just, you know, using the host.</p>
<p><strong>Performance is horrible on Macs.</strong> I use Linux as my only operating system (Ubuntu specifically), but many colleagues past and present prefer using Macs. With the latest hardware advances from Apple, this is going to hold true going forward. And yet the performance is tangibly worse for Docker on Macs, because you have to run it inside a VM. (Windows cleverly skirts this problem by running the Linux kernel directly, not inside a VM; Mac OS could certainly take a similar approach in the future, if they prioritize developer experience. I am not optimistic.)</p>
<p><strong>Integration with tooling isn't great.</strong> We've had a tough time at <a href="https://remesh.ai/">work</a> getting IDEs like PyCharm or VS Code to play nice with our containerized setup. They support containers, but they don't seem to support containerized monorepos very well. Or that's what I've seen from the problems my colleagues have run into. I've fiddled with it a bit. As a vim user, it doesn't affect me personally, but it is a big issue when considering the impact on the team at large.</p>
<p>So, yeah, containers are pretty great. I'm glad we have them, and I <em>love</em> having them for use in production environments. But locally? Most of the time, I think you're better off running what you're developing directly on your local machine. You get a robust, easy-to-use setup that doesn't throw away a lot of the features you get for free (history!). There are benefits to either approach, but the old tried-and-true methods deserve some love.</p>

<![CDATA[Wvim: Quickly edit shell scripts, aliases, and functions]]>
            </title>

February 3, 2021 | https://ctoomey.com/writing/which-plus-vim-wvim | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ctoomey.com/writing/which-plus-vim-wvim">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
  <p>Over the years I’ve collected an array of one-off scripts, shell aliases, git
subcommands, etc., and I often find myself wanting to reference or edit of one
of them. Sometimes I know where to look, but not always, and when in doubt I
rely on the <code>which</code> command to point me in the right direction.</p>

<p><code>wvim</code> is a script that I’ve built to streamline these sort of edits. It started
as a simple wrapper around <code>which</code> — <code>function wvim() { vim "$(which $1)" }</code> —
but over time I’ve added support for shell functions &amp; aliases, as well as git
aliases and scripts. The thing that tipped this into the “oh wow, that’s pretty
cool” space for me was the addition of tab completion by leveraging the existing
tab completion for <code>which</code> via <code>compdef wvim=which</code>.</p>

<p>Using it looks something like this:</p>

<video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" controls="" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/72f38f70e9318ad832a3a3d083ff721193825df2/e9a66/assets/videos/wvim.mp4">
</video>

<h2 id="show-me-the-code">Show Me The Code!</h2>

<p>You can check out <a href="https://github.com/christoomey/dotfiles/blob/master/zsh/configs/wvim.zsh">my current version of this script in my dotfiles
repo</a>,
but for completeness, I’ve included the contents of the file below. You can use
it by including the code in your <code>~/.zshrc</code> file (or by splitting it out into
its own file for organization purposes if you share my penchant for clean config
files).</p>

<p><em>Note</em> - the <code>compdef</code> completion line is zsh-specific, but I believe the rest
should be reasonably portable to bash or other similar shells.</p>

<p>Given that <code>wvim</code> is built out of various regex checks and heuristic searching
logic, I’ve been impressed by how well <code>wvim</code> has worked for me.</p>

<p>That said, there are a few assumptions baked into this script, most notably that
I have it configured to look in both <code>~/.zshenv</code> and <code>~/.zshrc</code>. If you don’t
have both those files, you’ll want to update that to only reference the file you
have.</p>

</div><div><p>It’s hard to measure the effectiveness of political ads because the goal is to change&nbsp;<em>offline</em>&nbsp;behavior, which means all those cookies that Facebook stuffs into your browser count for nothing.</p>
<p>Since there’s no way to track conversion (i.e. how many people vote for your team) many political campaigns try using&nbsp;<em>recall</em>&nbsp;to measure to effectiveness of an ad.&nbsp;<em>Recall</em> is the percentage of people who will remember seeing an ad from your campaign two days later<span><a onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor_1_2('footnote_plugin_reference_1_2_6');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_1_2_6">[6]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1_2_6">Facebook&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1029827880390718?id=429023050853196">actually says</a> “within two days” which is hilariously imprecise.</span></span><sup id="fnref2"></sup>, and&nbsp;<em>recall lift</em>&nbsp;is the difference in recall between people who have seen your ad and people who haven’t.</p>

<p>The other common way of measuring the efficacy of a political ad to use some other behavior as a proxy for voting. Maybe if someone eventually donates to your campaign (or Super PAC or whatever), that’s a sign that your ad is working! Maybe if they just&nbsp;<em>click</em>&nbsp;on your ad, that’s a good sign!</p>
<p>I dunno maybe? It seems pretty unscientific. I actually click on lots of crazy Trump ads because I’m curious who’s paying for them.<span><a onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor_1_2('footnote_plugin_reference_1_2_7');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_1_2_7">[7]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1_2_7">And (spoiler) I did not vote for the Trumpster.</span></span> And if you’re trying to persuade <em>undecided</em>&nbsp;voters who to vote for, it’s pretty unlikely they’re going to go from “I don’t know who to vote for” to “OMG TAKE MY MONEY!”</p>
<p>But here’s a crazy idea: what if we showed people ads <strong>and then just&nbsp;asked&nbsp;who they planned to vote for?</strong></p>
</div><div><p><a href="https://www.mturk.com/">Mechanical Turk</a> is a marketplace for extremely small, web-based tasks. The tasks (called Human Intelligence Tasks or HITs) are usually just an HTML form, possibly with some links to external media. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2016/07/11/the-requesters-a-mix-of-academics-and-businesses/">Common Mechanical Turk tasks</a> include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identifying objects in images (usually for ML training)</li>
<li>Transcription (i.e., from audio to text)</li>
<li>Surveys (either academic- or marketing-related)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691610393980">Several</a> <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract-id=1626226">studies</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1357054.1357127">attest</a> that Mechanical Turk can provide survey responses that match or exceed the quality of traditionally-administered surveys. And—most importantly for the 2020 election—you can do it without actually <em>talking</em> to anyone!</p>
</div><div><p>In a past life <a href="https://tjcx.me/p/i-wasted-40k-on-a-fantastic-startup-idea">I read a lot of randomized controlled trials</a>. I might not be a scientist but I can definitely play one on <del>TV</del> this blog. So here’s what I’m thinking, design-wise:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find all the (self-identified) conservatives on Mechanical Turk</li>
<li>Split them into two groups
<ol>
<li>The&nbsp;<strong>control group</strong>
<ol>
<li>Who gets to look at a cute dog</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>and the&nbsp;<strong>experimental group</strong>
<ol>
<li>Who sadly must look at a political ad</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Then we ask them “hey there voter, who are you voting for?”</li>
<li>Compare the groups and see which (if any) of your ads worked</li>
</ol>
<p>Basic science, right?<span><a onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor_1_2('footnote_plugin_reference_1_2_8');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_1_2_8">[8]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1_2_8">It’s also (I think?) the basic strategy used by Civis Analytics, based on this <a href="https://medium.com/civis-analytics/with-message-testing-popularity-does-not-equal-persuasiveness-2da200ecc3a8">extremely vague Medium article</a> I read.</span></span> It’s not quite double-blind (most subjects are <em>aware</em> that they’re looking at a pro-Biden ad) but as social science experiments go it’s not bad.</p>
</div><div><h3>What’s the point of all this?</h3></div><div><p>I used to think that all political ads had a single goal:&nbsp;<em>convincing people on the other team to vote for your team.</em></p>
<p>But it turns out these “persuasion” ads don’t really work. A <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3042867">2017 review</a> of 40 field experiments concluded that “the best estimate of the effects of campaign contact and advertising on Americans’ candidates choices in general elections is zero.” So why run ads at all?</p>
<p>Well persuasion ads are only one type of political ad. The full list is</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mobilization ads,</strong> which encourage people on your team to get off their asses and vote</li>
<li><strong>Demobilization ads,</strong> which encourage people on the <em>other</em> team to stay home</li>
<li><strong>Persuasion ads,</strong> which convince independent voters that they should vote for you team</li>
</ol>
<p>In other words, changing minds is hard, but convincing people to (1) get off or (2) stay on the couch is relatively easy.</p>
<p>Mobilization ads are pretty common. The phonebanking that I so desperately tried to avoid was&nbsp;<em>entirely</em> about mobilization—we only called “lean left” voters and made sure they knew how to get to their polling place. You may have also heard this called “Get out the vote,” “GOTV,” or even “Get off your festering, bedridden ass and do your civic duty.”<span><a onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor_1_2('footnote_plugin_reference_1_2_9');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_1_2_9">[9]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1_2_9">Depending on how many consecutive hours of phonebanking I’ve done.</span></span> This tends to work pretty well, since one-third of Americans don’t vote in general elections.<span><a onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor_1_2('footnote_plugin_reference_1_2_10');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_1_2_10">[10]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1_2_10">Although the 2020 election did have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/elections/voter-turnout/">record turnout</a>.</span></span></p>
<p>A quick perusal of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library">Facebook Ad Library</a> tells me that both sides have the mobilization part covered. That means <em>mobilization</em> is saturated and <em>persuasion</em> doesn’t work—which leaves the dark art of <em>demobilization:&nbsp;</em><strong>how can I best convince conservatives to <em>not</em> vote for Trump?</strong></p>
</div><div><p>I’m not Don Draper, but since I have two eyeballs and an internet connection I see roughly 8,156 ads every second—I should be able to&nbsp;<em>make</em> the damn things, right?</p>
<p>Well okay here’s what I came up with:</p>
</div></div></div><div id="the-ads"><div><div><p>The ads compared in this study. Click to enlarge.</p>
</div></div></div><div><div><div><p>I wanted to try positive&nbsp;<em>and</em> negative ads, and I wanted to try a few different issues. Can already guess which ads worked?</p>
</div><div><p>Anyway, after displaying one of these ads to a Turker<span><a onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor_1_2('footnote_plugin_reference_1_2_11');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_1_2_11">[11]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1_2_11">I’m told this isn’t as pejorative as it sounds.</span></span> I ask them two questions.

</div></div></div><div><div><div><p>In addition to this question, I also asked an <a href="https://www.cloudresearch.com/resources/blog/attention-check-questions-in-surveys-examples/"><strong>attention-check question</strong></a> (ACQ). The ACQ varied for each treatment group, but it looked something like this:</p>
</div></div></div><div><div><div><span><img width="1460" height="356" alt="Screenshot of attention check question" title="attention-check" src="https://anthemlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2021-01-23-at-5.06.19-PM.png" srcset="https://anthemlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2021-01-23-at-5.06.19-PM-200x49.png 200w, https://anthemlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2021-01-23-at-5.06.19-PM-400x98.png 400w, https://anthemlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2021-01-23-at-5.06.19-PM-600x146.png 600w, https://anthemlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2021-01-23-at-5.06.19-PM-800x195.png 800w, https://anthemlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2021-01-23-at-5.06.19-PM-1200x293.png 1200w, https://anthemlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2021-01-23-at-5.06.19-PM.png 1460w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 1200px"></span></div><div><p>One of my attention-check questions (ACQs).</p>
</div></div></div><div><div><div><p>Basically, Turkers are incentivized to complete as many tasks as possible in the shortest amount of time. I’m not saying that Turkers are <em>intentionally</em> filling out random answers to surveys, but I&nbsp;<em>am</em> saying that the incentives aren’t great. To combat the inattentive Turker I’ve added this second question, which asks Turkers something painfully obvious about the ad I’ve just showed them.<span><a onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor_1_2('footnote_plugin_reference_1_2_12');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_1_2_12">[12]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1_2_12">After I ran this study I found some evidence that <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/methods/2020/02/18/two-common-checks-fail-to-catch-most-bogus-cases/">open-ended questions make&nbsp;<em>much</em> better ACQs</a>—something to try next time!</span></span></p>
<p>I threw out 1% of the responses because they got this question wrong.</p>
</div><div><p>I don’t want any schmuck with an internet connection to fill out this survey. There are&nbsp;<em>rules</em>, you know? My respondents should</p>
<ul>
<li>Be conservative (I’m studying the demobilization of&nbsp;<em>conservatives</em>)</li>
<li>Live in the US<span><a onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor_1_2('footnote_plugin_reference_1_2_13');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_1_2_13">[13]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1_2_13">Well okay I want them to be eligible to vote in US federal elections but “location” is a good enough proxy.</span></span></li>
<li>Not have filled out another survey in this study</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway Mechanical Turk makes enforcing these rules pretty easy via&nbsp;<em>Worker Qualifications</em>:</p>

</div></div></div><div><div><div id="worker-qualifications">
<p>Easy, right? But before you start piling on qualifications like Yogurtland toppings, let me remind you that many of these are “premium” qualifications and cost an arm and leg. If you don’t want to be one of those schmucks that <a href="https://www.delish.com/food-news/news/a53666/best-frozen-yogurt-toppings-for-your-money/">wastes money on fruit at Yogurtland</a>, <strong>consider asking your own screening questions.</strong></p>
<p>The downside of asking your own screening questions is that you’ll have to throw out all the answers from people who don’t meet your criteria. But depending on the cost of the qualification and the estimated percentage of people who will pass the screening question, it might make financial sense to do it yourself.</p>
<p>Ready to be dazzled by some complicated math? Here’s the cost of using your own screening questions<span><a onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor_1_2('footnote_plugin_reference_1_2_14');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_1_2_14">[14]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1_2_14">Assuming the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice">Axiom of Choice</a></span></span>:</p>
<p>\[\text{requirement cost} = \frac{1-p}{p}c\]</p>
<p>Where \(p\) is the estimated proportion of Turkers that will pass your qualification, and \(c\) is the total cost for each completed HIT. In my case each task cost $0.46 ($0.33 for Turkers and $0.13 for Amazon), and according to a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2158244016636433">2016 study</a> of the Mechanical Turk population is roughly 14.6% capital-R Republican<span><a onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor_1_2('footnote_plugin_reference_1_2_15');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_1_2_15">[15]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1_2_15">Wild, right?</span></span>, so the “roll-your-own” screening method would cost</p>
<p>\[\text{requirement cost} = \frac{1-0.146}{0.146}0.46 = $2.69\]</p>
<p>Which is&nbsp;<em>far</em> more than <a href="https://requester.mturk.com/pricing">the $0.40 that Amazon charges</a> for the “US Political Affiliation” premium qualification—so that’s what I used.</p>

		<div>
			<div>
<p>They called him the Black Sparrow, and from the beginning of his life, all he wanted to do was get to France.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He was born in Georgia, his father a former slave from Haiti, his mother full-blooded Creek. He ran away while still a child, determined to fulfill his destiny.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>He lived for a time with a group of English Romani, learning the art of horsemanship and working as a jockey. He kept traveling and working until he made his way to Norfolk, where he stowed away on a ship bound for Scotland.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He wouldn’t see America again for thirty years.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>In Glasgow he got work as a lookout for gambling operators, saving money until he had enough to get to England: one country closer to his goal. In Liverpool he did hard labor until his muscles developed and he turned to boxing.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He became part of a whole expat community of Black boxers — some of the finest fighters in history — who had fled to Europe to find opportunities denied them in the States. Soon he was fighting regularly as a welterweight, racking up an impressive record, even fighting on the undercard of a few Jack Johnson bouts.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>His boxing career earned him a decent amount of money, and eventually took him to Paris, where he won his bout and promptly hopped off the tour.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Imagine, if you will, being a young, handsome Black/Creek man, son of a slave, escaped from the American South, newly arrived in Paris in the springtime with your own apartment and a pocketful of money.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Fighting for France was a no-brainer. After all, in his heart at least, it was his country. He joined the French Foreign Legion, training to fight in the 3rd Marching Division alongside wealthy Ivy Leaguers, mariners, farmers, doctors, executives, refugees, cooks, and plenty of characters from all over the world running from undisclosed situations. These were Belgians, Italians, Russians, Greeks, Americans, a handful of Black Americans; Muslims, Catholics, Jews and Protestants — the legendary rabble of the Legion.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Sent directly to the front along the Somme, he was thrust into a world of filthy, bloody trenches still filled with the body parts of the dead and the rancid smell of shit and blood as his unit experienced some of the worst losses of the war.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>At the end of this stint, what was left of the 3rd was disbanded and he had only the briefest respite before he joined the 170th Cavalry and was sent straight to Verdun to participate in what would become one of the worst battles in the history of the human race.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Now a corporal, he led a machine-gun crew and again was front-and-center for the worst of the fighting, suffering first a shrapnel wound to the face that he simply fought through, then finally sidelined by a massive, nearly fatal wound to his thigh that finally sent him away from the front.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Decorated with the Croix de Guerre for his valor at Verdun — one of France’s highest military honors — he was well within his rights to find a desk job in the military.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He had other ideas. He wanted to fly.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Already viewed as a hero, he was able to pull the necessary strings to enter flight school, and became the first Black American fighter pilot in history.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He flew a SPAD VII C1 with a distinctive alteration to its appearance. Painted on the outside of the fuselage was a red heart with a dagger through it. Above the heart was his personal slogan, one he would later use for the title of his unpublished memoir: Tout Le Sang Qui Coule Est Rouge; roughly, in English: “All Blood Runs Red.”</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He flew with honor and distinction until his career in the air came to an abrupt halt. The Americans had entered the war and the involvement of a certain Dr. Gros, a US Army Major with racist attitudes, led to the end of the Black Sparrow’s career as a pilot.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>But the French continued to celebrate him. He ended this part of his military career with the Military Medal, Croix de Guerre, Volunteer Combat Cross, Medal for Military Wounded (twice), World War I Medal, Victory Medal, Voluntary Enlistment Medal, Battle of Verdun Medal, Battle of Somme Medal, and the American Volunteer with the French Army Medal.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>And that is when his life got interesting.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>The Great War over, he found himself in Paris in the 1920s at the onset of the Jazz Age. He got back in shape, took work as a sparring partner and fought a few more times. But it wasn’t sustainable with his injuries.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>So he learned to play the drums and became a jazz musician. He gigged frequently, saved money, and ended up in a business partnership with a biracial American blues singer whose birth name was Ada Beatrice Queen Victoria Louis Virginia Smith — known as “Bricktop” for her red hair.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Together, they opened the Le Grand Duc, and thus he became proprietor of the hippest nightclub in the hippest city during the birth of hip.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He got married around this time to a Frenchwoman named Marcelle and they had two daughters. For reasons that remained private, Marcelle ended up leaving him with their children, to whom he would remain devoted for the rest of his life, as we will see.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>But he had to balance the duties of being a single parent with Le Grand Duc — and later his other club, L’escradille, which was connected to a boxing gym so that patrons could party, then exercise, take a steam bath, get a massage, and start partying again.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>To name the personages that frequented his clubs is basically to list the greatest names in art and culture in the renaissance that was the 1920s.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Langston Hughes was a busboy and dishwasher. Arthur Wilson — you may know him as “Sam” of Casablanca fame — was part of the house band. Charlie Chaplin was a favorite. Gloria Swanson. Fatty Arbuckle. The Prince of Wales. Staff would move tables when Fred and Adele Astaire came in to tear up the floor. Picasso would stop by, and Hemingway was there often enough that he wrote about it in “The Sun Also Rises.” Josephine Baker could not be missed, and even babysat for the Sparrow. F. Scott Fitzgerald and Zelda were frequent, notorious guests. Cole Porter would come in; he adored the way Bricktop interpreted his songs. When Louis Armstrong encamped in Paris, he and the Sparrow became close.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>But the good times couldn’t last. In 1933, Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany. In France, the Deuxième Bureau was created as a counter-intelligence service and the Sparrow was recruited to work with the beautiful Alsatian spy, Cleopatre “Kitty” Terrier, whose father’s murder by Germans in the disputed border region had instilled in her a lifelong hatred of German expansionism.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Kitty and the Sparrow worked as a team at the club. He would serve tables and play dumb, exploiting German prejudices that would never suspect he was fluent in German. She would flirt her way into privileged information. It was a highly successful (and probably romantic) pairing, but with rationing, blackouts, and other wartime austerity measures, keeping businesses running became harder and harder.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>He tried. He procured a wagon and would visit markets at the end of the day for discounted goods, throw them in a stew at the club. Come evening he would feed everyone for free, plus a free glass of wine per person and a pack of cigarettes per table. He tried. But of course, things got worse.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He pulled his daughters out of their convent school to keep them close. Closed the club. Many were fleeing as the Nazis came storming through Belgium. He wouldn’t run.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He continued to work with Kitty in the Resistance until 1940, when the Nazis marched down Champs-Élysées and through L’arc de Triomphe.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Tens of thousands fled the city only to be bombed from the skies. He left his daughters in the care of Kitty, who promised to do what was necessary to keep them safe, packed his gear, and headed for the frontlines, determined, despite his age and multiple injuries, to find his old unit and rejoin the Legion.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>When he arrived, it was only to find that his unit had been destroyed. Returning to Paris, he couldn’t enter; it had been completely overrun.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>But he heard rumors that the French 51st was holding out at Orléans. He started off on foot. The roads were full of starved, half-mad refugees. Bombings were frequent.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>When he got there he discovered that his lieutenant from the last war was the commander of the 51st, and, in what must have felt like the world’s worst case of déjà vu, he was once again in charge of a machine-gun crew, fighting the Germans.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He fought with his usual bravery. But it was a hopeless last stand. A shell that killed 11 men threw him forty feet and cracked a vertebrae.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>His fighting days were over. Using his rifle as a crutch, he struck out for a military hospital in Angoulême, trying to stay out of sight.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>But there was little they could do for him there: painkillers, some bandages, and a few cans of sardines with a suggestion to head for Bordeaux and into Spain which, although Fascist, had maintained official neutrality, and was tacitly allowing Allied rescue efforts on Spanish soil.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He made it, somehow, received his first passport, and was put on a Navy ship to finally return to the United States he had fled decades before.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Life in Manhattan wasn’t easy. He had to start from scratch. He worked odd jobs — longshoreman, salesman of French perfume. Through a contact in the State Department he was able to get in touch with Kitty, who was true to her word: his daughters were safe. They came to the States without a word of English between them and moved in with their beloved father in Spanish Harlem.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>He became involved in Free French groups, working to support General de Gaulle, head of the Free French government in exile, and was also filmed getting beaten by police as part of a human chain to protect Paul Robeson when his concert was disrupted by white supremacists.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Times were tight but he was doing okay. His old friend Louis Armstrong came to help, hiring him as a tour manager and occasional drummer. He even tried to recover his club and gym in …</p></div></div></div></div>

<h2 id="Marc%20on%202021-02-03">Marc on 2021-02-03</h2>

<p>I firmly believe the Internet, and what it stood for, peaked with RSS. </p>

<p>RSS, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">Really-Simple-Syndication</a>, is (or <em>was</em> depending on your viewpoint) a means of allowing basically anything online to be collated into a single feed. You would visit the websites you loved, add their RSS feed to your preferred reader, and from then on be instantly notified of any new content, it was as simple as that. RSS primarily had its heyday during the Web 2.0 era (circa 1999-2010) when the freedom to do whatever you wanted with the information present on the Web was really the driving force behind a lot of new features and systems. This was of course before Social Media had taken off in the way we know it today and most of these concepts were siloed off into their own locked-down social-feeds.</p>

<p>Once Social-Media took its hold on the Web if there was something/someone you wanted to follow online you just added them to your Twitter feed or subscribed on YouTube; a fine idea until you decide you don't like the layout of the site in question or an algorithm decides you don't need to see the work of those you care about as often as you want (aka the <em>curated</em> timeline). I've already spoken before about my <a href="https://atthis.link/blog/2020/mastodon.html">general disinterest with Social Media</a> but it wasn't until somewhat recently that I decided to really start looking for alternatives - searching for a better way to interact with the Internet. I found my answer in RSS. I enjoyed the freedom to see sources as I wanted, the flexibility to move to a new reader if I wanted, the complete lack of advertising. It was hard to not fall in love with the service.</p>

<p>However it wasn't until I began working from home and everything in my life moved online that I really began to notice how beneficial RSS could be with relation to Digital Wellbeing. By selecting only the sites, blogs, creators etc. that I had a serious interest in, I could effectively remove the negative effects of social media and excessive online usage from my life. It was easier to get involved in serious <a href="https://atthis.link/blog/2020/deepwork.html">Deep Work</a> as I had no social feeds to endlessly scroll through. It was easier to stay informed as I could only see the <em>latest</em> items rather than being given an algorithmic infinite feed of supposedly “breaking news.” I could open my reader maybe twice a day, skim through the latest items and continue on with my work, a process that could be over and done with in under 5 minutes - a far cry from opening Twitter and suddenly 2 hours have passed…</p>

<p>Another use-case I was surprised to develop was managing collaborative projects. An issue I've heard repeatedly from those working from home is that of being deafened by the ever-present, ever-ringing notification-bell as countless chat and collaboration apps incessantly vie for your attention with new questions, comments, and discussions that may-or-may-not need your already splintered focus. For me, RSS solved that issue. Instead of checking-in every 10 minutes to see if there's any new project developments, or sending chaser messages asking if a colleague finished up on that feature - I can just track everything with RSS. If anything comes up that I need to know about, RSS will be there to present it to me.</p>

<p>As I said during the introduction of this post, RSS may appear to some to have fallen by the wayside as content is increasingly siloed into only being available on a specific platform. However a not insignificant number of sites still make the service readily available, for instance:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/wiki/rss">Reddit still offers RSS support</a> by appending <code>/.rss</code> to the end of a given URL.</p></li>
<li><p>GitHub allows you to add an activity feed of your followed accounts/organisations by clicking the feed icon at the bottom of your account page.</p></li>
<li><p>YouTube offers RSS support by adding a channel ID (The series of numbers and characters present in the URL of a channel homepage) to the following URL:</p></li>
</ul>

<pre><code>www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=CHANNEL_ID
</code></pre>

<p>Having only the content I want to see only be shown when I want to see it with the freedom to jump between readers as I please, all with no ads? For me, no other service comes close to the flexibility, robustness, and overall ease-of-use that RSS offers.</p>

<p>Its heyday may be over but RSS is still very much alive with services like <a href="https://feedly.com/">Feedly</a> and <a href="https://newsboat.org/">Newsboat</a> (recommended) along with a host of mobile apps on either platform letting you experience the web at what I consider to be its best. If you feel like trying out RSS for yourself, why not get started by adding <a href="https://atthis.link/rss.xml">this blog</a> to your reader?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>You can’t hold a gun to someone’s head and say “Be Creative.”</strong> -Mike Booth, creator of Left4Dead</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The best PM’s don’t come up with creative ideas and strategy all the time. They create space for creative thinking and optimize their process.</p>
<p>It feels like the stars have to align. The right environment, the right mood, the right spark of inspiration. Now throw a global pandemic on top of that where everyone is working from their bedrooms (or at least I am). There are constant distractions, more meetings than ever, and my typical tools like whiteboards and walking 1:1’s are out the window.</p>
<p>You can call it ‘in the zone’ or ‘flow state’ or ‘creative mode’ but whatever it was... I wasn’t hitting it.</p>
<p>Last month, I found myself sitting around for hours unable to focus and make any progress on strategy or vision.</p>
<p><strong>I was really struggling.</strong></p>
<p>Since then, I’ve started to crack a formula to enter creative mode. It hasn’t been a single epiphany or a magic incantation, but rather a series of behavior changes.</p>
<h2><strong>Schedule</strong></h2>
<p>Creative thinking takes time. You can’t just flip your brain into creative mode instantly. On a good day, it takes about 15 minutes for me to enter creative mode. On a bad day, it can take hours. <strong>If you’re always in meetings with 30 minute chunks in between, you’ll never make any progress.</strong></p>
<p>Instead, we want to optimize for large, uninterrupted focus blocks. Think of The Matrix. When Keanu is interrupted IRL, everything in his brain falls apart. Your brain works the same way. You have to boot the entire project up in your brain, hold it there, and manipulate it.</p>
<img src="https://bdickason.com/static/posts/unlock-creative-strategic-thinking/soul.jpg">
<p>In the movie Soul, flow is an alternate plane of existence.</p>
<p><strong>Select days for creative thinking</strong> - If you aren’t intentional, meetings will crowd your time and create sprawl all over your calendar. Select at least two days where you optimize your schedule for creative thinking. This will allow you to remember (and have a rationale) to defend those days. I like to setup my calendar as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monday - 1:1’s</li>
<li>Tuesday - Team Meetings</li>
<li>Wednesday/Thursday - Creative Mode</li>
<li>Friday - Left open for Ad-hoc meetings</li>
</ul>
<p>If I’m working on a large strategy project, I’ll block off 4+ days per week to ensure I can make plenty of progress. If you take this approach, make sure you align your manager and have their support. Otherwise, you risk getting dinged for not collaborating.</p>
<p><strong>Batch meetings</strong> - Most days end up looking like swiss cheese - Lots of sproadic meetings with 30m-1hr in between. Squeeze your schedule so that the meetings all line up one after another. Paul Graham calls this ‘manager time’. Manager time is when we review and we discuss vs. when we create.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I find one meeting can sometimes affect a whole day. A meeting commonly blows at least half a day, by breaking  up a morning or afternoon. But in addition there's sometimes a cascading effect. If I know the afternoon is going  to be broken up, I'm slightly less likely to start something ambitious in the morning.</em>” (<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html">see: Maker’s Schedule, Manager’s schedule</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Going from meeting to meeting is draining, but those tiny blocks in between are useless and you’ll never make any meaningful creative progress. Batch your meetings so you have large blocks of uninterrupted time for creative thinking.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid context switching</strong> - Just like it takes time to switch into creative mode, it takes time to switch context between projects. If you’re working on multiple products or projects, designate specific days to work on each one. It takes me at least 2-3 hours to switch context from one project to another. If you want to make significant creative progress in a single day, you have to be very intentional (and typically use tactics like a long walk or lunch in between to clear your head). I typically will work on one project on Wednesday and another on Thursday to minimize switching.</p>
<p><strong>Let your teammates know</strong> - Now that you’ve rearranged your schedule, you need to publicize it so others respect it. Providing this context will set clear boundaries and make sure people understand the importance of focus.</p>
<ol>
<li>Align your manager to your schedule. Your manager will need to support you and help you defend your time.</li>
<li>Share your schedule in a team meeting or small group conversation. This will help socialize why you’re blocking off this time (which will increase the chance people will respect it) and give them a chance to give feedback or adjust your schedule.</li>
<li>Write a post/email with your schedule. Make it clear that you’re available outside of your focus blocks and will get back to messages quickly after each block is completed. Bonus points if you set this up as an auto-responder during your focus blocks.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Environment</h2>
<p>The right environment can make the difference between a session of fidgeting and one of deep focus. To take advantage of your focus blocks, you need to design your environment for creative mode. Eventually, your brain will start to recognize this place and will shift rapidly.</p>
<p><strong>Choose a separate space for creative thinking</strong> - This should be different than your typical work space. You want to avoid your brain switching into ‘task’ or ‘execution’ mode. If you normally work standing, try sitting in a chair. If you normally work in your office, shift to another room (if you have one!)</p>
<p><strong>Setup the space for creativity</strong> - You want your space to fade away. It should be calming, well lit, and comfortable. Not ‘lay down in bed and fall asleep’ comfortable, but enough that you can zone out from distractions around you and not think about adjusting your position. I like to let outside light in and add a few small touches such as a poster (<a href="https://romero.com/shop/p/armedcoders-rrdwf">here's mine 🤓</a>) or a special lamp that inspires you. If possible, avoid spaces with other people in them as their movement will distract you.</p>
<p><strong>Walk or move before you start</strong> - If possible, walk or move before you start. This could be a walk around the block or walking across your house to another room. Movement enables us to think more creatively and problem solve. I knew that Steve Jobs liked walking meetings, but there’s science to back it up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Creative thinking improves while a person is walking and shortly thereafter ... The study found that walking indoors or outdoors similarly boosted creative inspiration. The act of walking itself, and not the environment, was the main factor."</em> (<a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2014/04/24/walking-vs-sitting-042414/">Stanford Graduate School of Education</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve started using walking as a tool to start and end sessions. If I’m stuck, taking a walk (or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6sdWYXB8RQ">riding my surf skate</a>) can help unblock me.</p>
<p><strong>Create playlists with noise cancelling headphones</strong> - This has been the most impactful change to my routine. Music seem sto help me enter creative mode very quickly. I have a pair of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RQ366VK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B07RQ366VK&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=bdickason-20&amp;linkId=29ec5297cca7ec448acba6f3bced2c8a">Jabra Elite 85h</a> in beige because I like the feel over ear headphones and they never have issues connecting to my devices. Whenever I sit down for creative time, I have a specific playlist that I put on and listen to on repeat. It’s repetitive, has few words, and the volume is pretty constant. I have a similar playlist for execution/tasks. <strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5pHtl20zTPi6rk6Flo1En9?si=_lyBpvl0RWWC4uJV8u1DEQ">Creative Playlist</a> / <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7KWYiMbxzJH8WqPvdEf3mg?si=e6L2NoY7QFWKPoxJsoiH7w">Execution Playlist</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Remove every distraction</strong> - PM’s pride themselves in being available, but even the vibration from your phone can pull you out of creative mode. Turn everything off:</p>
<ul>
<li>Close apps and tabs</li>
<li>If possible, turn off wifi</li>
<li>Turn on Do Not Disturb on your laptop</li>
<li>Use a minimalist writing app with focus mode like <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a></li>
<li>Put your phone on airplane mode (ideally in a different room)</li>
</ul>
<p>These may sound silly or extreme, but every little bit helps.</p>
<h2>Make it easy to start</h2>
<p>Ok, you’ve got your calendar dialed and you’re in your magic rocket ship creativity chair. Great. Now you pull out a blank page and.... Crap. You’re stuck.</p>
<p><strong>Never start with a blank page</strong> - A blank page can be intimidating and challenging. A good note taking system can shortcut this and make sure you always have a starting point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Everybody’s got an eye for something. The only difference is that I carry around a notebook in my front pocket. I write everything down, and it helps me recall.”</em> (<a href="https://perell.com/essay/how-to-cure-writers-block/">David Sedaris via David Perell</a>)*.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Throughout the week, jot down notes about your topic. These could be words that come to mind, short phrases or links, or even an entire outline. The key is to take ideas as they come to you (vs when you sit down to work) and plant tiny seeds of ideas on paper (or in your note taking app). They don’t have to be fully formed, they just need to give you a starting point when you sit down so you’re not starting from scratch.</p>
<p>I take notes using <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> on my phone or desktop. You might choose an app or pen and paper. The important part is that you write them down and remember them when the time comes.</p>
<img src="https://bdickason.com/static/posts/unlock-creative-strategic-thinking/post-outline.png">
<p>Here’s an example of my starting point for this post.</p>
<p><strong>You don’t have to start at the beginning</strong> - My best strategy work happens when I start in the middle. Creative thinking is unstructured by nature and you want to let your creative faucet flow. Trying to force yourself to follow a structure will only cause you to get stuck on a specific section. <em>“Start writing wherever you can start.</em> <em>Start writing wherever you feel comfortable”</em> (<a href="https://www.dailywritingtips.com/break-writers-block-dont-begin-at-the-beginning/">Daily Writing Tips</a>).</p>
<p>Think of creative mode like a fitted sheet, you put one corner on, then the other, then go back and adjust the first corner. If words come to you, write them down. If two thoughts seem linked, write both and draw a line to connect them. Let the ideas flow in any order they come. Over time, your brain will connect them.</p>
<p><strong>Leave yourself breadcrumbs -</strong> Remember, each time you enter creative mode, your brain has to boot up your whole project in your head. You can help your future self by leaving notes about what you plan to do next. “<em>Unfortunately, most writers get right in their cars and drive away. But the great ones capture the view.”</em> (<a href="https://perell.com/note/leave-a-summary-for-yourself/">Leave a Summary for Yourself by David Perell</a>) This could be a short outline at the top of the document or notes peppered throughout. Keep track of what ideas you were excited about so you don’t have to analyze the entire strategy or vision. For example, for this post I left …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Around Christmas, the React team introduced <a href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/12/21/data-fetching-with-react-server-components.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">React Server Components</a>. It’s a complete surprise for the React ecosystem as React has always focused on the client-side with a small focus on server-side rendering. Server-side rendering can, for instance, be accomplished using Next.js. </p><p>However, with React Server Components (RSC), it’s now possible to write server-rendered code using React only. Note that RSC is not a final feature as of now. Currently, React Server Components are undergoing beta-testing.</p><p>In this article, you’ll learn the following concepts about React Server Components:</p><ol><li>What is a React Server Component?</li><li>Why do we need React Server Components? What problems do they solve?</li><li>What does a React Server Component look like, and what are the benefits?</li><li>What’s the difference between React Server Components and Server Side Rendering (SSR)?</li><li>Is there any future for React Server Components?</li></ol><h2 id="what-is-a-react-server-component">What is a React Server Component?</h2><p>Let’s make this clear first: React always renders React Server Components on the server. It allows frontend developers to create components that span both server and client. </p><p>Why is this useful? This property allows developers to quickly fetch data from external sources Therefore, you don’t have to send an expensive request from your client to your database (for example) to fetch data. As you render your components on the server that also hosts your backend, you can make a local call to your API to fetch data. In other words, locally fetched data is super fast (cheap).</p><p>To summarize, React Server Components allow you to access the speed of fetching data on the server-side while maintaining its rich interactivity of client-side apps. That’s a fantastic improvement for the React ecosystem to build faster applications.</p><h2 id="why-do-we-need-react-server-components">Why do we need React Server Components?</h2><p>UI development needs to offer the following properties:</p><ol><li>It should offer a good user experience</li><li>It should be cheap to maintain</li><li>It should offer fast performance</li></ol><p>However, these properties are at odds with each other.

React won’t include a dependency that you use only in a React Server Component in the bundle size. Therefore, the user won’t have to download this dependency. The RSC will use this dependency on the server to render the required output and send this output to the client. Cool, right?</p><h2 id="whats-the-difference-between-react-server-components-and-server-side-rendering-ssr">What’s the difference between React Server Components and Server Side Rendering (SSR)?</h2><p>Server-side rendering focuses on reducing the initial page load. When using SSR, you send HTML to the client. The client then loads all of the React JavaScript you need to make your web page interactive. In other words, you have a traditional React app after the initial page load when React injects all JavaScript. </p><p>The most significant difference is that your components are still client-side components. All required dependencies are still downloaded. The only difference when using SSR is that your initial page load contains only HTML to improve performance.</p><h2 id="is-there-any-future-for-react-server-components">Is there any future for React Server Components?</h2><p>There’s a massive potential for React Server Components as they address many tradeoffs React developers experience. Some of the most important benefits include:</p><ul><li>Fast data fetching locally on a server</li><li>Server-side dynamic logic</li><li>Ability to include any dependency for RSCs without having to worry about increasing the cost to load a web page</li></ul><p>On the other hand, many React users might get confused at first by this domain switch. React has shown a strong focus on the client-side in the past. React Server Components suddenly span both server and client. This change requires a significant shift in the way we think about React components. </p><p>For that reason, I expect React developers to embrace this approach but also to see many people struggle to grasp this concept and make correct decisions about server/client-side components.</p><p>If you want to play around with the demo code for React Server Components, you can find this code on <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/server-components-demo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub</a>.</p><h2 id="monitor-bad-and-slow-requests-in-production">Monitor bad and slow requests in production</h2><p>While RSC will let you work seemlessly with back-end and front-end requests, debugging data fetching requests and responses in production may be challenging and time consuming.

Yet, it presents a risk that is growing with the increase of AI adoption rate.</p>
<p>In this post I’ll go over the main concepts to understand this subject:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Why</strong> do we need to care about the security of ML systems ?</li>
<li><strong>What</strong> are the vulnerabilities of ML systems ?</li>
<li><strong>How</strong> can we secure ML Systems ?</li>
</ol>
<h2>Why should we care ?</h2>
<p>Machine Learning models are more and more integrated in sensitive decision-making systems such as autonomous vehicles, health diagnosis, credit scoring, recruitment, etc. Some models can be trained on personal data like private emails, photos and messages from social media.</p>
<p>Machine learning models are complex software components and can be compromised. Vulnerable systems can lead to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data extraction:</strong> the exposure of sensitive information or specific details included in the data used for training the models.</li>
<li><strong>Model extraction:</strong> copying a model by stealing the internal parameters and hyperparameters.</li>
<li><strong>Model tricking:</strong> fooling the model by manipulating the inputs, leading to erroneous decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Model corruption:</strong> methods that perturb the inner functioning of the model to generate corrupted outputs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What are the threats ?</h2>
<p>Here is a list of some vulnerabilities from which ML models suffer, this is a non-exhaustive list:</p>

<h3>Data extraction</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Unintended Memorization</strong></p>
<p>Deep learning models and in particular generative models suffer from unintended memorization<sup>1</sup>, they can memorize rare details from the training data. Using only inferences from the model, it is possible to extract sensitive information from the training dataset.</p>
<p>This method was used to extract credit card details and social security numbers from Gmail’s Smart Compose feature that helps you to write emails faster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Membership Inference</strong></p>
<p>Using this technique an attacker can infer whether a new data record is included in the training dataset or not.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Model extraction</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Model Stealing</strong></p>
<p>Using these methods and by querying models (with predictions APIs), it is possible to extract an equivalent ML model. These attacks are successful against a wide variety of model types: logistic regressions, decision trees, SVMs and deep neural networks.</p>
<p>A set of model extraction attacks were used to steal model types and parameters from public machine learning services such as BigML and Amazon Machine Learning in 2016 <sup>2</sup>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Model tricking</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Adversarial attacks</strong></p>
<p>Adversarial attack is maybe one of the most known attacks on deep neural networks since it has been widely mediatized. It works by providing deceptive input at inference time. It’s a powerful method because the noise added to the input can be imperceptible and it does not depend on the architecture of the attacked model.</p>
<p>In the following example <sup>3</sup>, the model is tricked to classify the image as “guacamole”.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Model corruption</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Poisoning</strong></p>
<p>Training data often include information harvested by automated scrapers or from unverified sources on the web, this is a vulnerability that can be exploited to tamper with models.</p>
<p>For example, data poisoning was used to generate undetectable spam messages <sup>4</sup>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Backdoor attacks</strong></p>
<p>These methods work by injecting a trojan in the training data or in a pre-trained model that is activated by a trigger at inference time to make the model output a specific result. It is model-agnostic.</p>
<p>In this example the trigger is a small square patch or sticker that is used to flip the identification of the stop sign <sup>5</sup>.</p>
<p><span>

    </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Attacks on Transfer Learning</strong></p>
<p>If a pre-trained model is corrupted with data poisoning or a backdoor attack, it is likely that a new model that is trained using the corrupted model as a starting point will be corrupted as well.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Federated Learning</strong>, considering its distributed nature, can be even more exposed to Model corruption through training data manipulation as we can assume that an ML hacker has a full control of part of the training samples and labels. Federated learning can also be subject to data extraction attacks through the leakage of gradients shared between the workers and/or the server <sup>6</sup>.</p>
<h2>How can we secure models ?</h2>
<p>Machine Learning security is an active research area, and since we are dealing with computer systems we cannot have a 100% secure system. Some of the defense mechanisms that exist are only experimentally validated, so we have to be aware that they can be broken.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Differential Privacy</strong></p>
<p>Differential Privacy can be used against data extraction attacks. The aim of this technique, applied during the training of the model, is to approach similar outputs when the training is done with the sensitive data or without it. It tries to ensures that the model does not rely too much on individual samples <sup>1</sup>. In practice, that comes at the expense of accuracy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Homomorphic encryption</strong></p>
<p>Homomorphic encryption is an encryption method that enables computations on encrypted data directly. It ensures that the decrypted result is the same as if the computation had been done on unencrypted inputs. In a simplified way, for an encryption function <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="script">E</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathcal{E}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>:</p>

<p>It is one of the defense mechanisms used in Federated learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Randomization methods</strong></p>
<p>The goal of these techniques is to protect Deep Neural Networks models against perturbations by adding randomness to test points and using the fact that Deep Neural Networks are robust to random perturbations. A random input transformation can help mitigate adversarial effects. Random smoothing technique is used to perturb backdoor attack triggers <sup>7</sup>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Input Preprocessing</strong></p>
<p>Input preprocessing can be used against backdoor attacks or adversarial attacks, by modifying the model input during training or testing. Autoencoders can be used to clean the input. An imperfect reconstruction can make the model unable to recognize triggers <sup>7</sup>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adversarial training</strong></p>
<p>In this method, we train the model by adding adversarial samples in the training data to improve its robustness against adversarial attacks <sup>8</sup>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Machine Learning systems are complex software systems where software code and data are interlaced, so they do not only face computer security risks but also data threats. Data Scientists and ML Engineers need to be aware of these risks when they design their Machine Learning systems.</p>

There are many of these ...if you have a moment, take your pick! Some
of these would make good projects, or would be a way your organization
could contribute to the building of the web.<p>
There are also special lists of little things to do for each existing
project such as the <a name="1" href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/LineMode/Defaults/Bugs.html">line mode browser</a> , the <a name="2" href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/NeXT/Implementation/Bugs.html">NeXT browser</a> , the common<a name="5" href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Library/Bugs.html">
library</a> , and the <a name="3" href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/Bugs.html">server</a> .
</p><h2>Client side</h2>
<dl>
<dt>More clients
</dt><dd> Clients exist for many platforms, but not all. Editors
only exist on the NeXT, but will be really useful for sourcing info
and group work. (Group editor?)
</dd><dt>Search engines
</dt><dd> Now the web of data and indexes exists, some really
smart intelligent algorithms ("knowbots?") could run on it.  Recursive
index and link tracing, Just think...
</dd><dt>Text from hypertext
</dt><dd> We need a quick way to print a book from the web.
(A simple method using TeX exists)
</dd></dl>

<h2>Server side</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Server upgrade
</dt><dd> Easier to install, port.  Export directories as hypertext.
Run shell scripts embedded in the directory for virtual documents
and searches.
</dd><dt>More Servers
</dt><dd> See the <a name="4" href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/DataSources/Overview.html">list</a> of things we have thought of or been pointed
to.
</dd><dt>WAIS integration
</dt><dd> WAIS protocol extensions to allow hypertext; HTML
data type, docids to be conforming UDIs. Integrate WAIS in client
too.
</dd><dt>Integrate client and server
</dt><dd> A client which generates HTML becomes
a general purpose gateway. Especially useful for sites where general
access to news, external internet, etc, is limited.
</dd></dl>

<h2>Other software</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Gateways
</dt><dd> JANET and DECnet for example. Real need.
</dd><dt>HTTP enhancements
</dt><dd> Format conversion, authorization, better logging
information for statistics.
</dd><dt>Mail manager
</dt><dd> A hypertext view of a mail archive with lists of messages
by author, topic, with links between messages. A friendly face on
a mail archive would be a great project management tool.
</dd><dt>HTTP enhancements
</dt><dd> Format conversion, authorization, better logging
information for statistics.
</dd><dt>Form processing
</dt><dd> If you can edit hypertext, you edit a hypertext form
and return it.   To be able to submit a form back to the server would
allow  special search patterns, administrative processing, electronic
voting, ...
</dd><dt>Graphic overview
</dt><dd> Display the web from any document in a graphical
form.
</dd></dl>

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Tutorials
</dt><dd> Hypertext leading a new or prospective user through W3.
</dd><dt>Canned demos
</dt><dd> A hypertext path through some good represenattive places
to visit. Maybe a script to make a timed presentation (with sound?).
</dd><dt> Videos
</dt><dd> Would save us giving so many talks!
</dd><dt>Policy documents
</dt><dd>Statements on NIR: collect from institutes, provide
background for organizations making NIR policy decisions.

<p>Calculating prime numbers in a range is another comparison in programming languages. In this article, we compared the speed of codes to find Prime Number functions in C++ and Python</p>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Prime numbers are an interesting area to research. A&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>prime number</strong></a>, it is also called&nbsp;<strong>prime</strong>&nbsp;shortly, is a natural number (a positive integer) greater than one that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. If a number is not prime then it is called a&nbsp;<strong>composed number</strong>. There are several mathematical questions regarding prime numbers that are still unsolved. Finding them and relations and their effects on some other functions, graphics really interesting in mathematical phenomena.</p>
<p>In the programming world today,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Python</a>&nbsp;is very popular and easy to use. It makes popular because of supports from big companies (i.e. Google) and its successful libraries and frameworks on AI Technology. It is a great object-oriented, interpreted, and interactive programming language. It is often compared with C/C++, Delphi, Lisp, Tcl, Perl, Ruby, C#, Visual Basic, Visual Fox Pro, Scheme, or Java. Python has very clear syntax and it has some practical things. It has modules, classes, exceptions, very high-level dynamic data types, and dynamic typing. There are interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems. New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++. Python is also usable as an extension language for other applications written in other languages that need easy-to-use. Python is free to use and more information can be found from their official web page&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.python.org/</a></p>
<p>C and C++ are the fastest and one of the most powerful programming languages and it is easy to calculate prime numbers as fast as possible. In these tests we will use&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder" rel="noreferrer noopener">C++ Builder</a>&nbsp;which has a great IDE, includes compilers for Win32, Win64, Android, and iOS. C++Builder has both CLANG Enhanced C/C++ Compiler and Embarcadero’s new Bcc C/C++ Compiler. It also features a modern, high-productivity RAD Studio IDE, debugger tools, and enterprise connectivity to accelerate cross-platform UI development. You can develop GUI based applications easily, as it comes with the award-winning VCL framework for high-performance native Windows apps and the powerful FireMonkey (FMX) framework for cross-platform UIs. There is a free C++ Builder Community Edition that can be used by students, beginners, and startups with limitations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can download the free C++ Builder Community Edition here:&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder/starter" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder/starter</a>. Professional developers can use the Professional, Architect, or Enterprise versions of C++ Builder. Please visit&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder</a>.</p>
<p>Python can be used inside Delphi projects and this prime number function is tested before in Delphi and in Python here&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCz5h96ObUM" data-rel="lightbox-video-0" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCz5h96ObUM</a>&nbsp;with Kiriakos Vlahos. Here, we were inspired by this video and we try to do the same tests on the same function in C++. Finding Prime Numbers in C++ is explained in detailed well in this&nbsp;<strong>Easily Learn To Find Prime Numbers In Modern C++</strong>&nbsp;post&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://learncplusplus.org/easily-learn-to-find-prime-numbers-in-modern-c/" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here, we compared the speed of Prime Number functions in C++ Builder 10.4 and Python 3.9.1.</p>

<p>In these counting prime numbers tests we also found that Python 3.9.1 version looks faster than 3.7.9 version which comes with current Spyder editor. It is obvious that 64bits test doubles 32bits test in speed.</p>
<p>We also tested counting prime numbers with same procedures in C++ Builder with system information in <a href="https://learncplusplus.org/interesting-c-builder-compiler-counting-prime-number-benchmarks/">our post here</a> before. Here are some of results.</p>

<p>These tables above show that calculating the number of prime numbers in 32bits takes 0.494 seconds in C++ Builder (including with Modern FMX GUIs) and Python 3.9.1 is doing the same operation in 8.770 seconds In this test, in comparison C++ Builder is&nbsp;<strong>17.8 times faster in 32bits</strong>&nbsp;and calculating number of prime numbers in 64bits takes 0.350 seconds in C++ Builder (including with Modern FMX GUIs) and Python 3.9.1 is doing the same operation in 3.298 seconds that means C++ Builder is&nbsp;<strong>9.4 times faster in 64bits</strong>. Note that we made the same tests before with&nbsp;<strong>GNUC/C++</strong>&nbsp;on the same system and we post it&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://learncplusplus.org/quickly-learn-to-count-prime-numbers-in-gnu-c-on-windows/" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://learncplusplus.org/learn-to-count-prime-numbers-in-visual-studio-code-c/" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<strong>VSCode</strong>&nbsp;before, and we did the same tests on the latest Dev-C++ and results can be found&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://learncplusplus.org/dev-c-tutorial-easily-learn-to-count-prime-numbers-on-windows/" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. All C++ tests are runs with about the same scores in different compilers on the same system given above.</p>
<p>We also found that Python 3.7.9 comes with Spyder is slower than 3.9.1 in our tests. Here is a table in comparison with C++ Builder below.</p>

<h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, on the same PC System, our tests show that C++ ( C++ Builder BCC &amp; CLANG, GNU C/C++, Dev C++, VS Code) is about 9.4 times faster than Python on counting prime numbers in 64 bits and about 17.8 times faster in 32 bits. The calculating number of prime numbers is good to use some basic logical operations and mathematical functions. The procedure includes logical if() clauses, for() loops, some mathematical procedures (floor, sqrt etc.), that show C++ is very fast in mathematical operations. These kinds of tests can be done in different operations to compare languages.</p>
<p>Note that all tests were done on a single core/thread test. C++ Builder is capable to do Threads and easy to use Parallel algorithms for multi-thread operations. It shows that threaded tests are much faster, depends on the number of cores/threads.</p>
<p>Actually, results were obvious because of Python is an interpreted programming language with some benefits while C/C++ is a non-interpreted (compiled) programing language. Here C++ proofs that still it is very fast to do mathematical operations in comparison with Python. These kinds of tests can be done on many mathematical operations and on other codes. Speed changes may improve analyzes and other operations (i.e face detection, image processing, or other AI technologies). If your applications are built with C++ they will have faster operations in each task. On the other side, Python has some advantages in coding, easy to code, well on AI technologies with some TensorFlow, Keras frameworks. Users should define their priorities before coding an application and they should choose their programming language for their projects.</p>
<p>Please keep following our next posts on these tests.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>Today we're releasing Hazelcast Jet 4.4 and we have some exciting new
features!</p>
<h2>Jet SQL</h2>
<p>Hazelcast Jet 4.4 brings you the first beta version of our SQL
interface. You can now log into Jet from the command line and issue
queries against the data sources you specify. They can be both data at
rest (<em>batch</em> sources) and live feeds (<em>streaming</em> sources).</p>
<p>If you have Docker at hand, here's something you can try out right now!
(For examples that don't require Docker, go to the
<a href="https://jet-start.sh/docs/sql/intro">docs</a>.)</p>
<pre><code>docker pull hazelcast/hazelcast-jet
docker network create jet-network
docker run --name jet --network jet-network -v <span>"<span>$(pwd)</span>"</span>:/csv-dir --rm hazelcast/hazelcast-jet
</code></pre>
<p>Wait for a message like this in the output:</p>
<pre><code>2021-01-15 17:50:18,645 [ INFO] [main] [c.h.c.LifecycleService]:
    [172.17.0.2]:5701 is STARTED
</code></pre>
<p>Now start another terminal window and enter the SQL shell:</p>
<pre><code>$ docker run --network jet-network -it --rm hazelcast/hazelcast-jet jet --targets jet sql
Connected to Hazelcast Jet 4.4 at [172.17.0.2]:5701 (+0 more)
Type 'help' for instructions
sql〉
</code></pre>
<p>You are now ready to write some SQL. Try these:</p>
<pre><code>sql〉 <span>SELECT</span> * <span>FROM</span> <span>TABLE</span>(generate_series(<span>1</span>,<span>3</span>));
+
|           v|
+
|           1|
|           2|
|           3|
+
3 row(s) selected
sql〉 <span>SELECT</span> <span>key</span>, <span>sum</span>(<span>key</span>) <span>as</span> total <span>FROM</span> (
          <span>SELECT</span> v/<span>2</span> <span>as</span> <span>key</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>TABLE</span>(generate_series(<span>0</span>, <span>7</span>))
      ) <span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> <span>key</span>;
+
|                 key|               total|
+
|                   0|                   0|
|                   1|                   2|
|                   2|                   4|
|                   3|                   6|
+
4 row(s) selected
</code></pre>
<p>Here are two more examples with streaming SQL. Streaming queries never
complete, so use <code>Ctrl+C</code> to cancel them after a while:</p>
<pre><code>sql〉 <span>SELECT</span> * <span>FROM</span> <span>TABLE</span>(generate_stream(<span>10</span>));
+
|                   v|
+
|                   0|
|                   1|
|                   2|
^C
Query cancelled.
sql〉 <span>SELECT</span> * <span>FROM</span> <span>TABLE</span>(generate_stream(<span>100</span>)) <span>WHERE</span> v / <span>10</span> * <span>10</span> = v;
+
|                   v|
+
|                   0|
|                  10|
|                  20|
^C
Query cancelled.
sql〉
</code></pre>
<p>For more examples with CSV files, Kafka and IMap, go to the
<a href="https://jet-start.sh/docs/sql/intro">docs</a>.</p>
<p>We're currently very focused on bringing more features to our SQL, so
stay tuned!</p>
<h2>File Connector</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://jet-start.sh/docs/api/sources-sinks">Unified File Connector API</a> gives you a
simple way to read files, unified across different storage systems.
Using the same API you can read files from the local filesystem, Hadoop
FS, Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage. At the same
time, the connector supports a variety of encoding formats: text files,
CSV, JSON, Avro, etc., equally for all storage systems.</p>
<p>Here's how the Java syntax looks:</p>
<pre><code><span>BatchSource</span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>&gt;</span></span> source <span>=</span> <span>FileSources</span>
    <span>.</span><span>files</span><span>(</span><span>"/path/to/my/directory"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>build</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>You specify the storage system type with the URI schema, for example to
access S3:</p>
<pre><code><span>BatchSource</span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>&gt;</span></span> source <span>=</span> <span>FileSources</span>
    <span>.</span><span>files</span><span>(</span><span>"s3a://bucket-id/path/to/my/directory"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>build</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>And this is how you tell it to use the Avro encoding:</p>
<pre><code><span>BatchSource</span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>User</span><span>&gt;</span></span> source <span>=</span> <span>FileSources</span>
    <span>.</span><span>files</span><span>(</span><span>"s3a://bucket-id/path/to/my/directory"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>FileFormat</span><span>.</span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>User</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>avro</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>build</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>

<h2>Kinesis Connector</h2>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-streams/">Amazon Kinesis Data
Streams</a> (KDS) is a
durable, scalable real-time data streaming service native to the AWS
environment, and fully managed by it. You can use it as both a source
and a sink in a Hazelcast Jet pipeline:</p>
<pre><code><span>StreamSource</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Map<span>.</span>Entry</span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>,</span> <span>byte</span><span>[</span><span>]</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span> source <span>=</span> <span>KinesisSources</span>

<h2>Enforce Strict Event Order</h2>
<p>Hazelcast Jet's primary focus is to leverage all opportunities to
improve the throughput and latency of its computation. One example is
using logic that isn't sensitive to the exact event order. Jet can use
this freedom to optimally load-balance the data across parallel tasks.
This works great for stateless transforms like <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code> as
well as aggregate operations specifically written in terms of
commutative and associative functions. However, Jet also supports
transforms such as <code>mapStateful</code>, where reordering any two events is
likely to result in different output.</p>
<p>In version 4.4 we provide a new option,
<code>pipeline.setPreserveOrder(true)</code>, which tells Jet to disable the
dataflow optimizations that result in reordered events. One consequence
of enabling it is that the level of parallelism in the source stage
determines the parallelism of all the subsequent stages because the data
flows in parallel lanes through the pipeline. So if you have a source
that isn't paralellized, your whole pipeline won't be parallelized
either (at least until a stage that explicitly changes the order, such
as <code>rebalance</code> or <code>groupingKey</code>). This feature works best when you have
a partitioned source and you only require strict order among events with
the same key. Then you get both the ordering you need and decent
parallelization.</p>
<h2>Improved Packaging</h2>
<p>We used to offer Jet packaged with some hand-picked extensions while you
could add others by downloading them separately. As of 4.4 we offer two
kinds: a full package with all the extensions, and a slim one with none.
Normally you want to use the full package, but if you want to optimize
the download size or disk usage, use the slim package.</p>
<p>Along the same lines, we now provide a slim Docker image,
<code>hazelcast/hazelcast-jet:4.4-slim</code>, to serve as the base image in your
Dockerfile that combines it with the extensions, like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>FROM</span> hazelcast-jet:<span>4.4</span>-slim
<span>ARG</span> JET_HOME=/opt/hazelcast-jet
<span>ARG</span> REPO_URL=https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/hazelcast/jet
<span>ADD</span><span> <span>$REPO_URL</span>/hazelcast-jet-kafka/4.4/hazelcast-jet-kafka-4.4-jar-with-dependencies.jar <span>$JET_HOME</span>/lib/</span>

</code></pre>
<p>See the
<a href="https://jet-start.sh/docs/operations/docker#build-a-custom-image-from-the-slim-image">instructions</a>
in our docs for more details.</p>
<h2>Full Release Notes</h2>
<p>Hazelcast Jet 4.4 is based on IMDG version 4.1.1. Check out its Release
Notes <a href="https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/rn/index.html#4-1-1">here</a> and,
for the Enterprise Edition,
<a href="https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/ern/index.html#4-1-1">here</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you for your valuable contributions!</p>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>[sql] SQL Beta: submit jobs to Jet from the command-line SQL shell.
(#2595, #2636, #2648, #2654, #2665, #2729, #2763, #2788)</p></li>
<li><p>[file-api] [017] Unified API to create sources and sinks from
file-like resources: local filesystem, Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage
and Data Lake Storage, Google Cloud Storage (#2518)</p></li>
<li><p>[kinesis] [018] Amazon Kinesis connector (#2656)</p></li>
<li><p>[pipeline-api] [016] Prevent event reordering: by default Jet reorders
data for performance, now you can disable this to get strict event
order where you need it.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Enhancements</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>[connectors] @hhromic improved the naming of source and sink stages
across different connectors, bringing them all in line with the same
convention <code>xSource</code> / <code>xSink</code> (#2685)</p></li>
<li><p>[pipeline-api] @TomaszGaweda added the <code>pipeline.isEmpty()</code> method
that tells whether it contains any stage (#2659)</p></li>
<li><p>[core] @TomaszGaweda added the
<code>jet.imdg.version.mismatch.check.disabled</code> config property that
disables the enforcement of the exact IMDG dependency version. This
allows adding IMDG quick fixes to the existing Jet release. (#2610)</p></li>
<li><p>[core] New packaging: download either the full package with all the
extensions enabled, or the minimal package and separately download the
extensions you want. (#2796)</p></li>
<li><p>[cli] Improved the behavior of <code>jet submit</code>: now it waits for the job
to start and prints a message about it. (#2699)</p></li>
<li><p>[python] Improved the error message when using a Python function but
Python is not installed. (#2672)</p></li>
<li><p>[kafka] Improved the performance of the Kafka source by fine-tuning
some timeouts. (#2732)</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>[core] Fixed a problem where Jet would close <code>System.out</code> during JVM
shutdown, preventing shutdown hooks from printing to stdout. (#2649)</p></li>
<li><p>[file-connector] Fixed the blocking File connector declaring its
processors as cooperative, resulting in performance loss. (#2628)</p></li>
<li><p>[file-connector] Several bug fixes in the File connector. (#2772)</p></li>
<li><p>[core] Fixed a leak caused by Jet's ephemeral loggers created for each
job. They didn't get released from internal maps in the logging
framework. (#2737)</p></li>
<li><p>[core] Fixed two problems with the <code>peek</code> transform. (#2740, #2765)</p></li>
<li><p>[hadoop] Fixed a problem when using Hadoop for local files, it behaved
as if the files were shared. (#2764)</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Breaking Changes</h3>
<p>None.</p>

<div data-id="de68357" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">

</div>
<div data-id="e2cc62c" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">

<p>One thing is certain: Robinhood were scrambling to react to these spontaneous decisions, and the execution was poor.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div data-id="897910b" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
<div>
<p>But the rush to push changes is not a valid excuse for a poor experience. In fact, it just fuelled the fire—probably contributing to the hundreds of thousands of 1-star ratings on the app stores, and Robinhood trending on Twitter.</p>

<div data-id="90aebad" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
<div>
<p>So let’s summarise the key points here:</p>
</div>
</div>
<div data-id="70f3e6c" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
<div>
<p><strong>1: Context matters —</strong> take those extra few minutes to explain to your users <em>why</em> you’ve made a difficult decision.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div data-id="7de0215" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
<div>
<p><strong>2: Remove ambiguity&nbsp; —</strong> give people realistic expectations for when certain restrictions will be lifted, and what they can do in the meantime.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div data-id="f11d414" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
<div>
<p><strong>3: Show empathy&nbsp; —</strong> apologising isn’t enough, you need to demonstrate that you understand why your users will be suffering, and how hard it is for them.</p>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><em>An article about the new <a href="https://wiki.dlang.org/LDC-specific_language_changes#.40.28ldc.attributes.fastmath.29"><code>@fastmath</code></a> and <a href="https://wiki.dlang.org/LDC-specific_language_changes#Traits"><code>__traits(target*)</code></a> features in LDC 1.1.0. The <code>@fastmath</code> attribute relaxes floating point math constraints and is used by <a href="https://github.com/libmir/mir">Mir</a> to <a href="http://blog.mir.dlang.io/glas/benchmark/openblas/2016/09/23/glas-gemm-benchmark.html">beat OpenBLAS and Eigen</a>.</em><br>
<em>To avoid confusion: <a href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> is doing the interesting work, LDC just adds a few pieces that allow LLVM to work its magic.</em><br>
<em>I’m afraid it won’t be a nice read if you are unfamiliar with some of peculiarities of the CPU’s <a href="http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/floating_point/understanding_floating_point_representation.html">floating point</a> math, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language#Syntax">x86 assembly</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD">SIMD</a>.</em></p>



<p>The available SIMD parallelism in the CPU is very powerful: with the <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2013/avx-512-instructions">AVX512 instruction set</a>, the CPU packs 16 (!) 32-bit floats in one register and can do a SIMD multiplication-addition twice (!) per clock cycle. So programming for performance boils down to writing your code such that the compiler can generate code that maximally exploits SIMD.<br>
Two weeks ago, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilya-yaroshenko-46464993">Ilya Yaroshenko</a> wrote the article <a href="http://blog.mir.dlang.io/glas/benchmark/openblas/2016/09/23/glas-gemm-benchmark.html">“Numeric age for D: Mir GLAS is faster than OpenBLAS and Eigen”</a>. The article presents performance benchmarks of his linear algebra additions to <a href="https://github.com/libmir/mir">Mir</a>, a generic numerical library written in D, demonstrating that his D code is fast and beats well-known assembly language implementations of the same functionality.<br>
For very high performance, common implementations of basic math primitive functions are written in assembly language explicitly instead of trusting the compiler to generate equally fast machine code. In contrast, Ilya writes: “Mir GLAS (Generic Linear Algebra Subprograms) has a single generic kernel for all CPU targets, all floating point types, and all complex types. It is written completely in D, without any assembler blocks.” That’s quite an achievement: carefully optimized D code that performs as fast as carefully optimized assembly code. In this article I’ll present a few (simple) additions to LDC that enable LLVM’s magical optimizer to generate such fast assembly code for Ilya’s amazing D code.</p>



<p>I’ll show assembly code snippets generated by LDC using <code>-c -output-s</code>. LDC version 1.1.0-beta2 or newer is needed. You can use the online compiler at <a href="http://ldc.acomirei.ru/">ldc.acomirei.ru</a> to look at the assembly code that LDC generates yourself, for the examples given here and for your own D code.<br>
<em>If you find that the generated assembly for your D code could be improved, submit an <a href="https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc/issues">LDC issue</a> on Github, <a href="https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc/issues/1438">like Ilya did</a>!</em></p>



<p>The CPU’s floating point math is not the same as algebraic math, because of approximation errors due to the finite storage available for a floating point number after each calculation. The calculation <code>a + (b + c)</code> may or may not be equal to <code>(a + b) + c</code>, and <code>(a + a) - a</code> may or may not be equal to <code>a</code>. With <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiply%E2%80%93accumulate_operation#Fused_multiply.E2.80.93add">fused multiply-add (FMA)</a>, <code>a * b + c</code> is not the same as, well…, <code>a * b + c</code>. This often prevents optimization of math code, unless the programmer tells the compiler that, really, it’s all the same to him.<br>
Let’s look at a basic math function and see how we can improve the compiler-generated machine code.</p>



<p>The following code calculates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product">dot-product</a> of two vectors of arbitrary length:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>double</span> <span>dot</span><span>(</span><span>double</span><span>[]</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>double</span><span>[]</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>double</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
    <span>foreach</span> <span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>i</span><span>;</span> <span>0</span> <span>..</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>s</span> <span>+=</span> <span>a</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>*</span> <span>b</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>];</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>s</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The algebraic equation for the dot product is</p>

<p>s = (a1 * b1) + (a2 * b2) + (a3 * b3) + …</p>

<p>but because of the inaccuracies of floating-point math, the D code calculation must be described as:</p>

<p>s = ((((0 + a1 * b1) + a2 * b2) + a3 * b3) + … )</p>

<p>The parens are important: they signify the order of operations, <a href="http://www.walkingrandomly.com/?p=5380">absolutely critical</a> for the outcome. From this equation, we can see that the multiplications can be done in any order and in parallel, but that the additions must be done sequentially and in a very specific order.</p>

<p>Let’s see what assembly code LDC 1.1.0 generates (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language#Syntax">AT&amp;T dialect</a>). I’ll only show the meat of the dot function, in this case the 4-fold-unrolled inner loop:</p>

<p><code>ldc2 -c -output-s -O3 -release dot.d</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code>LBB0_4:
  movsd (%rcx,%rdi,8), %xmm1
  mulsd (%rsi,%rdi,8), %xmm1
  addsd %xmm0, %xmm1
  movsd 8(%rcx,%rdi,8), %xmm0
  mulsd 8(%rsi,%rdi,8), %xmm0
  addsd %xmm1, %xmm0
  movsd 16(%rcx,%rdi,8), %xmm1
  mulsd 16(%rsi,%rdi,8), %xmm1
  addsd %xmm0, %xmm1
  movsd 24(%rcx,%rdi,8), %xmm0
  mulsd 24(%rsi,%rdi,8), %xmm0
  addsd %xmm1, %xmm0
  addq  $4, %rdi
  cmpq  %rdi, %rdx
  jne LBB0_4
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>No vectorization: it’s just sequential multiply-add-multiply-add-multiply-add-…</p>

<p>But wait, I forgot to tell the compiler that my CPU is newer than the default <code>core2</code> CPU (nota bene, at least on OS X, by default LDC compiles your code for a 10-year-old processor). In this case it doesn’t matter much:</p>

<p><code>ldc2 -c -output-s -O3 -release dot.d -mcpu=haswell</code></p>

<p>Don’t be fooled by the “v” seemingly implying “vector”. Those multiply and add instructions are mere <em>single</em> double-precision operations. The loop is unrolled 8-fold, and that’s all that changed. Without relaxing some constraints on the mathematics, it’s the best possible.</p>



<p>One performance improvement is to allow the compiler to ‘fuse’ <code>a*b+c</code> into one instruction <code>fma(a,b,c)</code>. It will change the outcome of the calculation, but for many use-cases it won’t matter. Note: the result using FMA is <em>not</em> necessarily worse than before (it may well be more accurate), it’s just <em>different</em> and that’s why the compiler can’t use FMA per default.</p>

<p>We can instruct LLVM to allow “unsafe-fp-math” transformations such as FMA using the LDC attribute <a href="https://wiki.dlang.org/LDC-specific_language_changes#.40.28ldc.attributes.llvmAttr.28.22key.22.2C_.22value.22.29.29"><code>@llvmAttr("unsafe-fp-math", "true")</code></a> (you’re not recommended to use this low-level attribute, please read on).</p>

<p>LLVM replaced the multiply and add instructions with non-vectorized fused multiply-add instructions, clearly a win. But the code is still not using the vectorized instruction set of the CPU.</p>



<p>For vectorization of our code, there is one last piece missing: telling LLVM that it’s OK to do whatever it wants with our floating point operations: e.g. the code does not have to support NaN or infinity, and it can change the order (!) of the add operations in our dot product. LLVM’s <a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#fast-math-flags">Fast Math Flags</a> are used for this, and you can apply this to all floating point operations in a function using the (low-level, not recommended) LDC attribute <code>@llvmFastMathFlag</code>. We combined <code>@llvmAttr</code> and <code>@llvmFastMathFlag</code> into the <a href="https://wiki.dlang.org/LDC-specific_language_changes#.40.28ldc.attributes.fastmath.29"><code>@fastmath</code></a> attribute.</p>

<p>I recommend the usage of <code>@fastmath</code> instead of the other two low-level attributes; it is much more resilient against LLVM changes. The burder is on LDC to make <code>@fastmath</code> work with whatever attributes LLVM will require in the future.</p>

<p>With <code>@fastmath</code> the result becomes:</p>

<p>We now have a nicely vectorized dot-product function: the <code>vfmadd132pd</code> instruction performs a vectorized fused multiply-add operation, in this case it’s the equivalent of 4 non-vectorized operations. Each loop iteration processes 32 vector elements.</p>



<p>In the examples above, the D code did not specify the target architecture: all vectorization happens automatically. All credit must go to LLVM’s amazing backend that is able to analyze and optimize the code so well. So when you’d be compiling for a new processor with wider SIMD registers, all you’d have to do is recompile for that CPU and the D code would become even faster:<br>
<code>ldc2 -c -output-s -O3 -release dot.d -mcpu=knl</code> results in <code>vfmadd231pd  (%rcx,%rdi,8), %zmm4, %zmm0</code> instructions that process 8 vector elements at a time (“knl” stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xeon_Phi#Knights_Landing">Intel’s Knights Landing</a>).<br>
If your target is an ARM processor with <a href="http://www.arm.com/products/processors/technologies/neon.php">NEON SIMD tech</a>, you’ll automatically get vectorized FMA code too:</p>

<p><code>ldc2 -c -output-s -O3 -release dot.d -mtriple=aarch64-none-linux-gnu -mattr=+neon</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code>.LBB0_5:
  ldp q2, q3, [x9, #-16]
  ldp q4, q5, [x10, #-16]

  add x10, x10, #32

  fmla  v1.2d, v5.2d, v3.2d
  cbnz  x11, .LBB0_5
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>The dot-product example above is a very simple function. For more complex algorithms, you can get better performance if you take the sizes of the CPU’s caches into account; the characteristics of the instruction and data caches are both important for performance tuning.</p>

<p>LDC 1.1.0 has <a href="https://wiki.dlang.org/LDC-specific_language_changes#Traits">two special <code>__traits</code></a> that give compile-time information about the compile target architecture: <code>__traits(targetHasFeature, "...")</code> and <code>__traits(targetCPU)</code>. For example, <code>__traits(targetHasFeature, "avx2")</code> returns true or false depending on whether the compile target supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions">AVX2</a> instructions or not.</p>

<p>Mir uses <code>__traits(targetHasFeature, "...")</code> to decide what vector types (say, a vector of 4 or 8 floats) to use in its algorithms, but I don’t know the exact how-and-why (yet? Ilya fill us in on …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>Indiana University, Fall 2020</p>

<p>High-level programming languages like Racket make it easier to program
relative to low-level languages such as x86 assembly code. But how do
high-level languages work? There’s a big gap between Racket and
machine instructions for modern computers. In this class you learn how
to translate Racket programs (a dialect of Scheme) all the way to x86
assembly language.</p>

<p>Traditionally, compiler courses teach one phase of the compiler at a
time, such as parsing, semantic analysis, and register allocation. The
problem with that approach is it is difficult to understand how the
whole compiler fits together and why each phase is designed the way it
is. Instead, each week we implement a successively larger subset of
the Racket language. The very first subset is a tiny language of
integer arithmetic, and by the time we are done the language includes
first-class functions.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> B521 or C311. Fluency in Racket is highly recommended
as students will do a lot of programming in Racket. Prior knowledge of
an assembly language helps, but is not required.</p>

<p><strong>Textbook:</strong> The notes for the course are available
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ktdw8j0adcc44r0/book.pdf?dl=1">here</a>. If
you have suggestions for improvement, please either send an email to
Jeremy or, even better, make edits to a branch of the book and perform
a pull request. The book is at the following location on github:</p>

<p><strong>Grading:</strong></p>

<p>Course grades are based on the following items. For the weighting, see
the Canvas panel on the right-hand side of this web page.  Grading
will take into account any technology problems that arrise, i.e., you
won’t fail the class because your internet went out.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Assignments</li>
  <li>Quizzes</li>
  <li>Midterm Exam (October 23, Online as a Canvas Quiz)</li>
  <li>Final Exam (December 15, Online as a Canvas Quiz)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Assignments:</strong></p>

<p>Organize into teams of 2-4 students. Assignments will be due bi-weekly
on Mondays at 11:59pm. Teams that include one or more graduate
students are required to complete the challenge exercises.</p>

<p>Assignment descriptions are posted on Canvas.
Turn in your assignments by creating a github repository and giving
access to Jeremy (jsiek) and Caner (cderici).</p>

<p>Assignments will be graded based on how many test cases they succeed on.
Partial credit will be given for each “pass” of the compiler.
Some of the tests are in the public support code (see Resources below)
and the rest of the tests will be made available on Sunday night, one
day prior to the due date. The testing will be done on the linux
machine kj.luddy.indiana.edu named
after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Johnson">Katherine
Johnson</a> of NASA
fame. The testing will include both new tests and all of the tests
from prior assignments.</p>

<p>You may request feedback on your assignments prior to the due date.
Just commit your work to github and send us email.</p>

<p>Students are responsible for understanding the entire assignment and
all of the code that their team produces. The midterm and final exam
are designed to test a student’s understanding of the assignments.</p>

<p>Students are free to discuss and get help on the assignments from
anyone or anywhere. When posting questions on Piazza, it is OK to post
your code.</p>

<p>In contrast, for quizzes and exams, students are asked to work
alone. The quizzes and exams are closed book.  We will be using
Respondus Monitor for online proctoring.</p>

<p>The Final Project is due Dec. 4 and may be turned in late up to
Dec. 11.</p>

<p><strong>Late assignment policy:</strong> Assignments may be turned in up to one
week late with a penalty of 10%.</p>

February 3, 2021 | https://blog.taiga.io/taiga6-release.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.taiga.io/taiga6-release.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><img alt="Taiga6 overview" src="https://blog.taiga.io/images/2021-01-26_whatsnewTaiga6/taiga6.jpg"></p>
<p>That's right, we, the Taiga team, felt we were at a crossroads. On one hand we had <strong>a stable and sustainable open source business</strong> that could evolve at a steady but calm pace. On the other hand, we felt <strong>we should be doubling down on our agenda</strong> towards a much better agile project management experience. The challenges were many, both technological and product driven. So far, we have tackled just a few of them and <strong>that's exactly what we're presenting today as Taiga6</strong>, our best release <strong>ever</strong> since Taiga 1.0.</p>
<h2><a id="lets-start-with-the-obvious-stuff">Let's start with the obvious stuff</a></h2>

<p>Sure, you might be as excited as us but you need <strong>to see and feel</strong> the new release. We absolutely get it! We've put together an express overview of the major changes that come with Taiga6.</p>
<h3><a id="user-interface-revamp">User Interface revamp</a></h3>

<p>Taiga's user interface has never stopped evolving but it had aged quite a bit. We're not talking just a new theme or some polishing, it's really <strong>more intuitive, slicker and faster than ever</strong>. This is still a work in progress but it's impossible not to notice the improvements. We believe this will be one of those major UI changes that will garner almost <strong>universal positive recognition</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.taiga.io/images/2021-01-26_whatsnewTaiga6/revamp.gif"><img alt="Taiga6 UI revamp example" src="https://blog.taiga.io/images/2021-01-26_whatsnewTaiga6/revamp.gif"></a>

</p><figcaption>Nice feedback, nice touches. Click to enlarge.</figcaption>
<h3><a id="swimlanes-on-kanban">Swimlanes on Kanban</a></h3>

<p>Taiga's KANBAN ranks high in flexibility and features. That's probably because we always thought KANBAN was deceptively simple and we made sure you got <strong>all its potential</strong>, not a second-class agile citizen. But... we lacked swimlanes. <strong>Swimlanes allow your team to create independent paths</strong> for your KANBAN cards and enjoy a much more powerful and flexible visual management state of things. Swimlanes can be almost anything you consider to deserve a particular space, from subteams to priorities or miniprojects. Try them out!</p>

<h3><a id="better-use-of-space">Better use of space</a></h3>

<p>Even if our screens get larger and larger and their resolutions dream of becoming 8K, we are quite <em>effective</em> at finding ways to get our digital workspace cluttered. Taiga was always weary of that annoying tendency to put on display as much as possible. What we've done is learn from user feedback, user interactions and most common behaviour pattern <strong>to redesign where things are, when they do appear and how you know they are there</strong>. <em>Lists of items</em> in particular and also <em>zoom levels</em> have been redesigned with your precious cognitive load in mind.</p>

<figcaption>Really, this is a so much better filter panel.</figcaption>

<h3><a id="taiga-resources">Taiga Resources</a></h3>

<p>We had lots of information about Taiga scattered around. We decided to inventory all that was relevant about Taiga and create a <a href="https://resources.taiga.io/">new resources centre</a> for you to be assured that either your information need is satisfied there or it's accessible through it. <strong>Nearly everything has been written again from scratch</strong>, from tutorials, critical articles on agile techniques, community contributions or FAQs.</p>

</p><figcaption>Screenshot of Taiga Resources landing page. Click to visit Taiga Resources.</figcaption>
<h3><a id="new-and-improved-text-editor">New and improved text editor</a></h3>

<p>Our dual HTML/Markdown editor was good enough for some time but it was time to acknowledge the amazing work by the great people at CKEditor. We have tweaked it a bit to address our Right-To-Left needs and also some convenient "stay on top" mode as well as keeping with the good "non-destructive mistakes" habits. Taiga's new editor will try hard <strong>to protect your half-baked changes whether your accidentally</strong> refresh page or click on cancel, hit escape, etc.</p>

</p><figcaption>Just focus on nice content...</figcaption>
<h2><a id="docker-image">Docker image</a></h2>

<p>We have back-pedalled on one of the most sacred long-standing truths here at Taiga; <em>"don't devote resources to an official on-premise/private cloud Taiga image"</em>. <strong>The response from the community was absolutely amazing</strong> providing quite a number of really great Taiga docker images and alternative deployment schemes. Eventually, we decided we should be taking a stance on the hundreds of thousands of private Taiga installations out there and <strong>provide an <a href="https://github.com/taigaio/docker-taiga">official Taiga docker image</a></strong>. Depending on its success and acceptance, we hope to expand to other ways for deploying Taiga.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/taigaio/docker-taiga"><img alt="Taiga6 editor" src="https://blog.taiga.io/images/2021-01-26_whatsnewTaiga6/docker.jpg"></a>

<h2><a id="what-to-expect">What to expect from Taiga in 2021</a></h2>

<p><strong>Short answer</strong>: A lot. <strong>Long answer</strong>: We want to go from the best open source agile project management platform to become one of the best project management platforms out there. We started this journey a few years ago and we are far from done. We want to do comprehensive under-the-hood tech overhaul as well as starting adding new project modules and really innovative features while we make sure to protect the key Taiga differentiators; <strong>ease of use, flexibility and straightforward agile for cross-domain teams</strong>.</p>
<p>Also, <strong>we developed Penpot</strong>, the first open source design and prototyping platform, <a href="https://penpot.app/">check it out</a>!</p>

<p>Welcome to Fluxtion streaming and thanks for coming, hope you enjoy exploring :)</p>

<p>Fluxtion is a java utility that builds embeddable, reactive complex event processors. 
The streaming api uses a functional programming style to define business logic. Write simple clean Java code 
to create real-time applications. All the complex heavy lifting is taken care of by Fluxtion, 
programs are quick to build, test, deploy and debug.</p>

<p>Fluxtion focuses on the processing logic of event streams, independent of messaging system. Areas of good fit include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Embedding real-time processing</strong> within an existing system</li>
  <li><strong>Edge processing</strong> executing on edge devices</li>
  <li><strong>No middleware vendor lock-in</strong> works with any messaging provider</li>
  <li><strong>Low latency</strong> or high performance requirements</li>
  <li><strong>Auditable systems</strong> supports ahead of time compilation</li>
</ul>

<p>Data streams can be merged, filtered, aggregated, joined, grouped and enriched. 
Windowing of data is fully supported. User functions are easily integrated to directly execute actions in addition to real-time monitoring.</p>

<p>A full set of tools for debugging, tracing, auditing and visualisation are provided to reduce development and support costs.</p>

<br/>
February 3, 2021 | https://www.wfff.info/mobile-native-vs-cross-platform | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.wfff.info/mobile-native-vs-cross-platform">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="comp-kknyjvzi" data-testid="richTextElement"><p><span>Recently I was asked this question and it got me thinking. This article is still an ongoing piece of work so any comments and suggestions are welcome.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>I have worked in the last 10 years as an iOS native developer. I’ve had to manage my own memory in Objective-C with [retain] and [release] and got to work with Swift 5 and Autolayout. I also dipped my toes into Android, React Native, Ionic and have previously worked with C++, .net, J2ME and others.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>Hence from my experience these are some types of companies that would benefit from doing things all native (iOS, Android or both):&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;1. Companies that already started with native apps a long time before and already have a significant codebase in native.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Companies for whom money is not a problem, but quality and performance is very important. They want the best there is and have no problem paying for that. Usually these are already large companies with a lot of sales and that have an important brand to protect. Ex: Banks, Automotive, Telecoms, Airlines, Electronics etc..</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;3. Companies that require a project that heavily uses some features close to the operating system. Examples: heavy use of video, or graphics, some types of games, fitness trackers or other apps that make constant use of sensors and run in the background. They also need to be the first that take advantage of a new feature in the OS.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;4. Companies that require a large and complex project. If you have a project with a complex UI and with many features. &nbsp;Often these are companies that already have a cross-platform project but it has become so large that it is getting difficult to maintain and might already have performance issues that are causing a bad user experience. They already are paying for a team of developers to maintain the app so there won’t be much of an economy if switching to native.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;5. Companies whose core service is through an app. Examples: Uber, Revolut, etc.. These are companies who cannot risk the app being broken or taken offline because of a change in the framework they are using. Moreover they require the app to work flawlessly, and be so good as to be featured in the AppStore or Google Play. Being in the top 5 apps is almost a requirement. Therefore it’s better to use the native tools that are guaranteed to be supported and that allow for a great user experience.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;6. For startups that need an MVP I would recommend starting with a native app in only one platform Android or iOS, whichever is closer to their potential customers. After you test it in the real world and have gone through several iterations of build+validation and started to have traction and funding, you can now invest in a second app for the other platform, having the advantage that you already have the first. Going native will allow you to iterate faster because the development process is making use of better tools and better support. Otherwise if you would start with a cross-platform solution you will find at some point that it doesn’t scale, or it has become too buggy and unstable to support different UIs (iPhone, iPad, Android, watch etc) from one codebase and that you will be forced to rebuild native anyway.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>What companies would NOT benefit from native app development vs cross-platform apps?</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; 1. Companies that already have a working mobile website and want to reuse a lot of that code then it’s probably better to go cross-platform.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Companies that have a lot of programmers and know-how in a certain technology ( ex: Javascript, Microsoft technologies) and wish to leverage that. If you have many people with experience in .net, you might want to try Xamarin. Likewise if you have many people with experience in React or other Javascript frameworks, you might want to try React Native or Ionic. This still means you occasionally will need to find someone who can work with native but those can be outside consultants and most of the codebase can be maintained by using the know-how inside the company.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;3. Internal apps that must work on many platforms and UI smoothness and beauty is not a concern, but resources in terms of people and time are.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;If you need to make an app that you don’t think will be maintained. Examples are apps for conferences or promotional campaigns that will only be used for a period of time and are afterwards useless, apps for conducting studies or surveys.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;If you have an app that should look the same way across all platforms disregarding UI guidelines. Examples: Many games are like that, made in Unity or other frameworks and have their own look and feel which is platform independent.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Frequent issues with cross-platform solutions:</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span>Memory issues when scaling the app.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>Animations and “snappiness”. Animations will not be automatically supported and actually more difficult to implement in cross-platform solutions.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>Lack of proper tools — Often, there is no debugger and no performance measurement tools.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>Uncertainty of whether that platform will still be supported in a few years. There have been cases of cross-platform tools that were either abandoned (Flash) or acquired and then axed (Parse). Even so, generally there seems to be a trend of people liking the newest cross-platform tools</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>A tendency to prefer the "new and trending" tools</span></p>
	</li>
</ul></div><div id="comp-kko39lkc" data-testid="richTextElement"><p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span><a href="https://medium.com/swlh/why-i-dont-use-cross-platform-mobile-dev-tools-ac57ddc582b0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source</a></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span>Too small community. Programmers need other programmers to learn from or use their open-source code. If there aren’t many others then you will be stuck fixing some obscure bug or having to build something from scratch for that particular platform.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>You still need access to native developers. Some parts will still have to be made native and often bugs will have to be fixed in the bridging platform. In RN there is a frequent issue of using open-source libraries that are not maintained or are buggy and some work still needs to be made on the native part to keep them up-to-date.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>Many companies that started with cross-platform tools have ultimately abandoned them: Facebook, <span><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2013/04/17/linkedin-mobile-web-breakup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a></span>, <span><a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/sunsetting-react-native-1868ba28e30a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Airbnb</a></span>, etc..&nbsp;</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>Delayed access to having the latest and greatest of what features the OS can provide. New features released on Android and iOS must be adapted in order to be available using cross-platform libraries. This means there will be an unknown delay between their official release and being able to use them in your code.</span></p>
	</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Modifying data in a class where they reside is always a good thing. The Tell Don’t Ask principle guides us on how to follow such an approach. Unfortunately, it is widespread to obtain data from object and process it inside some service or manager class. After this article, you will know how to talk with objects and process data inside them instead of pulling their logic out of objects. You will be able to test your new skill with kata exercise.</p>



<h3>Benefits of Tell Don’t Ask principle</h3>



<p>At the first glance, obeying the Tell Don’t Ask principle might look like a cosmetic change for the code. In fact, it provides a lot more than just a simpler, less coupled clean code. By following this principle, you will follow OOP with ease by:</p>



<ul><li>The localisation of information — everything related to the object will be kept in one place — its data, ways of modifying it, its flow and ways of processing it</li><li>Limited code duplication, as operations with objects data will be kept in one place. You will not have to keep an eye on DRY principle, as it will be implemented naturally</li><li>Strong <a href="https://pawelpluta.com/the-oop-has-been-explained-wrongly-to-me/">object-oriented approach</a>, with a focus on abstraction</li><li>Simplified unit tests. Instead of preparing heavy service classes to test data processing, most of your code could be tested with lightweight unit tests</li></ul>



<h2>A little bit of theory</h2>



<p>The Tell Don’t Ask is about <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TellDontAsk.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keeping the data where it belongs</a> – encapsulated inside the object. Encapsulation should prevent us from modifying object internal state without it knowing that. Modifying the object state with setter does not guarantee that, as such the object lacks abstraction. Service classes digging in objects internals are like trying to eat by putting food directly to your stomach, instead of putting the food into your mount.</p>



<p>Sample application used here will simulate a small farm, that has only a few responsibilities. The first task that it will fulfil is to water plants when they need that. The second will be gathering products from the plant, when they are ready, and the last one is to deliver packed products to the customer.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="689" src="https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled-1024x689.png" alt="Diagram showing the interaction between service and classes that are violating OOP." srcset="https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled-1024x689.png 1024w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled-300x202.png 300w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled-768x517.png 768w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled.png 1102w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Sample service managing the data kept inside the objects.</figcaption></figure>



<p>With such an approach, we do not give objects any privacy. Tearing out their internals violates OOP and complicates the service logic. Let’s think how we can refactor it to obey Tell Don’t Ask principle and achieve clean code. Try to find the logic that has been taken out of classes. Spot for the places, where some decision is made. Found it? The first step would be to tell the <code>Plant</code> to water it using some <code>WaterValve</code>, instead of service doing that.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="862" height="602" src="https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tellDontAskPlantRefactored.png" alt="Diagram showing the interaction between service and classes while using Tell Don't Ask Principle." srcset="https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tellDontAskPlantRefactored.png 862w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tellDontAskPlantRefactored-300x210.png 300w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tellDontAskPlantRefactored-768x536.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 862px) 100vw, 862px"><figcaption>Tell don’t ask principle used to refactor code to more object oriented one.</figcaption></figure>



<p>By telling the <code>Plant</code> to water it with some <code>WaterValve</code>, we encapsulated its logic inside the class. We do not need to make condition outside of the <code>Plant</code> class, which simplifies service testing by reducing the number of interactions between objects and possible execution paths. Let’s take a look into the practice.</p>



<h2>Modeling it in code</h2>



<p>Let’s look at the implementation that reflects the first diagram. It is digging deeply into objects internal, fetching plants from <code>RaisedBed</code> and getting internal properties from those plants. If that wasn’t enough, it is implementing plant-related logic, asking the plant for its values and setting new ones, depending on the <code>Plant</code> state. Service has huge knowledge about other object internals.</p>






<p>Sample service implementation that does not follow the Tell Don’t Ask principle.</p>



<p>Apart from asking for internal values, it also differentiates the logic depending on the type. Think a little bit about that, how you are going to test this solution? Are you going to check logic for every type of plant? Will you make different tests depending on plant soil moisture? What if there will be no raised bed or valve? Testing every possible path will require a lot of tests. Or, maybe you will decide risk bugs and not test everything?</p>



<h3>Getting hands dirty</h3>



<p>Consider the same service, but respecting the Tell Don’t Ask principle. Let’s literally tell the raised bed to be watered with some valve, and let it delegate this work to its plants.</p>






<p>Watering service after we applied the Tell Don’t Ask principle into it.</p>



<p>When we applied to Tell Don’t Ask principle, this service simply delegates the request to it. Its only responsibility is to orchestrate invocation and manage the repositories. Testing it will only limit to the integration with repositories, while logic that used to be in it can be checked easily with unit tests. You might struggle, where the logic is now? Take look on a part of refactored <code>RaisedBed</code>.</p>






<p>Again, using Tell Don’t Ask, we are not using the internals of <code>Plant</code> in here – we are only managing specific plant watering, but we let the plant to decide if it needs one. Again, there are not many cases to test in here, so writing unit test should be easy. Next step with this refactoring will be to include the watering logic inside the plant itself. You can consider introducing a Strategy pattern to simplify logic even more.</p>



<h2>Dealing with dependencies</h2>



<p>Sometimes, to perform an action, you will need to call another service. In our application, this is a situation when we sale products. Plants after gathering are organized into crates. Crates can be packed for the customer, and such a package can be sent to it. However, sending a package is managed by another service.</p>






<p>Service with dependent service usage without refactoring.</p>



<p>There are two most common approaches to refactor that into code obeying Tell Don’t Ask principle.</p>



<h3>Service orchestrating invocation</h3>



<p>First discussed approach relays on a service (<code>Sales</code> in this case), that has the knowledge about that when the <code>Package</code> should be sent. <code>Sales</code> service is an orchestrator for the process. In this case, we simply pass the package to delivery service so it will be processed by it.</p>






<p>Service orchestrating invocation of another service.</p>



<p>For most people, it is natural to code this way, so the benefit of this approach is the ease of understanding this solution. On the other hand, it creates a little bit of coupling between <code>Sales</code> service and a <code>Package</code> class – Sales does need to know when packaging was successful, and when it should be delivered.</p>



<h3>Disconnected Domain Model variation</h3>



<p>Disconnected Domain Model is was described in Vernon’s “Implementing Domain-Driven Design” book as a technique of injecting repositories into aggregates. Injecting repositories in every aggregate by constructor may cause problems with dependency injection mechanisms due to a large number of aggregates that should be fed with repository dependency. Instead of that, we might try to pass this dependency directly that need to use some service.</p>






<p><code>packageToDeliver.send()</code> requires <code>DeliveryService</code> to work.</p>



<p>This technique limits the knowledge of <code>Sales</code> service about <code>Package</code> class implementation, so it simplifies testing of a service. It keeps the whole logic related to <code>Package</code> inside class. On the other hand, it usually brings confusion to the developer, who is unfamiliar with it. While using this technique, carefully select services that are injected. Using those services only for invoking processing is usually not a threat, but using a value returned from injected service might lead to <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FlagArgument.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flag Argument</a> antipattern.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<p>The Tell Don’t Ask principle promotes keeping logic inside object instead of service. This increases their cohesion, making the code more maintainable and easier to test. Extracting the logic into service makes them unnecessarily big and complex. Try to speak with your objects, and tell them what to do.</p>



<h2>Code Kata</h2>



<p>If you feel, like you need some practice in adapting code according to Tell Don’t Ask principle, challenge yourself to do related <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/pawelpluta/tell-dont-ask-kata" target="_blank">Code Kata</a>. You will find the description in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/pawelpluta/tell-dont-ask-kata/blob/main/README.MD" target="_blank">Readme file</a>. Try to write as much as you can by yourself. There are some unit tests already written, but you will need much more of those. Sample solution can be found on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/pawelpluta/tell-dont-ask-kata/tree/sample-solution" target="_blank">this branch</a>, but remember, that it is just a sample, and there are multiple ways of doing it.</p>

<p>Chances are you are reading this blog post using your web browser. Chances also are your web browser has various extensions that provide additional functionality. We usually trust that the extensions installed from official browser stores are safe. But that is not always the case as we recently found.</p>



<p>This blog post brings more technical details on CacheFlow: a threat that we first <a href="https://blog.avast.com/malicious-browser-extensions-avast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> about in December 2020. We described a huge campaign composed of dozens of malicious Chrome and Edge browser extensions with more than three million installations in total. We alerted both Google and Microsoft about the presence of these malicious extensions on their respective extension stores and are happy to announce that both companies have since taken all of them down as of December 18, 2020.</p>



<p>CacheFlow was notable in particular for the way that the malicious extensions would try to hide their command and control traffic in a covert channel using the <code>Cache-Control</code> HTTP header of their analytics requests. We believe this is a new technique. In addition, it appears to us that the Google Analytics-style traffic was added not just to hide the malicious commands, but that the extension authors were also interested in the analytics requests themselves. We believe they tried to solve two problems, command and control and getting analytics information, with one solution.</p>



<p>We found that CacheFlow would carry out its attack in the following sequence:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="497" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/CacheFlow-diagram-1024x497.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/CacheFlow-diagram-1024x497.jpg 1024w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/CacheFlow-diagram-300x146.jpg 300w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/CacheFlow-diagram-768x373.jpg 768w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/CacheFlow-diagram-1536x746.jpg 1536w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/CacheFlow-diagram-2048x994.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>High-level overview of the CacheFlow malware</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Based on our telemetry, the top three countries where Avast users downloaded and installed the CacheFlow extensions were Brazil, Ukraine, and France.</p>

<p>We initially learned about this campaign by reading a <a href="https://blog.nic.cz/2020/11/19/hledani-skodliveho-kodu-mezi-doplnky/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Czech blog post by Edvard Rejthar from CZ.NIC</a>. He discovered that the Chrome extension “Video Downloader for FaceBook™” (ID <code>pfnmibjifkhhblmdmaocfohebdpfppkf</code>) was stealthily loading an obfuscated piece of JavaScript that had nothing to do with the extension’s advertised functionality. Continuing from his findings, we managed to find many other extensions that were doing the same thing. These other extensions offered various legitimate functionality, with many of them being video downloaders for popular social media platforms. After reverse engineering the obfuscated JavaScript, we found that the main malicious payload delivered by these extensions was responsible for malicious browser redirects. Not only that, but the cybercriminals were also collecting quite a lot of data about the users of the malicious extensions, such as all of their search engine queries or information about everything they clicked on.</p>



<p>The extensions exhibited quite a high level of sneakiness by employing many tricks to lower the chances of detection. First of all, they avoided infecting users who were likely to be web developers. They determined this either through the extensions the user had installed or by checking if the user accessed locally-hosted websites. Furthermore, the extensions delayed their malicious activity for at least three days after installation to avoid raising red flags early on. When the malware detected that the browser developer tools were opened, it would immediately deactivate its malicious functionality. CacheFlow also checked every Google search query and if the user was googling for one of the malware’s command and control (C&amp;C) domains, it reported this to its C&amp;C server and could deactivate itself as well.</p>



<p>According to user reviews on the Chrome Web Store, it seems that CacheFlow was active since at least October 2017. All of the stealthiness described above could explain why it stayed undetected for so long.</p>

<h2>The covert channel</h2>



<p>First, we’ll show the hidden backdoor that the extensions used to download and execute arbitrary JavaScript. Specifically, we’ll describe the backdoor from the Chrome extension “Downloader for Instagram” v5.7.3 (ID <code>olkpikmlhoaojbbmmpejnimiglejmboe</code>), but this analysis applies to the other extensions as well, since the malicious code hidden in them is very similar in functionality.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/DErNJa7s3X7-EUGOvCPpQEsJkAFH3KdRvBFxQiWH37NiSAKIUFvxmKssQ6m0i5zTskNWTeV8pfeCj7secZzSG2uckKlFTISyB4r1PwuDMYvf5CkgITiXM_V2UR3QYIZsSElCeuDm" alt=""><figcaption>“Downloader for Instagram” page on the Chrome Web Store</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>It is generally a good idea to start the analysis of unknown Chrome extensions from the <code>manifest.json</code> file. The manifest of “Downloader for Instagram” gives us some interesting pieces of information.</p>



<p>First of all, the <code>content_security_policy</code> is defined in such a way that it is possible to use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval#never_use_eval!" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">infamous</a> <code>eval</code> function to load additional JavaScript. However, looking for the string <code>eval</code> in the extension’s source code did not yield any interesting results. As we’ll show later, the extension does use the <code>eval</code> function quite a lot, but it hides its usage, so it is not immediately apparent.</p>

<p>Secondly, the extension asks for quite a lot of permissions and it is not immediately clear why these permissions would be needed to download videos from Instagram. Especially interesting is the <code>management</code> permission, which allows the extension to control other extensions. The combination of the <code>webRequest</code> and the <code>&lt;all_urls&gt;</code> permissions is also interesting. Together, these two permissions make it possible for the extension to intercept pretty much any web request coming from the browser.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/GXlvV4yTGeWbiZn6q7WjmNOfxq-jQx8pYbqFCwcgLU8Li3I_i8_YQ7C-QXdSMBm03-LaGuk-ZhkVbn15nD0UZ2a7BFYaSdFAIsXPTbGmn4rFZRXpgDn3cyBZBwS8oVq07i6NnetY" alt=""><figcaption>Permissions requested by the malicious extensions</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Finally, the manifest defines two background scripts: <code>js/jquery.js</code> and <code>js/background.js</code>. These scripts are persistent, which means that they will keep running unless the extension gets disabled.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/tflzmxXmCyqagTiUbTkHb7DfNI4It30R0hHDVjZh7WeAiV-bl4f6ve33LXphmm84N9kO_epPU1iIhI2S0vE6powG9jB5ufNMJ1ima-gEKgVyZx-_8RbfQyzCXaiPExZqMsDfpO-i" alt=""><figcaption>Background scripts declared in the <code>manifest.json</code> file</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>One of these background scripts, <code>background.js</code>, is where the suspicious <code>webRequest</code> API is used. This script accesses the HTTP response headers of all intercepted web requests and stores their values in localStorage.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/kB_RAWUKhE4467ei82a1zl_u6pXyfB5eEtzfXI_kjFMKqXSWGjk9VHbNsndNB-EesAb3yZAUFy7nGr4jQPK3Ok7BTwm9Iih-eGXzFqVV7gBiPxdBb2ZSzNAlxjzFviBWDSJOAht3" alt=""><figcaption>CacheFlow saves the values of all sufficiently long HTTP response headers into localStorage.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The content of localStorage is then read by the other persistent malicious background script: <code>jquery.js</code>. While this script appears at first glance to be the legitimate <a href="https://jquery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jQuery</a> library, some additional functions were inserted into it. One of those additional functions is misleadingly named <code>parseRelative</code>, while all it does is return the <code>window.localStorage</code> object.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TeINLg0HORJ_P0DDJbaEsBs_cz5hA2fDGSSb6orJ76THL7JKjxYj1UOj-Atkn89kjg1Zfmk6tQTL-LzlneXJh4Kj1MizzyCDh66jonO8tMc3EL-sNA3dNyBLmcNTbNEOPxAumWKi" alt=""><figcaption>Misleadingly named <code>parseRelative</code> function hidden inside <code>jquery.js</code></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Another inserted and misleadingly named function is <code>initAjax</code>.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1006" height="456" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/initAjax.png" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/initAjax.png 1006w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/initAjax-300x136.png 300w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/initAjax-768x348.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1006px) 100vw, 1006px"><figcaption><code>initAjax</code> function decodes the content of <code>localStorage['cache-control']</code> and stores decoded values in the <code>window</code> object.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>This function is particularly interested in the content of <code>localStorage['cache-control']</code>, which should at this point be set to the value of the last received <code>Cache-Control</code> HTTP response header. The function splits the content of this header with a comma and attempts to decrypt each part using a custom function named <code>strrevsstr</code>, before finally parsing it out as a JSON string.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/goWFLSGQb0chknR4jrq9RWhhwgku6ms3lXOQy7Ix-n7YM9WsmAzRZ4OonUGJV6Pm6pmt_NHOYeSKEDdyuYt029lAhBsR6fy3VNkgJu0UU25TSAnMZpAAOpmuVfPsRzkfySTLJSI3" alt=""><figcaption><code>strrevsstr</code> function used by the extension to decrypt strings</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The obvious question now is why would the extension expect to intercept requests that contain an encrypted JSON string in the <code>Cache-Control</code> response header?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The answer is that the threat actors are using the content of the <code>Cache-Control</code> header as a covert channel to send hidden commands to the malicious extension.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a part of the malicious extension’s regular functionality, analytics requests about some events are sent to <code>https://stats.script-protection[.]com/__utm.gif</code>. These are standard analytics requests that bear resemblance to Google Analytics. The catch is, that the server used by this extension might respond to the analytics requests with a specially formed <code>Cache-Control</code> header, which the client will decrypt, parse out and execute.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ght_jCWk0nzs16njkDqf6SCrXlE7Va4Y_BLXzs8w8lgJXRnxFDgZa60VirwgiZ421w7dZwBnQAw-jOAvvy8A_PAborsR8hTg5fmWhtTFHK2PVDHWFF58lDRprGqhnYzibiN2FV_4" alt=""><figcaption>Flow of the covert channel</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>To see what the commands could look like, we simulated the extension and sent a fake analytics HTTP request to <code>https://stats.script-protection[.]com/__utm.gif</code>. After a couple of attempts, we received a specially crafted <code>Cache-Control</code> header.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/evazuvvQ91jdK50XsV34gbeOAkRH_vJz6mptWRlJtBgQQbyK-JOEPrAsshMkMLZdHcxZUJORtwLANqhWO1e6W_QLMx1K2e5JNi6rg9zDYr2n7IK_beX5bKLYfJDobQyfe2hy9o7G" alt=""><figcaption>Fiddler capture of a seemingly innocent analytics request that contains a hidden command in the <code>Cache-Control</code> response header</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Note that the response will contain the encoded command only when some conditions are met. First of all, the GET parameter <code>it</code> has to be set at least three days into the past. Since this parameter contains the time when the extension was installed, this effectively ensures that the extension will not exhibit any malicious behavior during the first three days. There is also a check based on the IP address, since we repeatedly did not receive any commands from one source IP address, even though we did receive a command for the same GET request from another IP address. As the logic behind these checks is safely hidden on the C&amp;C server, there might be additional checks that we are not aware of.</p>



<p>When the content of the received <code>Cache-Control</code> header is <a href="https://github.com/avast/ioc/blob/master/CacheFlow/extras/decryptor_strrevsstr.py" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decoded</a> using the custom <code>strrevsstr</code> function as outlined above, we get the command in the following JSON. As was seen in the <code>initAjax</code> function, all of the attributes from this JSON get stored in the global <code>window</code> object.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="642" height="134" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/json_command-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/json_command-1.png 642w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/json_command-1-300x63.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px"><figcaption>Command decoded from the <code>Cache-Control</code> response header</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Upon receiving such a command, the extension downloads the second stage from <code>command['uu']</code> in a function named <code>siblingAfter</code>, which is also hidden inside <code>jquery.js</code>. The dollar sign from <code>command['jj']</code> here represents the <code>jQuery</code> object, so the function uses the <code>jQuery.get</code> function to download the next stage from <code>command['uu']</code> and to store it in <code>localStorage.dataDefault</code>.</p>

					<p>The laser scanning microscope is a special light microscope which uses a focused laser beam to scans the sample. The scanning of the laser across the sample is done by driving the laser in x and y direction.&nbsp; The image is composed in the software by combining the measured light points.</p>
<p>The DVD Laser Scanner Microscope is build from two DVD pick-up heads. The laser of the DVD head is used to illuminate the sample at a tiny spot, focused with the DVD heads own focusing mechanism. The deviation of the laser is done by the pick-up heads lens moving coils.</p>

<h6>Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy</h6>
<p>A special case is the confocal laser scanning microscopy that enables the reconstruction of three-dimensional structures from sets of images obtained at different depths. Confocal laser scanning microscopes are often used in combination with fluorescence to study properties of biological samples such as cells.</p>

<h6>Image Resolution</h6>
<p>The resolution of the image is defined by the number of measurements taken in x direction and the number of lines in y. The maximum resolution is limited by the numerical aperture of the system’s objective lens and the wavelength of the laser as in conventional optical microscopes. In fluorescence observations, the resolution is often limited by the strength of the signal. More sensitive photo-detectors or increasing the intensity of the illuminating laser can compensate.</p>

<h6>Prototype Setup</h6>
<p>The first prototype set-up uses two pick-up head. One is emitting the laser and scanning in x direction. The second pick-up head carries the sample and moves in y direction. The photo-detector on the laser unit is removed and the signal is captured with a simple photo-diode. The coils are controlled by an <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno">Arduino</a> with drive electronics and the images is rendered in <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content">
			

			<div>
				
<p>Reading a blog post about what’s <a href="https://www.loicmathieu.fr/wordpress/en/informatique/java-16-quoi-de-neuf/">coming up in JDK 16</a> recently,
I learned that one of the new features is support for Unix domain sockets (<a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/380">JEP 380</a>).
Before Java 16, you’d have to resort to 3rd party libraries like <a href="https://github.com/jnr/jnr-unixsocket">jnr-unixsocket</a> in order to use them.
If you haven’t heard about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket">Unix domain sockets</a> before,
they are "data communications [endpoints] for exchanging data between processes executing on the same host operating system".
Don’t be put off by the name btw.;
Unix domain sockets are also supported by macOS and even Windows since <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/af_unix-comes-to-windows/">version 10</a>.</p>
<p>Databases such as Postgres or MySQL use them for offering an alternative to TCP/IP-based connections to client applications running on the same machine as the database.
In such scenario,
Unix domain sockets are both more secure
(no remote access to the database is exposed at all; file system permissions can be used for access control),
and also <a href="https://momjian.us/main/blogs/pgblog/2012.html#June_6_2012">more efficient</a> than TCP/IP loopback connections.</p>
<p>A common use case are proxies for accessing Cloud-based databases,
such as as the GCP <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/sql-proxy#proxy_startup_options">Cloud SQL Proxy</a>.
Running on the same machine as a client application
(e.g. in a sidecar container in case of Kubernetes deployments),
they provide secure access to a managed database, for instance taking care of the SSL handling.</p>
<p>My curiousity was piqued and I was wondering what it’d take to make use of the new Java 16 Unix domain socket for connecting to Postgres.
It was your regular evening during the pandemic,
without much to do, so I thought "Let’s give this a try".
To have a testing bed, I started with installing Postgres 13 on Fedora 33.
Fedora might not always have the latest Postgres version packaged just yet,
but following the official <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/redhat/">Postgres instructions</a> it is straight-forward to install newer versions.</p>
<p>In order to connect with user name and password via a Unix domain socket,
one small adjustment to <em>/var/lib/pgsql/13/data/pg_hba.conf</em> is needed:
the access <code>method</code> for the <code>local</code> connection type must be switched from the default value <code>peer</code>
(which would try to authenticate using the operating system user name of the client process) to <code>md5</code>.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code>...
# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local   all             all                                     md5
...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Make sure to apply the changed configuration by restarting the database
(<code>systemctl restart postgresql-13</code>),
and things are ready to go.</p>
<div>
<h2 id="_the_postgres_jdbc_driver">The Postgres JDBC Driver</h2>
<div>
<p>The first thing I looked into was the Postgres <a href="https://jdbc.postgresql.org/">JDBC driver</a>.
Since version <a href="https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/changelog.html#version_9.4-1208">9.4-1208</a> (released in 2016) it allows you to configure custom socket factories,
a feature which explicitly was added considering Unix domain sockets.
The driver itself doesn’t come with a socket factory implementation that’d actually support Unix domain sockets,
but a few external open-source implementations exist.
Most notably junixsocket provides such <a href="https://kohlschutter.github.io/junixsocket/dependency.html#PostgreSQL">socket factory</a>.</p>
<p>Custom socket factories must extend <code>javax.net.SocketFactory</code>,
and their fully-qualified class name needs to be specified using the <a href="https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/head/connect.html#unix%20sockets">socketFactory</a> driver parameter.
So it should be easy to create <code>SocketFactory</code> implementation based on the new <a href="https://download.java.net/java/early_access/jdk16/docs/api/java.base/java/net/UnixDomainSocketAddress.html">UnixDomainSocketAddress</a> class, right?</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java"><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>PostgresUnixDomainSocketFactory</span> <span>extends</span> <span>SocketFactory</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>@Override</span>
  <span>public</span> <span>Socket</span> <span>createSocket</span><span>()</span> <span>throws</span> <span>IOException</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>socket</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Socket</span><span>();</span>
    <span>socket</span><span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>UnixDomainSocketAddress</span><span>.</span><span>of</span><span>(</span>
        <span>"/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432"</span><span>));</span> <i data-value="1"></i><b>(1)</b>
    <span>return</span> <span>socket</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>// other create methods ...</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><i data-value="1"></i><b>1</b></td>
<td>Create a Unix domain socket address for the default path of the socket on Fedora and related systems</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>It compiles just fine;
but it turns out not all socket addresses are equal,
and <code>java.net.Socket</code> only connects to addresses of type <code>InetSocketAddress</code>
(and the PG driver maintainers seem to sense some air of mystery around these "unusual" events, too):</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code>org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: Something unusual has occurred to cause the driver to fail. Please report this exception.
  at org.postgresql.Driver.connect(Driver.java:285)
  ...

Caused by:
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unsupported address type
  at java.base/java.net.Socket.connect(Socket.java:629)
  at java.base/java.net.Socket.connect(Socket.java:595)
  at dev.morling.demos.PostgresUnixDomainSocketFactory.createSocket(PostgresUnixDomainSocketFactory.java:19)
  ...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now JEP 380 solely speaks about <code>SocketChannel</code> and stays silent about <code>Socket</code>;
but perhaps obtaining a socket from a domain socket channel works?</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java"><span>public</span> <span>Socket</span> <span>createSocket</span><span>()</span> <span>throws</span> <span>IOException</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>sc</span> <span>=</span> <span>SocketChannel</span><span>.</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>UnixDomainSocketAddress</span><span>.</span><span>of</span><span>(</span>
      <span>"/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432"</span><span>));</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>sc</span><span>.</span><span>socket</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Nope, no luck either:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code>java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Not supported
  at java.base/sun.nio.ch.SocketChannelImpl.socket(SocketChannelImpl.java:226)
  at dev.morling.demos.PostgresUnixDomainSocketFactory.createSocket(PostgresUnixDomainSocketFactory.java:17)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Indeed it looks like JEP 380 is concerning itself only with the non-blocking <code>SocketChannel</code> API,
while users of the blocking <code>Socket</code> API do not get to benefit from it.
It should be possible to create a custom <code>Socket</code> implementation based on the socket channel support of JEP 380,
but that’s going beyond the scope of my little exploration.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_the_vert_x_postgres_client">The Vert.x Postgres Client</h2>
<div>
<p>If the Postgres JDBC driver doesn’t easily benefit from the JEP,
what about other Java Postgres clients then?
There are several non-blocking options,
including the <a href="https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-pg-client/java/">Vert.x Postgres client</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pgjdbc/r2dbc-postgresql">R2DBC</a>.
The former is used to bring Reactive capabilities for Postgres into the Quarkus stack, too,
so I turned my attention to it.</p>
<p>Now the Vert.x Postgres Client already has support for Unix domain sockets,
by means of adding the right Netty native transport dependency to your project.
So purely from functionality perspective, there’s not that much to be gained here.
But being able to use domain sockets also with the default NIO transport would still be nice,
as it means one less dependency to take care of.
So I dug a bit into the code of the Postgres client and Vert.x itself and figured out, that two things needed adjustment:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The NIO-based <a href="https://github.com/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/blob/master/src/main/java/io/vertx/core/net/impl/transport/Transport.java"><code>Transport</code></a> class of Vert.x needs to learn about the fact that <code>SocketChannel</code> now also supports Unix domain sockets (currently, an exception is raised when trying to use them without a Netty native transport)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Netty’s <a href="https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/4.1/transport/src/main/java/io/netty/channel/socket/nio/NioSocketChannel.java"><code>NioSocketChannel</code></a> needs some small changes, as it tries to obtain a <code>Socket</code> from the underlying <code>SocketChannel</code>, which doesn’t work for domain sockets as we’ve seen above</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Step 1 was quickly done by creating a custom sub-class of the default <code>Transport</code> class.
Two methods needed changes:
<code>channelFactory()</code> for obtaining a factory for the actual Netty transport channel,
and <code>convert()</code> for converting a Vert.x <code>SocketAddress</code> into a NIO one:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java"><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>UnixDomainTransport</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Transport</span> <span>{</span>

</div>

<tr>

</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Now let’s take a look at the <code>UnixDomainSocketChannel</code> class.
I was hoping to get away again with creating a sub-class of the NIO-based implementation,
<code>io.netty.channel.socket.nio.NioSocketChannel</code> in this case.
Unfortunately, though, the <code>NioSocketChannel</code> constructor invokes the taboo <code>SocketChannel#socket()</code> method.
Of course that’d not be a problem when doing this change in Netty itself,
but for my little exploration I ended up copying the class and doing the required adjustments in that copy.
I ended up doing two small changes:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Avoiding the call to <code>SocketChannel#socket()</code> in the constructor:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java"><span>public</span> <span>UnixDomainSocketChannel</span><span>(</span><span>Channel</span> <span>parent</span><span>,</span> <span>SocketChannel</span> <span>socket</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>super</span><span>(</span><span>parent</span><span>,</span> <span>socket</span><span>);</span>
    <span>config</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>NioSocketChannelConfig</span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span>,</span> <span>new</span> <span>Socket</span><span>());</span> <i data-value="1"></i><b>(1)</b>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><i data-value="1"></i><b>1</b></td>
<td>Passing a dummy socket instead of <code>socket.socket()</code>, it shouldn’t be accessed in our case anyways</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>A few methods call the <code>Socket</code> methods <code>isInputShutdown()</code> and <code>isOutputShutdown()</code>;
those should be possible to be by-passed by keeping track of the two shutdown flags ourselves</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As I was creating the <code>UnixDomainSocketChannel</code> in my own namespace instead of Netty’s packages,
a few references to the non-public method <code>NioChannelOption#getOptions()</code> needed commenting out,
which again shouldn’t be relevant for the domain socket case</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>You can find the complete change in <a href="https://github.com/gunnarmorling/unix-domain-socket-poc/commit/9d8502f5c47cb59162e325640db54672f1ed8b68">this commit</a>.
All in all, not exactly an artisanal piece of software engineering,
but the little hack seemed good enough at least for taking a quick glimpse at the new domain socket support.
Of course a real implementation could be done much more properly within the Netty project itself.</p>
<p>So it was time to give this thing a test ride.
As we need to configure the custom <code>Transport</code> implementation,
retrieval of a <code>PgPool</code> instance is a tad more verbose than usual:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java"><span>PgConnectOptions</span> <span>connectOptions</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>PgConnectOptions</span><span>()</span>

            <p id="article-description">Using my own web server accesslogs and public
            latency data to get a quantitative answer and why roundtrips are such a
            pain.</p>

                    <p>As network latencies grow, strange things can happen: "fat"
                    sites can become fast (especially if served completely from CDN)
                    and "thin" sites that use APIs can become slow. A typical latency
                    for a desktop/laptop user is 200ms, for a 4G mobile user,
                    300-400ms.</p>
                    <p>I've assumed <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/896779/average-mobile-fixed-broadband-download-upload-speeds/">
                    40 megabit bandwidth</a>, TLS, latency to CDN of <a href="https://blog.apnic.net/2019/08/28/analysing-global-cdn-performance/">
                    40ms</a> and no existing connections.</p>
                    <p>"Origin" here means the primary webserver (as opposed to "edge"
                    CDN caches).</p>

            <p>What's the fastest place to put my server? Beyond the time taken for
            servers to respond to requests it takes time just to traverse the internet,
            just to get a packet from A to B.</p>
            <p>To estimate what the theoretical best physical place to put my own
            server is I've combined publicly publicly available data on latencies with
            my own web server accesslogs. I'm aiming to get a rough, quantitative,
            answer that's based on a real data set.</p>
            <h2>Why location matters</h2>
            <p>Time taken to traverse the internet is added to the time taken to
            respond to a request. Even if your API can respond to a request in 1ms, if
            the user is in London and your API server is in California the user still
            has to wait ~130 milliseconds for the response.</p>
            <p>It's a bit worse than just 130 milliseconds. Depending on what a user is
            doing they may end up making a number of those roundtrips. To download a
            web page usually requires five full roundtrips: one to resolve the domain
            name via DNS, one to establish the TCP connection, two more to set up an
            encrypted session with TLS and one, finally, for the page you wanted in the
            first place.</p>
            <p>Subsequent requests <em>can</em> (but don't always) reuse the DNS, TCP
            and TLS setup but a new roundtrip is still needed each time the server is
            consulted, for example for an API call or a new page.</p>
            <p>130ms sounded fast at first, but the rigmarole of just getting a page
            and then making an couple of API calls can easily end up taking most of a
            second just in terms of time waiting for the network. All the other time
            required: for the server to decide what response to send to your request,
            time downloading the thing and then rendering whatever it is in your
            browser - that is all extra.</p>
            <h3>The two kinds of "fast" for networks</h3>
            <p>One of the confusing things about networking is the inspecific way in
            which people talk of getting "faster" networking: "faster" residental
            broadband for example, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Ethernet">"fast ethernet"</a> (100
            megabits per second, no longer impressive).</p>
            <p>This kind of "faster" is not in fact talking about speed. Greater speed
            would be reduced latency - so faster roundtrips. Instead "faster"
            networking is really about <em>greater bandwidth</em>: more bytes per
            second.</p>
            <h3>APIs or CDNs</h3>
            <p>One thing that does make things faster: a Content Distribution Network
            (or CDN). Instead of going all the way to California perhaps you can
            retrieve some of the web page from a cache in central London. Doing this
            saves time - perhaps taking just 50 milliseconds, a saving of 60%. Caches
            work great for CSS files, images and javascript - stuff that doesn't change
            for each user. It doesn't work as well for the responses to API calls, for
            which the responses are different for each user, and sometimes, each
            time.</p>
            <h2>A quantitative approach</h2>
            <p>A happy few can serve everything from their CDN. News sites, for
            example, show the exact same thing to everyone. Others are less lucky and
            can make only limited, or no, use of caching. These poor people have to
            pick a location for their main server to help them get their bytes to the
            users who want them as fast as possible. If they want to make that choice
            with the sole aim of reducing latency, where should they pick?</p>
            <p>Here's what I did:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>I took my own accesslogs for a two week period in September just
                after I'd published something new. I got about a million requests
                during this period from 143k unique IPs. I excluded obvious robots
                (which was ~10% of requests).</li>
                <li>I used Maxmind's GeoIP database to geocode each IP address in those
                accesslogs to geographic co-ordinates.</li>
                <li>I then used <a href="https://wondernetwork.com/pings">WonderNetwork's published latency
                data</a> for internet latencies between ~240 world cities.
                </li>
                <li>I mapped those cities (semi-manually, which was pretty painful)
                from their names to <a href="https://www.geonames.org/">Geonames</a>
                ids - which gave me co-ordinates for the cities.
                </li>
                <li>Then I loaded all of the above into a Postgres database with the
                <a href="https://postgis.net/">PostGIS</a> extension installed so I
                could do geographical queries.
                </li>
                <li>I queried to estimate how long, by percentile, requests would have
                taken if I'd had my server in each of the 200 cities.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>The results</h2>
            <p>In the table below I've recorded the outcome: how long users would take
            to complete a single roundtrip to my server if it were in each city. I've
            done this by percentiles so you have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the average ("p50")</li>
                <li>for three quarters of requests ("p75")</li>
                <li>and for 99% of requests ("p99")</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All numbers are in milliseconds.</p>

It gets a control plane and a set of worker nodes, and leverages Rook and Ceph to get Persistent Volume support.</p><h2 id="why">Why install Kubernetes using kubespray?</h2><p>The reasons why one might want to install Kubernetes “manually” are many:</p><ul><li>Allows you to run Kubernetes on cloud providers even if they do not offer a managed Kubernetes service such as AKS, EKS, or GKE.</li><li>Not entangled with the cloud provider’s IAM or other services, which makes a multi-cloud strategy easier to implement in practice. This way, your tools and processes will not be cloud-vendor specific.</li><li>Allows full control over the control plane: if you want to install, e.g., an OpenID Connect provider such as Dex to integrate with your Identity Provider (IdP), you can. With a managed service, what you can or cannot do is at the mercy of your cloud provider.</li></ul><p>So let’s get to it!</p><h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2><p>Our cluster setup is as following:</p><ul><li>One control plane node: 2GB RAM, 2 vCPU, 50GB local storage.</li><li>Three worker nodes: 8GB RAM, 4 vCPU, 100GB local storage each.</li></ul><p>All nodes are running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. The cluster is running Kubernetes v1.19.7 and is installed using kubespray 2.15.0. You will also need Terraform to follow along with this guide.</p><h2 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure</h2><p>The first thing that is needed is to set up all the infrastructure needed for the cluster.</p><h3 id="terraform">Terraform</h3><p>The easiest way to deploy a production-ready Kubernetes cluster is to use the Terraform script from <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kubespray</a></p><p>Clone kubespray for the script. Exoscale support is on master right now.</p><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray.git
cd kubespray<br></code></pre><p>Create a new folder in the inventory folder for your cluster.</p><pre><code>CLUSTER=my-exoscale-cluster
cp -r inventory/sample inventory/$CLUSTER
cp contrib/terraform/exoscale/default.tfvars inventory/$CLUSTER/
cd inventory/$CLUSTER</code></pre><p>Edit <code>default.tfvars</code> and make sure that <code>ceph_partition_size</code> for all the workers is set to 50. <em>(To match the reference setup)</em></p><p>For authentication you can use a encrypted credentials file ~/.cloudstack.ini or ./cloudstack.ini. This file can be created by running:</p><pre><code>cat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt; cloudstack.ini
[cloudstack]
key = 
secret = 
EOF
sops --encrypt --in-place --pgp  cloudstack.ini
sops cloudstack.ini</code></pre><p>Insert your API key in <code>key</code> and API secret in <code>secret</code>. Follow the <a href="https://community.exoscale.com/documentation/iam/quick-start/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exoscale IAM Quick-start</a> to learn how to generate API keys.</p><p>To create the cluster, run the following and follow the instructions on the screen.</p><pre><code>terraform init ../../contrib/terraform/exoscale
sops exec-file -no-fifo cloudstack.ini 'CLOUDSTACK_CONFIG={} terraform apply -var-file default.tfvars ../../contrib/terraform/exoscale'</code></pre><p>You should now have a inventory file <code>inventory.ini</code> that you can use with kubespray. To test it and to make sure that all the nodes are properly up and running, run the following:</p><pre><code>ansible -i inventory.ini -m ping all</code></pre><h3 id="other-setup">Other setup</h3><p>If you are setting up the nodes by yourself, please keep in mind that Exoscale at the time of writing doesn’t have support for adding additional disks. Therefore you need to split the root disk into multiple partitions.</p><p>This can be achieved by making sure that your instance has more than 50GB of disk and that the following lines is added to your user-data before booting.</p><pre><code>#cloud-config
bootcmd:
- [ cloud-init-per, once, move-second-header, sgdisk, --move-second-header, /dev/vda ]
- [ cloud-init-per, once, create-ceph-part, parted, --script, /dev/vda, 'mkpart 2 50GB -1' ] # Create ceph partition spanning from 50GB from start to end</code></pre><p>More information about this can be found in this blog post, <a href="https://elastisys.com/elastisys-engineering-how-to-set-up-rook-with-ceph-on-kubernetes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rook Ceph on Kubernetes</a>.</p><h3 id="kubespray">kubespray</h3><p>When the infrastructure is up and running, it’s time to add Kubernetes on top of all this. If you have followed the suggested way of spinning up the infrastructure, you should be able to run:</p><pre><code>ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini ../../cluster.yml -b -v</code></pre><p><em>NOTE: You might want to set the value <code>kubeconfig_localhost</code> in the file <code>group_vars/k8s-cluster/k8s-cluster.yml</code> to <code>true</code> to get the kubeconfig file. Just remember that it will use the private IP of the server, so update the server IP to match the IP of the control plane load balancer.</em></p><p>When Ansible is finished, verify that you have access to the Kubernetes cluster by running:</p><pre><code>kubectl get nodes</code></pre><h3 id="rook">Rook</h3><p>Install rook by installing the rook operator chart.</p><pre><code>helm repo add rook-release https://charts.rook.io/release
kubectl create namespace rook-ceph
helm upgrade --install --namespace rook-ceph rook-ceph rook-release/rook-ceph --version v1.5.5 --wait

# Need to use ceph v15.2.7 to be able to use partitions

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><strong>How we built a visual COVID-19 mask quality inspection prototype running on-device on an OpenMV-H7 board and the challenges on the way.</strong></p><p>‍</p><p>TLDR; The source code to train and deploy your own image classifier can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/ARM-software/EndpointAI/tree/master/ProofOfConcepts/Vision/OpenMvMaskDefaults" target="_blank">https://github.com/ARM-software/EndpointAI/tree/master/ProofOfConcepts/Vision/OpenMvMaskDefaults</a></p><p>‍</p><p>In the summer of 2020, we worked with Arm to build an easy-to-use tutorial on how to train and deploy an image classifier on an Arm microcontroller. In this post, we show how we approached and solved the following challenges:</p><ul role="list"><li>Convert a PyTorch ResNet to TensorFlow and quantize it to use 8-bit integer values</li><li>Collect, select, and annotate data of faulty and non-faulty masks</li><li>Use self-supervised pre-training to boost model performance when working on fewer images.</li></ul><p>‍</p><h3>The Results to Expect</h3><p>The goal of this project was to show an end-to-end workflow on how to train and deploy a convolutional neural network to an OpenMV-H7 board.</p><p>The video below showcases how our classifier detects faulty masks in real-time.</p><figure id="w-node-1e0674653ff8-e7e87989"><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ba1c1JkBnNc"></iframe></p></figure><h3>The OpenMV-H7 Board</h3><p>The board consists of an <a href="https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers/stm32h743vi.html" target="_blank">STM32H743VI</a> Arm Cortex-M7 processor running at 480MHz, multiple peripherals, and a camera module mounted on it.<br>The camera module has an <a href="http://www.ovt.com/products/sensor.php?id=80" target="_blank">OV7725</a> sensor from OmniVision and can record in VGA resolution (640x480) at 75 FPS.</p><p>Since the board has limited computing power and memory, we aimed for a very small deep learning model. We call the variant ResNet-9 since it’s more of a cut in half ResNet-18 variant. Below you can find some numbers about the model configuration, runtime, and other metrics.</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Input size:</strong> 64x64x3 </li><li><strong>CPU Freq.:</strong> 480 MHz</li><li><strong>Operations:</strong> 33.4 MOp</li><li><strong>Model size: </strong>90 kBytes</li><li><strong>Inference Time: </strong>150 ms</li><li><strong>Operations/s</strong>: 249 MOp/s</li></ul><p>Detailed specs can be found on the official website of OpenMV <a href="https://openmv.io/products/openmv-cam-h7" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><figure id="w-node-54c1c743c46b-e7e87989"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7ac1d59a6fc121dde87967/6006dd1b05a6ba9ae8de6dd0_1*tN005NiVE1kZbBK9BwCRmw.jpeg" alt=""></p><figcaption>A close-up picture of the OpenMV H7 Board we used.</figcaption></figure><h3>Data Collection</h3><p>Neural networks are very data-hungry. In order to efficiently collect enough training data we did the following:</p><ol role="list"><li>We used the camera on the OpenMV-H7 board to record video sequences. With the USB interface and the <a href="https://openmv.io/pages/download" target="_blank">OpenMV IDE</a>, we were able to easily record the camera stream and save it as a video file.</li><li>To simulate a real production line we mounted the camera on cardboard to make sure the camera is stable. The optics point to the production line which is a metal plate with tall borders. This setup ensures, that the camera sees defect and non-defect masks within the same environment.</li><li>Finally, we moved masks through our inspection line using a combination of push and pull.</li></ol><figure id="w-node-aeaf7ee059b3-e7e87989"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7ac1d59a6fc121dde87967/6006dd1b93ae233273724258_1*fULWu10pKzaaYevH6g1wAw.jpeg" alt=""></p><figcaption>A picture of our data collection pipeline. We cut a small hole into the cardboard to clamp the USB table holding the board into it.</figcaption></figure><h3>Data Selection and Annotation</h3><p>At this stage we have multiple video files, each having captured a few minutes. The next challenge is to extract the frames and annotate the data. We use FFmpeg for the frame extraction and <a href="http://lightly.ai/" target="_blank">Lightly</a> to select a diverse set of frames. Note that we had more than 20k frames but no time to annotate all of them. Using <a href="http://lightly.ai/" target="_blank">Lightly</a> we selected a few hundred frames covering all relevant scenarios.<br><a href="http://lightly.ai/" target="_blank">Lightly</a> uses self-supervised learning to get good representations of the images. It then uses these representations to select the most interesting images which should be annotated. The benefit of this method is that we can access the pre-trained model and fine-tune it on only a handful of labeled images.</p><figure id="w-node-d0a8cad91e90-e7e87989"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7ac1d59a6fc121dde87967/6006dd1bb94b015a4b0f3fab_1*PReJtvsyDDVwhWxQXDaI9w.jpeg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Example images taken with the OpenMV H7 camera showing the three labels for the data. From left to right: good mask, defect mask, no mask.</figcaption></figure><figure><p><img src="" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong>Model Fine-Tuning<br></strong>To prevent the model from overfitting, we simply froze the pre-trained backbone and added a linear classification head to the model. We then trained the classifier for 100 epochs on a total of 500 annotated images.</p><p>‍</p><h3>From PyTorch to Keras to TensorFlow Lite</h3><p>Moving the pre-trained PyTorch model to TensorFlow Lite turned out to be the most difficult part of our endeavor.</p><p>‍</p><p>We tried out several tricks with ONNX to export our model. A simple library called <a href="https://github.com/nerox8664/pytorch2keras" target="_blank">pytorch2keras</a> worked fine for a model only consisting of linear layers but not for our conv + linear model. </p><p>The main problem we encountered, was that PyTorch uses the CxHxW (channel, height, width) format for tensors whereas TensorFlow uses HxWxC. This meant that, after transforming our model to TensorFlow Lite, the output of the layer just before the classifier was permuted, and hence, the output of the classifier was incorrect. In order to address this problem, we considered manually permuting the weights of the linear classifier. </p><p>However, we decided to go for a simpler solution. We pooled the output of the last convolutional layer into a Cx1x1 shape. That way, changing the order of the channels does not affect the output of the neural network.</p><p>‍</p><p>The final step is to quantize and export the Keras model to TensorFlow Lite. In our case quantization reduces the model size and speeds up running the model in inference at the cost of a few percent lower accuracy.</p><p>Special thanks to our collaborators at Arm and <a href="https://medium.com/u/297b71d663f3" target="_blank">Philipp Wirth</a> from Lightly for making this project possible. The <a href="https://github.com/ARM-software/EndpointAI/tree/master/ProofOfConcepts/Vision/OpenMvMaskDefaults" target="_blank">full source code is available here</a>. You can easily train your own classifier and run it on an embedded device.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div><p>I’ve been part of the internet startup scene for a while. There are so many different camps: the bootstrappers, the VC-backed tech-bros, the crypto “investors”, the people marketing their courses on marketing courses, the newsletter gurus, the micro-saas homeboys. The list goes on.</p>
<p>Each of these groups have their own, unique views on building companies and products. Some are moonshots, others are sustainable “grow-slowly” types, and each has its own subset of hard-core, flame-war inducing followers. Ah, the internet is a beautiful, terrible, magical, ghastly, colourful place.</p>
<p>I’ve been associated with, and in some cases, been a part of a few of these various subcultures. After working at a VC backed startup, I went the bootstrapped route (popularised by the IndieHackers movement) with my own product. It was an interesting ride, but was still rife with the Marketing Course Joes who just made $3000 last week with their “How to market no-code apps” course, as well as the Hustle Boys with their Twitter feeds full of “Work like no-one works today, so you can live like no-one lives tomorrow. #entrepreneur”. Neither of these resonated with me.</p>
<p>I have found my own analogy/ideology. My product is my garden.</p>
<p>During the early days of lockdown, my girlfriend got deep into gardening. She would spend hours nurturing her tomato plants, weeding, watering, puttering about. She would spend afternoons reading articles on permaculture, figuring out which plants grew well alongside other plants. Lavender with tomatoes kept the pests away, slight shade for the granadilla vine, some water, but not too much for the root vegetables. It was lovely to watch her coax tasty and nutritious food individually out of the ground. I can’t imagine full-scale farming being nearly as enjoyable.</p>
<p>That’s what I want from my products. I want to putter about, feel connected to the process, and have fun doing so. I want to make things that don’t scale. To see people tuck into them and enjoy them as people, not as stats. I’ve done this fairly successfully with <a href="https://justsketch.me/">JustSketchMe</a>. We have a small, diverse, and amazing community of artists and illustrators making awesome things. I’m trying to build a similar product with <a href="https://bearblog.dev/">Bear Blog</a>. Something niche but valuable. Something I can spend time on because I want to.</p>
<p>Being able to talk to, and interact with the people using my tools is fulfilling. Spending time meticulously improving subtle aspects of the product is enjoyable.</p>
<p>Obviously, to do this a product has to reach a basic threshold of profitability. This will differ depending on where you are. I live in Cape Town, South Africa where the cost of living is low (compared to the US and EU). I reached basic profitability, matching an average developer salary here, about 10 months ago, and since then I’ve been improving my projects. Not to grow at all cost, but to ensure that people using the tool have an ever-improving experience.</p>
<p>This is my garden, and I intend to putter.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>As the fallout of the <a href="https://fsfellowship.eu/court-case-fsfe-women-and-volunteers-face-modern-day-slavery/">FSFE stalking scandal continues</a>, we are publishing below the leaked FSFE diversity strategy.</p>

<p>Here are the highlights we identified:</p>

<blockquote><em>For the FSFE front page we asked women to provide quotes with picture:
 This worked for <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=Amaelle+Guiton&amp;ia=web">Amaelle</a>. Other female contributors were also initially
 interested in providing a quote, but other constrains prevented them
 from doing so.</em></blockquote>

<p>What is the real reason women don't want their name and picture on the FSFE web site?</p>

<blockquote><em>At our events we encourage female speakers, as well as new speakers,
 and from different countries (e.g. LLW, but also at the summit).</em></blockquote>

<p>FSFE's biggest event is LLW but it is never advertised.  The registration process and the Call for Papers are hidden from the former Fellows and the Supporters.  Women will not participate in other Free Software events as long as the biggest events, like LLW, are hidden in the shadows.</p>

<blockquote><em>For internships we meanwhile give preference to women.</em></blockquote>

<p>Women employed as interns, men employed on permanent contracts.  As the recent court case demonstrates, all women on permanent contracts were <a href="https://fsfellowship.eu/court-case-fsfe-women-and-volunteers-face-modern-day-slavery/">sacked for talking about equality</a>.  What Matthias Kirschner describes is analogous to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untermensch">Untermensch concept from the Third Reich</a>.  This isn't the first time <a href="https://fsfellowship.eu/matthias-kirschner-fsfe-nazi-comparisons/">we find Kirschner's conduct is close to that of the Third Reich</a>.</p>

<p><img width="33%" alt="Olga Gkotsopoulou, FSFE, open source, intern, internship, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, VUB, law" src="https://fsfellowship.eu/assets/girlie-hacking-grey-front-large.jpg"></p><blockquote><em>we also encourage female interns to stay active in the
 FSFE after their internships:
 <ul>
 <li>We hired Polina (<a href="https://fsfellowship.eu/assets/fsfe-llw-conflict-of-interest.pdf">resigned after FSFE/LLW Conflict of Interest scandal</a>) after her internship</li>
 <li><b>Nikos is currently talking with <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Olga+Gkotsopoulou+fsfe+women+scandal&amp;t=ffab&amp;ia=web">Olga</a> about her becoming the Greek

 <li>With <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=lucile+falgueyrac+fsfe&amp;ia=web">Lucile</a> we have regular contact and invite her to meetings (she
   has very little time).</li>

is at the moment organising a Free Software event and
   coordinating with Matthias.</li>
 </ul>
</em></blockquote>

<p>Why would <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Olga+Gkotsopoulou+fsfe+women+scandal&amp;t=ffab&amp;ia=web">Olga Gkotsopoulou</a>, a woman from Greece, want to continue working for Free after her paid German internship ends?  Why would a woman in Greece want to send money to a misogynist in Berlin?  What will this Greek money be used for, hiring more female interns in Kirschner's cramped little office?</p>

<p>Kirschner appears to be delusional about his obligation to pay people.  An internship is a contract that ensures the woman can never acquire maternity rights, the contract always finishes before they can become pregnant.  Women resent this.</p>

<blockquote><em>### In Progress

</em><ul><em>
</em><li><em> Finish and implement Code of Conduct:
<ul>
 <li>Continue with the CoC, implement it, also against some critism (Erik
   worked on it with Heiki, but as it should be valid for the whole
   organisation so we said it would be good that we do not have several
   CoCs in the FSFE but try to merge it with the LLW CoC).</li>
  <li>help our groups to enforce it with a training about that topic next
   year (for the LLW Polina worked on a detailed guide what to keep in
   mind about that)</li>
</ul>
</em></li></ul></blockquote>

<p>This was the only definite action from the strategy, another Code of Conduct.  The way Kirschner <a href="https://fsfellowship.eu/court-case-fsfe-women-and-volunteers-face-modern-day-slavery/">went to this woman's home</a> demonstrates the reality of the Code of Conduct: leaders of open source organizations see themselves as God, they can do whatever they want and only apply their "enforcement" venom to their political rivals.</p>

<blockquote><em>
<p>Subject: Re: diversity and expanding the GA<br>
Date: Mon, 14 Aug 2017 10:51:58 +0000<br>
From: Matthias Kirschner <mk@fsfe.org><br>
To: ga@fsfeurope.org</mk@fsfe.org></p>

<p>Dear GA members,

</p><p>thank you all for raising your points in this thread. As Hugo pointed
out we repeatedly had that discussion, and also worked on some points.
Still there were some new ideas in the thread and from the Council we
suggest a few action items to make further progress. But first, so that
everybody is on the same page, some examples of existing activities on
that topic.,/p&gt;

</p><p>## Some examples of what we already do/did

</p><ul>
<li>When we have pictures on our website we try to have equal wo/man on
 them. For example have a look at
 https://fsfe.org/campaigns/ilovefs/whylovefs/gallery.en.html (this
 year we had some additions, before IIRC the ratio was better).</li>

<li>For the FSFE front page we asked women to provide quotes with picture:
 This worked for <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=Amaelle+Guiton&amp;ia=web">Amaelle</a>. Other female contributors were also initially
 interested in providing a quote, but other constrains prevented them
 from doing so.</li>
<li>At our events we encourage female speakers, as well as new speakers,
 and from different countries (e.g. LLW, but also at the summit).
 Although we have the same problem most conferences have, that is is
 really difficult to achieve that.</li>

<li>For the Legal Network council we started by picking the same ratio
 with men as with women.</li>

<li>For internships we meanwhile give preference to women. One reason is
 also because becoming intern is also increasing the chance to become
 an employment in the Free Software area.
 (https://fsfe.org/contribute/internship.en.html says "We want more
 women to be involved in Free Software. That's why we will give
 preference to applications from suitably qualified female
 candidates.")</li>

<li> As with males we also encourage female interns to stay active in the
 FSFE after their internships:
 <ul>
 <li>We hired Polina (<a href="https://fsfellowship.eu/assets/fsfe-llw-conflict-of-interest.pdf">resigned after FSFE/LLW Conflict of Interest scandal</a>) after her internship</li>
 <li>Nikos is currently talking with <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Olga+Gkotsopoulou+fsfe+women+scandal&amp;t=ffab&amp;ia=web">Olga</a> about her becoming the Greek
   deputy coordinator.</li>
 <li>With <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=lucile+falgueyrac+fsfe&amp;ia=web">Lucile</a> we have regular contact and invite her to meetings (she
   has very little time).</li>
 <li>We work a lot with <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=Eszter+Bako+fsfe&amp;ia=web">Eszter</a>, who is now assistent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Reda">Julia Reda</a>, but
   it might be difficult to include her further at the moment.</li>
 <li><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=Lusy+Vaseva+fsfe">Lusy</a>
is at the moment organising a Free Software event and
   coordinating with Matthias.</li>
 </ul></li>

<li>Staff was following-up with proposals from the past. For example
 Patrick Ohnewein before proposed Sonia Montegiove. Matthias had
 several talks with her and invited her to the FSFE summit. The problem
 is that she is quite shy when speaking English.</li>
<li>This year we had a
moderations workshop for our staff. Before it we
 clarified with the trainer that one of our goals is to enable our
 staff running more inclusive meetings. The workshop was documented in
 the wiki https://wiki.fsfe.org/Internal/Moderation (some permission
 problem at the moment, hope it is soon fixed).</li>
</ul>

<p>## Next Steps</p>

<p>### In Progress</p>

<ul>
<li> Finish and implement Code of Conduct:
 <ul>
 <li> Continue with the CoC, implement it, also against some critism (Erik
   worked on it with Heiki, but as it should be valid for the whole
   organisation so we said it would be good that we do not have several
   CoCs in the FSFE but try to merge it with the LLW CoC).</li>
 <li>help our groups to enforce it with a training about that topic next
   year (for the LLW Polina worked on a detailed guide what to keep in
   mind about that).</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>### Possible actions</p>

<ul>
<li>Discussion with Ulrike about the topic. She studied gender studies and
 is very interested in the topic) about the topic. Together with her
 identify strategies for more diversity inside the FSFE community and
 the GA, by</li>
<ul>
<li>having a budget for counselling on diversity (as several
people
   pointed out, just because someone is a women in IT, does not know
   they know about diversity).</li>
<li> have a time budget for Ulrike to
help on this issue next year.</li>

<li> As some hesitate to just add women to the GA without first being
 involved in other areas, make it a priority to support already active
 or interested females (or other under represented groups).  * This
could include that we encourage them to join us in teams, and
   mentor them, or to invite them to events so we can meet them (could
   also include priority for travel funding in case we have to choose).
</li></ul>

<li>GA participation:
<ul><li>You might have realised that all our male
staffers are GA members,
   but none of our female staffers is. That is bad. We should encourage
   Polina and Ulrike to think about joining, too.</li>
 <li>Depending on the outcome of the FSFE2020 discussion: if we enlarge
   the council (as the FSFE board) introduce a quote there (as Daniel
   proposed to have a second VP position, with a requirement that at
   least one of the VP positions must not be male.)</li>
 <li>Depending on the Italian GA member's feedback, we could invite her
   as a guest to the next GA, or if they think it would be a good idea
   we can ask her to first become another coordinator for Italy as a
   first step.</li>
  </ul></li>

<li>https://fsfe.org/contribute/internship.en.html starts with a quote by
 a former male and female interns. But we should update one of the
 quotes by Erik or Hugo on that page with former quotes.</li>

<li>Make sure we have balanced quotes by women on our website / as well as
 the front page. E.g.
 https://fsfe.org/campaigns/ilovefs/whylovefs/whylovefs.en.html (either
 get more or think about removing this page for next years in the
 campaign)</li>
</ul>

<p>Best Regards,<br>

		<div>
			<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>While this post is addressed to F# .NET developers, it introduces much wider concepts starting from hardware architecture to overall .NET runtime and JIT compiler optimizations. It shouldn't be a surprise - optimizing the application performance requires us to understand the relationships between our high level code and what actually happens on the hardware.</p>
<p>There's a popular opinion that F# code must be slower than equivalent C# code. This opinion is mostly false, however it comes with some rationale. Usually comparison doesn't use <strong>equivalent</strong> code in both languages, and F# is generally more high level and declarative in nature. "Idiomatic" F# code doesn't always play well with .NET virtual machine. Writing code that is high level, declarative and fast on .NET platform is not an easy task.</p>
<p>In the examples below we'll use some common tools that will help us get better insight into nature of F# code:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sharplab.io/">Sharplab</a> allows us to easily inspect generated JIT intermediate representation, assembly or even equivalent C# code (which sometimes is approximate, since not all IL idioms are representable in C#) for a given F# snippet. For assembly code usually some extra mangling with params may be necessary for code to be generated as SharpLab sometimes cannot introspect F# core lib code.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/SergeyTeplyakov/ObjectLayoutInspector">Object Layout Inspector</a> lets us see how structs and classes will actually be represented in memory.</li>
<li><a href="https://benchmarkdotnet.org/articles/overview.html">BenchmarkDotNet</a> is very popular library for writing micro benchmarks. We'll use it to show heap allocations and execution times of our code.</li>
</ul>
<p>A correct profiling of the executing application is crucial before starting any work on optimizing the code - there's no sense in shaving last possible CPU cycles out of the function that's executed for 0.1% of the time.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that for most day-to-day business applications, first way to solve performance problems is to reduce obvious mistakes (eg. replacing multiple I/O requests with one, writing more efficient database query etc.). If that was not the case, next step for satisfactory solution can be simply writing more imperative code - to make it easier to reason about for the compiler rather than human - or picking better-suited data structures. This is especially prevalent in F#, where we can observe pervasive usage of types like <code>'t list</code> (tip: if you're looking which collection to use and want good performance, F# list is almost never a good answer). Here we're about to go deeper, into area where we're about to compete with the prefabricated data types and algorithms.</p>
<h2 id="understandmemorylayoutofvaluetypes">Understand memory layout of value types</h2>
<p>One of the big performance gains, that .NET runtime uses to take advantage over other managed virtual machines (like JVM) in race for ultimate performance, often comes from using value types. So if we're about to go fast, we first need to understand how they work.</p>
<p>.NET structs represent types, which are not allocated separately on the managed memory heap, but rather inlined within the containing scope (instance of the class in case of fields, thread stack for variables, etc.). This means that usually they are cheaper and easier to access in high-allocation scenarios.</p>
<p><img src="https://bartoszsypytkowski.com/content/images/2021/02/class-vs-struct-layout.png" alt="class-vs-struct-layout"></p>
<p>Historically, F# code was not very promising, when it comes to utilizing value types. Nowadays we got things like struct tuples - <code>struct('a * 'b)</code> which unfortunately are not widely used in F# even though in practice they should be preferable choice when working with tuples - and <code>[&lt;Struct&gt;]</code> attribute, that can be used on records and discriminated unions (we'll return to them later), making use of them became much more feasible.</p>
<p>However this doesn't necessarily mean, that replacing all reference types with value types will make our code magically go faster. In fact, this may be quite opposite. Why? Imagine what happens when we want to pass a record as a parameter. How is it done? Usually passing object to a function happens by copying reference to that object, which is either 4B or 8B depending on our OS being x86 or x64, and therefore fits perfectly into standard CPU register.</p>
<pre><code>type A() =
  class
    [&lt;DefaultValue&gt;] val mutable x: int
    [&lt;DefaultValue&gt;] val mutable y: int
    [&lt;DefaultValue&gt;] val mutable z: int
  end

let print (value: 't) = System.Console.WriteLine(value.ToString())

let a = A() // sub rsp, 0x28
            // mov rcx, 0x7ff91b23d1a8
            // call 0x00007ff9730aade0 ; allocate A on the heap
print a     // mov rdx, rax            ; copy reference to a to the stack
            // mov rcx, 0x7ff91b23d5f8
            // call _.print[[System.__Canon, System.Private.CoreLib]](System.__Canon)
</code></pre>
<p>Now what if we're using structs? For reference types we copy object's reference on the stack - since reference is just a single address, it always can fit into register and be done within a single operation. For value types, we copy entire value instead. If they don't fit into register, we'll have to copy them over in multiple steps.</p>
<pre><code>type B =
  struct
    [&lt;DefaultValue&gt;] val mutable x: int
    [&lt;DefaultValue&gt;] val mutable y: int
    [&lt;DefaultValue&gt;] val mutable z: int
  end

let b = B() // sub rsp, 0x38
            // xor eax, eax       ; zero field b.x
            // xor ecx, ecx       ; zero field b.y
            // xor edx, edx       ; zero field b.z
print b     // lea r8, [rsp+0x28]
            // mov [r8], ecx      ; copy field b.x to the stack
            // mov [r8+4], eax    ; copy field b.y to the stack
            // mov [r8+8], edx    ; copy field b.z to the stack
            // lea rcx, [rsp+0x28]
            // call _.print[[_+B, _]](B)
</code></pre>
<p>Each of these steps is a machine instruction that takes time to execute. However, sometimes .NET can optimize that - pointer-sized registers are not only ones available in modern machines. We also have a special purpose SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) ones, that are much bigger and can be used as long as passed data fits into them perfectly.</p>
<pre><code>type C =
  struct
    [&lt;DefaultValue&gt;] val mutable x: int
    [&lt;DefaultValue&gt;] val mutable y: int
    [&lt;DefaultValue&gt;] val mutable z: int
    [&lt;DefaultValue&gt;] val mutable zz: int
  end
  
let c = C() // sub rsp, 0x48
            // xor eax, eax             ; zero register
            // mov [rsp+0x38], rax      ; init fields b.x and b.y together with zero'ed register
            // mov [rsp+0x40], rax      ; init fields b.z and b.zz together with zero'ed register
print c     // vmovupd xmm0, [rsp+0x38] ; copy all 4 fields together on the stack using SIMD registers
            // vmovupd [rsp+0x28], xmm0
            // lea rcx, [rsp+0x28]
            // call _.print[[_+C, _]](C)
</code></pre>
<p>Another thing available in .NET, that allows us addressing inefficiencies of passing structs as arguments are so called by-ref parameters. There are 3 types of these, marked using <code>'t inref</code>, <code>'t outref</code>  and <code>'t byref</code>:</p>
<pre><code>let print(value: 't inref) = ...
let c = C()
print &amp;c // lea rcx, [rsp+0x28] ; copy address of the struct head onto the stack
         // call _.print[[_+C, _]](C ByRef)
</code></pre>
<p>Please, don't confuse by-ref parameters with <code>ref</code> data type:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>'a ref</code> is actually an alias for <code>Ref&lt;'a&gt;</code> class, therefore allocated on the heap and passed by reference. In general, using this class in F# very rarely has sense (outside of writing exemplar, idiomatic code).</li>
<li><code>'a byref</code> is equivalent to C# <code>ref</code> parameter tag - it means that we're passing reference (memory address) to an object or struct. It expects it to be initialized and can be used to change the contents of the underlying value. For this reason F# requires fields and variables passed as <code>byref</code> to be declared with <code>mutable</code> keyword.</li>
<li><code>'a outref</code> is equivalent to C# <code>out</code> parameter tag - it always must be initialized by the end of the function body. This may sound a bit tricky as F# doesn't put that requirement explicitly. If we didn't make that assignment in any of the code branches, F# compiler will simply initialize it for us with default value (just like using <code>Unchecked.defaultof&lt;_&gt;</code>), which sometimes may lead to null reference exceptions.</li>
<li><code>'a inref</code> is the youngest of these and is equivalent of C# <code>in</code> parameter - while in C# structs passed as arguments for that parameters don't have to be tagged,  F# will always require to mark passing by ref (using <code>&amp;</code> prefix for passed argument) for any parameter marked with <code>byref</code>/<code>inref</code>/<code>outref</code>. <code>inref</code> is basically an optimization technique for what we saw above - it allows us to pass struct into a function using only its memory address, without copying entire struct contents. Additionally <code>inref</code> says that parameter is treated as read only, so it cannot be modified inside of function body. .NET JIT can utilize this information in some cases to reduce number of safety checks, therefore reducing number of instructions to be executed.</li>
</ul>
<p>While using by-ref parameters is usually good idea when it comes to writing code targeting complex value types, there are several limitations to it.</p>
<p>One is that arguments passed using by-ref params cannot be captured by closures/lambdas/anonymous functions, which prevents them from being used in more abstract code:</p>
<pre><code>// WRONG!
let doSomething (a: int inref) =
  [1..10]
  |&gt; List.map (fun x -&gt; x + a) // `a` is captured by closure, which is compilation error
  
// RIGHT
let doSomething (a: int inref) =
  let mutable result = []
  for x=10 downto 1 do
    result &lt;- (x + a)::result
  result
</code></pre>
<p>This includes problems even for common inlined functions like eg. pipe operator <code>|&gt;</code>. That's the price, we have to pay for speed (at least for now).</p>
<p>Second issue is that, at the moment by-ref parameters cannot be involved in building nested functions (regardless if they capture the values from function in outer scope or not). This again makes very inconvenient to use them in cases like tail recursive loop pattern:</p>
<pre><code>// WRONG!
let doSomething (a: 'a) =
  let rec loop n (x: 'a inref) = // this nested function won't compile
    if n = 0 then ()
    else loop (n-1) &amp;x
  loop 100 &amp;a

// RIGHT
let rec loop n (x: 'a inref) =
  if n = 0 then ()
  else loop (n-1) &amp;x
  
let doSomething (a: …</code></pre></div></article></div>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>A certain business process had been automated three years before. A small team of engineers had formed around a business need to meet some legal compliance issues, wrote the first version, and then left it in the hands of a product team that included one of the initial engineers.</p>

<p>It was plain sailing for a few years. The code expanded to automate more aspects of the compliance problem, and a third party system integrated to handle some issues that were not first-class concerns of the business logic. The team proceeded naturally, with some members leaving, and others taking over.</p>

<p>The first crack was that the third party system didn’t catch on with other parts of the business (even though it was widely applicable). Therefore, fewer candidates with good contextual knowledge remained in the face of natural attrition. Attrition was worrying, accelerated by some interpersonal issues and the standard flow of enquiries from hiring competitors.</p>

<p>The apparent saving grace against attrition were the contractors who had been present for the maintenance of this code. They appeared happy, and the relationship between the customer and client was strong, so they weren’t going anywhere.</p>

<p>When the last internal person left, the contractors became more isolated from the rest of the business. Three internal product owners engaged with the space and eventually moved on, but these contractors soldiered on, albeit with less oversight and awareness of the broader technical goals of the company.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the business hit funding difficulties when the VC darling of the local tech community pulled out of a <em>signed</em> term sheet because of a global investment crisis. This VC presented themselves as the saviour of local startups during that crisis, but a dark possibility is that they thought that the company could be bought for a better price after the crisis did some shaking.</p>

<p>All contractors (and a third of the permanent workforce) were out within a month of the deal failing, leaving no-one who knew the code.</p>

<p>Four engineers found themselves in the space vacated by two teams, looking after various systems including this code. Over months they pieced together a picture of how it was supposed to work, learning (amongst other things) that the process had been broken for months before they took over. Fixes went in, and increased monitoring was added.</p>

<p>Unfortunately attrition had not taken a break during the crisis: ten months later one departure, another pending resignation, an extended period of leave for a third member, and a hiring freeze left the team poorly positioned for the ongoing flood of production issues.</p>

<p>The two available members soldiered on, trying to make sure that the old code would be safe with fewer and fewer people available to maintain it (if you’re counting, the two would soon be reduced to one after a completed notice period).</p>

<p>One day, this code didn’t produce what was expected. The process needed to be complete by Saturday at 5pm, or lawyers had to get involved. It was Friday at 3pm, and one of the members was expecting to celebrate his partner’s 30th birthday the next day.</p>

<p>He left at 5pm on Friday, grateful for his teammate’s willingness to handle the problem for what would still (he assumed) be a few hours, and enjoyed a pleasant evening of birthday events with the family.</p>

<p>The next morning, he woke to see that the other teammate had been working all night on the problem and couldn’t continue. The happy path was fixed, but the lawyers would still need to get involved for the exceptions. With a few hours effort he believed he had a fighting chance of tracking down the exceptions, but again, it was his partner’s birthday.</p>

<p>Distracted by party preparations, it was not a good time to deal with: logging that was unfamiliar and slow to search; builds that took 45 minutes to get anything into production; flaky tests; data investigation tools that took hours to fetch the necessary data (and it was later realised, would have produced the wrong data); and some poor abstractions from years of maintenance without strong awareness of the big picture.</p>

<p>What should have been a simple matter (read some logs, run some code based on the results) ended up going nowhere. Eventually the truth had to be faced: they’d pick this up on Monday, with or without the lawyers.</p>

<p>The moral is related to frequent engineering decisions. Is your code understandable and resilient, are errors easily understood and recoverable, are builds are fast and stable, are feedback loops fast enough to learn and make change? Is your system isolated in a way that will reduce the number of people who can contribute usefully?</p>

<p>When you make these decisions, consider that it will not be you in your current context, with your current teammates for whom it matters.</p>

<p>It will matter a year or more after you and all your teammates are gone, when the person using all this has worked through the night, or is severely distracted by important, once-in-a-liftetime family events. It will matter when lawyers need to get involved if things go wrong, and it will matter when the company has less money to spend on tech than it does now.</p>

<p>There are a few caveats here:</p>

<p>First, companies sometimes make the decision to grow today at the expense of sustainability because there will be no point in sustainability if the business does not exist tomorrow. Product leaders or management may even oppose some of these ideas for this reason. I feel fortunate that in my current role, people are particularly receptive about ideas on how to avoid disasters, but it was not always like this.</p>

<p>Less charitably, middle management may be ignorant of the consequences, and their incentives are also often out of line with long running systems. They may even be consciously aware that the next rung of the ladder will come before they would have to deal with the consequences of making unsustainable decisions.</p>

<p>As engineers it often falls to us to educate people on the benefits of “non-feature” work. Ideally things like fast feedback loops will make you grow faster, as well as being more sustainable in the long term, but people who have not seen this work may struggle to understand.</p>

<p>Lastly, no single person’s decisions matter on their own, because that person will not be around to see the results. What matters is that there is a culture that can push everyone in a healthy direction.</p>

We track every single thing that’s trackable; page visits, followers, impressions, likes, shares, diet, sleep, dream, sex, calories — everything. While the use of analytics is valid in some cases, were we such analytics freaks just a decade ago?</span></span></p><h2 id="block-9a6cf2f7e066445cbd212ba79104e402"><span id="9a6cf2f7e066445cbd212ba79104e402"></span><span><span><strong>Anxiety</strong></span></span></h2><p><span><span>Analytics overload leads to unnecessary anxiety. When people share their supposedly impressive stats online, we instinctively compare theirs to our own. If we are better, we flaunt. If we are lesser, we feel stressed out. Rarely do we ever feel content. This is normal because we are not angels. However, we can learn to minimize this unnecessary anxiety and lead a happier, calmer life.</span></span></p><p><span><span>A simple way to reduce analytics anxiety is to avoid it altogether. Your personal site doesn’t need an analytics script. Your casual blog site doesn’t need an analytics script. You don’t need to visit your app’s analytics page every day. You don’t need to track your REM cycle when you sleep. Remove all of them, and you will see a difference in your life within just a few days. You will have more time to yourself and feel more positive.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Sometimes, it is inevitable when your social media friends share something analytics related like Twitter followers count and Gumroad payments. It is not a bad thing per se because it can motivate you to work harder. However, try your best not be too concerned with it. Either ignore or wish them good. Fill your feed with things you enjoy instead, like sports or science. Focus on making yourself happy rather than comparing your life to others.</span></span></p><p><span><span>If you really need to use analytics, set aside a time to study it. Once that time is up, remove the analytics tab from your view because it will be a distraction to you. If you are using analytics for your websites, I'd recommend using something like </span><span><a href="http://plausible.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plausible.io</a></span><span> or </span><span><a href="http://simpleanalytics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">simpleanalytics.com</a></span><span>. One notable feature that they offer is an email summary of your sites' performance for each week or month. This is great because now you don't need to check in as often.</span></span></p><h2 id="block-b5666e09bbeb43d48ea1583005bbd0dd"><span id="b5666e09bbeb43d48ea1583005bbd0dd"></span><span><span><strong>Noise</strong></span></span></h2><p><span><span>Realize that analytics wasn’t even a thing a decade or more ago. Life was calmer and less competitive for attention. We managed to diet well, sleep soundly, and build healthy businesses without a care about analytics. Analytics is the new noise, and we should try to plug our ears whenever possible.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Despite writing this, I was, and still am guilty of being an analytics freak. But I’m doing my best to minimize my obsession and revert to how I was in the 2000s when life was evidently calmer. Oops, did I just give away my age?</span></span></p><p><span><span><code>Happy to chat</code></span></span></p><ul><li id="block-e7e22e9ff6cf4edaa608c694aca55a7b"><span><span>Tweet me on </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/yusufgiftworks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a></span></span></li></ul></article></div></div></div>]]>

<p>I am 100% serious with the title, despite the appearance of click-bait. Mastodon has a serious structural rot that is only worsening as time gets on. I think this is for a few reasons which I will outline below.</p>



<p>Ironically, I don’t feel safe posting this directly to the fediverse because of the very forces I’m about to describe. I’m not worried about the cancel crew, I just don’t want to deal with hostile interactions right now. I might link to this post but it’s less likely to get hate mail I suspect if I do it that way rather than write this all up in a giant thread on fedi.</p>



<p>What I am presenting is largely anecdotal opinion, although it has been gathered from countless others (I’m not going to name any names, they deserve better than harassment or people trying to change their views and in the process merely reinforcing them).</p>



<h2>Background on myself</h2>



<p>I’ve been on Mastodon since April 2017. I was on “fedi” (well, the ostatus fediverse) before that, on long-gone instances I forgot the name of. I was on Mastodon in the very early days of its development, when content warnings were brand new, blocking/silencing was seriously broken, and fedi was just getting exciting due to press coverage. Before this, I was on IRC since 2005 and an IRC operator on a small network (it’s not glamorous, trust me).</p>



<h2>The problem</h2>



<p>Fedi has a problem as the title says: it’s crumbling. It’s a lot less vibrant than when I joined up, even back when GNUSocial roamed the earth (it was a pile of shit trying to imitate Twitter and mostly filled with people banned from Twitter for GamerGate and going too far, even for Twitter’s lax standards of the day).</p>



<p>It actually baffles me why so much of the Mastodon userbase can be traced back to the Tumblr/Twitter leftist crowd, when Fedi’s beginnings were on a network largely consisting of ultra-right people thrown off Twitter. I can only speculate, but I suspect the main reasons are they believed they would be safer (which is a joke), and many themselves (or their friends at least) were banned from those platforms for similarly shitty behaviour.</p>



<p>But it’s a mistake to believe that Fedi is safer at all. In fact, in many ways, it’s worse.</p>



<h3>Fedi is the least safe place around</h3>



<p>The thing about Fedi is that due to its nature, it has a low bar to entry. Anyone can make an instance at any time for not a whole lot of money. There are tons of far-right instances littering the place, and few admins can truly keep up (the worst-kept secret amongst Mastodon admins I would say). Most of the userbase just blocks them on an ad-hoc basis and moves on (or doesn’t notice them), but the fact that the Nazis haven’t really taken over the place is only by their mere incompetence.</p>



<p>To illustrate the problem, I will tell you about this: the largest instance on the Fediverse.</p>



<p>Oh, no, not mastodon.social. They’re big, but not as big as the largest. The largest is Pawoo, with around a million users last I checked. It’s owned by Pixiv, a Japanese company (think Japanese DeviantArt). And if Fedi knew even a rudimentary level of Japanese (this would require widespread non-Western cultural awareness they do not possess), they wouldn’t have joined in the first place. Japanese nationalism is everywhere on Pawoo, and the admins largely don’t care (granted: I don’t pay much attention to it and filtered it a long time ago, this may not be the case any longer). There is a certain irony I love about the largest Fedi instance being a commercial entity, despite the English speakers of the Fediverse largely eschewing corporations and brands. They also allow loli and (fictional) artwork of children, which is not banned in Japan but is a grey area in the US as advised by legal counsel for IF (I personally don’t want to test it, if you want to, have fun, leave me out of it).</p>



<p>Pawoo mostly sits there, under the radar, because they don’t speak English, and many instances blocked them a long time ago (I remember the great Pawoo discourse of 2017). There are tons and tons of other instances that most people don’t even know about that spew things that are far worse.  We at mst3k actually have <a href="https://mst3k.interlinked.me/about/more" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a pretty big list</a>, and it ain’t even close to how many are actually out there. I just block them as I see them. Granted, many of those instances are long-gone, but there are many more to replace them.</p>



<h3>The faux-woke crowd is making fedi less safe</h3>



<p>I know this one is going to get me flamed and called racist or whatever the fuck, but so be it.</p>



<p>Now, full disclosure: I am partially Romani, Native American, but mostly (and certainly culturally raised) white, but <a href="https://weirder.earth/@WeirderAdmin/105640549522292568" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I’ve listened to what other PoC have to say on this matter.</a></p>



<p>Fedi has a really bad problem: race-based trolling. There is a huge contingent on Fedi that is taking advantage of white guilt to troll the ever-loving fuck out of people.</p>



<p>I know this sounds like an amusing thing and is very much a “so what, they’re white” moment.  But I assure you, it’s anything but funny, and it’s causing minorities to be shed from Fedi.</p>



<p>Let me give a specific example: in mid-2020, a Jewish non-binary person was harassed by a member of one of the instances that host many of these trolls. People were still reluctant to do the right thing and block the instance, because they didn’t want to be called racist. The thing is, you can be a minority and still be a fucking dickhead, and you can also still be racist (without even realising it!) and act in bigoted ways against other minorities (go look up the Cherokee freedmen controversy for a really, really, really bad look into how far this can go). But nothing about your skin colour or ethnicity says “I can troll whoever I want.” Anyone who tells you otherwise is a troll and you should block and report them. If their admin won’t do anything, remove them.</p>



<p>The thing is, these kinds of games cheapen real racial justice. These people are less interested in racial justice for all and more interested in getting a rise out of people. And people are too afraid to stand up to it. This is a cancer silently driving people back to Twitter. I don’t think it’s the only thing stacked against Fedi, but it’s a huge one.</p>



<h3>The cancel crowd</h3>



<p>I’m going to say it: the canceldon crowd are obnoxious. They’re a holdover from Twitter and Tumblr. I won’t go into the whole “why cancelling is a waste of time” thing, but suffice it to say: cancelling doesn’t really fucking work, and it’s just a nice way of saying “doing what 4chan does to people it hates, but poorly.” Which is to say, harassment and trolling people. And of course people think it’s okay, even when they fuck up and sometimes cancel the wrong person or have bad info or got led on (this is never discussed, of course, and there is never an apology).</p>



<p>These people are literally making Fedi inherently less safe for everyone, and are no better than the crowd that used to be on Fedi (and still are to an extent) before Gargron decided to co-opt the Fediverse for his own gain.</p>



<h3>The people who write the software are fucking dickheads</h3>



<p>I’m going to be honest with you: Gargron (the guy who makes Mastodon) is an asshole. His reputation precedes him, so I won’t go into detail. However, I found out from a former IRL friend of mine (who will remain nameless) that he once asked her if he could continue to refer to her by her dead name. Said friend referred to Gargron as a “shitty liberal,” and I do not mean in the US sense.</p>



<p>The people at Pleroma are not much better. I mean, Alex Gleeson, enough said.</p>



<p>The only two relevant pieces of Fedi software are Pleroma and Mastodon. ActivityPub is such a horrible protocol, and Mastodon has butchered it so much, it’s impossible to make an interoperable implementation without man-months of work. To reimplement Mastodon from the ground up would be a nightmare. And forking Mastodon sounds great, but you’re up against a huge pile of technical debt. You could fork Pleroma, but then you’d have to know Elixir (a language few people know).</p>



<p>Also, the last time a major fork happened in Mastodon (aside from Glitch), it was mostly a group of non-developers who hoped they could cult their way into a dev team. It didn’t work.</p>



<p>I wanted to fix this problem but I decided it wasn’t worth it, and you’d have to be up against a community who is watching your every mistake and will find a reason to pillory you if you fuck up.</p>



<h3>“Mastodon” never developed a culture of its own</h3>



<p>You know, if you leave a container of yoghurt out for 4 years, it develops a culture. That’s more than can be said for the Mastodon part of Fedi, which has never outgrown being an offshoot of Twitter and Tumblr.</p>



<p>This is to its detriment, as it’s not a compelling place on the surface. People come in waves, and most leave again when Twitter and Tumblr rights its wrongs. I’ve seen this happen multiple times.</p>



<p>Mastodon users would do well to stop treating Fedi as Twitter, but of course, Mastodon and Pleroma as platforms basically both treat Fedi as Twitter expanded universe. It’s no coincidence <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/twitters-vision-of-decentralization-could-also-be-the-far-rights-internet-endgame/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gargron has joined Twitter’s federation initative.</a> I have no hopes Fedi will develop a meaningful distinct culture before its too late.</p>



<h3>The tools to protect users are rotten fruit in an opaque bag</h3>



<p><em>Note: this was edited in after the fact. I meant to include it in the original.</em></p>



<p>I’m going to say what many admins lack the bravery or vision to say: the tools to protect the users of Mastodon are inadequate. Pleroma got this better, but many Mastodon users cancel any Pleroma user on sight (as I explain below).</p>



<p>The filtering sucks (it displays “filtered” unless you choose to permanently delete any posts containing a keyword). The default guide for setting up ElasticSearch (the thing that enables search) had (may still have for all I know) no mention of using a firewall or listening only on localhost (Gargron pushed back on requests to mention this), which would enable anyone in theory to connect to …</p></div></article></div>

                    <p>Brain iron dyshomeostasis with iron accumulation is a known feature of brain aging. 
The cause of this iron accumulation is aging is unknown, but the immune system is less active in older people, and as viruses replicate more efficiently in iron-rich senescent cells, they may have developed the ability to induce this phenotype in aging host tissues.</p>

<p>It <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33220280/">has been proposed several times</a> that metal dyshomeostasis could be an underlying mechanism responsible for the initiation and progression of the pathological changes associated with neurodegenerative disorders, including the motor and extra-motor symptoms of ALS.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33491917/">new paper proposes</a> an update of the iron hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (Alzheimer's disease), based on large scale emerging evidence.</p>

<p>Iron featured historically early in Alzheimer's disease research efforts for its involvement in the amyloid and tau proteinopathies, yet iron neurochemistry remains peripheral in mainstream Alzheimer's disease research.</p>

<p>Much of the effort investigating iron in Alzheimer's disease has focused on the potential for iron to provoke the onset of disease, by promoting proteinopathy through increased protein expression, phosphorylation, and aggregation.</p>

<p>The authors provide new evidence from a large post mortem cohort that brain iron levels within the normal range are associated with accelerated ante mortem disease progression in cases with underlying proteinopathic neuropathology.</p>

<p>These results corroborate recent findings that argue for an additional downstream role for iron as an effector of neurodegeneration, acting independently of tau or amyloid pathologies.</p>

<p>The researchers hypothesize that the level of tissue iron is a trait that dictates the probability of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease by ferroptosis.</p>

<p>Ferroptosis is a type of programmed cell death dependent on iron and characterized by the accumulation of lipid peroxides, and is genetically and biochemically distinct from other forms of regulated cell death such as apoptosis.</p>

<p>Ferroptosis is initiated by the failure of the glutathione-dependent antioxidant defenses, resulting in unchecked lipid peroxidation and eventual cell death. Lipophilic antioxidants and iron chelators can prevent ferroptotic cell death.</p>

<p>A substantial body of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33513737/">preclinical evidence and early clinical data</a> has demonstrated that deferoxamine and other iron chelators have strong disease-modifying impacts in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, ischemic stroke. Acting by the disease-nonspecific pathway of iron chelation, deferoxamine targets each of these complex diseases via multifactorial mechanisms.</p>

<p>Deferiprone another iron chelator <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=Amyotrophic%20Lateral%20Sclerosis&amp;term=chelator&amp;cntry=&amp;state=&amp;city=&amp;dist=&amp;Search=Search">is tested in clinical trials against ALS</a> in France’s Lille CHU hospital.</p>

This blog post shares SPOUD’s story of engineering a simple application with Apache Kafka<sup>®</sup>, ksqlDB, and Red Hat’s Quarkus. Spoiler alert: It was a blast!</p>
<h2 id="introduction"><a id="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>We are SPOUD, a small company based in Bern, the capital of Switzerland. We’re specialised in event-driven architectures, real-time decision-making, and streaming technologies, especially Kafka. Similar to other startups with spare office space, we created a small playground in the office to play table football. Being the geeks we are, we always find ways to make simple things look fancy, which is why we created “Töggelomat” (in Swiss German, “töggele” means “table football”), an application that keeps track of game scores and matches players according to their skills. Unfortunately, due to COVID-19, we don’t play as much as we used to.</p>
<h2 id="goal"><a id="goal"></a>Goal</h2>
<p>We initially decided to make Töggelomat a reality at last year’s SPOUD hackathon. As stated earlier, we use Kafka a lot and have expertise in running clusters, connecting to data with Kafka Connect, and using AI together with stream processing. However, we hadn’t gotten the chance to really use <a href="https://ksqldb.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ksqlDB</a>, and we wanted to try it out with Quarkus.</p>
<h2 id="play"><a id="play"></a>Let’s play</h2>
<p>As we now dive deep into the technical details behind building Töggelomat, you can look at our <a href="https://github.com/spoud/toeggelomat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub project </a>for the source code. Note: the ksqlDB queries are very interesting.</p>
<p>First, we needed to think in terms of events versus static databases because everything is an event. Using the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">event sourcing technique</a>, we created a topic with a list of current employees.</p>
<p>Then, using ksqlDB queries, we created players with a starting score of 500 points.</p>
<pre>INSERT INTO toeggelomat_player
      SELECT 
            uuid,
            nickName, 
            email,
            500 as defensePoints,
            500 as offensePoints
       FROM employee;
</pre>
<p>With the query above, the <code>toeggelomat_player</code> compacted topic is filled every time a new employee is added to the topic <code>employee</code>.</p>
<p>To generate a new match, the Töggelomat application reads the last state from the <code>toeggelomat_player</code> topic and <a href="https://github.com/spoud/toeggelomat/blob/master/backend/src/main/java/io/spoud/services/MatchRandomizeService.java" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">randomizes a fair match</a>. Once the players are chosen, the application generates a new match and displays it in the front end. When the match is done, the score is entered in the UI and the application publishes the topic <code>toeggelomat_match_result</code>. The topic is visible in SPOUD’s data platform product, <a href="http://agoora.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Agoora</a>, and displays the description of the topic, the inferred schema, and the profile with some example data. Feel free to register and try it out for yourself.</p>
<p>After a match result, we need to compute the score, which is based on the skills of the players. If two higher-ranked players win against two lower-ranked players, they will not earn a lot of points. In reverse, if the lower-ranked players win, they will be generously rewarded. The point computation is done <a href="https://github.com/spoud/toeggelomat/blob/55ec5dc879169333f147b0f24f12dc183ce11042/backend/src/main/java/io/spoud/services/MatchPointsService.java#L55-L71" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in the application</a>, and the score is published on the topic <code>toeggelomat_scores</code>.</p>
<p>With ksqlDB, we create four entries (one for each player) in the topic <code>toeggelomat_point_change</code> based on the score published in the topic <code>toeggelomat_scores</code>. The point changes are then applied to the topic <code>toeggelomat_player</code>, to close the loop.<img src="https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/to%CC%88ggelomat-process.png" alt="Töggelomat process" width="701" height="447" srcset="https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/to%CC%88ggelomat-process.png 1999w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/to%CC%88ggelomat-process-300x191.png 300w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/to%CC%88ggelomat-process-1024x653.png 1024w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/to%CC%88ggelomat-process-768x489.png 768w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/to%CC%88ggelomat-process-1536x979.png 1536w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/to%CC%88ggelomat-process-350x223.png 350w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/to%CC%88ggelomat-process-600x382.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 701px) 100vw, 701px">In summary:</p>

We expose the data as an “offer,” similar to what we call them in <a href="https://agoora.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Agoora</a>. The offer has a description as well as the data schema and profile. The profile is useful to data scientists who want to look more closely at the data.<br>

<h2 id="conclusion"><a id="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It’s honestly overkill to use so many topics for such a small use case, but the main point was to learn something, and we did! First of all, Quarkus is awesome and could really be the next Spring Boot. It’s a perfect match for Kafka and the cloud in general. Its reactive nature really helps when writing an event-driven application. Plus, its startup time and low memory footprint are better than that of a standard Java application.</p>
<p>Ever since the hackathon, SPOUD has been integrating Quarkus more and more. KsqlDB is also really great and easy to use. It gives you the sense of a database management system (DBMS), but you are in fact working with event streams.</p>
<p>At the same time, you can even join streams! Isn’t that awesome? Think about all the possibilities! Yet, our use case also highlighted some pain points. For example, there is a loop, the match score is dependent on the player’s ranking, and the ranking is also influenced by the score. In a DBMS, you have a defined state at any moment, and all changes in the state are ensured by transactions. Although this makes ensuring consistency easier, events give you the flexibility to scale. For this particular use case, there is at most one match every five minutes, so the loop has the time to complete before the next match. With time-sensitive use cases, you want to avoid loops as much as possible.</p>
<p>The use case presented in this blog post used <a href="http://confluent.io/confluent-cloud">Confluent Cloud</a>, which was inexpensive since there wasn’t a lot of data.</p>

<p>Confluent also allows you to leverage ksqlDB as a service, although in our case the lowest instance available was bigger than what we were looking for. And because an SLA wasn’t essential for our use case, we decided to run our own ksqlDB server based on the documentation and using the Docker image from Confluent.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I built a financial index that <strong>rates data sets</strong> by their markets' performance (<strong>liquidity</strong> and <strong>equality of liquidity shares</strong>). <strong>Check out the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rugpullindex.com/">website</a></strong> and the minimalistic <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rugpullindex.com/changelog.txt">blog</a>, or keep on reading the article.</p>
<p><img src="https://timdaub.github.io/assets/images/rugpullindex.png" alt="A screenshot of the
rugpullindex.com website"></p>
<h2 id="why-building-a-data-set-index">Why Building a Data Set Index?</h2>
<p><strong>Would you pay a stranger on the internet</strong> to buy a data set they're offering without knowing them or ever having seen the data? Tough decision! But that's precisely the type of situation <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a> users face in its newly-launched decentralized <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">data set market</a> [3].</p>
<p>I'll spare you most of the details of how it all works and say this: 2020's most transforming technology has been <strong>on-chain markets</strong>. In particular, the implementation that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://uniswap.org/">uniswap.org</a> is using called <strong>automated market makers</strong>.</p>
<p>Simply put, they work by incentivizing users to <em>pool</em> a pair of assets at a ratio they deem as the assets' current prices. These users, I herein call them <strong>liquidity providers</strong>, e.g., pool 1 ETH and 540 USDC, so that when a buyer of either asset comes along, they can immediately trade 1 ETH for 540 USDC or 540 USDC for 1 ETH. This principle works fantastically at scale, as the pool incentivizes liquidity-providing by charging buyers and sellers a small fee, which is distributed by the pool to each liquidity provider, respectively [1].</p>
<p><img src="https://timdaub.github.io/assets/images/marketmakers.png"></p>
<p>This model has been so successful that there've been days where decentralized trading on Uniswap outperformed volumes on Coinbase! Which, of course, has lots of implications on the cryptocurrency space. I think it's no overstatement to say that automated market makers may be <strong>the killer app for crypto</strong>.</p>

<p>But there's one implication I've been particularly keen on exploring: all <strong>the openly-accessible data produced by on-chain markets</strong>. See, if you ever tried building a trading bot, you'll have noticed the terrible resolution publicly-available market data has. You might have also noticed that it's quite difficult even to find data at all. It's not by accident. <strong>Trading data is valuable</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="rating-a-data-set-by-its-markets-performance">Rating a Data Set by its Market's Performance</h2>
<p>Remember when I asked you at the beginning of this article about <strong>buying a data set from a random stranger on the internet?</strong> Well, it turns out that Ocean Protocol is now betting on the same technology that made Uniswap successful. They allow users to publish a data set, along with a fungible <strong>data token</strong> and an integrated <strong>automated market maker</strong>. Meaning, you can now buy access to a data set by purchasing tokens. These tokens get priced by liquidity providers providing a ratio of OCEAN Tokens to <em>data tokens</em>.</p>
<p>However, just because data sets are now available for sale on the market, doesn't mean you know they're valuable! After all, if ebay.com didn't have a rating system for sellers, how would you know which seller to trust?</p>
<p>On ebay.com, you know which seller to trust because you can see how many articles they've sold and what each buyer's experience was. It's a simple identity-based rating system.</p>
<p>But within the anarchistic world of cryptocurrencies, there are no working identity-based rating systems! Instead, the space is filled with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sock_puppet_account">sock puppets</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack">sybils</a>. <strong>Then, without buying a data set first, how are we supposed to know if a data set is valuable or an outright scam?</strong></p>
<h2 id="introducing-rugpullindex.com">Introducing rugpullindex.com</h2>
<p>That's where <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rugpullindex.com/">rugpullindex.com</a> comes into play. <strong>We crawl all of Ocean Protocol's data token pools daily</strong> and rate each market's liquidity provider distribution by its equality using the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient">Gini coefficient</a>. While ranking markets based on their liquidity is common industry-practice, calculating a Gini score for each market's liquidity provider shares isn't. The idea behind this is that the more liquidity providers with an equal share back an asset in the market, the less likely it is for a "rug pull" attack to happen (details <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/multi-repo-issue/issues/30#issuecomment-726132174">here</a>). By factoring in a pool's relative liquidity, it allows us to derive a score <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>s</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">s</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> that is <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn><mo>&lt;</mo><mi>s</mi><mo>&lt;</mo><mn>100</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0 &lt; s &lt; 100</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>
<p>For users of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rugpullindex.com/">rugpullindex.com</a>, this <strong>yields a few attractive benefits</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>They can now choose to adjust their data set investments based on market data.</li>
<li>They can decide to invest in data sets relative to their performance on to <em>increase their diversivication and hence lower their exposure risk</em>. And finally;</li>
<li>If they're unsure about <strong>sending a random stranger on the internet money for a data set</strong>, they can check out the data set's market performance to make an informed decision.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's a widely-known fact that index-based investment yields superior results compared to stock picking [2]. The same is true when <em>investing</em> in data, which makes me excited about working on this project.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-the-future-hold">What Does The Future Hold?</h2>
<p>I have many ideas for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rugpullindex.com/">rugpullindex.com</a> and not as much time as I'd like to have. However, my overarching goal is to make the ranking so reliable that I can build a smart contract-based index fund on top of it.</p>
<p>I think that rating assets based on their markets' performance is valuable occupation in itself. Not only within the data set market but beyond. I'm particularly interested in rating a wide range of on-chain asset markets, but I'm also thinking about rating more on-chain intellectual property markets. I'm eager to crawl more data and explore. Until then, I hope you're having fun using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rugpullindex.com/">rugpullindex.com</a>.</p>

February 2, 2021 | https://www.jotaen.net/9zRPA/klog-time-tracking-plain-textfiles/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.jotaen.net/9zRPA/klog-time-tracking-plain-textfiles/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <main>
      

      <p>One topic that kept me thinking on and off for a couple of years now is time tracking. That is for very practical reasons, as I was (and still am) interested to keep track of my working hours. Back in the day, when I used to work full-time, I wanted to know how well on track I was with the 40&nbsp;hours that I agreed to devote to my employer. Nowadays, as a freelancer, I need to log my working hours for bookkeeping reasons, as my invoices are based on an hourly rate.</p>

<p>There exist countless web services for time tracking, some of which offering an impressive feature set that cater for all imaginable use-cases. However, I never felt too much appeal to use them. It’s not that I have any special requirements or practice an extravagant workflow. My reluctance is instead stemming from a conceptual thought: keeping track of times is a rather mundane and simple thing to do, so why rely on (semi-) commercial online services that build on complex technology stacks for something that you can basically do with a pencil and a piece of paper?</p>

<p>What did the trick somewhat well for me throughout the years was a spreadsheet that I setup and maintained by hand. It allowed me to enter data quickly and I could also run some simple evaluations, e.g. in order to aggregate the entries by week or month. While this solution was both simple and flexible, it also felt a bit cumbersome, especially for things like writing more sophisticated formulas or configuring pivot tables. As luck would have it I am in the fortunate position of being able to build my own tools. But before we get to this I need to share another thing with you first.</p>

<p>The longer I have been working with computers the more I appreciate the freedom and simplicity of plain text files: not being bound to proprietary software for opening or editing them; not being exposed to the risk that your data gets sold to advertising companies; no lock-in on arbitrary subscription plans; no connectivity issues that would prevent or slow down access. Instead, the data is just there, it’s all yours and you can rest assured that you will be able to work with it for decades to come. Viewing or manipulating the files can be done with any off-the-shelf text editor, and syncing them across multiple devices is as easy as putting them into your Dropbox folder. While plain-text formats don’t work for each and every application obviously, they seem to be a more than reasonable choice for this task here.</p>

<p>Born out of this conception I experimented with different formats to record time tracking data using plain text files. Over the past weeks I tried out various structures to model and layout the information. What I came up with is a lightweight format with minimal syntax that I called “klog”. The idea is to record the data in a similar style as you would using a physical notebook: it’s basically the date, then time-related entries such as a time range or duration of how long something took, and maybe a short note about what you did.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jotaen.net/posts/2021-01-31-klog/demo.gif" alt="A terminal window demonstrating the file format and the command line tool usage"></p>

<p>I implemented a parser for the klog file format along with a small command line tool that allows to evaluate the data programatically. You find the project <a href="https://github.com/jotaen/klog">on Github</a>, where you can also download the binary in order to experiment with klog. If you happen to be interested in this idea I’d appreciate some feedback and learn about your use-cases – drop me an <a href="https://www.jotaen.net/mail">email</a> or open an issue on Github. klog obviously fits <em>my</em> needs, but I aimed for making it general-purpose enough so that other people may find it useful too.</p>

<p>Building klog was not just a fun programming exercise, I also ran into some interesting questions along the way: is it necessary to support timezones? Is it okay to restrict time values to hours and minutes, but to omit the seconds part for convenience? What if someone starts an activity close to midnight and finishes it on the next day, like working a night shift? Which of the numerous date and time notations need to be understood? How can you start tracking something that’s not yet finished and therefore doesn’t have an end time? I wrote a brief guide (that you find in the repository) that gives a tour of klog and also covers these questions.</p>

<p>The command line tool is fairly minimalistic for now, as I first and foremostly want to validate that my basic idea sustains before investing more work into it. The cli tool has read-only functionality so far and can basically pretty-print, filter and evaluate files. I attributed special attention to error handling, so in case there are formatting errors you should see precise and (hopefully) helpful error messages. The application is written in Go, which ensures that it runs cross-platform without relying on runtime dependencies, and – as a bonus – it’s also quite fast even on large data sets.</p>

<p>And as for the name, “klog” is what we call a “Kofferwort” in German: since my original use-case was tracking work times it is a blend of the two terms “work” and “log”.</p>

                            <p>This article aims to provide a fair and thorough comparison of the current private messaging apps in terms of their privacy, security, and anonymity†. However, it must be abundantly clear that this post is written by Status (one of the above messengers). We strongly encourage you to verify our sources, do your own due diligence, and correct us if we are wrong.</p><p><em>†For the purposes of simplicity for the average reader, anonymity will be defined as a complete dissociation of one's chat identity and their true identity.</em></p><h2 id="signal"><strong>Signal</strong><br></h2><h3 id="what-can-signal-servers-see">What can Signal servers see?</h3><p>Not much. Your messages, attachments, calls, sender metadata, group chats and group metadata are all end-to-end encrypted. However, Signal (and Amazon) can infer who talks to who with a fair degree of accuracy by analyzing the network traffic. Signal is the only entity that runs the Signal servers, and <a href="https://signal.org/blog/looking-back-on-the-front/">they host all such servers on Amazon Web Services</a>. Here is a simple breakdown of what the network traffic could look like if Alice (1.1.1.1) sent a message to Bob (2.2.2.2):</p><p><strong>08:23:02</strong> — IP Address 1.1.1.1 sends 512 bytes to Signal's server.</p><p><strong>08:23:04</strong> — IP Address 2.2.2.2 receives 512 bytes from Signal's server.</p><p>This is what Jeff Bezos can see. Now, this, on its own, doesn't necessarily mean that Alice is talking to Bob. It could just be a coincidence — Bob happened to receive a different and entirely unrelated packet two seconds after Alice sent one of equal size.</p><p>However, if this coincidence were to happen, ten, twenty or a hundred times, with packets of equal sizes going back and forth from Alice and Bob, it would soon become apparent that these two IP addresses are likely talking to each other. At this point, one simply has to ask the respective Internet Service Provider (such as Comcast or AT&amp;T) who is behind a given IP address to uncover their legal identity.</p><p>So basically, Jeff Bezos can know who you talk to on Signal with a fair degree of accuracy via traffic analysis. This can be done even without Signal's cooperation, as Amazon has direct access to all incoming and outgoing traffic on the centralized Signal servers. In fact, Moxie Marlinspike, the creator of Signal, <a href="https://youtu.be/Nj3YFprqAr8?t=2034">acknowledged this flaw in the Q&amp;A session</a> of his 36C3 talk "The ecosystem is moving."</p><p>If Signal were to cooperate in such traffic analysis attacks, it would become much easier, as Signal does have access to the recipient metadata (<a href="https://signal.org/blog/sealed-sender/">but not sender metadata</a>). In other words, they can see who the envelope is addressed to, but not who it came from. This, in addition to the traffic analysis, would allow Signal to infer nearly all the sender/recipient metadata, in addition to some of the group metadata.</p><h3 id="is-signal-anonymous">Is Signal anonymous?</h3><p>No. You are required to provide your phone number — which, in many parts of the world, is synonymous with providing your government-issued ID. In addition, Signal will leak your IP address to your contacts that call you by default (you can change this in the settings by enabling the option "Always Relay Calls"). Signal also has the technical capability of associating your IP address and your Signal account (<a href="https://signal.org/bigbrother/">but they probably don't do this</a>). This means that even a burner number isn't enough for total anonymity if you assume the Signal servers are malicious or compromised.<br></p><p>It is worth noting that Signal has never claimed to be an anonymous tool. These points do not detract from the fact that they do care about your privacy — they are simply approaching it in a different manner.</p><h3 id="is-signal-easy-to-shut-down">Is Signal easy to shut down?</h3><p>If you don't have any faith in the US government, the answer is yes. If you do, the answer is probably not. Signal is the sole operator of the Signal servers, and they are based in the United States. There is no federation, and there is no peer-to-peer architecture. If Signal is legally compelled to shut down their servers, that's it. All forms of communication through Signal would immediately halt. However, the likelihood of such an event is debatable, and will be left to the reader.</p><p>It would be very difficult to quickly move Signal to a different jurisdiction, as they have thus far operated under the assumption that the US will not ban them. Moxie Marlinspike lives in the US, as does the overwhelming majority of Signal's employees, and their only two legal entities <a href="https://signal.org/legal/">were incorporated in the US</a>. In addition, given the centralized nature of their server architecture, Signal themselves could shut down Signal (this may seem obvious, but certain decentralized architectures prevent even the creator of something from shutting it down, such as Bitcoin).</p><hr><h2 id="telegram"><strong>Telegram</strong><br></h2><h3 id="what-can-telegram-servers-see">What can Telegram servers see?</h3><p>Basically everything. They can see <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/710344/psa-telegram-chats-arent-end-to-end-encrypted-by-default/">every message you've ever sent in a group chat</a>, most of your 1:1 conversations (not secret chats), all your contacts, your profile picture and your bio. They know who you talk to, and at what time (even if it's a secret chat!). They know the members, name, and icon of every single group (including private ones) .</p><p>This may sound completely contrary to what Telegram says. The reason is that Telegram fundamentally operates on a different trust model. They assume that you trust Telegram, but not the government.</p><p>Telegram splits up their encryption keys and stores the separate pieces in several different jurisdictions. In theory, this means that all of the jurisdictions used by Telegram would have to cooperate in order to obtain any user data. They claim this has allowed them to <a href="https://telegram.org/faq#q-do-you-process-data-requests">not release a single byte of user data</a>. These claims, by their very nature, are unverifiable, and require that you trust Telegram. If that's good enough for you, use Telegram.</p><h3 id="is-telegram-anonymous">Is Telegram anonymous?</h3><p>Kinda. If you trust Telegram, then Telegram can be anonymous, as you are given the option hide your phone number and use a username of your choice. If you don't trust Telegram, it is not anonymous in any way, as they will have your phone number and <a href="https://telegram.org/privacy#5-2-safety-and-security">they can see your IP address</a>.</p><h3 id="is-telegram-easy-to-shut-down">Is Telegram easy to shut down?</h3><p>Probably not. Telegram intentionally set up its legal structure to be agile and resistant to overreaching governments. If Dubai (<a href="https://telegram.org/privacy#8-2-telegrams-group-companies">their current jurisdiction</a>) bans them, they would likely move to another. Dubai is a flag of convenience for Telegram. However, given the centralized nature of their server architecture, Telegram themselves could shut down Telegram.</p><hr><h2 id="whatsapp"><strong>WhatsApp</strong><br></h2><h3 id="what-can-whatsapp-servers-see">What can WhatsApp servers see?</h3><p>All the metadata, but none of the content. They can see your profile picture, who you talk to, and when. They can see who is a member of a given private group, the group icon, the group name, and which members are the administrators of said group. But your messages, pictures, attachments, status updates and calls are all end-to-end encrypted.</p><p>However, it is very important to note that the end-to-end encryption of WhatsApp messages has been repeatedly compromised through <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2018/09/04/whatsapp-backups-android/">unencrypted Google or iCloud backups</a>. Although these backups are technically optionally, they are repeatedly suggested to the user with a coercive user interface. Even if you do not enable these backups, there is a good chance your conversation partner did, which compromises the integrity of the end-to-end encryption for both of you.</p><h3 id="is-whatsapp-anonymous">Is WhatsApp anonymous?</h3><p>No. You are required to provide your phone number — which, in many parts of the world, is synonymous with providing your government-issued ID. In addition, WhatsApp <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/privacy-policy/?lang=en">logs your IP address</a> and directly associates it with your chat identity.</p><h3 id="is-whatsapp-easy-to-shut-down">Is WhatsApp easy to shut down?</h3><p>Not really, given the scale of Facebook and the nature of public corporations. However, it is very likely that WhatsApp could be forced to include a backdoor into their clients. There would be no way around this, as the clients are all proprietary. With all other messaging apps in this list, one could simply download the code prior to the backdoor, build it, and run that version of the client which still correctly encrypts the messages. Decentralized messaging architectures such as Status or Matrix would be even more resilient against such coercion, as there would be no central servers to shut down.</p><hr><h2 id="matrix"><strong>Matrix</strong><br></h2><h3 id="what-can-federated-matrix-servers-see">What can federated Matrix servers see?</h3><p>All the metadata, but none of the content. They can see your profile picture, your private room aliases, your device names, who you talk to, and when. They can see who is a member of a given private room, the room icon, the room name, and which members are the administrators of said room. They can see who talks and when in private rooms. But your messages, pictures and files are all end-to-end encrypted by default.</p><p>Although some homeserver implementations have <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/4565#issuecomment-540320761">stopped storing this metadata by default</a>, all homeservers still have the technical ability to access it. Some of these metadata issues may be resolved with the latest developments in <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/06/02/introducing-p-2-p-matrix">P2P Matrix</a>, but it is unclear as to whether or not this will be effective in regards to room metadata such as membership or administrator privileges.</p><p>It should be noted that the relative ease of hosting your own Matrix server diminishes the value of any metadata leaks. If all of your contacts use a Matrix server that you trust (which could be one that you host), it doesn't matter if the server can see this metadata. However, in practice, most people just use someone else's server (such as the matrix.org one).</p><h3 id="is-matrix-anonymous">Is Matrix anonymous?</h3><p>Kinda. If you trust the federated homeserver you are connected to not to disclose your IP address, you are anonymous.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div><p>This review is largely in response to the article "<a href="https://qntm.org/clean">It's probably time to stop recommending Clean Code</a>", and the ensuing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/hhlvqq/its_probably_time_to_stop_recommending_clean_code/">Reddit discussion</a>.  A lot of really interesting points were brought up, but the big question that the author themself wasn't able to answer was: "What should we recommend instead?"</p>
<p>I believe the book we should be recommending is <em>A Philosophy of Software Design</em> by John Ousterhout.  In this post I want to spend a bit of time reviewing it and giving an overview of the contents, and then I want to explain why, in my opinion, it is such a good recommendation.</p>
<h2 id="an-empirical-philosophy-book">An Empirical Philosophy Book</h2>
<p>The elevator pitch of John Ousterhout's book <em>A Philosophy of Software Design</em> is fairly simple: he is a university professor (albeit one with almost two decades of experience in the "real world", also the inventor of Tcl, creator of RAFT, company founder amongst <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/lb8zrn/an_alternative_to_clean_code_a_philosophy_of/glt3e4n/">other things</a>), who each year teaches students how to actually design software in a practical, hands-on course where the students are expected to design and modify "a substantial piece of software" in an iterative way, hopefully understanding more about the practice of software design each time around.</p>
<p>The book, then, is a synthesis of the pieces of wisdom that Ousterhout has himself learned from his own experiences, tempered and refined by the practical examples he has been able to draw from his students.  In this way, it has a (somewhat) scientific, research-based approach, where the author's assertions are backed up with examples from student projects that worked (or didn't).</p>
<p>At it's core, though, this is still philosophy - the book doesn't just list the things that worked well, and the things that worked poorly.  Instead, Ousterhout attempts in each chapter to divine broader truths that apply to software design in general.  There are no lists of what to do and what not to do, but instead principles to follow, red flags to be aware of, and warnings against taking anything too far.</p>
<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>
<p>The book is split into a series of chapters, each of which generally explores a single principle.  These range from the very high level ("Working Code Isn't Enough", "Modules Should Be Deep") to the more practical questions ("Choosing Names").  The whole book is relatively short (about 180 pages), and many chapters flow together nicely, which means that it's quite easy to go from cover-to-cover, rather than approach the book as a reference manual.  That said, the final pages provide summaries of the design principles and red flags found in the book, making it easy to reference key parts of the book.</p>
<p>Within each chapter, Ousterhout generally starts by stating a problem or motivation that software engineers will face, and then defining a principle to solve this.  The rest of the chapter is then a discussion of the principle, the dangers of alternative approaches, the red flags that indicate that the principle needs to be applied (or in some cases avoided), and some notes about taking ideas too far.</p>
<p>The examples are often based on problems that Ousterhout has given his classes, which means that they generally feel meaty enough to be worth discussing.  An example of a text editor appears in Chapter 6, but is extended in Chapters 7, 8, 9, and 10 in different contexts.  Enough is omitted from most examples to make the point clear, but enough is kept in to give the feeling of real code.</p>
<h2 id="ousterhout-s-principles">Ousterhout's Principles</h2>
<p>The overriding theme throughout the book is that good code <em>looks</em> good.  Ousterhout thinks very much in terms of abstraction and interfaces - where "interfaces" refers to the contact points between different units of abstraction, rather than any similarly-named construct in any particular language.  Most of the book is dedicated to figuring out how to spot bad abstractions and rework them into good abstractions.</p>
<p>To a certain extent, this feels at odds with certain common mantras in software engineering circles today, where we encourage enough other to Keep It Simple, Stupid, and worry about premature abstractions.  <em>Philosophy</em> seems to worry less about the dangers of over-abstraction, and more concerned with how to make sure that the chosen abstraction is a good one.</p>
<p>This approach makes for a more positive experience than in many other programming circles - rather than being warned into a very conservative approach, Ousterhout encourages his readers to go out and make abstractions, but to be careful about designing the correct ones.</p>
<p>This isn't to say that the book isn't also cautionary - in the summary pages at the back, the list of red flags gets more page space than the list of principles, and throughout the book these red flags mark out moments when readers are given the go ahead to use these abstraction techniques.  There are also warnings about when a principle might be used too much.</p>
<h2 id="everyone-s-a-critic">Everyone's a Critic</h2>
<p>Beyond the mild danger of encouraging excess abstraction, the biggest issue in <em>Philosophy</em> is probably the missing parts - the topic of testing gets a single page in Chapter 19 (Software Trends), and ideas about effective use of a type system to avoid issues are largely ignored.  Ousterhout's principles will still apply in these areas, but it would be nice to see some more specific discussion of these areas.</p>
<h2 id="the-target-audience">The Target Audience</h2>
<p>It can be a bit unclear at times to whom Ousterhout writes.  A lot of the examples clearly relate to his students, and the projects that they come from have a somewhat academic feel - a text editor here, and an HTTP protocol parser there.  The code in the examples is generally object-oriented (Java and occasional C++), although it generally feels like it could be replaced with most imperative/OO languages without much of an effect.</p>
<p>The use of the phrase "software design" might make one think more of broader software architecture, but Ousterhout uses it more to describe the design of individual modules and functions <em>within</em> a program, rather than the broader architecture of the program itself (although he occasionally touches on that).</p>
<p>More functionally-minded people might think they can simply side-step a lot of the discussion here, in the same way that they can when discussing the Gang of Four's design patterns, but the principle "design errors out of existence" (Chapter 10) and its corollary "design special cases out of existence" should ring bells for people in this area who are also aware of the principle of making illegal states unrepresentable.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I think this book aims at a space that is slightly deeper than a lot of existing software literature.  Where books like <em>Design Patterns</em>, Fowler's <em>Refactoring</em>, and the aforementioned <em>Clean Code</em> are aimed at more traditional "enterprise" software development, <em>Philosophy</em> feels more widely applicable, albeit at the cost of being more abstract and difficult to apply.</p>
<p>In general, I think <em>Philosophy</em> is a good read if you are both (a) working with software regularly, and (b) conscious of the inherent maintenance cost in software, and aiming to minimise it.</p>
<h2 id="a-book-to-recommend">A Book to Recommend</h2>
<p>The original question I wanted to answer was what we, as software engineers, should recommend over books like <em>Clean Code</em>.  As I said, my answer to that question is <em>A Philosophy of Software Design</em>.</p>
<p>Software engineering (indeed, engineering in general) is not a science, insofar as there are no (or at least very few) exact answers.  Everything from the database you use to your choice of testing strategy will be dependent on the context of the software you're writing.  This means that the advice that we give to each other will probably be very context-specific.  In general, you probably shouldn't use a NoSQL database, but in a lot of specific contexts you probably should.</p>
<p>This isn't a problem if we don't run into these exceptional cases often, but engineering is all about exceptional cases - if there were no exceptional cases, we wouldn't need to write any new software, because our existing tools would do the job.  This is where books like <em>Philosophy</em> come in - rather than give situational advice, it attempts to define wider principles that the reader will then need to apply to different situations.</p>
<p>Take, for example, my favourite principle: "Modules should be deep" (explored in Chapter 4).  The idea is that an individual unit of abstraction should do a lot of work (i.e. be deep, and contain a lot of complexity), but it should have a relatively simple interface (i.e. be narrow).  Essentially, if you're going to abstract something, make sure your abstraction is deep.</p>
<p>Notice that this principle says nothing about functions, classes, lines, blocks, parameters, or anything specific to a single language or paradigm.  However, when we apply it, for example to the Java code Robert C. Martin talks about in <em>Clean Code</em>, we can derive some of his ideas from this principle.  Assuming a function is our unit of abstraction (for now, at least), the parameters are its interface, therefore we should reduce the number of parameters to the minimum necessary.</p>
<p>However, because our principle is more general, we can actually correct some of the mistakes Martin makes.  Martin talks about removing parameters by adding private fields to the class that the method belongs to.  When we think in terms of interfaces, we notice that this <em>hasn't decreased the interface at all</em> - we've lost a parameter, but we've gained a private field, and in the process made things harder for the consumer of our abstraction.</p>
<h2 id="teaching-principles-over-rules">Teaching Principles Over Rules</h2>
<p>When I recommend books, I generally hope that the other person will learn something from the book I have suggested.  If I were to recommend <em>Clean Code</em>, I would hope that the reader would learn something about how to write clean Java code, but I suspect they would mainly learn how to write code like Robert C. Martin - or more accurately, like someone copying Robert C. Martin's actions without always understanding why he's taking them.</p>
<p>I do not feel this way about <em>A Philosophy of Software Design</em>.  When I recommend it, I …</p></div></div></div>

<p>My team writes a lot of command line tools, and we like to assume that people aren’t using a literal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100">VT100</a> (meaning: we liberally use colours, italics, and basically every other terminal feature available to us). This tends to result in strings in our code that look a little like this:</p>
<pre><code>"\x1b[A\r\x1b[K\x1b[1;32mopened \x1b[1;4;34m%s\x1b[0;1;32m in your browser.\x1b[0m\n"</code></pre>
<p>If you’re like most people, your face just melted, but it’s actually really simple. This page is a crash course in what all of these things mean, and how to learn to read and write them effectively.</p>
<h3 id="x1b"><code>\x1b</code></h3>
<p>ANSI escapes always start with <code>\x1b</code>, or <code>\e</code>, or <code>\033</code>. These are all the same thing: they’re just various ways of inserting the byte 27 into a string. If you look at an <a href="http://www.asciitable.com/">ASCII table</a>, <code>0x1b</code> is literally called <code>ESC</code>, and this is basically why.</p>
<h3 id="control-sequences">Control sequences</h3>
<p>The majority of these escape codes start with <code>\x1b[</code>. This pair of bytes is referred to as <code>CSI</code>, or “Control Sequence Introducer”. By and large, a control sequence looks like:</p>
<pre><code>0x1B + "[" + &lt;zero or more numbers, separated by ";"&gt; + &lt;a letter&gt;</code></pre>
<p>It’s helpful to think of it this way: the terminating letter is a function name, and the intervening numbers as function arguments, delimited by semicolons rather than the typical commas.</p>
<p>If you see <code>\x1b[0;1;34m</code>, you can read it like this:</p>
<pre><code>\x1b[  # call a function
0;1;34 # function arguments (0, 1, 34)
m      # function name</code></pre>
<p>In effect, this is <code>m(0, 1, 34)</code>. Similarly, <code>\x1b[A</code> is just <code>A()</code>.</p>
<h3 id="available-functions">Available functions</h3>
<p>So with that mental model—reading escape sequences as function invocations—here’s an abridged documentation of the “standard library”, as it were:</p>

<p>Multiple SGR arguments can always be concatenated using another <code>;</code>, and they will be applied in the order they are encountered. It’s especially common to see <code>0;</code> before some other argument, in order to reset the state before applying our own.</p>
<h3 id="colour-palettes">Colour Palettes</h3>
<p>The basic colour palette has 8 entries:</p>
<ul>
<li>0: black</li>
<li>1: red</li>
<li>2: green</li>
<li>3: yellow</li>
<li>4: blue</li>
<li>5: magenta</li>
<li>6: cyan</li>
<li>7: white</li>
</ul>
<p>A useful way to help remember this, or at least to select colours for use, is that, with the exception of 0/black, the colours are ordered by usefulness, with highest first: red text is very useful for indicating failures, green is useful for indicating extreme success, yellow for warnings, and then blue, magenta, and cyan for progressively more obscure conditions or decoration.</p>
<p>0 and 7 are less useful for text because one or the other will generally look nearly-unreadable depending on whether the user has a light or a dark background.</p>
<p>Terminals will also have a “bright” version of this palette (activated using 90–97 / 100–107). These are the same (black/red/green/etc.) but generally noticeably brighter than their regular counterparts.</p>
<p>For practice, you might try to figure out how this string would display:</p>
<pre><code>\x1b[38;2;255;255;0mH\x1b[0;1;3;35me\x1b[95ml\x1b[42ml\x1b[0;41mo\x1b[0m</code></pre>
<h3 id="miscellany">Miscellany</h3>
<p>Another pair of useful escapes is <code>\x1b[?25h</code> and <code>\x1b[?25l</code>. These show and hide the cursor, respectively. Try not to think too hard about the syntax here: <code>?25</code> means something to do with the cursor and <code>h</code> and <code>l</code> stand for “high” and “low”: imagine a bit indicating whether the cursor should be visible. The “high” value (1) would indicate “show”; the “low” value (0) would indicate “hide”.</p>
<p>Show/hide is useful when you’re going to draw some stuff that’ll cause the cursor to jump around like crazy, for example, repainting a couple of the last few lines to update them with new content.</p>
<p>One other thing that we use frequently is <code>\r</code>, or Carriage Return, which is functionally similar or identical to <code>\x1b[1G</code>. It just moves the cursor to the start of the line.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>That was a lot of information, but that’s essentially everything you need to know in order to competently read and write ANSI escape codes in a terminal.</p>

inspired by <a href="http://www.pandagon.net/mtarchives/001749.html">pandagon</a>: a meta-proof of P=/!=NP, coming to a <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;group=comp.theory">newsgroup near you</a>:
</p><p>
P: I would like to announce my proof of P=/!=NP. The proof is very short and demonstrates how to solve/not solve SAT in polynomial time. You may find a write up of the proof <a href="http://">here</a>.
</p><p>
|-- V: I started reading your proof and when you claim 'foobar' do you mean 'foobar' or 'phishbang' ? 
<br>|----P: I meant 'phishbang'. Thanks for pointing that out. An updated version is <a href="http://">here.</a>
<br>|------V: Well if you meant 'phishbang' then statement "in this step we assume the feefum" is incorrect.
<br>|--------P: No no, you don't understand. I can assume feefum because my algorithm has a glemish.
<br>|-----------V: It has a glemish ? !! But having a glemish doesn't imply anything. All algorithms have glemishes !!
<br>|----V': Yes, and in fact in the 3rd step of argument 4, your glemish contradicts the first propum. 
<br>|--V'': I think you need to understand some basic facts about complicity theory before you can go further. Here is a book to read.
<br>|----P: My proof is quite clear, and I don't see why I have to explain it to you if you don't understand. I have spent a long time on this.
<br>|------V': Um, this is a famous problem, and there are many false proofs, and so you do have to convince us that the argument using glemishes can   actually work.
<br>|--------P: But what is wrong in my proof ? I don't see any problems with it, and if you can't point one out, how can you say it is wrong.
<br>|----------V'''': I don't have to read the entire proof: glemished algorithms are well known not to work.
<br>|------------V'''''': Check out this reference by </p><well known="" person=""> to see why.
<br>P: &lt;silence&gt;
<br>|--P: &lt;answering earlier post&gt;. This is what I mean by a glemish. it is really a flemish, not a glemish, which answers your objection.
<br>|----P': Keep up the good work P. I tried publishing my result, and these people savaged my proof without even trying to identify a problem. All great mathematical progress has come from amateurs like us. See this <a href="http://">link</a> of all the theorems proved by non-experts.
<br>|------V': Oh jeez, not P' again. I thought we had established that your proof was wrong.
<br>|--------P': no you didn't: in fact I have a new version that explains the proof in such simple language even dumb&amp;%&amp;%s like you can get it.
<br>|------P: Thanks P', I understand that there will be resistance from the community since I have proved what they thought to be so hard. 
<br>|--V': P, I'm trying to understand your proof, with the flemishes, and it seems that maybe there is a problem in step 517 with the brouhaha technique.
<br>P: &lt;silence&gt;
<br>|----P: V', thanks for pointing out that mistake. you are right. Instead of a brouhaha technique I need a slushpit. The details are complicated, so I will fix it and post a corrected version of the proof shortly. Thanks to all those who gave me constructive advice. I am glad that at least some of you have an open mind to accept new ideas. 
<hr>
<p>
This was prompted by the latest P=NP fiasco on comp.theory. I can only express my amazement and wonder at the few tireless souls (and they seem to be the same ones) who patiently try to address each new crackpot proof that comes down the pipe.

	<p><em>Faced with yet another crisis caused by a bug hidden in a cold path, I found
myself Googling for a quick link to Slack out to the engineering team about cold paths.
Unfortunately, I can’t find a focused write-up; and so here I am writing this.</em></p>

<p>A <strong>cold path</strong> is a path through the code or situation that rarely happens. By contrast,
<strong>hot paths</strong>
happen frequently. You don’t find bugs in hot paths. By nature, bugs are found
in places that you didn’t think to look. Bugs are always in cold paths — every bug is
found in a path colder than all the paths you tested.</p>

<p>Here are some real world “cold paths” with big consequences:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://blog.thousandeyes.com/impacts-expired-tls-certificate/">An outage caused by an expired TLS certificate</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem">Y2K</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Rare events are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Improbable-Robustness-Fragility/dp/081297381X">hard to predict</a>. That’s just the nature of them. As engineers,
I belive it’s our responsibility to do our best to try harder and get better at planning for
these rare bugs. Is that it? Try harder?</p>

<p>Better: Don’t have cold paths</p>


<p>I watched one of Gil Tene’s many amazing talks on Azul’s C4 garbage collector (not <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Java-GC-Azul-C4/">this talk</a>,
but similar) where he claimed that normally it takes 10 years to harden a garbage
collector. Azul didn’t have 10 years to produce a viable business, so they avoided almost all
cold paths in the collector and they were able to harden it in 4 years (I never tried verifying
this claim).</p>

<p>For a garbage collector, this means things like offering fewer options, or having a simpler
model to avoid cold paths around promoting objects between generations. For your app it will
mean something different.</p>

<p>You can <strong>test less</strong> to achieve high quality by <strong>reducing the size</strong> of your application. 
Less edge cases is equivalent to less testing surface area, which implies less testing work
and fewer missed test cases. There’s something to be said for avoiding config options and
making solutions less generic.</p>


<p>While I worked at AWS I had this beaten into my skull, but thankfully they’ve published 
guidence an excellent piece titled <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/avoiding-fallback-in-distributed-systems/?did=ba_card&amp;trk=ba_card">“avoiding fallback in distributed systems”</a>. The 
hope is that, when system 1 fails you would like to automatically fallback to system 2.</p>

<p>For example, let’s say we have a process that sends logs to another service. For the hot 
path, we send logs directly via an HTTP request. But if the log service fails (e.g. 
overloaded, maintenence, etc.) we fallback by writing to a file and have a secondary process 
send those logs to the service when it comes back.</p>

<ul>
  <li>System 1: directly send logs to server</li>
  <li>System 2: send asynchronously via file append</li>
</ul>

<p>If system 2 is more reliable than system 1, then why don’t we always choose system 2? 
Always write to the file and ship logs asynchronously rather than send directly to the 
server. This is surprisingly strong logic that isn’t considered often enough. More often,
by asking the question you end up finding a way to make system 1 more robust.</p>

<p>In cases where fallback can’t be avoided they suggest always exercising the fallback. 
For example, on every request, randomly decide to use either system 1 or system 2, 
thereby ensuring that the cold path isn’t cold because both are exercised on the hot path,
at least sometimes.</p>


<p>In <a href="https://danluu.com/deconstruct-files/">“files are fraught with problems”</a>, Dan Luu demonstrates that it’s unexpectedly
difficult to write a file to disk correctly. Juggling issues like handling random power loss or 
strange ext4 behavior becomes a full-time job. It’s a lot to keep in your head, just to 
write a file.</p>

<p>Is it better to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ignore the cold paths and hope for the best</li>
  <li>Correctly implement &amp; test each file write event and ship late</li>
  <li>Use a system that does it correctly for you, like MySQL or SQLite</li>
</ol>

<p>Choice #3 delegates the testing of all those pesky cold paths to a 3rd party. 
Therefore, #3 is always the best choice, unless your company is in the file writing 
business (e.g. you’re AWS and working on DynamoDB or S3).</p>

<p>Alternnate take on the same idea: <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">Choose boring technology</a></p>


<p>The practice of avoiding cold paths is often presented as “simple code”. Unfortunately, “simple”
has such wildly varying meanings that it’s often antagonistic to use it outside a
mathematical setting. I’ve found that centering conversations around “avoiding cold paths”
gives more clarity on how to proceed.</p>

<p>In system design, the conversation about what is “simple” is even tougher due to the 
amorphous nature of it. The principle of “avoiding cold paths” can be extended to mean,
“delegating cold paths” to a trusted third party, like an open source project or a cloud
provider. An earnest discussion about your capacity for testing might be
appropriate. It lets you disengage from “building cool stuff” and instead view it as
“testing burden I’d rather not have”.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>If you have a software background and you want to pick up digital design,
then one of the first things you need to learn about early on is the concept
of the clock.  To many software engineers turned beginning
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language">Hardware Description Language
(HDL)</a>
designers, the concept of a clock is an annoyance.  Without using a
clock, they can turn
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language">HDL</a>
into a programming language–with $display’s, <code>if</code>’s,
and <code>for</code> loops like any other programming language.  Yet the clock that these
beginning designers ignore is often the most fundamental part of any digital
design.</p>

<p>This difficulty is never more present then when reviewing some of the first
designs that beginning
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language">HDL</a>
developers produce.  I’ve now talked with several of these individuals who
have posted questions on the forums I participate within.  When I’ve then
drilled down into what they are doing, I’ve had to cringe at what I’ve found.</p>

<p>As an example, one student came to me struggling to understand why no one
on-line seemed to think much of his
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language">HDL</a>
implementation.
I’ll spare him the embarrassment of being named, or of linking to his project.
Instead, I’m just going to call him a <em>student</em>.  (No, <a href="https://zipcpu.com/about">I’m not a
professor</a>.)
This “student” had created a Verilog design to do not one round of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>
encryption, but <em>every round</em>, <em>all in combinatorial logic with no clocks</em> in
between.  I can’t remember if he was doing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>-128,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>-192, or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>-256,
but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>
requires between 10 and 14 rounds.  As I recall, his encryption engine
worked perfectly in the simulator, yet it only used one clock to encrypt or
decrypt his data.  He was proud of his work, but couldn’t understand why
those who looked at it told him he was thinking like a software engineer,
and not like a hardware designer.</p>

<table><caption>Fig 1: Software is Sequential</caption><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://zipcpu.com/img/sw-is-serial.svg" alt="Software runs serially" width="128"></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Indeed, I’ve now had the opportunity to counsel many of these software
engineers, new to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language">HDL</a>,
like this “student”.  Many of them like to treat
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language">HDL</a> like
just another <em>software programming</em> language.  Having programmed before, they
go and look for the basics in any software programming language: how to
declare variables, how to make an if statement, a case statement, how to write
loops, etc.  They then write their code like a computer program–where
everything needs to run sequentially (Fig 1), yet completely ignoring the
reality of digital design which is that everything runs in parallel.</p>

<p>Sometimes these programmers will find a simulator, such as
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>,
<a href="http://iverilog.icarus.com/">iverilog</a>,
or the
<a href="https://www.edaplayground.com/">EDA playground</a>.
They’ll then use a bunch of <code>$display</code> commands in their logic, treat them like
sequential “printf”s and use them to get their code to work–<em>without using
a clock</em>.  Their design then “runs” in the simulator using combinatorial logic
alone.</p>

<p>These students then describe their designs to me, and explain to me that their
design “works without a clock”.</p>

<p>Say what?</p>

<p>The reality is that no digital logic design can work “without a clock”.
There is always some physical process creating the
inputs.  These inputs must all be valid at some start time–this time forms the
first clock “tick” in their design.  Likewise, the outputs are then required
from those inputs some time later.  The time when all the outputs are
valid given for a given set of inputs forms the next “clock” in a “clockless”
design.  Perhaps the first clock “tick” is when the set the last switch on
their board is adjusted and the last clock “tick” is when their eye reads the
result.  It doesn’t matter: there is a clock.</p>

<p>The result is that someone who claims that their design “has no clock” is
either stating that he is using the simulator in an unrealistic fashion, or
that the design has an external clock setting the inputs and reading the
outputs–which is another way of saying that the design really <em>does</em> have
a clock.</p>

<p>If you find yourself struggling to understand the necessity of having a clock
when working in digital logic, or if you know someone who might be struggling
with this concept, then this post is for you.</p>

<p>Let’s spend a moment or two discussing the clock, and why it is so important
to build and design your logic around a clock.</p>

<h2 id="lesson-1-hardware-design-is-parallel-design">Lesson #1: Hardware design is parallel design</h2>

<p>The first and perhaps most difficult part of learning hardware design is
to learn that all hardware design is parallel design.  Things don’t take
place serially, as in one instruction after another (Fig 1), like they do in a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">computer</a>.
Instead, everything happens at once, as in Fig 2.</p>

<table><caption>Fig 2: Hardware logic runs in Parallel</caption><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://zipcpu.com/img/hw-is-parallel.svg" alt="Hardware runs in parallel" width="780"></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>This changes a <em>lot</em> of things.</p>

<table><caption>Fig 3: A software loop</caption><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://zipcpu.com/img/sw-loop.svg" alt="Figure of a software loop" width="200"></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>The first thing that changes needs to be the developer.  You need to <a href="https://zipcpu.com/blog/2017/08/21/rules-for-newbies.html">learn to
<em>think</em> in
parallel</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps a good example of this difference would be a hardware loop.</p>

<p>In software, a loop consists of a series of
instructions, as Fig 3 illustrates.  These instructions create a set of
initial conditions.  Logic is then performed within the loop.  Then a loop
variable is used to make and define this logic, and it is often incremented
each time through the loop.  Until the
loop variable reaches the termination condition, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a>
continues to repeat
the instructions and logic within the loop.  The more times the loop runs,
the longer it takes to run the program.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language">HDL</a>
based hardware loops are not like this at all.  Instead, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language">HDL</a>
synthesis
tool uses the loop description to make several copies of the logic all
running in parallel.  The logic used to create the loop, such as the index,
to increment that index, to check the index against the final condition, etc.,
doesn’t need to be synthesized–so it is usually removed.  Further, since
the synthesis tool is creating physical wires and logic blocks, the number
of times through the loop cannot change after synthesis time.  After that
time, the amount of hardware is fixed and can no longer be changed.</p>

<p>The structure that results, shown in Fig 4 below, is <em>very</em> different from
the structure of a software loop in Fig 3 above.</p>

<table><caption>Fig 4: An HDL generated loop</caption><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://zipcpu.com/img/hw-loop.svg" alt="Figure of an HDL generated loop" width="780"></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>This has several consequences.  For example, loop iterations can’t necessarily
depend upon the output of prior loop iterations like they could in software.
As a result, it’s hard to run a loop of logic across all of the data in a set
have an answer in the next clock.</p>

<p>But … now we’ve come back to the concept of the clock again.</p>

<p>The clock is central to any
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
design.  Everything revolves around it.
Indeed, I would argue that all of your logic development should <em>start</em> with
the clock.  It’s not an afterthought, but rather the clock forms the
structure of how you think about digital design in the first place.</p>

<h2 id="why-the-clock-is-important">Why the clock is important</h2>

<p>Step one is to understand that everything within a digital logic design takes
time to do in hardware.  Not only that, but
different operations take different amounts of time.  Traveling from one
part of the chip to another also takes time.</p>

<p>Perhaps the way to visualize this is with a chart.  Let’s place the
inputs to our algorithm on the top, the logic in the middle, and the outputs
on the bottom.  Time, as an axis, will run from top to bottom, from one clock
to the next.  The result of this visualization might look something like
Fig 5, below.</p>

<table><caption>Fig 5: Logic takes time, three operations</caption><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://zipcpu.com/img/clk-poor-design.svg" alt="Figure showing several logic operations, and their impact on the clock rate" width="780"></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>Fig 5 shows several different operations: an addition, a multiply, and several
rounds of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>–although
for discussion purposes it could be several rounds of any algorithm.
I’ve used the size of the operation boxes, in the vertical direction, to
indicate notionally how much time each operation might require.  Further,
operations that depend upon other operations stack up.  Hence, if you want
to do many rounds of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a> within
one clock, you’ll need to know that the second round cannot begin until
the first is complete.  Fitting this logic in, therefore, will increase the
amount of time between clock ticks and slow down your overall clock rate.</p>

<p>Now let’s look at the pink boxes.</p>

<p>The pink boxes represent the wasted capacity in your hardware
circuit–times when you might have been able to do something,
but since you had to wait for the clock, or perhaps wait for your inputs
to be processed first, you couldn’t do anything.  For example, in our notional
diagram above the multiply doesn’t take as long as one round of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>,
neither does the addition.  However, you can’t do anything with the results
of those two operations while the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>
calculations are taking place since those operations need to wait for
the next clock to get their next inputs.  This is what the “pink” boxes
represent in Fig 5: idle circuitry.  Further, because all of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>
rounds are pushing the next clock into the distance, there’s a lot of
idle circuitry presented in Fig 5.  This design, therefore, will not run as
fast as the hardware would allow.</p>

<p>If all we did was pipeline the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>
algorithm, so that one round could be calculated on every clock, we could
then get the entire design to run faster with less wasted capacity.</p>

<p>Fig 6 shows this idea.</p>

<table><caption>Fig 6: Breaking up the operations speeds up the clock</caption><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://zipcpu.com/img/clk-aes-better.svg" alt="Figure: several operations, with immediate results between each" width="780"></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>As a result of breaking our operation up into smaller operations, each of
which could be accomplished between clock ticks, our design now has much
less wasted capacity.  Even better, instead of encrypting only one block
of data at a time, we can pipeline the encryption algorithm.  The resulting
logic won’t encrypt a single block any faster than Fig 5 above, but if you
can keep the pipeline full you should be able to increase your
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>
encryption throughput by somewhere between 10-14x faster.</p>

<p>This is therefore a better design.</p>

<p>Can we do better?  Indeed we could!  If you are familiar with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>,
then you know that each round of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>,
has discrete steps within it.  These
can be broken up, allowing us to increase our clock speed until the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>
round logic takes less time than the multiply.  This will increase the number
of adds and multiplies you can do, as well as micro-pipelining your
encryption engine so that you can run even more data through it on a per
clock basis.</p>

<p>Not bad.</p>

<p>February 2021</p>

<p>Last week’s GameStop (GME) speculative frenzy stirred a motley crew  of Redditors, politicians, and venture capitalists, each using the volatility to push their preferred narratives. <em>Evil hedge funds are <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340">propping up their buddies</a> and astroturfing misinformation. Market makers are evil for <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestop-frenzy-puts-spotlight-on-trading-giant-citadel-securities-11612089000">profiting off retail order flow</a>. Robinhood has forsaken its namesake and is in cahoots with the aforementioned parties.</em> There are plenty of villains in this story, or none at all, depending on your view of the financial industry.</p>

<p>The real answer to why Robinhood restricted trading on GME turned out to be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/02/01/business/us-economy-coronavirus#robinhood-needed-3-billion-to-cover-risky-trades-its-chief-told-elon-musk">far more mundane</a>. To recap, settlement of stock trades takes multiple days, and in the meantime, the clearinghouses that facilitate trades for brokers require that some collateral be placed to account for risk that the buyer or seller does not fulfill their side of the trade. Since this risk increases with stock volatility, clearinghouses demanded $3 billion collateral from Robinhood to account for their users holding GME, a meme stock that was routinely seeing +/- 50% swings but threatened to crash to earth at any moment. Robinhood was forced to deal with the imminent liquidity challenge by raising emergency funding. In the meantime, to manage risk, they placed limits on purchasing GME shares. So goes the story recounted by Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev (or as Elon Musk called him, “<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-calls-robinhood-ceo-vlad-the-stock-impaler-and-grills-him-over-the-gamestop-saga-11612180184">Vlad the stock impaler</a>”).</p>

<p>Yet this surface-level explanation likely leaves the observant investor with more questions. <em>Okay, so plausibly if we’re trading on margin, Robinhood could face a liquidity crunch. But what’s the problem if we’re trading using our own settled cash?</em> Cash trades need to settle and we have to put down collateral to insure against risk in the meantime. <em>That’s no problem, the internet enables us to process transactions quickly, right?</em> No, it takes two days. <em>Why does it take two days?</em> Transactions are processed at night in batches. <em>Fine then, can’t you use the money we just put up as collateral?</em> You can’t use client funds for that purpose. <em>Why not? Wait, wouldn’t this all be a non-issue if trades cleared near-instantly? Isn’t this a self-imposed problem within the financial industry?</em></p>

<p>Indeed, this doesn’t seem to be how we would design the system from first principles. As it turns out, Robinhood’s liquidity incident only exposes the surface of deeper troubles in fintech. Underneath a world of seamless consumer transacting represented by Robinhood, Venmo, and other apps of their generation lies an underbelly of interconnected financial systems that struggle to meet modern demands. Fintech’s attempts at abstracting away such complexity run into challenges when long-tail events occur, leaving customers frustrated and institutions in danger. A firmer foundational infrastructure from the Fed involving features like open banking, instant P2P payments, and real-time trade settlement (update: <a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/2/2/its-time-for-real-time-settlement">Robinhood themselves called for this now!</a>) would allow us to build a more robust layer of services while minimizing rent-seeking middlemen. <strong><a href="https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/">It’s Time to Build</a>.</strong></p>

<h2 id="when-abstractions-fail">When Abstractions Fail</h2>

<p>Software engineers define leaky abstractions as when underlying implementation details of a process, meant to be hidden away, become relevant as things fail. From this perspective, Robinhood manifested <strong>an</strong> <strong>abstraction that was not simply leaking but gushing out from every news report</strong> and flooding investors’ brokerage accounts. By hiding the details of a complex settlement process and marking sale proceeds as immediately available to a customer, Robinhood presents a simplified trading process to customers while handling the settlement and margin details behind the scenes. It all works well until some Redditors decide to send a stock to the moon and your platform bears the brunt, I guess. In any case upon discovery of a software bug, it’s an all-too-familiar experience to realize a certain library call isn’t working, and find yourself having to dig further and further into the annals of ancient source code down the chain to figure out where something went wrong.</p>

<p>Since you were never intended to dig this far (you’d never need to, right?), they sure won’t make it easy to dig down there, with obfuscated binaries, hidden state effects, and other nasty monsters of the underworld. Likewise, delving into the GME situation is a hopeless exercise for an average investor who, faced with a sudden message of “trading suspended”, rationally wants to get to the bottom of this. They would quickly find a wall of opaque financial rules with regards to the clearing process that seem to exist on a “need to know’’ basis. If Vlad the CEO himself <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2M7X2dsW_Xw">“doesn’t quite know how the formula works”</a>, what hope does the average citizen have to track down the source of this seeming bug in the system? Perhaps we should all just give up, raise pitchforks against Citadel, and call it a day.</p>

<p>The financial world is not new to abstractions, of course. Almost any tangible object or collection of intangibles has been securitized, packaged into new securities, tranched once or twice for good measure, and repackaged - repeat until satisfied. New engineered securities are then available for boomer 401k portfolios, sovereign wealth funds, and anyone else who wants in from the peripheries. These abstractions, in their defense, have usually made the markets in which they’re employed <a href="http://www.oeconomia.actapol.net/pub/9_3_181.pdf">far more efficient and liquid</a>. Mortgage-backed securities, as much as they were maligned for their role in precipitating the Great Recession, made it dramatically easier for cash-strapped homebuyers in North Carolina to be matched up with someone on the other side of the world looking to [in theory] buy a bunch of uncorrelated assets (we all know how that ended though) for their investment portfolio. In exchange for the hard work and research that goes into assembling these securities, <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/causes-of-wage-stagnation/">financial middlemen wages have shot up dramatically since 1970</a> against a backdrop of broader economic inequality.</p>

<p>But <strong>abstractions are only useful when they’re built upon a well-designed foundation of primitives</strong>. When abstractions are instead used as patches over flimsy Swiss cheese layers of infrastructure, they’re bound to go wrong and leak, making their presence known to the world at the most inopportune time. Like, say, when GME is attempting to go to the moon but passengers are getting ejected for mysterious reasons. <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/">Joel Spolsky’s Law of Leaky Abstractions</a> asserts that “All non-trivial abstractions, to some degree, are leaky.” Assuming the truth of this statement, building unnecessary layers of complex abstractions compounds the risk for no good return.</p>

<h2 id="fintechs-stopgap-unicorns">Fintech’s Stopgap Unicorns</h2>

<p>The brave new world of fintech software consists of many such abstractions that really ought not to exist in an ideal world with better financial infrastructure. It’s a classic American story of governmental inaction and private opportunists seeking to fill the gap, providing acceptable service and pocketing some hefty middleman profits in the meantime. The existence of these entrenched middlemen further dampens any political interest in solving root causes of central dysfunction, and so the cycle is perpetuated.</p>

<p>Take Venmo for example. Nations around the world have begun setting up open banking APIs for peer-to-peer payments and other services by legally mandating interconnectability. The European Union’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Services_Directive">Revised Payment Services Directive</a> went into effect in 2018 putting Europe at the forefront of open banking initiatives. Supporting payments is a core function that makes a bank a bank, and in the 21st century, those payments occur over the internet and so we expect instant deposits. Instead, if we rely on existing open standards for payment in the US, ie. ACH deposits, it seems the <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/banking/ach-transfers">fastest we can do is a few business days</a> or pay up for expensive wire transfers. And conveniently those are extra days where funds are in limbo mean that banks can earn some extra interest.</p>

<p>The US has taken a market-driven approach to hoping for more interconnectedness between banks, resulting in Zelle, a P2P payment system created by a bank consortium that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/22/business/zelle-banks-fraud.html">is sometimes secure</a>. Meanwhile Venmo has the first-mover advantage in the P2P payment space, and has built out a formidable network of users in a domain where implicit trust in identities is critical. Don’t like those options? You’re also free to use Messenger Pay, Apple Pay, CashApp, among a myriad set of options. Clearly, the fragmentation is killing us here, making what intuitively wants to be a well-designed protocol a mess of walled gardens with varying functionality. These days, it’s hard to even grasp how protocols like email, or heck even USPS mail, ever came to fruition against the alternative crop of self-interested ecosystems.</p>

<p>Venmo won by building an abstracted network that appears to support instant peer-to-peer payments based just on a username. Underneath, of course, it rarely arranges for any bank transfers at all, and simply adjusts numbers in a database until a user actually wants to cash out. In the meantime, parent company PayPal can enjoy <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2018/02/20/what-are-apps-venmo-doing-your-money/">the returns on idle capital</a> chilling in user wallets. This middleman profit, along with various fees for third-party integrations, seems like a fair concession for the services provided. But it gets worse: <a href="https://github.com/ccorcos/venmo-dark-patterns">Venmo is filled with dark patterns</a> that try to encourage you to share as much financial data as possible with them and others, in vague hopes of building “a social network” since apparently that’s the only end game allowed in the Valley. Perhaps outsourcing critical financial functions to growth-hungry companies with flimsy morals wasn’t such a great idea after all.</p>

<p>Plaid is another example of a Silicon Valley fintech darling filling in a gap resulting from our lack of an interbank API. Plaid allows users to connect bank accounts to other apps by logging into bank accounts on users’ behalf and scraping relevant data. Again, it’s easy to spot the …</p></section></div>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Writing tests today sucks. Tests are expensive to write. They're even more
expensive to maintain. They're somewhat opaque to anybody who's not intimately
familiar with the test harness. You can't always be sure whether you're writing
the “right” tests for your situation. Worst of all, it's sometimes difficult to
persuade a non-technical stakeholder that software testing actually does
anything underneath the hood, except maybe inflate operational expenses for your
software budget. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18442941">Every software development horror
story</a> I've heard comes with some
discussion around tests, and that's because not only does software fail in more
ways than anybody without job security may care to admit, it fails in novel and
unpredictable manners.</p>
<p>What sucks even more is <em>just how important effective software testing is</em> for
software engineers to quickly and confidently contribute value. The absolute
first thing I do after cloning most <code>git</code> repositories these days, for work or
otherwise, is run the test suite. Test suites are self-documenting and always
more accurate than a wiki or other forms of documentation, and since they're
programmatic it's much easier to tie into the rest of your developer workflow
(say when setting up automated deployments to production).</p>
<hr>
<p>Honestly, this probably isn't news to you if you've been working in industry for
a while, and it's easy to fall into a trap of powerlessness and believing any
endemic lack of alignment is eternal. And while it's not always (and usually
not) the fault of technical limitations, it may be useful to think of technical
ways to grow beyond the immediate problem. So I'd like to say there are two
great aspects about professional software that could be applied to software
testing.</p>
<p>The first is we're usually using paradigms that are decades old. Professional
software is usually incremental in action and incrementalist in thinking. This
implies there's often new concepts in academia or research that might solve
current problems. One professor I talked to around graduation 4 years ago
brought up how the A* path-finding algorithm was invented 20 years before its
adoption in the video game industry (and apparently that's at least one reason
why NPCs don't collide with in-world walls anymore).</p>
<p>The second is test suites usually under the full control of engineering. There
might be a QA department within engineering, but I have yet to see a
sales/marketing department care deeply about how you structure a test harness,
vs. the layout of a landing page. While serving the company is the goal of any
business-oriented engineering department, this means there's more agency than
usual in how engineering approaches testing, than say product implementation or
devops.</p>
<p>What we're looking for as software engineers is to write as many good tests as
possible within some limited time frame.</p>
<h2 id="different-software-testing-strategies-ive-used">Different software testing strategies I've used</h2>
<p>The most important thing about writing good tests is to start writing good
source code and develop good habits. This might involve separating concerns in a
codebase by using functions instead of classes, gradually applying type
signatures using <code>mypy</code> or <code>pyre-check</code> and adding a typechecking step to your
CI pipeline, and paying attention to software properties like immutability
(updating an object creates a copy of the object with the update instead of
mutating the original object) and idempotency (running a code block generates
the same output for the same input even for multiple runs). You can bring a lot
of value to the table by using tools + infrastructure like <code>black</code> for
autoformatting and Docker / <code>docker-compose</code> for running local infrastructure,
and a lot of this undergirds higher-order testing strategies like property-based
testing later on.</p>
<p>Some of these strategies I've applied in the field revolve around these simpler
ideas. When I'm building a webapp frontend or backend, I adopted the idea of
“functional core, imperative shell”, where you have a soup of decoupled methods
within your app that are easily unit testable, and a set of well-defined I/O
interfaces and stubs to imperative resources like your network or database to
create the cheapest possible integration tests. This is nice for stateless,
pass-through entities, but works less well when you're primarily looking for
effects (e.g. it'd be very difficult to unit test most of PostgreSQL
effectively). So when I became a data engineer, and I spent most of my day
interacting with effectful systems, I attempted with some success to write a set
of <a href="https://bytes.yingw787.com/posts/2018/11/07/data_driven_testing">data-driven integration tests using
<code>pytest</code></a> and leverage its ability to
parameterize over fixtures using data to create essentially a mongodump of test
descriptions. This solution was nice since it allowed me to scale the amount of
data I tested far beyond the amount of code I needed to write. However, I still
needed to come up with my own oracle values to test with. It's easy to run an
expensive integration test with very little added value.</p>
<p>This is where my interest in property-based testing stems from. I'd also mention
that even with property-based testing, all these testing strategies (and others
I haven't covered or discovered yet) have their place and their tradeoffs. You
should decide for yourself when to apply or to not apply each.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-property-based-testing">What is property-based testing?</h2>
<p>At its simplest, property-based testing is the inverse of normal unit testing.
Instead of providing some amount of data and a transformation so the computer
can assert a property, you provide a property and a transformation, so the
computer can provide some data.</p>
<p>Let's go back to the basics. Say you defined a method <code>addOne()</code> to increment an
integer by one:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>addOne</span>(x: int) <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> int:
    <span>return</span> x <span>+</span> <span>1</span>
</code></pre></div><p>In order to test method <code>addOne()</code>, you can define a set of unit tests:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>test_addOne</span>():
    <span>assert</span> addOne(<span>5</span>) <span>==</span> <span>6</span>
</code></pre></div><p>You can even parameterize a list of oracle inputs and expected values:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> pytest

<span>@pytest.mark.parametrize</span>(<span></span><span>'</span><span>_input, _expected</span><span>'</span>, [(<span>5</span>,<span>6</span>), (<span>6</span>,<span>7</span>), (<span>7</span>,<span>8</span>)])
<span>def</span> <span>test_addOne</span>(_input, _expected):
    <span>assert</span> addOne(_input) <span>==</span> _expected
</code></pre></div><p>The final leap is realizing that instead of coming up with your own oracle
values, you just care that the inputs are integers and the outputs are a
functional, deterministic transform resulting in an integer output. This is
where property-based testing:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> hypothesis <span>import</span> given, strategies <span>as</span> st

<span>@given</span>(st<span>.</span>integers())
<span>def</span> <span>test_addOne</span>(_input):
    <span>assert</span> addOne(_input) <span>==</span> _input <span>+</span> <span>1</span>
</code></pre></div><p>For some properties, you can define and apply the opposite transform, which when
combined with the original transform, generates the identity function, which
should then leave the input untouched:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>subOne</span>(x: int) <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> int:
    <span>return</span> x <span>-</span> <span>1</span>

<span>from</span> hypothesis <span>import</span> given, strategies <span>as</span> st
<span>@given</span>(st<span>.</span>integers())
<span>def</span> <span>test_addsub_returns_value</span>(_input):
    <span>assert</span> subOne(addOne(_input)) <span>==</span> _input
</code></pre></div><p>So what else is it similar to / different from? One's <em>generative testing</em>,
which are tests that create tests. Since we're creating a spec here,
<code>hypothesis</code> is generating tests underneath the hood for us and running them.
Otherwise, property-based testing is a bit different as it supports intelligent
search strategies that allow us to shrink the error space.</p>
<p>Another testing paradigm similar to property-based testing is <em>fuzz testing</em>,
where random inputs are inserted into a program to see how it behaves and
whether it crashes. To me, fuzz testing is more an extension of black-box
integration testing, and extends more into devops or security related testing,
rather than the unit-focused nature of property-based testing.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-hypothesis">What is <code>hypothesis</code>?</h2>
<p><code>hypothesis</code> is one of the more popular implementations of property-based
testing in Python. I had thought it originated from a PBT library called
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck"><strong><code>QuickCheck</code></strong></a> in Haskell,
but after reading through a Haskell book earlier this year and <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/ovebeq/pythonista_s_review_haskell#c_gz09vc">talking to some
folks online</a>,
there's a more “intelligent” PBT library in Haskell it came from called
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hedgehog"><strong><code>Hedgehog</code></strong></a>, which applies
built-in shrinking as part of the test generation suite.</p>
<p>You can find the <code>hypothesis</code> for Python documentation
<a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest">here</a>, and additional
documentation around the team behind Hypothesis
<a href="https://hypothesis.works/">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="hypothesis-strategies"><code>hypothesis</code> strategies</h3>
<p>The key idea behind <code>hypothesis</code> is strategy generation. You can see examples of
it by running this code segment in your <code>python</code> terminal:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> hypothesis <span>import</span> strategies <span>as</span> st

st<span>.</span>text()<span>.</span>example()
</code></pre></div><p><code>hypothesis</code> supports basic strategies like those targeting Python's “primitive”
types. You can create <code>st.integers()</code> or <code>st.text()</code>. You can also do more
advanced things, like create strategies from structs like dictionaries or lists,
combine strategies together, infer strategies from a regular expression, and
build strategies from well-recognized third-party classes from <code>pandas</code> or
Django.</p>
<h3 id="hypothesis-tactics"><code>hypothesis</code> tactics</h3>
<p>I took a lot of these tactics from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcyGUVzL7HA">a talk by Zac Hatfield-Dodds introducing PBT
at PyCon US</a>. Check out his website
<a href="https://zhd.dev/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The types of properties you can apply with <code>hypothesis</code> allow for certain
tactics you can play with in <code>hypothesis</code>.</p>
<p>One of these tactics might be manually defining the property, then letting
<code>hypothesis</code> generate the test cases for you. One common way this tactic is
applied is to look for “round-trip” properties, where you look for the inverse
method and check that applying both would result in the identity method.</p>
<p>Another tactic might be to use an oracle function. This can be really helpful if
you're refactoring a piece of code and you want to carry forward the original
behavior of that method, regardless of whether it's correct or incorrect. In
this case, that method becomes an oracle and you can apply the equal-by-value

      <p><strong>1. Trade Options</strong></p><p><em>Fastest</em></p><p>No doubt you have heard all about how easy it is for people to lose their life savings trading securities in the stock market. But there is actually a much faster way – options. I’m not going to get into the nuts and bolts of trading options (actually, most people who lose money with options don’t understand how they work anyway) but I will give you a quick definition and then show how efficient these instruments-of-wealth-destruction really are.&nbsp;</p><p>There are two types of options – calls and puts. If you buy a call option, you are purchasing the right to but the underlying stock at a specified price. So, you might pay $3,000 dollars for the right to buy 100 shares Microsoft stock at $200 per share. Then, if the stock goes up to $300 you can either buy 100 shares at $200, or you can sell the option to some other idiot and they can use it to buy the shares. But, as you might imagine, that options contract is worth a lot more than $3,000 now, and you can sell it for a premium. This is how leverage works to make money. But we’re concerned about how to use leverage to lose money.&nbsp;</p><p>The nice thing about options is that there isn’t just one way to lose money. No, you can lose money in many different ways – far more than I can write on this page. But, if you’re looking to lose money don’t bother to read up on the different ways to trade options. Just go for it, and I’m certain you will lose everything. I’ll give you a few real-life examples of how I’ve lost money in options. First, buy options that are about ready to expire. In the previous example, if you bought the Microsoft options for $3,000, but the stock went to $195 instead of $300, you could lose all your money. Another easy way to lose money with options is to buy contracts that are way out of the money (OTM). This simply means you might buy Microsoft options that give you the right to buy stock at $200 – except this time, the stock is at $150 per share. If you do this, you won’t find anyone willing to buy the option contract back from you (after all, why would someone pay for the right to buy stock at $200 if it’s already at $150). And if you can’t find anyone to buy the contract from you it will expire worthless and you’ll lose all your money. Another favorite is not cutting your losses. If your contract is losing money (this often happens if you think the stock is going to go up but it goes down) and you want to lose more money, just hold it and don’t sell. Options decay with time so the longer you hold it the more likely it is that you will lose all your money. So, simply hold your position when it starts to go south and you’ll lose way more money.</p><p>Pro tip – Make sure to buy a bunch of contracts (say 10 of them) so you lose $30,000 instead of $3,000.</p><p>I could go on but I think you get the point. I have personally lost thousands of dollars using these methods and would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a fast way to lose it all. I’d recommend you try losing a small amount in stocks first to get your feet wet – then dive into options. If you’re anxious to give it a go, <a href="https://cash.app/app/TDZWWPC?utm_campaign=UA-188825179-1&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">use this link to start trading with Cash App</a> and you’ll get free money to lose right away.</p><p>The only options trader who doesn’t lose money is the one who never starts.</p><p><em>- Andrew Tye</em></p><p><strong>2. Write a Book</strong></p><p><em>Most consistent</em></p><p>You might think writing a book is a great way to make a bunch of cash – and you’d be wrong. In spite of the many books that will tell you how to make money writing a book, I’m here to let you in on a secret –writing a book is actually a fantastic way to lose money. I’ve written four short books and they have literally grossed hundreds of dollars. Now – hearing that I’ve sold some books might make you think you should write one also. But it’s a trap – you will spend hundreds of hours writing a book and then make hundreds of dollars in return. Not sure about you, but if I’m working for $1/hour I’m losing money fast. My latest book probably has more pages than it has copies sold – <a href="https://gum.co/getajob?utm_campaign=UA-188825179-1&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">take a look here</a> if you want a quick reference on how to get a job.</p><p><strong>3. Teach Online Courses</strong></p><p><em>Most helpful</em>&nbsp;</p><p>Aw, I love this one. You can help other people learn a skill and lose your money at the same time. Win-lose. Some folks think they can make a great online course and it will make them a nice living or side income. Most of those nice people are wrong. News flash – more people lose money creating online courses than make money from them. The good news for you is that there really aren’t many barriers to entry here. Get yourself a cheap mic (who needs quality audio anyway) and an inexpensive webcam. And go to town without bothering to make an outline. I’ve found a couple approaches that both work well. Option A - read the script from a piece of paper. Option B – don’t plan at all and just wing the recording.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a strategy that I’ve already proven out for you. I created a few classes online and over the past 5 years they have actually generated thousands of dollars. But net returns are certainly negative because for those thousands of dollars I spent hundreds of hours creating content, answering questions, and buying likes. If you’d like a good idea of what to expect, I have over 40,000 students taking my online courses and they have generated a few thousand in gross revenues.</p><p>Pro tip – make your courses free from the start – you will recoup less of your investment this way, and end up losing quite a bit more overall.</p><p><strong>4. Get a Degree</strong></p><p><em>Most socially acceptable</em></p><p>This tactic is harder to lose money with, but when you lose you lose big. Books and courses are more consistent losers, but they don’t add up as fast as big tuition debt combined with time off work. As mentioned, you do have to be careful with this one because it is possible to get a degree and actually make money. But here is what you do to ensure loss. First, choose a degree that you aren’t passionate about, or that doesn’t have high paying jobs, or that doesn’t really have any jobs (<a href="https://lunarjobs.co/radar?utm_campaign=UA-188825179-1&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">research here</a>). Second, don’t get a side job during school and take all of the student loans you can get your hands on. Third, be very picky about which of the few jobs you take and only take ones that are in fact low paying (high cost of living is also preferred when choosing location). </p><p>Pro tip – fail a few classes to extend your time to graduation – that way you can take on more debt.&nbsp;</p><p>One thing to watch out for is accidentally choosing a degree that can actually make you money. Like engineering or computer science. But even this caution is less important now than when I went to college because places like Lambda School are making four year university degrees more certain losers. I’ve been on both sides of this one. I spent two years studying software development and about 4 years studying engineering. Both of those degrees were inexpensive, I worked part-time while studying, and have made money with both of them. But, thankfully I learned my lesson and managed to lose a lot of money by the time I got an MBA. I could have started a company with the money, or just worked my way up in an engineering role. But by taking on a bunch of debt and forgoing a salary for a couple years I was able to lose way more money than if I’d simply started a company. I think I actually lost more by going to business school than if I’d started a company and lost all of the investors’ money!</p><p><strong>5. Become an Inventor</strong></p><p><em>Most fun</em></p><p>Okay people, this has to be one of the most enjoyable ways to lose money! I have drummed up all sorts of new inventions. Of course, they don’t make any money but that’s sort of the point right! Most of my awesome inventions failed make money because someone else took them to market before me. Other times it was because they were so stupid nobody wanted to buy them (or even look at them actually).</p><p>I’ve invented lots of awesome products that lost money, but here is one of my favorite no-hits:</p><p><em>Barking Bulb</em>: Scare away intruders with a bark</p><p>Don’t want a dog in your backyard? Fine, get a bulb that barks when intruders are detected. Light, motion sensing and sound in one bulb. I thought this was so brilliant. Safe as having a guard dog, but you don’t have to clean up after it. Literally the best of both worlds. Coming soon to a Home Depot near you!&nbsp;</p><p>Pro tip: Go straight for all of the full, non-provisional patents you can before you know if anyone wants the idea. Don’t wait to see if it’s manufacturable. Don’t do market research to see if competitive products exist. Just talk to an attorney and get the patents drawn up. This shortcut will let you lose $20,000 to $40,000 upfront before you even start doing hardcore R&amp;D or go to production.</p><p><strong>6. Do Internet Advertising </strong></p><p><em>Most controversial&nbsp;</em></p><p>Another interesting way to lose money is with online advertising. What I like most about this one is you can lose money consistently and sound smart to your friends at the same time. Where do you spend your money they ask? Oh, I have a website with ads. Wow. That is so cool. What you do is setup a website with some content (e.g. a blog about how to lose money) and you put some ads (from Google AdSense or affiliates) on it that will generate money for you. Then, to get more people to your blog you also buy ads from Google Ads or Facebook. If you do it just right there is arbitrage here – for every dollar you spend buying ads to get traffic to your site you can get 70 cents of income from the ads on your blog. You can consistently lose $0.30 for every $1.00 you spend. The downside is nearly unlimited as long as you pick a topic that has significant search traffic.</p><p>This one is somewhat controversial because a lot of people think that putting ads on your site and then buying other ads to get more traffic is actually a good way to make money. I’ve proven that it’s much easier to lose money with this method than it is to make money. So you can ignore the doubters.</p><p><strong>7. Stop finishing Projects</strong></p><p><em>Biggest loss</em></p><p>I have completely mastered this one. It has a sweet combination of money lost from working for …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>This is a question that often arises in the product world and it requires our time to unpack it. Though these roles are somewhat similar and they work towards achieving the same set of goals, we then ought to look at the clear line distinction in the line of duty of the individuals and performance metric used to evaluate the success achieved by each role to help us understand them better and also help you figure out the most suitable for you.</p><p>These roles vary from company to company as in the case of a startup, a product manager is often tasked with the duty of these 3 roles while in larger or enterprise companies, there are 3 or more different roles in the product team working at different capacities to ensure that the right product is shipped and meet the demands of users.</p><p>While the product manager’s role is one that has come to limelight, the product marketing manager and product owner role have also been adopted by a lot of companies depending on their product and company culture. In this article, we will explain the difference between these roles and the job requirement of the individual involved.</p><h3 id="the-product-manager">The Product Manager</h3><p>These individuals are often referred to as mini CEOs of a product. They conduct customer surveys to figure out the customer’s pain and build solutions to address it. The PM also prioritizes what features are to be built next and prepares and manages a cohesive and digital product roadmap and strategy.</p><h3 id="the-product-marketing-manager">The Product Marketing Manager</h3><p>The PMM communicates vital product value — the “why”, “what” and “when” of a product to intending buyers. He manages the go-to-market strategy/roadmap and also oversees the pricing model of the product. The primary goal of a PMM is to create demand for the products through effective messaging and marketing programs so that the product has a shorter sales cycle and higher revenue.</p><h3 id="the-product-owner">The Product Owner</h3><p>This role exists in a scrum environment — <em><a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum" title="Scrum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Scrum</a> is a framework for project management that emphasizes teamwork, accountability, and iterative progress toward a well-defined goal.</em></p><p>A product owner (PO) maximizes the value of a product through the creation and management of the product backlog, creation of user stories for the development team. The product owner is the customer’s representative to the development team. He addresses customer’s pain points by managing and prioritizing a visible product backlog. The PO is the first point of call when the development team needs clarity about interpreting a product feature to be implemented.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>Going more practical, we will use a hypothetical case study of a tech company, Slyde, to explain these roles to clearly understand their day-to-day duties.</p><p>Slyde is a financial technology company based in Lagos, Nigeria with coverage in other African countries. The company has been providing payment solutions through its web-based application but has noticed a large churn rate in areas with poor internet connection which in turn delay users from completing their transaction. The product team made this observation and has been tasked to come up with a solution.</p><h3 id="where-does-the-product-manager-product-marketing-manager-and-the-product-owner-come-in">Where does the Product Manager, Product Marketing Manager, and the Product Owner come in?</h3><p><strong>PM</strong>: The Product Manager will interface with the users through user interviews/feedback surveys or other means to hear directly from the users. They will come up with hypotheses alongside the team and validate them through prototyping and user testing. They will then create a strategy on the feature and align the team and stakeholders around it. The PM who is also the chief custodian of the entire product roadmap will, therefore, be tasked with the duty of prioritization. Before going ahead to carry out research and strategy, they will have to convince the stakeholders if it is a good choice to build the feature in context at that particular time or wait a bit longer based on the content of the roadmap.</p><p><strong>PMM</strong>: The product marketing manager is tasked with market feasibility and discovering if the features being built align with the company’s sales and revenue plan for the period. They also make research on how sought-after the feature is being anticipated and how it will impact the budget. They communicate the values of the feature; the why, what, and when to potential buyers — In this case users in countries with poor internet connection.</p><p><strong>PO</strong>: The product owner will first have to prioritize the backlog to see if there are no important tasks to be executed and if this new feature is worth leaving whatever is being built currently. They will also consider the development effort required to build the feature i.e the time, tools, and skill set that will be required. They will be the one to tell if the expertise of the current developers is enough or if more engineers or designers are needed to be able to deliver at the scheduled time. The product owner is also armed with the task of interpreting the product/feature requirements for the development team. They serve as the interface between the stakeholders and the development team.</p><hr><p>Lastly,</p><p>The goal of a product team is to delight its user by providing an excellent solution to their pain points regardless of the job title/role. Irrespective of your job role on a product team, you should always be driven by user empathy and the company’s goal as this will in-turn make you collaborate better among the team. A product person should first and foremost see themselves as a product leader — one who makes sure the user’s need is always advocated for, despite top executive declination, the product person is to persuasively align the executive to this.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>Product Owner is a role you play on a Scrum team. Product Manager is the job. — Melissa Perri</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>So, regardless of your job role, a great product person will always act in the stead of a product manager and never streamline herself to the JD only but be actively involved directly or indirectly in every phase of the product development cycle. When the role is clearly understood and the duties implemented collaboratively as a team, every aspect of the product comes together in one beautiful piece.</p><p>This article first appeared on my <a href="https://blog.usejournal.com/product-manager-vs-product-marketing-manager-vs-product-owner-8ab08bc45662" title="Medium" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Medium</a></p><p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/olufisayo-babalola/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Olufisayo Babalola</a> for reviewing this article.</p><hr><h3 id="sources">Sources:</h3><ul><li><a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/product-manager?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Hero Image by airfocus on Unsplash</a></li></ul></div></article></div>]]>

Our product (dbt) was a tool that I wanted to use in order to deliver services, and I honestly never believed at the outset that there would be many other folks in the world who wanted to use it. But it turns out that there are. So it took a full 3.5 years from launching dbt and watching its growth before I felt confident that we had a real shot at being a "big" company. This is one of the main reasons we waited for so long to raise capital--we bootstrapped the entire way until we felt like we had that confidence.  </span></p><p id="viewer-cj0e4"><span>It's an unusual approach and I'm not sure it would work for every situation and every founder, but our path has had a ton of really unique benefits for us and I wouldn't trade it for anything.</span></p><p id="viewer-b0ecd"><span><span>- Tristan Handy, </span>Founder and CEO<span>, </span><a href="https://www.fishtownanalytics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u><span>Fishtown Analytics</span></u></a> </span></p><h3 id="viewer-63li0"><span><span><strong>Breaking even from a Thanksgiving promotion</strong></span></span></h3><p id="viewer-394rh"><span>Honestly, I knew it was "viable" ever since I started the company - otherwise I certainly wouldn't have started it :)</span></p><p id="viewer-64kiv"><span>When I knew we'd hit the inflection point of growth though is when we ran a promotion one time, I think it was a Thanksgiving day promotion - and we sold enough in those couple days that paid for the monthly expenses at the time.

While entrepreneurs always have to be optimistic, it was only once we proved out the technical concept and got positive user experience feedback from family and friends that we knew our idea and product was viable.</span></p><p id="viewer-7tp4h"><span><span>- </span>Brad Jefferson<span>, CEO &amp; Co-Founder, </span><a href="https://animoto.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u><span>Animoto</span></u></a><span> </span></span></p><h3 id="viewer-2mf9g"><span><strong><span>First enterprise customer on annual contract</span></strong></span></h3><p id="viewer-2prob"><span>In my startup Qwiklabs when we had a first enterprise customer sign an annual contract I knew my product/startup idea was viable. At this point we had a minimalist product addressing the critical user journey. It was unclear at that point if there was a product/market fit (that is: if we had a great product for a large market). But it was clear that our idea and MVP were unique and useful enough for a large enterprise to pay for it. We established product/market fit a year from then when over a dozen enterprise customers were paying for the full-fledged version of the product.  In my view founders have an inkling/gut feeling about an idea; founders should bring that idea to a minimalist life and very quickly start validating it. </span></p><p id="viewer-e67l1"><span><span>- Jitesh Shetty, Co-Founder, </span><a href="https://infinichains.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u><span>Infinichains</span></u></a> </span></p><h3 id="viewer-2l3n1"><span><strong><span>The first dollar</span></strong></span></h3><p id="viewer-18vsj"><span>I have a very simple answer... it was when the first dollar came through the door.

I knew that if we kept building, kept learning and improving we would reach many more people.

I spend way too much time on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>.  It's a fun place, and a good way to keep up to date on all the new tech that us developer folk seem to need to know about.  But it also leaves a fella feeling like he <b>really needs to keep up</b> with all this stuff.  I mean, if you don't have a side project using the latest client-side framework, well, good luck ever finding a job again in this industry.
</p>
<p>
Thinking about it, I find that I straddle the line on this. As a long-time contractor, I try to stay up to date on the New Shiny and will happily run with whatever flavor of the month language, framework, and programming paradigm that a given gig wants. Yeah, sure, Node.js with tons of functional stuff mixed in pulling from a NoSQL store and React on the front end. I'm your guy. We're gonna change the world!
</p>
<p>
But for 
<a href="https://www.twiddla.com/">my</a>
<a href="https://unwaffle.com/">own</a>
<a href="https://www.s3stat.com/">stuff</a>, 
there's no way I'd use any of that crap. Good old C#, SQL Server and a proper boring stack and tool set that I know won't just up and fall over on a Saturday morning and leave me debugging NPM dependencies all weekend instead of bouldering in the forest with the kids. This stuff is my proper income stream, and the most important thing is that it works. If that means I have to write a "for" loop and declare variables and risk 19 year old kids snooting down at my code, so be it.
</p>
<h4>I can't tell you how nice it is to have software in production on a boring stack. It gives you freedom to do other things.</h4>

<p>
I can (and often do) go entire months without touching the codebase of my main rent-paying products. It means I can, among other things, pick up a full-time development gig to sock away some extra runway, take off and go backpacking around the world, or better still, build yet another rent-paying product without having to spend a significant amount of time keeping the old stuff alive.
</p>
<p>
It seems like on a lot of stacks, keeping the server alive, patched and serving webpages is a part-time job in itself. In my world, that's Windows Update's job. Big New Releases come and go, but they're all 100% backwards compatible, so when you get around to upgrading it's just a few minutes of point and clicking with nothing broken.
</p>
<p>
I see it as analogous to <b>Compound Interest, but to productivity</b>. The less effort you need to spend on maintenance, the more pace you can keep going forward.
</p>
<p>
But yeah, the key is to never get so far down in to that comfy hole that you can't hop back into the present day when it's time to talk shop with the cool kids.  Shine on, flavor of the week!

      <p>Alongside cooking for myself and walking laps around the house, Japanese cartoons (or “anime” as the kids are calling it) are something I’ve learned to love during quarantine.</p>

<p>The problem with watching anime, though, is that short of learning Japanese, you become dependent on human translators and voice actors to port the content to your language. Sometimes you get the subtitles (“subs”) but not the voicing (“dubs”). Other times, entire seasons of shows aren’t translated at all, and you’re left on the edge of your seat with only Wikipedia summaries and 90s web forums to ferry you through the darkness.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So what are you supposed to do? The answer is obviously not to ask a computer to transcribe, translate, and voice-act entire episodes of a TV show from Japanese to English. Translation is a careful art that can’t be automated, and requires the loving touch of a human hand. Besides, even if you did use machine learning to translate a video, you couldn’t use a computer to dub… I mean, who would want to listen to machine voices for an entire season? It’d be awful. Only a real sicko would want that.</p>

<p>So in this post, I’ll show you how to use machine learning to transcribe, translate, and voice-act videos from one language to another, i.e. “AI-Powered Video Dubs.” It might not get you Netflix-quality results, but you can use it to localize online talks and YouTube videos in a pinch. We’ll start by transcribing audio to text using Google Cloud’s <a href="https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text">Speech-to-Text API</a>. Next, we’ll translate that text with the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/translate">Translate API</a>. Finally, we’ll “voice act” the translations using the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech">Text-to-Speech API</a>, which produces voices that are, according to the docs, “humanlike.”</p>

<p>(By the way, before you flame-blast me in the comments, I should tell you that YouTube will <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6373554#zippy=%2Cautomatic-captions-on-videos-on-demand">automatically and for free</a> transcribe and translate your videos for you. So you can treat this project like your new hobby of baking sourdough from scratch: a really inefficient use of 30 hours.)</p>

<h2 id="ai-dubbed-videos-do-they-axe-usually-sound-grood">AI-Dubbed Videos: Do they axe usually sound grood?&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Before you embark on this journey, you probably want to know what you have to look forward to. What quality can we realistically expect to achieve from an ML-video-dubbing pipeline?</p>

<p>Here’s one example dubbed automatically from English to Spanish (the subtitles are also automatically generated in English). I haven’t done any tuning or adjusting on it:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cURHKESgNaI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>As you can see, the transcriptions are decent but not perfect, and the same for the translations. (Ignore the fact that the speaker sometimes speaks too fast–more on that later.) Overall, you can easily get the gist of what’s going on from this dubbed video, but it’s not exactly near human-quality.</p>

<p>What makes this project trickier (read: more fun) than most is that there are at least three possible points of failure:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The video can be incorrectly transcribed from audio to text by the Speech-to-Text API</li>
  <li>That text can be incorrectly or awkwardly translated by the Translation API</li>
  <li>Those translations can be mispronounced by the Text-to-Speech API</li>
</ol>

<p>In my experience, the most successful dubbed videos were those that featured a single speaker over a clear audio stream and that were dubbed from English to another language. This is largely because the quality of transcription (Speech-to-Text) was much higher in English than other source languages.</p>

<p>Dubbing from non-English languages proved substantially more challenging. Here’s one particularly unimpressive dub from Japanese to English of one of my favorite shows, Death Note:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gWNRfeEHmp4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>If you want to leave translation/dubbing to humans, well–I can’t blame you. But if not, read on!</p>

<h2 id="building-an-ai-translating-dubber">Building an AI Translating Dubber</h2>

<p>As always, you can find all of the code for this project in the <a href="https://github.com/google/making_with_ml/tree/master/ai_dubs">Making with Machine Learning Github repo</a>. To run the code yourself, follow the README to configure your credentials and enable APIs. Here in this post, I’ll just walk through my findings at a high level.</p>

<p>First, here are the steps we’ll follow:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Extract audio from video files</li>
  <li>Convert audio to text using the Speech-to-Text API</li>
  <li><strong>Split transcribed text into sentences/segments for translation</strong></li>
  <li>Translate text</li>
  <li>Generate spoken audio versions of the translated text</li>
  <li><strong>Speed up the generated audio to align with the original speaker in the video</strong></li>
  <li>Stitch the new audio on top of the fold audio/video</li>
</ol>

<p>I admit that when I first set out to build this dubber, I was full of hubris–all I had to do was plug a few APIs together, what could be easier? But as a programmer, all hubris must be punished, and boy, was I punished.</p>

<p>The challenging bits are the ones I bolded above, that mainly come from having to align translations with video. But more on that in a bit.</p>

<h2 id="using-the-google-cloud-speech-to-text-api">Using the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API</h2>

<p>The first step in translating a video is transcribing its audio to words. To do this, I used Google Cloud’s <a href="https://daleonai.com/translate-dub-videos-with-ml?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=CDR_dal_aiml_ai-dubs_020221">Speech-to-Text API</a>. This tool can recognize audio spoken in 125 languages, but as I mentioned above, the quality is highest in English. For our use case, we’ll want to enable a couple of special features, like:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/enhanced-models?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=CDR_dal_aiml_ai-dubs_020221">Enhanced models</a>. These are Speech-to-Text models that have been trained on specific data types (“video,” “phone_call”) and are usually higher-quality. We’ll use the “video” model, of course.</li>
  <li>Profanity filters. This flag prevents the API from returning any naughty words.</li>
  <li>Word time offsets. This flag tells the API that we want transcribed words returned along with the times that the speaker said them. We’ll use these timestamps to help align our subtitles and dubs with the source video.</li>
  <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/context-strength?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=CDR_dal_aiml_ai-dubs_020221">Speech Adaption</a>. Typically, Speech-to-Text struggles most with uncommon words or phrases. If you know certain words or phrases are likely to appear in your video (i.e. “gradient descent,” “support vector machine”), you can pass them to the API in an array that will make the more likely to be transcribed:</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>client</span> <span>=</span> <span>speech</span><span>.</span><span>SpeechClient</span><span>()</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The API returns the transcribed text along with word-level timestamps as JSON. As an example, I transcribed <a href="https://youtu.be/o6nGn1euRjk">this video</a>. You can see the JSON returned by the API in <a href="https://gist.github.com/dalequark/e983b929b6194adb49d00a9c55ae4e33">this gist</a>. The output also lets us do a quick quality sanity check:</p>

<p><em>What I actually said:</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Software Developers. We’re not known for our rockin’ style, are we? Or <em>are</em> we? Today, I’ll show you how I used ML to make me trendier, taking inspiration from influencers.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>What the API thought I said:</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Software developers. We’re not known for our Rock and style. Are we or are we today? I’ll show you how I use ml to make new trendier taking inspiration from influencers.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my experience, this is about the quality you can expect when transcribing high-quality English audio. Note that the punctuation is a little off. If you’re happy with viewers getting the gist of a video, this is probably good enough, although it’s easy to manually  correct the transcripts yourself if you speak the source language.</p>

<p>At this point, we can use the API output to generate (non-translated) subtitles. In fact, if you run my script with the `–srt` flag, it will do exactly that for you (<a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/srt-file#:~:text=An%20SRT%20file%20(otherwise%20known,the%20sequential%20number%20of%20subtitles.">srt</a> is a file type for closed captions):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>python dubber.py my_movie_file.mp4 <span>"en"</span> outputDirectory <span>--srt</span> <span>--targetLangs</span> <span>[</span><span>"es"</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="machine-translation">Machine Translation</h2>

<p>Now that we have the video transcripts, we can use the <a href="https://daleonai.com/cloud.google.com/translate?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=CDR_dal_aiml_ai-dubs_020221">Translate API</a> to… uh… translate them.</p>

<p>This is where things start to get a little 🤪.</p>

<p>Our objective is this: we want to be able translate words in the original video and then play them back at roughly the same point in time, so that my “dubbed” voice is speaking in alignment with my actual voice.</p>

<p>The problem, though, is that translations aren’t word-for-word. A sentence translated from English to Japanese may have word order jumbled. It may contain fewer words, more words, different words, or (as is the case with idioms) completely different wording.</p>

<p>One way we can get around this is by translating entire <em>sentences</em> and then trying to align the time boundaries of those sentences. But even this becomes complicated, because how do you denote a single sentence? In English, we can split words by punctuation mark, i.e.:</p>

<p><code>"Hi! My name is Dale. What's up?" --&gt; ["Hi", "My name is Dale", "What's up"]</code></p>

<p>But punctuation differs by language (there’s no ¿ in English), and some languages don’t separate sentences by punctuation marks at all.</p>

<p>Plus, in real life speech, we often don’t talk in complete sentences. Y’know?</p>

<p>Another wrinkle that makes translating transcripts difficult is that, in general, the <em>more</em> context you feed into a translation model, the higher quality translation you can expect. So for example, if I translate the following sentence into French:</p>

<p>“I’m feeling blue, but I like pink too.”</p>

<p>I’ll get the translation:</p>

<p>“Je me sens bleu, mais j’aime aussi le rose.”</p>

<p>This is accurate. But if I split that sentence in two (“I’m feeling blue” and “But I like pink too”) and translate each part separately, I get:</p>

<p>“Je me sens triste, mais j’aime aussi le rose”, i.e. “I’m feeling sad, but I like pink too.”</p>

<p>This is all to say that the more we chop up text before sending it to the Translate API, the worse quality the translations will be (though it’ll be more easy to temporally align them with the video).</p>

<p>Ultimately, the strategy I chose was to split up spoken words every time the speaker took a greater-than-one-second pause in speaking. Here’s an example of what that looked like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>   </span><span>{</span><span>
        </span><span>"en"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Software developers."</span><span>,</span><span>
        </span><span>"start_time"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0.2</span><span>,</span><span>
        </span><span>"end…</span></code></pre></div></div></div></div>

<p>There's a Yom Kippur joke I love: the rabbi and the richest man in town are praying, "Oh Lord, I am nothing, I am nothing!"</p>
<p>The synagogue's janitor sees them and joins in: "I am nothing!"</p>
<p>The richest man says to the rabbi: "Look who thinks he's nothing."</p>
<p>The humblebrag is a wild phenomena, and it's endemic to a certain kind of tech criticism. When a technologist – what Maria Farrell calls a "prodigal tech bro" – confesses that he's an evil genius, then "genius" is the point.</p>
<p><a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2020/09/23/story-ate-the-world-im-biting-back/">https://crookedtimber.org/2020/09/23/story-ate-the-world-im-biting-back/</a></p>
<p>Think of the "AI" scientists who claim that they are about to be responsible for massive waves of technological unemployment, seeming to confess to a sin while actually overpromising on their AI.</p>

<p>Or the critique of "surveillance capitalism" that takes at face value ad-tech's outlandish boasts about how good they are at changing peoples' minds with data-mining, and then warns that we're all about to be enslaved to mind-control tech.</p>
<p><a href="https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59">https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59</a></p>
<p>Or the hand-wringing over the "trolley problem" of self-driving cars, as though the issue with these cars will be their reliable fine-grained judgments, rather than their unreliability and anticompetitive fealty to their manufacturers.</p>
<p><a href="https://this.deakin.edu.au/self-improvement/car-wars">https://this.deakin.edu.au/self-improvement/car-wars</a></p>
<p>This is what Lee Vinsel calls "criti-hype," criticism that actually builds on – and depends on – maintaining the halo of devastating potency that surrounds overhyped technologies.</p>
<p><a href="https://sts-news.medium.com/youre-doing-it-wrong-notes-on-criticism-and-technology-hype-18b08b4307e5">https://sts-news.medium.com/youre-doing-it-wrong-notes-on-criticism-and-technology-hype-18b08b4307e5</a></p>
<p>While it's true that the social problems that technologies create have unique, subtle elements that require a fine-grained understanding of the underlying science, it's a mistake to assume this obviates historical lessons.</p>
<p>Like, blockchain and proof-of-work and cryptography do bring unique facets to the problems of financial engineering, money-laundering and fraud – but all the problems of financial engineering and money-laundering and fraud are still in the mix.</p>
<p>Ad-tech and engagement-maximization systems add new wrinkles to the problems of communications monopolies and the epistemological chaos created by corrupt institutions, but the chaos and the monopolies are still central to these problems.</p>
<p>The problem with many metacritics of tech – people who criticize tech critics – is their assumption that tech is irrelevant. The problem with tech critics themselves is their assumption that tech is dispositive.</p>
<p>The reality is that tech has formal characteristics – the universality of Turing completeness – that both expand the policy toolkit (the power of interoperability mandates) and constrain it (the futility of cryptography back-doors).</p>
<p>Criti-hype is real, and its remedy isn't to ignore technicalities and criticize tech as though it was just another industry – the remedy is to really understand what tech can and can't do, and to understand that the industry isn't run by super-genuises (evil or otherwise) nor science heroes (or villains).</p>

<p>2018 was almost the year we won the Right to Repair.</p>
<p>Instead, 2018 turned out to be the year we lost R2R: 20 bills defeated in 20 state houses, and it was mostly Apple's fault.</p>
<p>Apple has a problem. As CEO Tim Cook warned his investors at the conclusion of his company's repair-killing lobbying spree, Apple's profits depend on people throwing away their devices, not fixing them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/01/letter-from-tim-cook-to-apple-investors/">https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/01/letter-from-tim-cook-to-apple-investors/</a></p>
<p>By monopolizing repairs, Apple doesn't just get to gouge you on parts and service – the real action is in pronouncing your device DOA, beyond repair. Then you have to buy another one.</p>
<p>Other companies lobbied hard against R2R: John Deere, GM, and other monopolists backed Apple's play. But Apple wrote the playbook, coming up with risible bullshit like claims that blocking independent repair is essential to protecting privacy.</p>
<p><a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/apple%20rfi%20-%20signed.pdf">https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/apple%20rfi%20-%20signed.pdf</a></p>
<p>Apple's anti-repair FUD got picked up and amplified by Big Car in 2020, when they spent millions fighting an automotive R2R ballot initiative in Massachusetts, claiming that letting independent mechanics at your car would lead to your actual <em>murder</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/13/said-no-one-ever/#r2r">https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/13/said-no-one-ever/#r2r</a></p>
<p>2018 is the year we lost Right to Repair, but 2021 might be the year we win it. We're only a month in and 14 states are already debating R2R legislation, with more to come. The Repair Coalition and PIRG are leading the fight, buoyed by massive R2R successes in the EU.</p>
<p>Independent repair isn't just fair and it isn't just good for the planet – it's also good for the nation and its economy. The average US family loses $330/year thanks to anti-repair practices, a $40b drag on the American economy.</p>
<p>Repair creates local jobs for SMEs whose earnings – from helping their neighbors – are taxed (not hidden in offshore tax-havens) and contribute to their communities. These are on-shore, dignified tech jobs – not slave labor in Xinjiang or coerced labor in a Foxconn plant.</p>
<p>Repair diverts ewaste from landfills. Each kiloton of ewaste creates &lt;1 landfill jobs, or 15 recyling jobs.</p>
<p>But that same kiloton of ewaste creates 200 local repair jobs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Right-to-Repair/Jobs-Revolution">https://www.ifixit.com/Right-to-Repair/Jobs-Revolution</a></p>
<p>Repair creates a secondary market for low-cost devices that find their way into the hands of people on the wrong side of the digital divide – a divide that got starker and more consequential during the pandemic, and will only get more important in years to come.</p>
<p>Speaking of the pandemic: anti-repair laws meant that when PB840 ventilators (the most common ventilator, sold by the monopolist Medtronic, which benefits from the largest-ever tax-avoidance "reverse takeover" in corporate history) broke, they couldn't be legally fixed.</p>
<p>Instead, desperate med-tech people turned to a lone Polish hacker who built Medtronic defeat devices into old guitar-pedals and clock radios to get around the anti-repair measures in the ventilators that hospitals had bought and paid for.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/10/flintstone-delano-roosevelt/#medtronic-again">https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/10/flintstone-delano-roosevelt/#medtronic-again</a></p>
<p>R2R is a fight for justice. For the right to decide who fixes your stuff. For the right to set up shop and help your neighbors. For self-reliance and resiliency over profits. For on-shore small businesses over multinational cheaters.</p>
<p>Once again, a wave of R2R laws is sweeping the nation. The monopolists who profiteered off our misery during the pandemic will once again turn out to stop them. PIRG and the Repair Coalition need our support – as do their coalition allies like EFF.</p>

<p>When you hear the phrase "free market," you probably think of "a market that is free from regulation" but that's the opposite of the phrase's original meaning!</p>
<p>Adam Smith used the term to describe a market that was free from "economic rents" – money earned by owning things, rather than doing things. Smith recognized that markets attract parasites – "rentiers" – who seek to drain wealth by "investing" rather than building and doing.</p>
<p>Which meant that, in the absence of muscular state  intervention, markets would become less and less free – more and more dependent on the whims of rentiers who used money to breed money by creating toll-barriers between parts of the productive economy.</p>
<p>For Smith, markets were only free if they were regulated. But that's the opposite of the way that we talk about free markets today. Today, a free market is a market where you are free to collect rents – passive income from owning things, at the expense of people doing things.</p>
<p>This is true in so many metaphorical ways, but it's especially true when we're talking about actual rent – actual homes that people need to survive and produce, whose primary role today is to serve as an asset class to be maximized, not a basic human right.</p>
<p>London is ground zero for the conversion of housing from a human right to a speculative asset, a city at war with itself, filled up with empty safe-deposit boxes in the sky, while productive workers – the "essential workers" of the pandemic – triple-up in substandard housing.</p>
<p>The conversion of London from a city to an asset was hugely profitable, primarily for offshore "investors," especially criminals who were attracted by London's veneer of respectability, which allowed them to convert their loot to legitimate earnings through property sales.</p>
<p>The overslosh of these tremendous cash flows has hopelessly corrupted London's planning authorities, who are absolutely helpless and hopeless at holding developers to their own promises – new builds get extra storeys and shed public concessions without penalty.</p>
<p>And just as the tax-authorities who despair of enforcing against the real cheats turn their efforts to everyday people who can't afford to fight investigations, London's planners spend their days making life miserable for homeowners trying to make minor improvements.</p>
<p>I spent two years fighting Hackney for the right to build a small, windowed greenhouse on my flat's balcony, finally giving up on growing my own veggies. Meanwhile, the for-profit "student residence" across the street replaced hundreds of small offices, overbuilt and busted.</p>
<p>Today, it's a failed Wework, while the four-storey "boutique hotel" across the street has been transformed into eight+ storeys, with multiple storeys of office space, all without any planning enforcement.</p>
<p>The conversion of London into a …</p></div></article></div>

So there was widespread satisfaction last week when  members of an online discussion group called WallStreetBets started  beating the Wall Street bully boys at their own game. Ringleaders of the  group noticed that hedge funds had taken a short position in the  videogame retailer GameStop that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ip6jnv/the_real_greatest_short_burn_of_the_century/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">far exceeded</a> the number of shares available to trade. Motivated as much by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6omry/an_open_letter_to_melvin_capital_cnbc_boomers_and/">revenge</a>  as by profit, these influencers in the group encouraged the 2.7 million  members (since risen to around 8 million) to purchase the stock in  order to drive the price higher and create a massive short squeeze. This  quickly became a movement with a cause similar to that of Occupy Wall  Street, except much more effective because it hit the intended target  where they would feel it the most, in the wallet. “The only way to beat a  rigged game,” one WallStreetBets leader <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ip6jnv/the_real_greatest_short_burn_of_the_century/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">said</a>, “is to rig it even harder.”&nbsp;</p><p>GameStop  stock, which closed at $17.69 a share on Jan. 8, shot up to $347.51 by  the close last Wednesday. With combined losses of almost $20 billion,  hedge funds were on the ropes and close to bleeding out, selling their  longs in an increasingly futile effort to cover their shorts. One fund,  Melvin Capital, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/31/melvin-capital-lost-more-than-50percent-after-betting-against-gamestop-wsj.html">lost over half its value</a> and had to be bailed out by <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/steve-cohen-ken-griffin-invest-3-billion-gamestop-short-seller-2021-1-1030003305">hedge fund sugar daddies</a>  Ken Griffin (Citadel) and Steve Cohen (Point 72). An even bigger fund,  Citron, was teetering on the brink of collapse. All this outsider army  needed to win was the continued ability to communicate with each other  online, and their collective ability to keep piling into the “Buy” side  of the trade. Within hours, they would be hobbled on the first front and  crippled on the second.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Empire Strikes Back</strong></p><p>First, the digital distribution platform Discord <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253251/discord-bans-the-r-wallstreetbets-server">banned</a> the WallStreetBets account after the close Wednesday for “<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/discord-bans-wallstreetbets-server-hate-speech-reddit-gamestop-gme-2021-1">hate speech, glorifying violence, and spreading misinformation</a>.” (For a moment, it looked like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/l6i26r/discord_and_reddit_remove_rwallstreetbets/">Reddit had also banned </a>the  group, but they resisted pressure to do so.) If the quoted  justification sounds familiar, it’s nearly identical to the one given by  Google, Apple, and Amazon for deplatforming Parler just three weeks  earlier. Echoing Amazon, Discord said it had sent the group repeated  warnings about objectionable content before deciding, on that day of all  days, to shut them down.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, WallStreetBets investors  were locked out of their trading accounts by online brokers such as  Robinhood on Thursday morning. Based on new collateral requirements that  it says were imposed by an industry consortium, Robinhood forbade its  users from buying GameStop and other stocks that WallStreetBets had  identified as short squeeze opportunities. Users were allowed only to  “close their positions”—in other words, to sell to the shorts desperate  to buy. When angry users registered their disapproval by leaving over  100,000 one-star reviews of the Robinhood app in the Google Play Store,  Google <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255245/google-deleting-bad-robinhood-reviews-play-store">deleted</a> them.&nbsp;</p><p>Normal  trading was allowed to resume Friday, but the hedge funds used their  24-hour sole ownership of the battlefield to fortify their positions,  covering the most vulnerable shorts. Wall Street then sent in  reinforcements, as new short positions were taken at these high price  levels, virtually guaranteed to pay out when, inevitably, the air leaks  out of the balloon. Faced with a game that, for once, they couldn’t rig  in their favor, it appeared that the insiders tipped the board over and  started a new game. As a massively decentralized online group of scrappy  outsiders, the only tools at WallStreetBets’ disposal were online  trading and social networking. Both were frozen at the crucial moment,  and the hedge fund insiders were let off the hook. The weaponization of  censorship is a big part of the reason why.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Down the Slippery Slope</strong></p><p>Some of us <a href="https://davidsacks.medium.com/the-speech-cartel-b3f5555f7787">warned</a>  of a slippery slope when Parler was taken down and a sitting president  was systematically ghosted from every online speech platform. But we  could not have foreseen how slippery the slope would be, or how fast we  would slide down it. We were told that the curbs on speech of President  Trump and his supporters were necessary to prevent further  “insurrection” and protect the peaceful transition of power. However,  much like the troops and barricades that still ring the Capitol, these  speech restrictions remain in place well after the transition of power  has occurred. The censorship power is always justified in response to a  genuine outrage or crisis, but it is rarely relinquished once the threat  passes. Rather it gets weaponized to protect powerful, connected  insiders, as the GameStop fiasco illustrates.</p><p>How do we suppose  Discord chose that moment to enforce its “Community Guidelines” against  WallStreetBets? Almost certainly, one of the hedge funds whose ox was  being gored combed through their message boards looking for anything  that might violate the terms of service. And surely they found it, as  these boards contain the same raunchy language you would hear if you  visited any trading floor or boiler room on Wall Street. They presumably  reported the content to Discord, which took the group down.&nbsp;</p><p>Did Discord warn WallStreetBets of content violations before last Wednesday? I’m sure they did. Amazon <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-responds-parlers-lawsuit-calls-meritless-cites-content-advocating-violence/">sent</a>  such a warning letter to Parler as well. Frankly, such a letter could  be, and likely is, sent to every large message board on the web. The  founder of a user-generated content site described it to me as “the One  Percent Problem.” Every user-generated content site will have a small  percentage of offensive material that gets through, no matter how many  content moderators are hired. For example, Facebook, Twitter, and  YouTube <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22221285/trump-online-capitol-riot-far-right-parler-twitter-facebook">allowed far more content</a> advocating for and planning the Capitol riot than Parler. But instead of acknowledging this, they were eager to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/13/facebook-role-in-capitol-protest/">blame</a>  the upstart, which had recently taken over the top spot in the social  networking category in the app store. Scapegoating Parler served the  dual purpose of deflecting blame and squashing a competitor.</p><p>Critics  of social networks insist that these sites simply need to double down  on censorship in order to finally rid us of problematic speech. But that  ignores how social media moderation actually works. Algorithms set to  recognize keywords capture only a small fraction of problematic posts,  leaving millions of posts for humans to review. The work is so  voluminous that it’s outsourced to far-flung locales where English may  not even be the first language. Low-level employees must decipher  complicated guidelines while navigating our increasingly Byzantine world  of political and cultural hot-buttons. Mistakes are inevitable, and the  harder a company tightens the standards to get the One Percent Problem  down to 0.1 or 0.01 percent, the more undeserving accounts—from <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/ron-paul-blocked-accessing-facebook-page-over-violating-community-standards-1560639">Ron Paul</a> to the <a href="https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2021/01/23/pers-j23.html">Socialist Equality Party</a>—will  be swept up in the dragnet. With the Town Square now digitized,  centralized, and privatized in the hands of a cartel of Big Tech  companies, the protections of the First Amendment no longer apply.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Insiders Vs. Outsiders</strong></p><p>Censorship  is about who has the power to censor, and what checks are placed upon  that power. Right now, tech companies have all the power, and they  exercise it as a like-minded cartel. When we see Alexandria  Ocasio-Cortez and Ted Cruz voice similar concerns over what happened to  WallStreetBets last week, we should realize that the politics of this  issue in the post-Trump era will no longer divide along an axis of Left  and Right, but of insider and outsider.&nbsp;</p><p>Elizabeth Warren, when  she started landing blows against Wall Street after the 2008 financial  crisis, met with President Obama’s economics adviser, the former  treasury secretary and Harvard president Larry Summers. He presented her  with a choice: “I could be an insider or I could be an outsider,” she  recalled in her 2014 memoir, <em>A Fighting Chance</em>. “Outsiders can  say whatever they want. But people on the inside don’t listen to them.  Insiders, however, get lots of access and a chance to push their ideas.  People—powerful people—listen to what they have to say. But insiders  also understand one unbreakable rule: <em>They don’t criticize other insiders</em>.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It’s  precisely this insider-protection scheme that the internet and social  media have most disrupted. Insiders are massively powerful but few in  number. Outsiders have always been numerous but unorganized. Social  networking and online organizing have given the outsiders real power to  effect change, and finally register their disgust at the way incompetent  elites protect each other. The elites of Big Business, Big Media, Wall  Street, and Washington are terrified of this, and will leverage any  censorship power to keep the outsiders at bay.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Real “Big Lie”</strong></p><p>After  the storming of the Capitol building on Jan. 6, we heard a lot about  the “Big Lie” perpetrated by Trump and his allies that the election was  “stolen.” In reality, this narrative never got far. It was rejected by  the media (including Fox News), thrown out by the courts, labeled by  social networks as “disputed,” and dismissed by politicians, including  Trump’s own vice president. Yes, some far-right groups like the Proud  Boys and Oath Keepers came to Washington to commit acts of violence, but  they were roundly denounced. For a Big Lie to be successful, it has to  have buy-in from the people in power, moneyed interests, the  narrative-framers in the media generally, all of whom have to benefit  from the lie and therefore repeat it.&nbsp;</p><p>But what issue could  possibly unite all of these constituencies? For several years, elites in  the media, government, and now finance have denounced social media as a  tool for propaganda, disinformation and hate. Social media was to blame  for the Russian disinformation that supposedly elected Trump in 2016.  Social …</p></div></div>

<p>
<b>Moscow, February 2, 2021</b> – The Gamaleya National Research Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF, Russia’s sovereign wealth fund) announce that the Lancet, one of the world's oldest and most respected medical journals, has published interim results of a Phase III clinical trial of Sputnik V, confirming the vaccine’s high efficacy and safety. Sputnik V, which is based on a well-studied human adenoviral vectors platform, is the world’s first registered vaccine against coronavirus.
</p>
<p>
In the interim efficacy analysis of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, where data on 19,866 volunteers were included in the efficacy analysis (14,964 of whom received the vaccine and 4,902 the placebo), the two-dose treatment of Sputnik V administered 21 days apart demonstrated efficacy of 91.6% against COVID-19. The calculation is based on the analysis of 78 confirmed cases of COVID-19 identified in the placebo group (62 cases) and in the vaccine group (16 cases). Sputnik V generated a robust humoral and cell mediated immune response.
</p>
<p>
<b>Alexander Gintsburg, Director of the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology,</b> said:
</p>
<p>
“The publication of internationally peer reviewed data on Sputnik V’s clinical trial results is a great success in the global battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. The Russian vaccine’s safety and high efficacy are shown by the hard scientific data presented and I congratulate the entire team of Gamaleya National Research Center for this monumental achievement. Several vaccines have already been created based on human adenoviruses and this tool is one of the most promising for development of new vaccines in the future.”
</p>
<p>
<b>Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund,</b> commented:
</p>
<p>
“This is a great day in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The data published by The Lancet proves that not only Sputnik V is the world’s first registered vaccine, but also one of the best. It fully protects against severe COVID-19 according to data which has been independently compiled and reviewed by peers and then published in The Lancet. Sputnik V is one of only three vaccines in the world with efficacy of over 90% but outperforms them in terms of safety, ease of transportation due to storage requirements of +2 to +8 degrees and a more affordable price. Sputnik V is a vaccine for all mankind.”
</p>
<p>
<b>Hildegund C.J. Ertl, M.D., Professor, Vaccine &amp; Immunotherapy Center, The Wistar Institute, USA,</b> said:
</p>
<p>
“The vaccine is 100% effective in preventing serious disease or death, which in the end is the most crucial parameter; we can all deal with the sniffles as long as we stay out of the hospital or the graveyard. Even after a single dose of this prime-boost regimen protection against disease was at 87.6%. Sputnik V is thus more effective than the AstraZeneca or Johnson&amp;Johnson. Sputnik V, which, unlike the equally efficacious RNA vaccines of Pfizer and Moderna, can be stored in the fridge, will be of tremendous value to combat the global COVID-19 pandemic.”
</p>
<p>
<b>Cecil Czerkinsky, PhD, M.D., Research Director, National Institute of Health and Medical research (Inserm), France,</b> said:
</p>
<p>
“The interim results of the phase 3 clinical trial of Sputnik V COVID adenovirus vector vaccine are fairly impressive. This vaccine appears to be highly efficacious and immunogenic across age groups. This is clearly good news as this dual formulation vaccine is comparatively easy to manufacture and to deploy amid the anticipated global shortage of vaccines and logistical problems in vaccination roll-out of temperature-sensitive vaccines recently authorized for emergency use.”
</p>
<p>
<b>Omar Sued, President of the Society of infectologists, Argentina,</b> said:
</p>
<p>
“The paper, published in The Lancet, confirms successful results and provides additional information about the efficacy and the safety of this vaccine in different subgroups. From the public health´s point of view, the efficacy of the vaccine was very high. The safety profile was very good. The dissemination of this information is vital for informing the scaling up and rollout of this vaccine worldwide.”
</p>
<p>
<b>David Livermore, Professor of Medical Microbiology at the University of East Anglia, UK,</b> said:
</p>
<p>
“Presently the world needs all the good vaccines that it can get against COVID-19. And these are impressive results: Sputnik V is the first adenovirus vector vaccine to achieve the 90% efficacy seen with the two mRNA vaccines.”
</p>
<p>
According to the peer-reviewed study results, the vaccine provides full protection against severe cases of the novel coronavirus infection. Among the confirmed severe cases of COVID-19, 20 were recorded in the placebo group, while none were recorded in the vaccine group. Due to the time needed for the immune response to develop, in the first week after vaccination there was no significant difference in protection against severe cases of COVID-19 between the vaccine and placebo groups, while in the period from 7 to 14 days the vaccine’s efficacy rose to 50%, in the period from 14 to 21 days to 74.1%, and to 100% from the 21st day, giving full protection against severe cases of the coronavirus.
</p>
<p>
Importantly, the study included 2,144 volunteers over 60 years old with the maximum ages of 87 years (vaccine group) and 84 years (placebo group), showing great safety results for the elder age strata. The vaccine’s efficacy for the elderly was shown at 91.8% and did not differ statistically from the group of 18-60 years old, also demonstrating great safety and immunogenicity results.
</p>
<p>
Sputnik V has demonstrated an excellent safety profile: 70 episodes of serious adverse events (SAE) not related to COVID-19 were recorded in 68 study participants: in 45 volunteers from the vaccine group and 23 volunteers from the placebo group. None of these events were associated with the vaccination as confirmed by Independent Data Monitoring Committee. Most adverse events (94%) were mild and were limited to flu-like syndromes, injection site reactions, headache and asthenia.
</p>
<p>
Sputnik V is one of only three vaccines in the world to have demonstrated efficacy of over 90%. Sputnik V stands out among these vaccines thanks to a number of key advantages, namely: a well-studied and highly efficient human adenoviral vector mechanism proven safe over decades; the vaccine’s low cost in comparison to other approaches; and fewer logistics requirements with a storage temperature of between two to eight degrees Celsius allowing for easier distribution worldwide.
</p>
<p>
The safety of vaccines based on human adenoviruses has been confirmed in more than 75 international publications and more than 250 clinical trials conducted during the past two decades - while the history of use of human adenoviruses in vaccine development started in 1953. Adenovirus vectors are genetically modified viruses of the regular flu that cannot reproduce in a human body. When the Sputnik V vaccine is used, the coronavirus itself does not enter the body as the vaccine only contains genetic information about part of its outer protein coat, the so called "spikes" forming its crown. This completely eliminates the possibility of getting infected as a result of vaccination while also causing the body to generate a stable immune response.
</p>
<p>
In addition, Sputnik V uses two different vectors - based on human adenovirus serotypes Ad5 and Ad26 - in two separate shots, allowing for a more effective defense against the coronavirus than vaccines using the same vector for both shots. By deploying two different vectors, Sputnik V avoids a possible neutralizing effect and generates a durable and longer-lasting immune response.

<p><em>In each issue of the “Cloud Irregular” newsletter, I’ll try to provide a useful piece of commentary on some tech-related topic. After that I’ll let you know about any new stuff I’ve published, or upcoming talks. Then I’ll give you something extremely silly, just to cleanse your palate, and we’ll be done.</em></p>

<p><em>Sound good? If so, throw in your email at the bottom of this post.</em></p>

<h3 id="amazon-won-t-spin-off-aws-and-that-s-too-bad-for-aws">Amazon won’t spin off AWS, and that’s too bad for AWS</h3>

<p>First let’s make one thing perfectly clear: Amazon and AWS are not splitting up. AWS CEO Andy Jassy has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/11/aws-ceo-we-would-follow-the-law-if-regulators-demand-amazon-spin-out.html">repeatedly avowed</a> that the only way AWS will ever leave the mothership is if federal regulators feed him feet first into a wood chipper.</p>

<p>On one level, this makes sense. AWS still generates something like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/25/aws-earnings-q1-2019.html">half of Amazon’s operating income</a>. Amazon can wrap its tentacles around every facet of the consumer experience because of the big dollars rolling in from its cloud business. AWS’s dominance fuels big AMZN share prices and funds new innovation, etc, etc. We get it: Amazon will let go of AWS when you pry it from <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/07/28/biceps-billionaire-doesnt-matter-jeff-bezos-not-worlds-richest/">Jeff Bezos’ weirdly fearsome biceps</a>.</p>

<p>That’s what AWS does for Amazon. But what does Amazon do for AWS? Increasingly, as far as I can tell, bad things.</p>

<p>Let’s lay aside for a moment the whole regulatory question, whether AWS and Amazon will someday be trust-busted and broken up by force. The 2020 presidential candidates can <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-amazon.html">hash that out</a>. Amazon is causing other political problems for AWS already.</p>

<p>Look, Amazon is huge; it’s owned by the richest man in the world, who increasingly owns <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/its-not-just-amazon-and-whole-foods-heres-jeff-bezos-enormous-empire-in-one-chart-2017-06-21">other things</a> as well. That means bad vibes from some other venture can poison AWS deals.</p>

<p>Remember <a href="https://defensesystems.com/articles/2018/07/26/jedi-hits-the-street.aspx">JEDI</a>, that $10 billion single-vendor Department of Defense contract AWS has been craving for what seems like years? Apparently the whole bid process <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/07/18/jedi_cloud_donald_trump/">is now on hold</a>, not because of anything AWS did wrong, but because, well, Jeff Bezos also owns the Washington Post, which Donald Trump does not appreciate, and so it’s all a mess. (Also, I love that Oracle has been apparently fomenting all this strife via Machiavellian backstage dealings, which I guess is Oracle’s whole brand now.)</p>

<p>There’s also the issue of AWS selling technology, directly or indirectly, to government agencies and police forces who use it for dubious purposes like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/22/17492106/amazon-ice-facial-recognition-internal-letter-protest">facial recognition</a>. Werner Vogels’ recent AWS Summit keynote address suffered <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/protesters-disrupt-amazon-event-over-its-ties-with-ice-11562882825">no fewer than five interruptions</a> from protesters angry that AWS services support the operations of US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p>

<p>While this might seem to be AWS’s problem, I guarantee that the name recognition of Amazon among everyday consumers drives a lot of the public outrage. (That’s why you often see Amazon-dot-com protests misdirected at AWS events. I’ve seen protesters interrupt an AWS summit with signs and shouts about Amazon warehouse conditions. The lines are blurry and it’s no wonder people get confused.)</p>

<p>Take Amazon out of the equation, and for better or worse the scrutiny of AWS goes down. To put it another way, there’s like a 50% chance that anyone running a big Oracle cluster at this point is a supervillain, but you don’t see Oracle getting protested.</p>

<p>Leaving aside the public sector issues, we have Gartner’s new magic quadrant report (I know, stay with me) <a href="https://www.crn.com.au/news/aws-azure-and-google-top-gartners-iaas-magic-quadrant-528501">reminding us</a> that many companies, particularly retailers, are now eschewing AWS out of an existential fear that they are funneling dollars indirectly to their biggest competitor. <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2018/least-one-retailer-online-outlet-zulily-still-willing-sign-amazon-web-services/">Walmart, Target, and Kroger</a> are all notorious for their no-AWS tech policies, with Amazon’s 2017 acquisition of Whole Foods apparently the last straw.</p>

<p>This is bad enough, but survivable: AWS can and does thrive without Walmart’s business. But Walmart actually takes their policy a lot further: they now <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/walmart-forces-tech-partners-to-leave-aws-following-whole-foods-acquisition/">require their tech partners to stay off AWS as well</a>. These retailers (and <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2019/06/09/nearly-50-of-health-systems-see-amazon-as-a-threat/">healthcare providers</a>, and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/16/why-volkswagen-chose-microsoft-azure-over-aws.html">car companies</a>, and whatever industry Amazon disrupts next) are fighting for their lives, and they’ll play every card they hold to swing their sizable partner ecosystems toward Microsoft or Google. The competing cloud platforms, for their part, are perfectly willing to push this narrative, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/12/microsoft-google-cloud-pitch-vs-aws-we-wont-compete-with-you.html">swearing up and down</a> that they won’t “compete with partners”.</p>

<p>So here’s the reality on the ground. I just got back from <a href="https://www.dashcon.io/talks/when-bad-architectures-happen-to-good-people/">speaking at Dash</a>, Datadog’s New York conference focused on next-generation ops and infrastructure (though mostly, let’s be real, focused on Datadog). I took an informal survey of tech leads there, people building SaaS platforms for everything from real estate to nonprofits to IoT. Not things Amazon competes with directly. But nearly all of these vendors have, or want to believe that they will land, the kind of big customer that may have a “no AWS” policy.</p>

<p>So with few exceptions, they are hedging their bets. They build on containers in a misplaced belief that will make quick migrations easier, they architect dubious “multi-cloud” workloads … the point is, they’re not using AWS the way it’s designed to be used, as a holistic, deeply integrated platform, and the looming shadow of Amazon is the reason why.</p>

<p>Of course, the whole “I can’t go all-in on AWS because some of my own customers might distrust AWS, because they in turn fear Amazon” thing is such a delightfully screwy reason for making suboptimal tech choices. It reminds me of the old fundamentalist idea of <a href="https://www.patheos.com/blogs/religionnow/2017/10/secondary-separation-islam/">secondary separation</a>, where you shun an innocent person because they’ve insufficiently disassociated themselves from heretics.</p>

<p>The problem with secondary separation, as the fundamentalists discovered, is that it has no logical stopping point. What degree of separation is enough? How many layers of vendors must you purge before you can be sure you’re not bankrolling heresy, or Amazon? The whole conversation is faintly dumb, but it’s <em>happening</em>, and that’s a problem for AWS as much as for the engineering teams who have to work around them.</p>

<p>So let’s recap the reasons Amazon may be harming AWS:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Amazon’s name recognition creates a target on AWS’s back when they want to work in politically-charged areas</p></li>

<li><p>Jeff Bezos’s other business ventures and feud with the president jeopardize AWS’s government contracts</p></li>

<li><p>Companies that compete with Amazon don’t want to use AWS services</p></li>

<li><p>Companies that want to attract business from Amazon competitors avoid AWS, or use it less fully</p></li>
</ul>

<p>None of these things are that bad on their own, at least not yet. But they all keep AWS from being the best, most juggernaut-y version of itself. They keep AWS’s services from competing on equal footing in the marketplace. And that’s a shame, because the tech itself is often pretty great.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/scott-galloway-amazon-will-spin-off-amazon-web-services-ignition-2018-12">some smart people</a> think Amazon will eventually have to spin off AWS just because AWS would be so valuable and do so well in the market as a “pure cloud” player. But AWS is a victim of its own success. It’s not going anywhere because Amazon depends on it. And as Amazon expands to threaten more industries, AWS may paradoxically become less successful. It’s a weird bind.</p>

<p>At any rate, unless something big changes in the regulatory landscape, Amazon and AWS will probably remain joined at the hip. And I’ll keep having frustrating conversations with more and more clients about why they can’t use the best cloud services on the market.</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: I work for an AWS consulting partner, but I own no $AMZN stock and have no direct interest in what Amazon does with AWS.</em></p>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-78a04d1642024dbcaa69"><div><p><strong>Chapter One: The Creation of Today’s Internet and the Needs of Tomorrow’s</strong></p><p>One of the neat things about the internet is who created it, why, and how.&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout the 1960s to 1990s, the foundation of today’s internet was built through a variety of consortiums and informal working groups composed of government research labs, public universities and independent technologists. These typically not-for-profit collectives typically focused on establishing common standards that would help them share information from one server to another (i.e. messages or files), and in doing so, make it easier to collaborate on future technologies, projects and ideas.&nbsp;</p><p>The internet’s quirky provenance is responsible for many of its best modern attributes. Today, everyone can create content on the internet, everyone is technically capable of accessing everything on the internet, and every web page on the internet can connect to another without the user needing to change browser, device or client. This flexibility, interoperability and universality isn’t by decree - there’s no Head of the Internet mandating the right to create, host or access/connect to a website.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, this is a byproduct of the internet’s open standards, programming, markup languages and so on. These ensure that a user doesn’t need to pay for a web browser or to load a website, nor does the owner of a website need to pay for the code used by their website. Services like Zoom also work because they leverage actively maintained standards that are free to use and designed to support any device. Every device maker needs to support these standards in order to have happy customers. Some of us now recoil against aggressive data collection, ad insertions and tracking, but this is partly because we don’t <em>need</em> to give these up. The use of standards, such as HTML, means that browser extensions can block ads or tracking. We may be willing to give up data for a free service, but the Internet’s makeup means we don’t have to.</p><p>The benefits here are hard to overstate. But just imagine, for example, how the internet might differ if it had been created by multinational media conglomerates in order to sell things, serve ads or harvest user data for profits. Downloading a .JPG could cost money, with a .PNG costing 50% more. Teleconferencing software might have required the use of a broadband operator’s app or portal (e.g. Welcome to your Xfinity Browser™, click here for Xfinitybook™ or XfinityCalls™ powered by Zoom™). Websites might only work in Internet Explorer <em>or</em> Chrome - and need to pay a given browser an annual fee for the privilege. Or maybe users would need to pay their broadband provider extra fees to read certain programming languages or use a given web technology (“This website requires Xfinity Premium with 3D Rendering”). Regardless of the specific differences, it’s likely internet penetration would be lower, as would usage and associated commerce.</p><p>The web’s cross-platform, standards-based and non-profit origins are inseparable from the internet’s rapid growth, the trillions of dollars in companies that have been founded over the past 30 years, and the positive societal impact of these companies (e.g. a drop in the cost and increase in the quality of communications, the reduction in gatekeeper power, lowered transaction fees, etc.).&nbsp;</p><p>Today’s heavily conglomerated internet giants remain mindful of the fact that open APIs, common standards, exportable data, etc., all help grow both the internet technology acceptance model and, in most cases, their own bottom lines. But these companies are less concerned with how the overall market grows than their share and control of this growth. Technology companies, almost by definition, prefer that the market build on top of or through them than have new entrants build around or in competition with them. As a result, the same companies that emerged thanks to openness tend to reject these principles where they might undermine their strategic position.</p><p>This isn’t an unusual disposition for a for-profit company, but the implications are particularly powerful in digital markets. In the offline world, free market economics enable robust competition that typically delivers the best products, variety and prices for consumers, and moderates the power of the strongest market players (if only due to diseconomies of scale). Online, incredibly powerful network effects and zero-cost marginal revenues/distribution has enabled dominant platforms to push back against the open nature of the internet, forcing consumers and creators to use them as universal intermediaries, and subduing standard market forces.</p><p>Right now, we are on the cusp of the next internet. The terms used for this future vary and the degree to which you believe in one label or vision is not particularly relevant. And the technologies to design, enable and support the fullest version of this are as far from the capabilities of 2021 as the 1990s Internet is from us today. But what matters is that a growing share of our time will be spent within virtual spaces and with virtual goods — for education, work, health, politics and leisure. Sometimes these spaces and goods will be purely virtual, other times virtual twins of physical ones, and sometimes augmented reality. For related reasons, a growing percentage of our income will be spent on virtual assets, goods, experiences — many of which we’ll be able to sell, trade, share, use or improve. And of course, enormous new industries, marketplaces and resources will emerge to enable these opportunities, with novel types of labor, skills, professions and certifications invented to serve them.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s no way for this future to be developed as the original internet was. The US government and public research institutions led the development of the information superhighway in part because few in private businesses understood the commercial potential of a World Wide Web, but also because these non-profits were essentially the only entities with the computational talent, resources and ambitions to build it. Conversely, all of today’s mega-tech companies are deep believers in this future internet, and are best positioned (via resources and talent) to build it.&nbsp;</p><p>The most important impediment today is Apple. Although no company has done more to propel the last 15 years of the internet, its policies are unlikely to produce the most prosperous overall ecosystem and do not lay a strong groundwork for the “next Internet”. Instead, Apple is inhibiting this future Internet. And it does so via tolls, controls, and technologies that not only deny what made and still makes the open web so powerful, but also prevents competition, and prioritize Apple’s own profits.</p><p><span><strong>Chapter Two: There’s Apple, then GAFM</strong></span></p><p>Apple’s adverse effects stem from three interconnected and increasingly powerful elements.</p><p>First, Apple believes it knows better than consumers, the developer community, and the market at large. This includes which technologies should be adopted by the internet community, the role of user agency (and the extent to which users are capable of informed consent), and common business practices around user data, privacy and security.</p><p>This disposition led Apple to limit the role of the marketplace <em>on its </em>device (something the company did not do for the Mac). Specifically, Apple mandates that on its devices:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>All applications would need to be distributed by the Apple App Store, and could not be directly downloaded from the app maker or a third party app store</p></li><li><p>All applications distributed by the App Store would need to be approved by Apple, and approval would be contingent upon an extensive list of policies and requirements</p></li><li><p>All applications distributed by the Apple App Store would need to conform with the App Store’s billing policies, which typically meant that Apple was the exclusive in-app biller for iOS applications</p></li></ol><p>These three layers are technically different — the ability to use an operating system driver has nothing to do with the ability to distribute an app to the consumer or charge for them for a given piece of content or function. However, Apple’s iOS devices forced them together. If a developer wants to make an app, they need access to native drivers. And if a developer wants access to native drivers, their apps need to be distributed by the App Store. And if they want to use the App Store, they must adhere to Apple’s policies, which means using Apple’s billing systems.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple’s control and integration allowed it to offer a best-in-class mobile experience that also helped repel the most pernicious aspects of the online world; onboard and engage less technically savvy users; and develop a richly monetized app ecosystem. This, in turn, led to unprecedented success. <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2020/8/18/app-stores">Today, the iPhone has 66% market share in the United States, 75% of U.S. App Store revenues, and over 80% of time spent on the mobile internet</a> (iOS’s share of physical e-commerce transactions is likely somewhere in the middle of this range). And this dominance is also growing. Eighty percent of U.S. teenagers have iPhones and the device held 90% of smartphone activations in the week after Christmas 2020.</p><p>While Apple’s closed approach is why the company’s products are so successful, the enormity of this success is what makes this approach so problematic. There is no proprietary, closed system that affects more lives on a daily basis than that of iOS. Due to this fact, Apple has become a de facto regulator for the internet; a single for-profit body that wields enormous soft, hard, and even accidental power.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There are almost no large companies in the world that can live without a mobile app (these apps are …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div></section></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>In my <a href="https://about.scarf.sh/post/shea-levy-composition-fanatic">previous post</a>, I remarked on the fact that composition, while central to our work as engineers, is often poorly supported by the tools we use. In this post I want to explore a specific trend away from this state of affairs, where composition is given the first-class treatment it deserves.</p><p>When engineering with atoms, composing components often consists of literally putting them together: you take piece A, move it close to piece B, and combine them by inserting tab X into slot Y. Sometimes an analogous case occurs in software: developers may instantiate instances of two particular design patterns in a class definition and compose them by ensuring the overlap meets both requirements, or copy in a template or project scaffold to compose a general structure with their specific use case.</p><p>Most of the time, however, software engineers compose by <em>reference</em>, making one part of the system conform to the interface of another and indirectly interact with the component exposing the interface through some pointer, handle, or name. These layers of indirection allow for more efficient reuse of components, clearer conceptual boundaries, and more specialized and dynamic composition. This benefits both the humans using the tools and the automated systems operating behind the scenes, at various time scales. Composition by named reference is so fundamental that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">one of the two foundational models of computation</a> revolves exclusively around referencing by name and resolving those references!</p><h2>Programming and networking</h2><p>Traditionally, most sophisticated name-based composition acted at the levels of building programs or of connecting entire machines.</p><p>Composition by name is ubiquitous in programming. We reference packages we want to use by a name and a version. We identify libraries we depend on by name. We call functions, consume data, implement interfaces, etc., all via their names. Then our tools take over: Our editors provide us documentation by name, our compilers look up type information and calling conventions by name, our static and dynamic linkers connect needed functionality across binary components by name.</p><p>Any user of post-Internet computers is intimately familiar with our industry's other venerable usage of names: finding another machine on the network. Every time you type a URL in your search bar, click a link, or configure an application to point to some specific service, you are composing computer resources by name. The most systematized and sophisticated aspect of these names is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">domain name system</a>, which gives you a high quality way to connect a top level name to a specific machine. Most of the rest of the URL is particular to each individual system, with at best weak conventions governing their use and meaning. But for both human and machine consumers, the domain name contains very precise semantics for composition at the machine level.</p><p>These names are not only crucial operationally, to put everything together in the system, they are also crucial cognitively, to put everything together in our minds. It's a clichéd joke that naming something is one of the two hardest problems in computer science, but that joke is based on the very serious fact that a name lets us treat a complex system as a single unit, and a good name helps us do that effectively.</p><p>DNS and programming language symbol resolution are at this point completely entrenched. They've been around in the relevant forms for the entire productive career of a huge portion of our industry. In more recent decades, however, some new approaches to name-based composition in new domains have emerged.</p><h2>Semantically-meaningful resource naming</h2><p>After the previous section, some of you may be wondering: What about the filesystem? It's true that files and other system resources have long been named by strings, with some weak structure for navigating trees of resources (i.e., the directory separator) and, on some systems, the type of file being named (the file extension). Similarly, other resources have long been referenced by name: <a href="https://google.com/">https://google.com</a> names not the server at google.com, but the specific HTTPS service exposed by that server over TCP port 443.</p><p>The problem with these and other naming systems is that they put too much of the work of composition onto the users. With a few minor exceptions like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard">filesystem hierarchy standard</a> and file extensions, file paths tell you almost nothing about the file in question that you didn't already know. Almost no one looks at the full URL of a hyperlink and extracts meaningful information from it that wasn't present in the context of the link. This results in the status quo: these names are almost always treated as fully opaque identifiers, and very few common naming rules apply across teams and systems.</p><p>Some systems have taken steps to move beyond this situation, however. In this section I will briefly cover a few novel tools that in some cases have succeeded in and in others promise to provide <em>semantically meaningful</em> names to compose different computational resources.</p><h3>git</h3><p>I assume most of you are familiar with <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>, at a high level. At a primitive level, git operates on various types of <em>objects</em>, such as blobs, commits, or symlinks. At the human interface level, many of these objects are ultimately referenced by ad hoc unstructured names, such as "file x/y/z on branch foo". That being said, you've probably seen commits referenced by a <em>hash</em>, such as 4149457c6358f702fffbefcc2b7f6e8a87f802fb. Hashes like this are what the human-readable names are translated into, and how all of the objects internally refer to each other.</p><p>What do the hashes mean? Each object can be <em>serialized</em>, i.e. written to a file such that it can be correctly reconstructed later, including references to any other objects it depends on. These serializations are <em>canonical</em>, such that any two objects that are the same will have byte for byte the same serialization. Using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">cryptographic hash function</a> on the contents of these serialized files then allows the git tools to give each object a short name that captures the full information content of the object, modulo unlikely hash collisions. We therefore call these <em>content-addressed</em> names.</p><p>Why should we use content-addressed names? In short, because they allow different components of the system to cheaply refer to each other with a high degree of reliability: If some commit object says that its associated filesystem tree has some file at a particular path, I know that whenever I refer to that file via relative references from the commit, I will get a file with exactly the same contents.</p><p>This allows for safe deduplication of files across commits and efficient communication protocols for distributing repositories across the network. It also gives a much more precise meaning to the names in question: "the file at x/y/z" can refer, at different times and on different systems, to any kind of file the relevant filesystem supports, whereas "the file at x/y/z in the tree of commit 4149457c6358f702fffbefcc2b7f6e8a87f802fb" refers, for most intents and purposes, to exactly one file with specific contents.</p><h3>Nix</h3><p><a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/#ch-about-nix">Nix</a> is a package manager for Unix systems. It is built on several innovations, but the one relevant for this post is the Nix store, where the filesystem resources associated with packages are managed.</p><p>Like git, Nix manages some of its filesystem resources by content-addressed name, using essentially the same logic as git's hash-based content addressing. By themselves, however, such names are inadequate to Nix's goal of highly reliable and accurate dependency management with composition across packages. If I've built package foo 1.0 against some specific content-addressed instance of package bar 2.0, I can calculate the content and thus a content-addressed name of the resulting package. But if you want to build foo 1.0 against the newly released bar 2.1, you can't reuse anything in that content addressed name and must rebuild from scratch.</p><p>Nix addresses this issue with what I call <em>recipe-addressed</em> names: Some filesystem resources are named not by their own content but by the content of a serialization of <em>a deterministic build recipe</em> for creating it. The nature of these build recipes is such that it is much easier to substitute in different versions, configurations, etc. anywhere in the dependency tree and recalculate what the new name of the results should be.</p><p>With content-addressed names for bootstrapping, and recipe-addressed names for building up more complex packages, Nix opens up a whole new world of package management. Nix can ensure that many different machines, however different their configurations, have exactly the same package installed.</p><p>Nix can safely reuse common dependencies between packages, parallelize builds, and distribute builds across multiple machines. Large centralized binary caches are possible with a <a href="https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-12-16-trustix-announcement/">decentralized trust mechanism</a> built on top. On top of these capabilities, <a href="https://nixos.org/guides/how-nix-works.html#nixos">entire system configurations</a> can be deterministically captured in a single name, allowing reproducible deployments and much more reliable migration of personal systems across computers.</p><h3>Nelson</h3><p><a href="https://getnelson.io/">Nelson</a> is a "cloud-native" service orchestration framework built to take advantage of modern distribution, resource management, and coordination mechanisms. Among other things, Nelson enables deploying an <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/what-is-immutable-infrastructure">immutable infrastructure</a>-style network topology while retaining efficient garbage collection of unneeded services. Nelson achieves this by requiring services to reference each other via name resolution mechanisms it populates from high level service configurations. Each service configuration specifies the other services it depends upon, providing both a service name, which has meaning to the user, and a <a href="https://semver.org/"><em>semantic version</em></a>, which contains information about cross-version compatibility. Nelson leverages the information in the dependency specification and keeps track of which services depend on which, allowing it to safely remove old instances of services that are not …</p></div></div></div></div>

Let's go over a simple problem to see how this can be useful.</p><p>For this problem, we are given an array <code>arr</code>, and a subarray size <code>k</code>, and we are asked to find the <em>average</em> of <em>all</em> subarrays in <code>arr</code> of size <code>k</code>. So given an array like <code>[1, 2, 3, 4]</code> and a subarray size <code>k = 2</code>, the correct answer would be <code>[1.5, 2.5, 3.5]</code> because:</p><ul><li><code>[1, 2, 3, 4]</code> has three subarrays of size 2, namely <code>[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]</code>.</li><li>The average of the first subarray is <code>1 + 2 / 2 = 1.5</code>, the average of the second is <code>2.5</code> (using the same formula), and the average of the third is <code>3.5</code>.</li><li>Putting this together we get the final result <code>[1.5, 2.5, 3.5]</code>.</li></ul><p>Given these steps, it seems pretty clear that in designing an algorithm to solve this problem we would have to (1) iterate through every subarray then (2) find the average of each and append it to the result array.</p><p>A straightforward way to find every subarray of an array is to iterate through each index of the array and <em>construct</em> the subarray that begins at that index by iterating <code>k</code> more times. In this second iteration we can also sum up the numbers to compute the resulting average. Here's what that would look like:</p><p>Doing that for <em>every</em> index in the array, we get the final algorithm:</p><p>Notice the number on the top right of the animation. This number represents the total number of steps required to compute the result given the inputs <code>arr</code> and <code>k</code>. Try adding two more items and see how that number changes—it went up, by a <em>lot</em>.</p><p>Is there a better way?</p><p>Looking back at the algorithm, notice that most of the time we're counting numbers that we've already included before. Let's look at the animation again, this time highlighting all the double counts in red:</p><p>When the algorithm finishes, only 2 elements <strong>were not double counted!</strong> It turns out that no matter what inputs, this implementation will <em>always</em> double count every element except for the first and the last (try playing around with the inputs to convince yourself).</p><p>So why are we double counting in the first place? If we look at the first two subarrays, we see there's a lot of overlap:</p><p>What if, on each step, we only take into account the <em>differences</em> instead? In other words, is there a way to get the sum of the second subarray from the sum of the first? If so, we would be able to <em>derive</em> the sum of the second subarray rather than recounting every element again.</p><p>In the example above, we can get the sum of the <strong>second subarray by subtracting 1 and adding 5</strong> to the sum of the first.</p><p>This reduces the sum computation from <code>k</code> iterations to only one iteration! This is also where the sliding window namesake comes from—it's as if we have a window of 4 items that we <em>slide</em> to the next subarray.</p><p>Maybe adding a border around the items would make the window more clear:</p><p>With this key insight let's rewrite the algorithm. Remember that the algorithm receives two inputs - an array of numbers <code>arr</code> and a size of subarray <code>k</code>.</p><ol><li>At the start, we <em>build</em> the window—iterate until our window contains <code>k</code> items—while keeping track of the sum.</li><li>Then, we <em>slide</em> the window one item over, updating the sum by subtracting the item no longer in the window and adding the item that was added to the window. By doing this we ensure that the sum stays in sync with the items that are in the window.</li><li>With this sum we can compute the average as before.</li></ol><p>And that's the find all averages problem using the sliding window pattern! Notice how this implementation only needs 7 steps to calculate the sum instead of 13 with the previous implementation. Now that doesn't seem to be too big of a difference, but look how blazing fast the optimal implementation is compared to our previous one:</p><p>While the window is building, both algorithms are going at the same pace (try changing the size of k to equal to the size of the array—both algorithms will finish at the same time!). However, once the window is complete, the optimal algorithm blazes off and terminates in less than half the time it takes for the naive algorithm to finish.</p><h2>Generalizing the Pattern</h2><p>Of course we're not limited to only counting averages. The sliding window pattern can be generalized to any problem that involves computing <em>something</em> in the subarray. As long as the problem has some definition of a window size, the pattern essentially boils down to:</p><ol><li>Maintaining some <strong>state</strong> in that window, and</li><li>keeping that state in sync with the items in the window through <strong>constant-time operations</strong>.</li></ol><p>By "constant-time operations" I mean without using further iterations and only using the stuff that leaves/enters the window.</p><p>In the case of the averages problem, the state that we're maintaining is the <strong>sum of the items</strong>. We're keeping this sum in sync with the items in the window by subtracting the item that's leaving and adding the item that's entering.</p><h3>Permutation in a String</h3><p>Here's another problem that makes use of the same concept of maintaining state and synchronizing that state. The problem's pretty simple—given a string and some pattern, determine if the string contains any <em>permutation</em> of that pattern. For example, given the string <code>aaacb</code> and the pattern <code>abc</code>, the algorithm should return <code>true</code> because the substring <code>acb</code> is a permutation of <code>abc</code>.</p><p>This is not as obvious of a sliding window problem than the problem we just worked through, but if you think of a string as an array of characters and a substring as a subarray, then the similarities start to show.</p><p>I'm not going to walk through each logical step to get to the optimal solution (that would take a minute!), but here are the main ideas:</p><ol><li>A string can only be a permutation of another if it's the same length. <em>This gives us the size of the window = <code>pattern.length</code></em>.</li><li>A string is <strong>exactly</strong> a permutation of another if it contains the exact same number of letters. A way to keep track of this is through a map of character -&gt; count pairs. <em>This gives us the state that we have to maintain</em>.</li><li>We need a way to update <em>and compare</em> the map in constant time. <em>Through this we fulfill the second condition of synchronizing state through constant operations</em>.</li></ol><p>With those ideas, here's the final solution:</p><p>If you're interested in more details of the algorithm (particularly the constant-time updates and comparison), open the note below!</p></article></main></div></div>]]>

				<p>Kubernetes has demonstrated the power of a well architected control plane with a great API. The industry is beginning to notice that this control plane can be used to do much more than orchestrate containers, and are increasingly looking to use the Kubernetes control plane to manage all of their infrastructure.</p><p>Several “cloud provider infrastructure” addons exist for Kubernetes. These addons provide a Kubernetes interface to a cloud provider’s infrastructure - databases, queues, etc. The three major clouds each maintain their own - Google Config Connector, Azure Service Operator, and Amazon Controllers for Kubernetes. Each exposes their respective cloud’s control plane APIs as custom resources, allowing Kubernetes users to manage an RDS instance (for example) using the same tools they would use to manage a <code>Deployment</code> or a <code>ConfigMap</code>.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/02/HeaderHero.svg"><figcaption>Crossplane exposes all of the major cloud provider control plane APIs as custom resources.</figcaption></figure><p>Crossplane is often compared to the various cloud provider infrastructure addons. There are certainly similarities - it is also a Kubernetes addon, and it also exposes all of the major cloud provider control plane APIs as custom resources. Crossplane even <a href="https://blog.crossplane.io/accelerating-crossplane-provider-coverage-with-ack-and-azure-code-generation-towards-100-percent-coverage-of-all-cloud-services/">shares code with some of these addons</a>. Where Crossplane differs is in how we expose cloud provider APIs.</p><blockquote>
<p>The Crossplane community believes that the typical developer using Kubernetes to deploy their application shouldn’t have to deal with low level infrastructure APIs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Drawing on our experiences as platform builders, SREs, and application developers we’ve designed Crossplane as a toolkit to build your own custom resources on top of any API - often those of the cloud providers. We think this approach is critical to enable <em>usable</em> self-service infrastructure in Kubernetes.</p><p>In this post we’ll demonstrate that seemingly simple tasks like spinning up a new database in the cloud for your applications to consume can often be more complicated than it would at first seem, and how Crossplane is designed to help tame that complexity.</p><p>Crossplane today consists of three things:</p><ol><li><em>Providers</em> extend Crossplane with custom resources that can be used to declaratively configure a system. The AWS provider for example, adds custom resources for AWS services like RDS and S3. We call these ‘managed resources’. Managed resources match the APIs of the system they represent as closely as possible, but they’re also opinionated. Common functionality like status conditions and references work the same no matter which provider you’re using - all managed resources comply with the Crossplane Resource Model, or XRM.</li><li><em>Composition</em> allows a platform team to define new custom resources that are composed of managed resources. We call these composite resources, or XRs. An XR typically groups together a handful of managed resources into one logical resource, exposing only the settings that the platform team deems useful and deferring the rest to an API-server-side template we call a ‘Composition’.</li><li><em>Packages</em> allow a platform team to quickly package, share, and declaratively install new kinds of composite resources and the providers they build on.</li></ol><blockquote>Despite the name, “provider” doesn’t necessarily mean “cloud provider”. Crossplane has providers that add support for managing databases on a SQL server, managing Helm releases, and <a href="https://blog.crossplane.io/providers-101-ordering-pizza-with-kubernetes-and-crossplane/">ordering pizza</a>.</blockquote><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/02/Crossplanecity.svg"><figcaption>When we founded Crossplane we focused on supporting the most useful resources.</figcaption></figure><p>When we founded the Crossplane project we started at the managed resource layer. We focused on the resources we thought would be the most useful to application developers - things like cloud databases, caches, and storage buckets. We quickly heard from early adopters that being able to spin up these resources alone <em>wasn’t enough</em>. An RDS instance might also need a security group or a subnet group to be reachable. GCP Cloud SQL instances and Azure SQL servers face similar issues. This pattern permeates cloud infrastructure; another example we see often is folks wanting to create an IAM policy for each DynamoDB table they create. </p><p>Let’s dig into the example of an application developer requesting an SQL database for their application to use. An experience you initially hope will look like this:</p><pre><code>apiVersion: database.aws.crossplane.io/v1beta1

<p>You might notice that we create a database and a user in the above example - something the RDS API does not support natively.</p><blockquote>Sometimes spinning up practically functional infrastructure requires multiple providers - even if you only use one cloud. In this case we use the SQL provider to finish what we started with the AWS provider.</blockquote><p>This will be an imposing amount of configuration for some application developers. They want to be able to self service their infrastructure needs, but shouldn’t need to be experts in the features and functionality of cloud provider APIs to do so. This is where Composition comes in - it allows a platform team to offer their application developers an experience much closer to the one they originally envisioned. Using Composition the application developer experience can look like this:</p><pre><code>apiVersion: example.org/v1
kind: ExampleCoDatabase
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  parameters:
    storageGB: 20
    username: example-user
  compositionSelector:
    matchLabels:
      engine: mysql
      class: production
  writeConnectionSecretToRef:
    name: example-database-credentials 
</code></pre>
<p>This is a composite resource - an XR.</p><blockquote>When an application developer creates, updates, or deletes this XR Crossplane can create, update, or delete the more verbose set of managed resources from the previous example.</blockquote><p>Composition allows the infrastructure experts - the platform team - to determine what settings their application developers need, and how to use those settings to produce an RDS instance, security group, database, etc. In this example the application developer can influence the size of the database but not its backup settings, which are enforced by the platform team.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/02/CrossplaneConsole@2x.png"><figcaption>Framing your opinions at the API level fosters automation and eases integration.</figcaption></figure><p>You may wonder why a platform team would use Composition rather than a familiar, existing tool like Helm or Kustomize. While it’s true that there are similarities, we feel that it’s better to frame your organisation's opinions at the API level, rather than via client-side tooling. For example when you use Crossplane to expose the above purpose-built <code>ExampleCoDatabase</code> API:</p><ul><li>Any REST client (from kubectl to curl to Python) can create an <code>ExampleCoDatabase</code> with a single API call. This fosters automation and eases integration with other systems.</li><li>Policy is enforced. RBAC can ensure at the API level that application developers may influence only the fields exposed by an <code>ExampleCoDatabase</code> XR. The platform team can ensure application developers have RBAC access to configure the settings they need, and nothing else.</li><li>RBAC is framed around your desired abstractions. Access is granted “to create an ExampleCo database”, not “to create an RDS instance, a security group, etc etc”.</li></ul><p>One novel design folks notice when they start using Crossplane is that most Crossplane custom resources are cluster scoped - they exist above the scope of any Kubernetes namespace. While this can seem odd at first, it’s another decision that was informed by real world scenarios.</p><p>Take the above <code>ExampleCoDatabase</code> XR. Assume that several teams of application developers, each with their own namespace, want …</p></section></div>

<p>If you understand the underlying concept of recursion but struggle to implement it like myself, or you don't even know what it is, then this post if for you.</p>
<p>Recursion is defined as solving a complex problem by breaking the problem into smaller versions of itself that can be solved. In programming, this is done by having a function call itself.</p>
<p>The underlying principle of recursion are these two cases:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Base Case</strong>: this case defines the smallest instance of a problem. In certain recursive solutions, there can be multiple base cases but for the purpose of this post's explanation, my example will only incorporate one. When coding, the base case prevents an infinite loop of the function calling itself.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Recursive Case</strong>: this case manipulates the problem in order to approach the base case. In programming, this is the case in which the function calls itself.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Put simply, the recursive case will breakdown the problem until it arrives at the base case, after which the the sub solutions build up to solve the original problem.</p>
<p>Do not worry if your understanding of recursion is hazy because the above definitions will make sense when implementing a recursive solution in Python.</p>
<h2 id="the-call-stack">The Call Stack</h2>
<p>In order to truly understand how recursion is implemented in Python, it is necessary to familiarize yourself with the call stack. </p>
<p>The call stack uses the stack data structure to keep track of local variables and previous function calls. The stack is a last-in, first-out data structure. This means that the last item to be placed in the stack will be the first to be removed. To help visualize, think of a stack of plates:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612217672194/K8ZCDamI8.jpeg?auto=compress" alt="brooke-lark-sG-PR0BNwb4-unsplash.jpg"></p>
<p>Whatever plate is placed last on the stack is the first one to be removed.</p>
<p>In terms of programming, the stack has two simple operations: push and pop. Push adds an item onto the stack and pop removes an item from the stack, returning its value.</p>
<p>In python, the call stack consists of frames. The bottom most frame is the global or module frame. This consists of all the global variables. Every time a function is called a new frame is pushed onto the stack containing its local variables and function arguments. When a function call returns, the frame is popped off the stack and its value is passed to where it was called in the previous frame.</p>
<h2 id="a-famous-recursion-example-factorial">A Famous Recursion Example - Factorial</h2>
<p>The factorial of a number is defined as so:</p>
<p>4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24</p>
<p>If we were to define the factorial of a number <code>n</code> as a mathematical equation, it would be:</p>
<p><code>factorial(n) = n * factorial(n-1)</code></p>
<p>The right side of the equation will be the <em>recursive case</em> of our solution. Notice, how the recursive case takes the original problem,<code>factorial(n)</code>, and makes it a simpler problem of multiplying <code>n</code> by whatever <code>factorial(n-1)</code> is.</p>
<p>We can define a function <code>factorial</code> that takes a parameter <code>n</code>. However, if we only defined this function with the above equation, it would call itself infinitely leading to an error.</p>
<p>This is because we did not define a <em>base case</em>. The most basic factorial is the factorial of 1 which equals 1. So we can tell the program that once it reaches the factorial of 1, instead of calling <code>1 * factorial(0)</code>, to just <code>return 1</code>. After which, the Python call stack will handle multiplying out the numbers.</p>
<p>After defining both the recursive and base cases, we arrive at the Python program below:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>factorial</span>(<span>n</span>):</span>
    <span>if</span> n &lt;= <span>1</span>:
        <span>return</span> <span>1</span>
    <span>else</span>:
        <span>return</span> n * factorial(n<span>-1</span>)
</code></pre><h2 id="in-depth-recursive-function-implementation">In Depth Recursive Function Implementation</h2>
<p>Before calling the factorial function, the Python call stack would look like:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612222009642/RKv1SGozi.png?auto=compress" alt="Call Stack - 1 (3).png"></p>
<p>Then, we call the factorial function passing in an argument of 4. </p>
<pre><code><span>factorial</span>(<span>4</span>)
</code></pre><p>A frame for the factorial function would be pushed onto to the call stack, setting the argument <code>n</code> equal to <code>4</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612222128046/cNmno7-YI.png?auto=compress" alt="Call Stack - 2.png"></p>
<p>The Python interpreter will then process the function and since <code>n</code> is not <code>&lt;= 1</code>, it will evaluate <code>n * factorial(n-1)</code>. However before the function can return a value, it must evaluate <code>factorial(n-1)</code>. This will cause another factorial frame to be pushed on the stack, with the argument <code>n</code> set to <code>3</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612222294743/zXgfi23TF.png?auto=compress" alt="Call Stack - 3.png"></p>
<p>Again, since <code>n</code> is not <code>&lt;= 1</code>, the function will evaluate <code>n * factorial(n-1)</code>. Likewise, the function must evaluate <code>factorial(n-1)</code> before returning a value. </p>
<p>This pattern will continue until the factorial frame with the argument n equal to 1 is pushed onto the stack.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612222730246/6jJduzt8q.png?auto=compress" alt="Call Stack - 5 (1).png"></p>
<p>When this occurs, the function reaches the base case, so it instead returns 1. As I mentioned early when explaining the call stack, when a function returns, it pops its frame off the stack, transferring its value to where it was called in the previous frame.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612222867866/Npx8dueYc.png?auto=compress" alt="Call Stack - 6.png"></p>
<p>Now since the value for <code>factorial(n-1)</code> has been evaluated, the factorial function can evaluate the product and return it to the previous frame, pushing the current frame off the stack.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612222963799/kJ7D_a-7I.png?auto=compress" alt="Call Stack - 7.png"></p>
<p>This pattern continues until we reach the original function call...</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612223032269/rxZsqVaa8.png?auto=compress" alt="Call Stack - 8.png"></p>
<p>As you might have guessed, the factorial function with argument 4 returns a value of 24.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>When writing a recursive solution in Python, think of the problem in terms of a base case and recursive case. Ask yourself: "How can I define a recursive case that will help me reduce the problem towards a base case?"</p>
<p>When trying to understand a recursive solution, I find it best to visualize the call stack in my head.  Every time a function is called an item is added onto the stack and any time you encounter the return keyword, it pops an item off the stack and returns its value to the previous function call.</p>

Browsing through companies that have recently IPO’d or raised $100M+ rounds — where one would expect a company to be able to hire junior developers — all I can find are jobs that require at least three or more years of experience or are explicitly only hiring “Senior” or “Developer II” or higher.</p><p>I have been working with bootcamp graduates and community-college graduates for years. But from my vantage point, when growth companies hire people with no development job experience, they are usually hiring top-tier, four-year college graduates. (There are some exceptions! Twitter’s <a href="https://careers.twitter.com/en/university.html">internship program</a> is admirable, although I don’t know in practice how restrictive the admissions end up being).<a href="https://twitter.com/shaft/status/1355696154990628864"></a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/608682016205344768"></a>One can understand wanting to make sure that the first few hires into any department have enough experience to build and maintain high quality software, except that</p><p>a) that often doesn’t prevent terrible technical debt, and</p><p>b) no one ever changes the expectations over time.</p><p>And so the culture just becomes, “we only hire people with experience.” I am a huge fan of <a href="https://www.segment.com/">Segment</a> (and a happy customer for more than five years), but despite their senior-developer-packed engineering roster, they seem to have to rebuild their <a href="https://segment.com/blog/goodbye-microservices/">entire architecture</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/how-segment-redesigned-its-core-systems-to-solve-an-existential-scaling-crisis/">every</a> <a href="https://segment.com/blog/rebuilding-our-infrastructure/">few</a> years. Every company starts by hiring seniors; most seem to keep hiring seniors, and many have to keep throwing away code constantly.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/BsxIM1LBghJkWOwT56C-wwa7lGYJbB9sJPYjYd-A2Dq7zKkJVO98_I3qSOZazzGzxkJkx_gqA4KBK1lm0st213MAaiRfakQxgcACtziqc7hsW5z3wfbtzmbN87DR9bB4NtACKSi2" alt=""></figure><p>Everyone agrees that talent is scarce, and that hires often fail — and that failure is expensive. Why don’t companies ever take a conscious look at how to build talent instead of buying it?</p><p>Put another way, it’s ironic that an industry that tends to want to build everything instead of buying it chooses to buy the absolute most expensive thing on the market: talent.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="h-the-problems-with-senior-developers">The Problems with Senior Developers</h2><p><strong>It is a fallacy that only hiring senior developers will lead to better results than hiring many junior developers</strong>. There are bad things about senior developers that no one should want in their organization, and without juniors to counterbalance, you’ll be overindexed to these downsides.</p><h4 id="h-senior-skills-can-stagnate">Senior skills can stagnate</h4><p>The most common error I see senior developers make comes, ironically, from their prior successes, combined with the pace of technology.</p><p>Most developers at the beginning of their careers are good at knowing and using most of the best practices at that time. But there is no continuing education in software development, and compensation is tied to shipping, not learning. So once a developer is five or more years into their career, there’s a really good chance they’re still relying upon tools, libraries, and practices that are no longer the best way to build, deploy, and run software.</p><p>Case in point: Instagram, all on the public cloud, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2127343/Facebook-buys-Instagram-13-employees-share-100m-CEO-Kevin-Systrom-set-make-400m.html">sells to Facebook</a> for $1B with 13 employees in 2012; Bank of America <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2019-11-06-IBM-Developing-Worlds-First-Financial-Services-Ready-Public-Cloud-Bank-of-America-Joins-as-First-Collaborator">makes its first announcement</a> to do anything with the public cloud in November of 2019. Kevin Systrom <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-founder-kevin-systrom-has-no-formal-programming-training-2012-4">had only just learned to program</a> when he started Instagram; Bank of America’s technology organization is run by people who are decades from being practitioners. (Lest anyone try to argue Bank of America’s slowness is due to regulatory issues, <a href="https://get.acloudguru.com/capital-one-case-study">consider Capital One</a>).</p><h4 id="h-senior-developers-can-be-a-solution-in-search-of-a-problem">Senior developers can be a solution in search of a problem</h4><p>Another problem with senior-developer-only organizations is that <strong>most organizations don’t have constant flows of work that require lots of experience</strong>. A tremendous amount of software development is updating interfaces to add functionality or improve usability, not building back ends from scratch that have to scale to hundreds of millions of daily users.</p><p>And as we have better and more powerful <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/serverless-sea-change/">cloud services</a> to build on (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure, Netlify, Twilio, Stripe), more developer focus turns to interfaces. Having an organization filled with senior developers who aren’t mentoring junior developers is asking to find senior-developer problems to solve, even if they’re best solved by an existing service.</p><h2 id="h-finding-undervalued-people">Finding Undervalued People</h2><p>Many developers are systemically undervalued because they do not fit central casting for appearance or mentality. Others are undervalued because organizations typically aren’t willing to hire software developers who need some training to do the job effectively.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, whatever cargo-cult exercise an individual had to learn to become an interviewer (e.g., inverting binary trees on a whiteboard) tends to be viewed like a fraternity hazing ritual: “I had to go through it, so I’ll make everyone else after me go through it.”</p><p>There are excellent software developers who hate hackathons and would rather spend time raising their children on weekends than on coding side projects. There are people who are neuroatypical who can’t deal well with your unrealistic, on-the-spot brain teasers. There are people who need some additional training and mentorship to be able to ship software effectively for most organizations. These people are all undervalued by the standard hiring practices in tech, which means that, with some effort on your part, they’ll give the highest return on investment of any hires you can make.</p><h2 id="h-when-you-invest-in-people-people-invest-in-you">When you invest in people, people invest in you</h2><p>Over the past twenty years, I have seen a real difference between hiring software developers with the view of, “You’re a superstar and we need you to come in and kick ass” versus, “We will bring you in, teach you how we think and build, and then you’ll help us achieve our mission.”</p><p>The former attitude can lead to developers thinking they are better than other departments and other people in the organization, because no one else can do what they do. (After all, they are superstars!) The latter is fundamentally aligning to a mission and a team and a culture.</p><p>Remember, all software developers pick up bad habits. They usually don’t know all the latest best practices. They generally haven’t been given work time and space to experiment with new technologies. They won’t know all of your code or your stack or how your teams’ specific approaches to software development. These generalizations hold true for all developers, junior to senior.</p><p>You can choose to not invest any effort into training and aligning senior developers and still see things ship, but that doesn’t mean that you’re growing cohesive teams that are making the right decisions for your organization. You should invest in bringing everyone up to speed and together. When you do that, you realize that <strong>bringing junior developers onboard is not necessarily a greater effort than bringing senior developers onboard</strong>, especially if your criteria for success is successful, happy teams that are making the best decisions.</p><h2 id="h-how-to-build-undervalued-talent">How to build undervalued talent</h2><p>If you hire undervalued people and you train them to be successful for your organization, you will end up with teams that are more aligned and more loyal to your mission. The right way to do this is to onboard people in stages that end up with developers working on your codebase, as opposed to hiring everyone with the expectation that they’re working high-priority tickets on day one.</p><p>For example, at Branch, we have a multi-stage process where entry-level developers are initially granted a stipend to fund living expenses while taking online courses, working through sample exercises, and attending office hours for any questions. The end of the first stage is completing the Branch take-home developer hiring exercise that we have used to hire all developers.</p><p>The second stage is a paid internship that has the goal of learning how to work as part of the development team, but having the space to go slowly and ask lots of questions, and the expectation that there may be many PR revisions. We identify tickets in our backlog as “intern” work, so that there isn’t high pressure to complete anything in a short period of time.</p><p>This entire process does take time from the existing development staff, but it can be contained (mostly) into onboarding, office hours, code reviews, and weekly 1-on-1s. And it allows you to make hiring decisions that exclude bad cultural fits because you will find enough talent by investing in your workforce. You’ll create a massive competitive advantage over your competitors who are still stuck in their fraternity-hazing ruts.</p><h2 id="h-the-roi-of-building-talent">The ROI of building talent</h2><figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>There is a delicious irony that so many venture-backed companies seek only to hire out of expensive four-year universities or people with experience working at other VC-backed startups, yet want their teams to be dedicated to the company's mission.</p><p>1/</p></div>— Joe Emison (@JoeEmison) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeEmison/status/1343222725226209280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 27, 2020</a></blockquote> </div></figure><p>Many venture-backed companies seek people dedicated to their missions, but then shoot themselves in the foot by only looking to hire people from “elite” schools or out of “name-brand” venture-backed companies. Those hiring pools are filled with people who are ready and able to job-hop to further themselves, and are often very weakly committed to company missions. In contrast, if a company invests in undervalued people who need some mentorship, training, and experience to reach their full potential, those people are much more likely to commit to the company and the mission with their full selves.</p><p><em>Joe Emison is the CTO of Branch Insurance, which provides home and auto insurance.
