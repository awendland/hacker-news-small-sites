<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>To explain the idea of ‘product discovery’, we can learn a lot from the story of Quibi. <br><a href="https://quibi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quibi</a>, a new streaming service designed for mobile phones, launched on April 6th, 2020. In a crowded market full of big-name competitors like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney Plus, Quibi differentiated its product by offering high-quality, professionally made TV shows tailored for on-the-go viewing. Each piece of content was 10 minutes or less and optimized for both vertical and horizontal full-screen dimensions.</p><p>Because its co-founders were already so successful in both Hollywood and business, Quibi raised almost $2billion prior to launch. They commissioned top talent to create exclusive content. The app itself was well-designed and easy to use. Switching from vertical to horizontal full-screen worked seamlessly, and felt like a genuinely unique feature.</p><p>But on October 22nd, 2020, Quibi shut down with hardly any users—just six months after launching. An article by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528404/quibi-shut-down-cost-subscribers-content-tv-movies-katzenberg-whitman-tiktok-netflix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Verge</a> lists some reasons behind this, from the global pandemic to simply bad content. Above all, the author picks out one factor as decisive: “a lack of insight into consumer behavior, wants, and needs.”</p><p>“Quibi didn’t work because no one at Quibi knew what it should be, what people wanted, or how people use their phones. Its entire thesis is wrong.”</p><p>In other words, Quibi didn’t fail because of flaws in the final product or bad user experience—it failed as an <em>idea</em> for a product. The way to avoid this? Product discovery.</p></div><p id="what"><h2>What is product discovery?</h2></p><div><p>Product discovery is the process of closely understanding what your users’ problems and needs are, then validating your ideas for solutions before starting development. By forming a close relationship with your users and letting them guide your design thinking, your overall product strategy is much more likely to end up solving real-user problems.</p><p>The idea of product discovery was originally developed in the 90s, when many of today’s product management best practices were formed. Back then, companies building websites and digital products spent a lot of time and money trying to convince customers that they needed their great products—but not so much time actually listening to them.</p><p>This led to a lot of very expensive failures, as products often made it to full release before their creators realized that people just didn’t need them. Over time, the development of customer-centric ideas—like the <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jobs to be done</a> framework, and early iterative testing based on user feedback—encouraged product teams to put themselves in their users’ shoes more, and to ask what they thought more often.</p><p>These days, we refer to this broad template of activities and approaches as ‘product discovery.’</p></div><p id="framework"><h2>A step-by-step product discovery framework</h2></p><div><p>There’s no singular, defined set of methods that you have to follow with product discovery—you could include customer feedback surveys, interviews, focus groups, journey mapping, insights from product analytics, and various types of <a href="https://maze.design/guides/usability-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">usability testing</a> in your approach.</p><p>But whatever modern <a href="https://maze.co/guides/product-discovery/techniques/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">product discovery techniques</a> you end up using—more on that in chapter 4—the goals are always the same:</p><ul><li>Form a deep, upfront understanding of what your users need</li><li>Define and validate a solution based on your users’ input</li></ul><p>For this reason, it’s vital to approach product discovery with a mindset that’s open to all possibilities. You might start the process with a really cool idea for a product in the back of your mind, only to find out that your users don’t need a new product after all. Maybe a few specific improvements to your current product are enough. This kind of realization is all part of the ‘discovery’—it’s what makes product discovery both useful and interesting.</p><p>And while the exact methodology is up to you, to achieve your product discovery goals you should combine this open mindset with this basic, step-by-step product discovery framework:</p><h3>1. Learn &amp; understand</h3><p>Before you start thinking about what's next on your product roadmap or even decide which problem you want to solve, spend a decent amount of time communicating with users. Run customer interviews, organize user stories into themes, create journey maps, and form a close relationship with a group of users.</p><p>The information you learn here will help you hone in on pain points to build solutions for. You could spend weeks or months in this stage—however long it takes to start spotting clear themes in your users’ feedback.</p><h3>2. Define &amp; decide</h3><p>Once you’ve got a healthy amount of data and feedback, your team should take a step back and prioritize the most important problems for your users.</p><p>With problems prioritized, you should be able to form a clear, broad hypothesis that can form the foundation of the solutions you develop. This should be a short, simple sentence—often a question—that covers the main problem and related sub-problems you want to solve for your users. Here’s an example:</p><p><em>“Building a commenting feature will increase the amount of time users spend in our product.”</em></p><p>This sounds straightforward, but it will probably take you a few attempts. Take your time—it’s super important to get this part right, as your hypothesis will determine what you build.</p><h3>3. Ideate &amp; prioritize</h3><p>Next, it’s time to get creative and start thinking about what a new product idea might look like. Encourage your team to brainstorm without limits at first, then gradually narrow down to the best ideas. You could even do an ideation hackathon to get the whole team focused on the problem.</p><p>Once you have a few solid options, plan out how each solution could work in practice by assigning scores for predicted value and feasibility to build. There are many ways of prioritizing your options—<a href="https://www.productboard.com/glossary/product-prioritization-frameworks/">some very detailed</a>. The simplest way is the ICE framework: score each solution out of 10 for the Impact (I) it’ll have, your Confidence (C) that it’ll solve the problem, and the Ease (E) of building it, then compare the average scores to get a prioritized list.</p><h3>4. Prototype &amp; test</h3><p>The final stage of product discovery is where you can start prototyping new products or features. But don’t get too carried away—the idea is just to create some quick prototypes for user testing. You could make a working MVP (Minimum Viable Product), a mockup using a design tool, or even a paper prototype.</p><p>With your prototype done, now’s the time to reach out to users again. Run some <a href="https://maze.design/blog/prototype-testing/">prototype tests</a> and collect user feedback to find out if you're building the right product. If your users’ responses validate your hypothesis and early iteration, you’re ready to start development. If not, keep tweaking your prototypes until you’re confident that the solution you’re proposing is really what your users are looking for.</p></div><p id="benefits"><h2>The benefits of product discovery</h2></p><div><p>Like many best practices of modern product development, a lot of the product discovery process seems like common sense. But as the fall of Quibi shows, the benefits of investing time into product discovery are still often overlooked to this day. So let’s take a look at some of the main ones:</p><h4>You’ll save time &amp; money</h4><p>Product teams spending weeks or months doing a lot of thinking and not very much building might seem counterintuitive to the fast startup culture they exist in. The demands of key stakeholders to drive metrics and business goals by shipping new products is a constant pressure for most product teams.&nbsp;</p><p>But cutting corners with <a href="https://maze.design/guides/ux-research">user research</a> to press on with development is a massive—and very expensive—risk. You’re essentially gambling on assumptions about what your users want, which could turn out to be false no matter how experienced you are. Product discovery gives you validation on whether your product needs to exist before spending a lot of money building, polishing, and marketing it. It makes you more agile, not less.</p><p>Sebastien Phlix, Product Manager at N26, sums it up:</p></div><div><div><p color="blue500" font-size="4" font-weight="600" font-family="Public Sans, sans-serif">“Think about how much one two-week sprint costs. 10k? 20K? Product discovery is important because engineering and design time is the most precious asset a company has.”</p><div><div><p><img src="https://images.prismic.io/maze-marketing/69724ec4-2cf8-4519-b505-e0b39715ffc9_Seb.jpg?auto=compress,format&amp;rect=52,0,481,481&amp;w=400&amp;h=400"></p></div></div></div></div><div><h4>Your products will be more innovative</h4><p>By incorporating customer viewpoints from the beginning, product discovery inspires your team to challenge their own assumptions and think outside of the box when making product decisions. This doesn’t just lead to more innovative solutions—it also validates which of your ideas are market opportunities.</p><p>Freddie Beesely, VP of Product at Attest, sees innovation as the true value of product discovery:</p></div><div><div><p color="blue500" font-size="4" font-weight="600" font-family="Public Sans, sans-serif">“Product discovery helps you expand within your market, move into new ones, stay ahead of competition, and adapt to changing trends. Without discovery, products tend to stagnate by getting stuck focusing on the short-term.”</p><div><div><p><img src="https://images.prismic.io/maze-marketing/0d66aefd-6515-4623-ad64-2042b227b9f4_freddie.jpg?auto=compress,format&amp;rect=0,0,200,200&amp;w=400&amp;h=400"></p><p color="#000000" font-size="1" font-family="Public Sans, sans-serif" font-weight="500"><span font-size="16" font-weight="400" color="#000000" font-family="Public Sans, sans-serif">Freddie Beesely<!-- -->,</span><span font-size="16" font-weight="400" color="#000000" font-family="Public Sans, sans-serif"> <!-- -->VP of Product at Attest</span></p></div></div></div></div><div><h4>Your product designers and development team will thank you</h4><p>Product discovery gives you a good idea of whether your new product or feature will be used. And for product designers and developers, seeing their creations help thousands or even millions of people is one of the best parts of the job. Without product discovery, your team members won’t get the feedback they crave.&nbsp;</p><p>Fadeelah Al-horaibi, Senior Product Manager at Slite, knows the feeling:</p></div><div><div><p color="blue500" font-size="4" font-weight="600" font-family="Public Sans, sans-serif">“I've unfortunately been in an environment where product discovery was skipped. No-one was talking about the customer or business opportunities—just product delivery. The scariest part is that once the delivery took place, we were straight on to the next.” </p><div><div><p><img src="https://images.prismic.io/maze-marketing/e6442d46-7134-485f-a972-73dce9fd6a8c_fadeelah.jpg?auto=compress,format&amp;rect=0,333,1333,1333&amp;w=400&amp;h=400"></p><p color="#000000" font-size="1" font-family="Public Sans, sans-serif" font-weight="500"><span font-size="16" font-weight="400" color="#000000" font-family="Public Sans, sans-serif">Fadeelah Al-horaibi<!-- -->,</span><span font-size="16" font-weight="400" color="#000000" font-family="Public Sans, sans-serif"> <!-- -->Senior Product Manager at Slite</span></p></div></div></div></div><div><p>Pivoting late in the development process—or worse, releasing a feature that no one uses—just doesn’t feel good. In many ways, the product development process is all about failing and learning. But without staying close to your customers, it’s hard to even know whether your team succeeded or not.</p><h2>Final notes</h2><p>Before Quibi, co-founder Jeff Katzenberg was CEO of Dreamworks Animation.

<p>Published on <span id="pubdate">2021-01-24</span>.</p>
<p>For many years I have been advocating passionately against the so-called "modern web" as it is really nothing more than a poor excuse for not using your brain and instead following the hype and trends of stuffing web applications with unneeded JavaScript and slow and crappy frameworks. But now the time has come when soon the "modern web" will finally die.</p>

<p>Most people don't like to feel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8BkzvP19v4">outside</a>, which is why the majority is always just following hype and trends. This is also why it is so easy for politicians and news media to fill people with lies.</p>

<p>If something is presented as "the right thing to do", most people want to do it. But what happens when the so-called right thing really doesn't make any sense, or the so-called right thing has obvious flaws? Truly independent thinking and responsible people gather information objectively and try to reach a conclusion without any consideration to social conformity, but most people are not truly independent thinking even though they like to believe they are.</p>

<p>Do you know how you can tell if you are really lying to yourself about why you do what you do? One crystal clear sign is if you are blindly following what the majority is doing without truly understanding the consequences of your actions. Another very clear sign is if you passionately and emotionally criticize the opposite opinion without any true personal experience or knowledge and then call what you do as being "modern", as if what you do is the right thing whereas what others are doing is hopelessly outdated.</p>

<p>The fact about the so-called modern web is that there has really never been any modern web. The hardware has become much faster, but that has nothing to do with the modern web. No, the truth is that the so-called modern web was invented as a term by people who like to feel important and smart. They did so by developing software and frameworks and then telling everyone else to stop "re-inventing the wheel" and instead use their clever solutions. And rather than evaluating the claims of these people objectively, the masses where swayed by all their impressive rhetoric's and their popularity.</p>

<p>The result has been absolutely mind bugling and ridicules because even though the real advance in technology has made the hardware many many times faster, both in processing power and data transfer speeds, the Internet has become absolutely stupidly slow. The main reason for that is all the webpages that gets stuffed with useless JavaScript and frameworks.</p>

<p>I have said it <a href="https://www.unixsheikh.com/articles/stop-pushing-javascript.html">before</a>, and I'll say it again: <strong>If you're pushing JavaScript as a dependency for your website to function, you'd better be serving some pretty amazing and special content, otherwise your website is just plain broken!</strong></p>

<p>Today data centers around the world are using more electricity than ever. It takes more than 50 power plants, each capable of generating 500 megawatts of electricity, to power all the data centers in operation in the U.S. alone. And this number will increase dramatically over the years if the current development model doesn't improve drastically.</p>

<p>My prediction is that in only a couple of years from now, it will be socially and environmentally unacceptable for any kind of company to have a high carbon footprint! And this doesn't mean that a company can simple go all green and start using windmills e.g. The reason for that is that even the production of windmills leaves a pretty high carbon footprint. No, what companies need to do is to reduce power consumption as much as possible. And when it comes to the software industry, then there is only one sure way forward, and that is to improve application performance as much as possible. This is especially important with gaming, web applications and other Internet related services such as gaming server applications. Video providers such as YouTube will eventually have to disallow content that doesn't generate any revenue for them because storage servers requires huge amounts of power.</p>

<p>I believe that in the near future companies will actually begin to compete with each other about who has the most performant applications, web or otherwise.</p>

<p>Just like responsible and grown up people don't throw trash on the street, responsible and grown up people also take care when they develop software. This is actually nothing new at all, it has just been ignored by the staggering careless approach of just "throwing more hardware at the problem because hardware is cheap". The fact is that hardware has never been cheap! Hardware production has always had a huge negative impact on the environment, not only in the form of carbon footprint during production, but also pollution and the thoughtless behavior of simply <a href="https://envibrary.com/electronic-pollution/">throwing away fully working machines</a>.</p>

<p>In 2018 electronic waste in America represented about 2% of the trash in landfills, but it equaled 70% of overall toxic waste.</p>

<p>In the near future public attention will drive government policy and carbon footprints will become a subject of worldwide scrutiny. Individuals, companies and countries will have to seek the fastest and most affordable ways to achieve a net-zero carbon footprint.</p>

<p>This will also mean that careless use of technology in web development, such as JavaScript and frameworks, needs to be a thing of the past and our current way of developing web applications will in the future look like the "dark ages".</p>

<p>For years I have worked as an independent contractor with a main focus on improving performance and security in web applications. My work has not been about throwing more hardware at the problems, but rather to remove hardware! This has been achieved in one very simple way each and every time: Remove all unnecessary JavaScript and re-build the application using a fast programming language without a framework and without stupid and slow design patterns. Absolutely no hype or trends allowed here!</p>

<p>I have argued for years against the irresponsible behavior of software developers who could care less about the future of a company by careless design choices, but for some strange reason many people believe that if you don't use a framework, then you have to reinvent the wheel each time you build something. But nobody does that! What you do instead is that you study and understand the technology you're using and then you put together small pieces of performant and reusable code and use that.</p>

<p>Other people argue against building web applications from the ground up because if you work in a team, then you need to read other peoples code, and without a framework, then nobody knows how to structure the code or understand what other people are doing. Well, guess what, that's what software development is about! Reading and understanding other peoples code, writing really good and quality documentation, commenting your code and following a clear and concise code style guide. If you cannot do that, then you shouldn't be a software developer. This is what we used to call "good programming".</p>

<p>It's time to take responsibility. Be a part of the solution, not the problem!</p>

January 28, 2021 | https://acoup.blog/2021/01/29/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-i-soldiers-warriors-and/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://acoup.blog/2021/01/29/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-i-soldiers-warriors-and/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>This is the first part of a three part (II, III) discussion of an idea I am going to term (<a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/2021/01/warrior-episode-forty-one/">borrowing from one of its proponents</a>) the ‘universal warrior’ – the idea that there is a transcendent sameness about either the warrior experience or warrior values which provides some sort of useful blueprint for today or a fundamental truth about viewing the past (it is generally presented as both).</p>



<p>Of course the ‘universal warrior’ is not meant literally; no one, <a href="https://theimaginativeconservative.org/2016/05/through-a-glass-darkly-george-s-patton.html">save George S. Patton</a>, is claiming that a single warrior was reincarnated through a host of battles, always the same in each case.  <strong>Rather, the claim that there is a ‘universal warrior’ is really a claim that there is a universal <em>war experience</em></strong>, which all combatants in all wars take part of and which remains largely unchanged or that there is fundamentally a <strong>universal set of warrior values, behaviors or attributes</strong> which define combatant through the ages and through different kinds of armies, different kinds of service</p>



<p>And that notion is a popular one, appearing equally at home in <a href="https://youtu.be/A50lVLtSQik">anti-war songs</a> and <a href="https://angrystaffofficer.com/2016/12/14/stop-calling-us-warriors/">military recruitment propaganda </a>(along with<a href="https://youtu.be/62tnJtLBQzQ"> lava monsters</a>).  Most recently, my attention was drawn to it by a series of what are effectively <a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/category/the-warrior-archetype/">self-help videos</a> framed around the idea by best-selling author Steven Pressfield and I am going to use those videos as the clear form of the argument I want to engage.  In part, this is because Pressfield makes the argument in almost all of its fullness, making many of the implications (‘warrior societies,’ the life advice, the transcendent connection between ‘warriors’ past and present, the implication that ‘warrior’ life is more morally pure and so on) explicit and clear.  And also because Pressfield’s books – <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7rdgm4/how_accurate_is_the_depiction_of_spartan_hoplite/">his <em>fiction</em> I should note, for his historical fiction works have at best a tenuous relationship with the historical record</a> – are, among other things, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gates_of_Fire">on officer training reading lists</a></em> making it a rather important thing if he is peddling an utterly bunk notion of the past.</p>



<p>And it is not hard to see why the idea of a universal warrior value set or a universal warrior experience is an attractive notion; it offers a transcendent connection, linking the experience of combat – whether that is understood positively, as Pressfield does, or negatively as the famous song does – across generations, centuries and cultures.  And it offers the promise of turning that feeling of transcendent connection into a sense of heroism in everyday life, a blueprint for self-improvement, or a timeless model for political consciousness.</p>



<p>And it <em>feels</em> true.  After all, we call people who fought in wars even at the beginnings of written history ‘soldiers’ and ‘warriors and we call our own war-fighters ‘soldiers’ and (unfortunately) ‘warriors.’  That suggestion of equivalence is built right into our linguistic systems.  Students often marvel at the ludicrous tendency for historical artists to represent conflicts in their own deep past (like medieval manuscript illustrators depicting conflicts from classical antiquity) using present (to them) day arms, armor and tactics.  But those same students will often almost immediately fall into the mistake of assuming that combatants of the past shared the same <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/04/16/collections-a-trip-through-bertran-de-born-martial-values-in-the-12th-century-occitan-nobility/">attitudes </a>and <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/04/10/collections-antarah-ibn-shaddad-victory-songs/">motivations </a>about war as they do.</p>



<p><strong>Of course a lot of things <em>feel</em> true which aren’t</strong>.  Standing on the ground, the Earth <em>feels</em> flat, it <em>seems</em> the Sun moves across the sky; of course in reality, the Earth is a ball and in a real sense the sky moves across the Sun.  Many things are <em>intuitive</em>, they <em>feel</em> true, without <em>being</em> true.  <strong>So is there a universal combat experience?</strong></p>



<p>To probe that question, we are going to examine it in two ways. <strong> This week, we’re going to look at the <em>kinds</em> of people in war, what the distinctions are between them and if their experience really can be universally applied</strong>.  Then next week, we’re going to look at this question culturally and chronologically, asking if the experience of the same kinds of people in war was really the same in <em>different wars</em>, drawing heavily on the social-military-history lens which concerns itself with the experience of battle (often called the <em>Face of Battle</em>-school after J. Keegan’s <em>The Face of Battle </em>(1976)).  Then the week after that we’ll take a look at the implications (particularly for how manliness and masculinity are understood) that this historical theory and its failures have on the broader cultural constructs built around it.</p>



<p>Because – spoiler alert –<strong> there is no universal warrior </strong>(in case some of you were concerned that I was going to spend two weeks carefully explaining different categories only to conclude that they were meaningless!) and <strong>there is no universal combat experience</strong>.</p>

<p>Alright?  Let’s soldier on!</p>



<h2>Soldiers and Warriors</h2>



<p>We want to start with asking what the distinction is between <em>soldiers</em> and <em>warriors</em>. <a href="https://angrystaffofficer.com/2016/12/14/stop-calling-us-warriors/"> It is a tricky question </a>and even the <a href="https://youtu.be/7TprgnuYfyQ">U.S. Army sometimes gets it badly wrong</a> (Pressfield, I should note, draws a distinction which isn’t <em>entirely</em> wrong but is so wrapped up with <a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/2020/09/warrior-episode-seven/">his dodgy effort to use discredited psychology</a> that I think it is best to start from scratch).  We have a sense that while both of these words mean ‘combatant,’ that they are not quite equivalent.</p>



<p>I suspect many of my readers (specifically the native English speakers) will immediately agree, for instance, that this fellow is a warrior, but not a soldier:</p>

<p><strong>But <em>why</em>?</strong>  The etymologies of the words can actually help push us a bit in the right direction.  Warrior has a fairly obvious etymology, being related to war (itself a derivative of French <em>guerre</em>); as <em>guerre </em>becomes war, so Old French <em>guerreieor</em> became Middle English <em>werreior</em> and because that is obnoxious to say, modern English ‘warrior’ (which is why it is warrior and not ‘warrer’ as we might expect if it was regularly constructed).  By contrast, soldier comes – it has a tortured journey which I am simplifying – from the <em>sold/sould</em> French root meaning ‘pay’ which in turn comes from Latin <em>solidus</em>, a standard Late Roman coin.  So there is clearly something about pay, or the lack of pay involved in this distinction, but clearly it isn’t <em>just</em> pay or the word mercenary would suit just as well.</p>



<p>So here is the difference: <strong>a warrior is an individual who wars, because it is their foundational vocation</strong>, an irremovable part of their identity and social position, pursued for those private ends (status, wealth, place in society).  <strong>So the core of what it is to be a warrior is that it is an element of personal identity and also fundamentally individualistic</strong> (in <em>motivation</em>, to be clear, not in fighting style – many warriors fought with collective tactics, although I think it fair to say that operation in units is much more central to soldiering than the role of a warrior, who may well fight alone).  A warrior remains a warrior when the war ends.  A warrior remains a warrior if fighting alone or for themselves.</p>



<p>By contrast, a soldier is an individual who <em>soldiers</em> (notably a different verb, which includes a sense of drudgery in war-related jobs that aren’t warring <em>per se</em>) as a <em>job</em> which they may one day leave behind, under the authority of and pursued for a larger community which directs their actions, typically through a system of regular discipline.  <strong>So the core of what it is to be a soldier is that it is a not-necessarily-permanent employment and fundamentally build about being both in and in service to a group.  </strong>A soldier, when the war or their term of service ends, becomes a civilian (something a warrior generally does not do!).  A soldier without a community stops being a soldier and starts being a mercenary.</p>



<p>Incidentally, this distinction is not unique to English.  Speaking of the two languages I have the most experience in, both Greek and Latin have this distinction.  Greek has <em>machetes </em>(<em>μαχητής</em>, lit: ‘battler,’ a <em>mache</em> being a battle) and <em>polemistes</em> (πολεμιστής, lit: ‘warrior,’ a <em>polemos</em> being a war); both are more common in poetry than prose, often used to describe mythical heroes.  Interestingly the word for an individual that fights <em>out of battle order</em> (when there is a battle order) is a <em>promachos</em> (πρόμαχος, lit: ‘fore-fighter’), a frequent word in Homer.  But the standard Greek soldier wasn’t generally called any of these things, he was either a <em>hoplite</em> (ὁπλίτης, ‘full-equipped man,’ named after his equipment) or more generally a <em>stratiotes</em> (στρατιώτης, lit, ‘army-man’ but properly ‘soldier’).  That general word, <em>stratiotes</em> is striking, but its root is <em>stratos</em> (στρατός, ‘army’); a <em>stratiotes</em>, a soldier, for the ancient Greeks was defined by his membership in that larger unit, the army.  One could be a <em>machetes</em> or a <em>polemistes</em> alone, but only a <em>stratiotes</em> in an army (<em>stratos</em>), commanded, presumably, by a general (<em>strategos</em>) in service to a community.</p>



<p>Latin has the same division, with similar shades of meaning.  Latin has <em>bellator</em> (‘warrior’) from <em>bellum</em> (‘war’), but Roman soldiers are not generally <em>bellatores</em> (except in a poetic sense and even then only rarely), even when they are actively waging war.  Instead, the soldiers of Rome are <em>milites</em> (sing. <em>miles</em>).  The word is related to the Latin <em>mille</em> (‘thousand’) from the root ‘mil-‘ which indicates a collection or combination of things.  <em>Milites</em> are thus – like <em>stratiotes</em>, <strong>men put together</strong>, defined by their collective action for the community (strikingly, groups acting for individual aims in Latin are not <em>milites</em> but <em>latrones</em>, bandits – a word Roman authors also …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today I want to talk about an idea that I don’t think has much purchase in real-world politics but seems to loom large both on the internet and in academic circles — the idea that new real estate development activity actually <em>causes gentrification</em> through some kind of induced demand phenomenon. </p><p>Nathan Robinson in his <a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2021/01/the-only-thing-worse-than-a-nimby-is-a-yimby">anti-YIMBY screed</a> explores a scenario in which replacing smaller buildings with larger ones increases housing scarcity even while adding units because “we're luring rich people from elsewhere to our city.” He’s doing a thought-experiment, but clearly one he thinks is plausible, while <a href="https://shelterforce.org/2018/11/05/heres-what-we-actually-know-about-market-rate-housing-development-and-displacement/">Amee Chew</a> in a 2018 Shelterforce article states that “numerous studies show that market-rate housing development has price ripple effects on surrounding neighborhoods, driving up rents and increasing the burden on lower-income households.”</p><p>Chew’s studies don’t really say that (more on this later) but the studies do say what I also know from personal experience which is that people living through a gentrification process often <em>say</em> this is what’s going on. This is all exacerbated by the fact that many people, as in this recent Washington Post article about Mt Pleasant, <em>define</em> gentrification as the presence of new-built condos with chain store retail on the ground floor. And it is definitely true that if what you mean by “gentrification” is “new buildings and chain stores” then blocking new buildings and chain stores will block gentrification.</p><p>But the argument here is supposed to be about prices, displacement, and ultimately people’s living standards. </p><p>And the induced demand objection fails on four scores:</p><ul><li><p>It is empirically false, at least most of the time. </p></li><li><p>Accepting its logic would counsel against <em>all</em> efforts to improve quality of life.</p></li><li><p>If it were true, it still wouldn’t follow that new construction is bad.</p></li><li><p>It misconstrues what the YIMBY proposal is in the first place.</p></li></ul><p>As I say, I don’t really believe that people believing in the induced demand argument explains any of the proximate barriers to housing reform. But it does come up a lot online, so I’d like to have a resource for explaining to people what’s wrong with it.</p><h4>The induced demand intuition</h4><p>The WMATA Green Line was extended to Columbia Heights in 1999, which meant that by 2003 a young person such as myself looking for a cheap place to live in a walkable neighborhood with good access to mass transit might pick it blindly off Google Maps and Craigslist as a good place to rent a basement apartment. </p><p>It was actually a fairly dismal neighborhood at the time, largely because the immediate vicinity of the metro station was a bunch of unsightly vacant lots and construction sites. But if you went to the no-longer-extant Columbia Heights Coffee Shop, all the talk among the gentrifiers was “there’s going to be a Target soon.” And, indeed, a few years later the construction sites were transformed into apartment buildings and retail, so if you go today, the immediate environs of the Metro station feature a Giant, a Target, a Best Buy, a Wawa, a Starbucks, and a bunch of other national chains along with some locally owned businesses. Then the slightly less proximate commercial areas either north on 14th Street or over on 11th Street are thriving ecologies of local businesses.     </p><p>There is clearly some kind of flywheel effect whereby the new retail amenities make the neighborhood a better place to live, which attracts more (and more affluent) residents, which in turn makes it a more attractive place to locate your business. </p><p>Now I think it’s obvious that the start of the Columbia Heights flywheel was the opening of the Green Line, especially given the largest context of falling urban crime during this period. The reason you could find white people in a coffee shop talking about how they were looking forward to the Target opening is that the gentrification cycle was already underway. Neighborhoods normally experience an initial hipster phase of gentrification (typified by dive bars, yoga studios, and independent coffee shops) <em>before</em> the major real estate developments and national chains arrive. </p><p>But we can argue intuitions all day — the real question is research.</p><h4>Empirically, more supply lowers prices</h4><p>Back when I wrote <em>The Rent Is Too Damn High</em>, I said that the impact of new development on hyper-local prices was theoretically ambiguous and the important thing was to look at city-wide effects that are not. </p><p>Fortunately, the past few years have seen a good amount of empirical work on this question. And it turns out that in most cases studied, new units reduce prices even on a very local scale. </p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/oplls6utgf7z6ih/Pennington_JMP.pdf?dl=0">Kate Pennington</a>’s recent study of San Francisco is very precise: “I find that rents fall by 2% for parcels within 100m of new construction. Renters’ risk of being displaced to a lower-income neighborhood falls by 17%. Both effects decay linearly to zero within 1.5km.”</p></li><li><p><a href="https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/7fc2bf_ee1737c3c9d4468881bf1434814a6f8f.pdf">Xiaodi Li</a> looked at New York: “For every 10% increase in the housing stock, rents decrease 1% and sales prices also decrease within 500 feet.”</p></li><li><p><a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/the-left-nimby-canon">Brian Asquith, Evan Mast, and Davin Reed</a> look specifically at new market-rate housing in low-income neighborhoods in eleven cities and find: “New buildings decrease nearby rents by 5 to 7 percent relative to locations slightly farther away or developed later, and they increase in-migration from low-income areas.”</p></li></ul><p>There are some more studies along these lines, but I don’t want to inundate you with them because I do agree that the impact is theoretically ambiguous and someday, someone, somewhere will find the opposite result. </p><p>It is striking, though, that induced demand theory doesn’t yet have its Card &amp; Kruger paper that changed the game on the minimum wage. There is no Arin Dube of induced demand theory who’s published a series of rigorous empirical papers demonstrating that there’s something weird in this market. Instead you get this from Chew:</p><blockquote><p>Studies show that market-rate housing development is linked to the mass displacement of neighboring low-income residents (Davidson and Lees&nbsp;<a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1068/a3739">2005</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.clarku.edu/mdavidson/files/2012/02/Davidson-Lees-2010-New-Build-Gentrification.pdf">2010</a>; Pearsall&nbsp;<a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1068/c08126">2010</a>). Such displacement occurs even when low-income housing is not directly demolished and destroyed to make way for new development—because it operates through indirect and exclusionary means, such as “price shadowing” (Davidson and Lees&nbsp;<a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1068/a3739">2005</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.clarku.edu/mdavidson/files/2012/02/Davidson-Lees-2010-New-Build-Gentrification.pdf">2010</a>). Market-rate housing production causes significant price impacts in surrounding neighborhoods, raising area rents and real estate taxes (Oliva&nbsp;<a href="https://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/handle/1903/4205/umi-umd-4016.pdf;sequence=1">2006</a>; Pearsall&nbsp;<a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1068/c08126">2010</a>; Zuk and Chapple&nbsp;<a href="http://www.urbandisplacement.org/sites/default/files/images/udp_research_brief_052316.pdf">2016</a>).&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>So I checked the links.</p><p>The two Davidson and Lees papers are concerned with a definitional question in urban geography. According to them, the traditional meaning of gentrification in the literature is something like “rich people move into old homes and renovate them.” They argue that we should extend the definition to include things like new mixed-use housing and retail developments in underused industrial spaces. They <em>assert</em> but do not demonstrate that “price shadowing” occurs in these cases, and then argue that this sort of phenomenon ought to count as gentrification.</p><p><a href="https://www.urbandisplacement.org/sites/default/files/images/udp_research_brief_052316.pdf">Zuk and Chapple</a> actually say: “At the regional level, both market-rate and subsidized housing reduce displacement pressures, but subsidized housing has over double the impact of market-rate units.”</p><p>Pearsall says that cleaning up brownfields raises prices in nearby Census tracts, which is interesting and raises the question of whether “make people live near toxic waste” is really the affordable housing strategy we want. </p><p>Last we get to Oliva, who at last actually finds induced demand. He looks at the Inner Harbor project in Baltimore which transformed a largely derelict stretch of waterfront into a tourist attraction featuring a convention center, an amazing aquarium, a cool park, and a bunch of hotels and restaurants. Note that in this case promoting economic development was the intended goal of the initiative (Baltimore is poor) and the point of his study is that it was a limited success story — home values did rise, but “this impact has been far more pronounced on the prices of properties located within a short distance from the water even decades after the initial projects on the waterfront were started.”</p><p>This is all good empirical work. But note that I don’t think anyone has ever argued that building an aquarium will reduce housing cost burdens. The Inner Harbor is (by design) a tourist attraction. A couple of weeks ago, I took my kid to the Maryland Zoo in Baltimore, then we drove down to the Inner Harbor, got some takeout from Shake Shack, walked around waterfront, and bought a couple of bottles of water somewhere. This is what a successful tourist attraction is supposed to accomplish — you bring in retail dollars and tax revenue. We’ll come back post-pandemic and see the aquarium. It’s a nice place to visit. And Oliva shows that if you build a nice place to visit in the middle of a city, then the immediately adjacent homes become more desirable. Similarly, per Pearsall, if you clean up a brownfield the adjacent homes become more desirable.</p><p>New infill housing appears to empirically neutralize the induced demand by simultaneously inducing supply. But conceptually there’s a question here — is it bad to make neighborhoods better places to live? </p><h4>Better neighborhoods are better</h4><p>Here’s the problem. Consider the following argument:</p><ol><li><p>Constructing new buildings will bring new retail amenities to the neighborhood.</p></li><li><p>New amenities will make the neighborhood a more attractive place to live.</p></li><li><p>Because the neighborhood is now more attractive, prices will rise.</p></li><li><p>Rising prices will displace some existing residents.</p></li><li><p>Therefore we shouldn’t allow new buildings to be constructed.</p></li></ol><p>In place of (1) you could put all kinds of things:</p><ul><li><p>Constructing a new park</p></li><li><p>Reducing the crime rate</p></li><li><p>Renovating the local high school</p></li><li><p>Improving bus service to downtown</p></li><li><p>Fixing the potholes</p></li></ul><p>In other words, you could imagine this kind of logic becoming an infinite cycle of bad urban policy. Defund police will lead to more murders? Well, that’s good for housing affordability. …</p></div></div>

<p><span>2020, the most fascinating and boring year of my life, is over, and despite one of the most violent market crashes in history and the sharpest recession of all time, US equity investors clocked in another good year on the calendar. The S&amp;P 500 index finished the year up 18.4%; this despite being down by as much as 30% in March, making 2020 one of the wildest swinging markets in history.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://ycharts.com/indices/%5ESPXTR/chart/#/?annotations=&amp;annualizedReturns=false&amp;calcs=id:total_return_forward_adjusted_price,include:true,,&amp;chartType=interactive&amp;correlations=&amp;dateSelection=range&amp;displayDateRange=false&amp;displayTicker=false&amp;endDate=12/31/2020&amp;format=indexed&amp;legendOnChart=false&amp;maxPoints=2000&amp;note=&amp;partner=basic_2000&amp;quoteLegend=true&amp;quotes=true&amp;recessions=false&amp;redesign=true&amp;scaleType=linear&amp;securities=id:^SPXTR,include:true,,&amp;securityGroup=&amp;securitylistName=&amp;securitylistSecurityId=&amp;source=false&amp;splitType=single&amp;startDate=01/01/2020&amp;title=&amp;units=false&amp;useCustomColors=false&amp;useEstimates=false&amp;zoom=custom"><img src="https://media.ycharts.com/charts/ccd34ab62ba3cdcc49abe8547f2cff73.png" alt="^SPXTR Chart"></a></p>

<p><span>But if you didn’t earn double digit returns last year you were in good company. The bull market was extremely concentrated in a narrow subset of stocks and most others floundered over the year. By my count, of the top 5,000 stocks trading on US exchanges (this includes over a thousand foreign stocks with US listings), only a little over half finished 2020 in positive territory and the median return was only 4.3%. If you didn’t have the good fortune to buy the few winners you were left behind, as happened with some of the industry’s best. Many of the world’s largest and previously most successful hedge funds and institutional money managers had a terrible 2020, including the top two: Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates and Jim Simon’s Renaissance Technologies, each famous for their billionaire visionary founders, uniquely<span> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-12/the-unsolved-mystery-of-the-medallion-fund-s-success">secretive</a>/<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbsVbFAczg">creepy</a></span> company culture, and astounding market-beating performance over decades, each suffered <em>negative double-digit</em> returns in their main funds in 2020. Similarly, some of the industry’s most highly regarded names such as <span><a href="https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1p9nxxx1d47xk/AQR-to-Liquidate-Some-Funds-After-Persistent-Outflows">AQR</a></span>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-17/renaissance-two-sigma-see-losses-as-quant-giants-navigate-chaos"><span>Two Sigma</span></a>, and <span><a href="https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1012650/dfa-is-paying-the-price-for-its-conviction">Dimensional Fund Advisors</a></span> all suffered massive investor redemptions in the face of substantial underperformance in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span>All these fund managers pursue a variety of different strategies in a variety of different markets, but they all have one thing in common: they’re quants. They take a data-driven approach to investing, using mathematical models based typically on decades of market returns to execute their strategy, often employing teams of Ph.D mathematicians, computer scientists, and economists to crunch the numbers. They generally pay little attention to the “human interest” elements of investing like the executive bio or squishy concepts like “product market fit” or five year strategic plans. There are a lot of different ways to be a quant, but if you are one, or invested with one in 2020, you probably had a bad year. 2020 was the year of the swashbuckling stock-picker. As Bloomberg declared in a year-end article, <span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-30/human-run-hedge-funds-trounce-quants-in-year-defined-by-pandemic">Human-Run Hedge Funds Trounce Quants in Covid Year</a></span>. 2020 was the revenge&nbsp;<em>against</em> the nerds.</span></p>
<p><span>So what happened? Leo Tolstoy famously wrote, “All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” So it was with investing in 2020, there were many different investing strategies that went unhappily in 2020, and all the strategies that went happily looked pretty much the same. Let’s look at the unhappy families first and then return to the one thing that went well in 2020.</span></p>
<h3>Diversification</h3>
<p>2020 saw a repeat of something we’ve witnessed a few times in the last decade, not only did US stocks have an especially good year, they did substantially better than pretty much every other market. Investors who diversified across multiple asset classes therefore had much weaker returns.</p>
<p><a href="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-1024x619.png" alt="" width="1024" height="619" srcset="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-200x121.png 200w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-300x181.png 300w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-400x242.png 400w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-600x363.png 600w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-768x464.png 768w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-800x484.png 800w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-1024x619.png 1024w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020-1200x726.png 1200w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Asset-Class-Returns-2020.png 1470w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p><span>Just about the only major asset that beat the S&amp;P 500 last year was gold. The shiny metal held its weight during the crisis in March and powered through the rest of the year. Emerging market stocks also put in a solid year, virtually tied with the US market, despite suffering an even harder crash in March. Most other major assets, however, had much more modest returns, including the stock markets of most other rich, industrialized nations. Investors diversified across these major markets still likely had reasonably positive returns, but were a far cry from the meteoric rise of the S&amp;P 500.</span></p>
<p><span>Of course, how investors allocated both across and within these asset classes was of tantamount importance to their outcomes in 2020, and generally these outcomes frustrated quants at every turn. Whether picking stocks within a market or allocating across asset classes, quants often rely on measures of valuation, volatility, or momentum to guide their process, based on the historical success of these metrics in predicting returns, and in nearly every case following the numbers led investors astray in 2020, starting with perhaps the most time-tested of financial strategies, value investing.</span></p>
<h3><span>Value and Fundamentals</span></h3>
<p><span>For investors like yours truly who believe markets ultimately have to have some <span><a href="https://rhsfinancial.com/2020/08/11/does-reality-matter-stock-market-2020/">relation to reality</a></span>, the following joke tweet from December is a little too on the nose.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="395" srcset="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word-200x82.jpg 200w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word-300x123.jpg 300w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word-400x165.jpg 400w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word-600x247.jpg 600w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word-768x316.jpg 768w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word-800x329.jpg 800w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/F-Word.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"></a></p>
<p><span>Value investors ask the same seemingly reasonable question of investments we all ask when we’re considering buying a good or service: is the price I have to pay a good deal compared to the quality I’m getting? In practice this generally means value investors seek to buy assets whose prices are low relative to their cashflows or other economic fundamentals. Value investing has an intellectual pedigree going back to at least the 1920s with the classic writings of Graham and Dodd and is perhaps most famous for their most successful student, Warren Buffett (who also didn’t do so well last year). Value investing has been out of favor for several years now, especially in the US market, something I documented extensively in my <span><a href="https://rhsfinancial.com/2020/08/11/does-reality-matter-stock-market-2020/">two part</a> <a href="https://rhsfinancial.com/2020/08/19/does-reality-matter-part2/">series</a></span> last year on market valuations.</span></p>
<p><span>Last year was a miserable one for value investors. Within the US market, value stocks lagged the market in the first couple months, fell further during the crash, and recovered slower than the rest of the market. Though they rallied harder in the last two months of the year, value stock both large and small finished the year finished the year just barely above zero, as judged by the commonly followed Russell 1000 Value (large stocks) and Russell 2000 Value (small stocks) indexes.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://ycharts.com/indices/%5ESPXTR/chart/#/?annotations=&amp;annualizedReturns=false&amp;calcs=id:total_return_forward_adjusted_price,include:true,,&amp;chartType=interactive&amp;correlations=&amp;dateSelection=range&amp;displayDateRange=false&amp;displayTicker=false&amp;endDate=12/31/2020&amp;format=indexed&amp;legendOnChart=false&amp;maxPoints=2000&amp;note=&amp;partner=basic_2000&amp;quoteLegend=true&amp;quotes=true&amp;recessions=false&amp;redesign=true&amp;scaleType=linear&amp;securities=id:^SPXTR,include:true,,id:^RLVTR,include:true,,id:^RUJTR,include:true,,&amp;securityGroup=&amp;securitylistName=&amp;securitylistSecurityId=&amp;source=false&amp;splitType=single&amp;startDate=01/01/2020&amp;title=&amp;units=false&amp;useCustomColors=false&amp;useEstimates=false&amp;zoom=custom"><img src="https://media.ycharts.com/charts/273b52a1901248cfb2556266430d94d6.png" alt="^SPXTR Chart"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://ycharts.com/indices/^SPXTR">^SPXTR</a> data by <a href="https://ycharts.com/">YCharts</a></p>
<p><span>Applying the value effect around the world gave even worse results. Choosing between stock markets, the US started the year the most expensive market in the world, and those in Europe were among the cheapest. But as we saw, the US market became more expensive still, and European stock investors barely ended the year in positive territory. Value stocks within foreign markets similarly failed to keep up with their broader market aggregates. One index of value stocks around the world, the MSCI ACWI Value Index, finished the year up a mere 0.42%. Taking an even more expansive view of valuation and applying it across global assets, buying those stocks, bonds, commodities, and currencies measured as cheap and selling those measured as expensive would have lost you about 12% in 2020 (through November) according to <span><a href="https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Datasets/Value-and-Momentum-Everywhere-Factors-Monthly">AQR’s methodology</a></span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Skeptics of value investing often point out that value stocks are usually cheap for a reason: they’re junk. Indeed, if you simply sort the market based on a simple valuation metric like price to book ratio you’ll often find that the most undervalued stocks are in declining industries, have weak balance sheets and margins, and are projected to lose market share. Value investors often try to avoid “value traps” like this by augmenting their value factors with metrics to score some measure of “quality”, looking at profitability measures like return on equity, for example. Adding such quality filters would have only made things worse in 2020. Among the cheapest stocks in the market, the most profitable among them did the worst last year.</span></p>
<p><span>Professor Ken French keeps an invaluable <span><a href="https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html">online database</a></span> to quants that records the track records to different portfolios of stocks sorted on a variety of metrics. Looking at a double-sorted portfolio of the stocks that are in the lowest quintile of valuation and the highest quintile of profitability, here’s how such a portfolio did last year (through November) compared to the S&amp;P 500.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-1024x546.png" alt="" width="1024" height="546" srcset="https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-200x107.png 200w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-300x160.png 300w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-400x213.png 400w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-600x320.png 600w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-768x409.png 768w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-800x426.png 800w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-1024x546.png 1024w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value-1200x639.png 1200w, https://rhsfinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/US-vs-High-Profit-Low-Value.png 1490w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><span>The most profitable, cheapest stocks in the US lost more than half of their value in the crash last year, before recovering to end up down “only” about 20% last year, a staggering 33.8% behind the S&amp;P 500.</span></p>
<p><span>Take a moment to consider how counterintuitive this ought to seem. I think most people, even without much financial savvy, would consider the strategy of “buy highly profitable companies at attractive valuations” to seem like a fairly reasonable one, the sort of things that might actually deliver superior results over the long run, and indeed if we look at the long run data it has, as we’ll see further down the page. You might even suspect that such a prudent strategy might shine especially during a period of great economic tumult and uncertainty, and indeed it often has historically. But that is absolutely&nbsp;<em>not</em> what happened during the chaos of 2020. And that wasn’t the only curveball 2020 threw quants either.</span></p>
<h3><span>Low Volatility/Risk Parity</span></h3>
<p><span>After value, low volatility strategies are some of the most commonly used quant approaches of the last decade. Research going back to the 70s shows that those stocks whose prices are relatively more stable tend to roughly keep up with the rest of the market or nearly so when times are good, but lose far less value during panics and bear markets. Thus, over the long run they’ve done about as good or better as the rest of the market with a lot less risk. That is… decidedly not what happened last year. Within the US market, two of the most popular quant funds of recent years have been the iShares US Minimum Volatility ETF and the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Low Volatility ETF, two ETFs that use a quantitative approach to pick the least volatile stocks within the US market. With tens of billions of dollars between them, here’s how these two flavors of low volatility stock investing did last year.</span></p>

<h3>When the pipe bursts</h3>



<p>7am every Wednesday, it was time to release the code. I’d take a weeks worth of code that I knew nothing about, by 2 dozen people, and ship it to production. We tested the code in isolation. We tested it together in our lower environments.  But even then when it was up on production who knew what was going to happen. Even if the release itself went well, there was always a chance that a feature was not ready for users. Finding that out at the last minute could push a release to a later day. This would delay other important releases that teams worked hard on.</p>



<p> <br>By batching up releases, we thought we were doing everyone a favor.  Customer success only has to learn about the release once a week! One person can own the release process and be an authority on it! We can test everything together all at once, and know for sure that it will work!. We were so wrong. </p>



<p><br>By batching up releases, we introduced a ton of risk. The release became an all or nothing affair. If any feature in a release wasn’t ready for customers, everything we had already communicated to customers was at risk. We would mitigate that risk by creating new problems. Rushing through something or introducing new issues. </p>



<p><br>The person (me) who was doing the deployment had no context for what exactly I was deploying. Sure the steps we could document the steps and what was in the release. But if something went wrong,, all I knew I could do was stop the whole train. If anything broke, it was impossible to figure out what may have caused it. Even if you are an expert of a system, a week’s worth of work by 20+ people is impossible to isolate defects. </p>



<p><br>After a few too many stressful releases, we decided one of the best investments we could make quickly was feature flags. With feature flags, you separate the release of code to customers from the deployment to production. Code for a new feature can live in a production environment for any duration of time without disruption to your customer. When the feature is ready, any team member can turn it on. If there is an issue for any reason, Anyone can shut the feature off, limiting impact. </p>



<p><br>We saw improvements to our process right away.  We stopped batching deployments, instead we would deploy to production regularly. Each change getting sent to production was easy to discern, it could be as small as a couple lines of code. If there was an issue it would be easy to track and identify. </p>



<p><br>When a feature was  ready for customers, anyone on our team, especially our product owners, could turn it on. We even went further. To deliver value customers sooner, we could build smaller features and only release it to users who had no known edge cases.  Once we had more time to identify how to approach the edge cases those customers would receive the updates. Teams became more confident, less stressed, and could get feedback on their work in a much shorter timeframe. </p>



<p><br>This was a transformative experience for me. I’ve been preaching the gospel ever since. I knew I could help get teams to work faster by enabling feature flags for more teams. </p>



<p><br>That’s why I built Molasses. <br></p>



<h3>The Great Molasses Flood </h3>

<p>I started building in June. I focused on the problems I saw with the current tools. I surveyed those who had used feature flagging and A/B testing services in the past to get their opinion. What I found was that while there are great solutions here and there, but there was space for improvement. </p>



<p><br>Despite being a developer focused tool,  so many feature flag services are developer hostile. They can be slow, and make blocking remote calls. They are naive in their ability to target users, sometimes only by IP address or one parameter.  They had no way to audit changes. They lacked integrations with platforms for planning, chatops or observability.   Teams are slow to remove feature flags, accumulating technical debt. The gaps in these feature flag systems are  filled with custom software. Taking away from expensive developer and operations resources. </p>



<p><br><a href="https://www.molasses.app/">Molasses</a> allows teams to get up and running with feature flags right away. It supports many different languages and frameworks.  Molasses’ clients are fast, non-blocking, and the service pushes updates to the client instantly, no waiting.  You can roll out features to specific users and target specific groups. Molasses lets teams focus on the features they are building, not building feature flag technology. </p>



<p><br>Molasses unlocks A/B testing. We can examine the effectiveness  of a change right away. Want to start rolling out a feature to a set of alpha or beta users? No problem! Molasses will let you adjust who receives a feature over time.</p>

<p><br>Molasses isn’t the only tool in your toolchain. It integrates with the systems you already use, like Datadog or Slack. You can use those updates to know if a recent change is causing issues. When your feature is finally rolled out, Molasses has the code clean itself up. It opens a PR in your Github repo removing any stale code. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Every time I used to visit Product Hunt, I would end up discovering a few awesome tools and products that make me say, wow! This is so cool. I want to build something like that. But the thing is I had no idea what to do. But I so wanted to build a product. I wanted to go through the process of building and shipping a product from scratch to end.</p>

<p>In late December, Hashnode announced  #ChristmasHackathon. And I decided to use it as a trigger to push myself to build something. I had few ideas so I started working and I built <strong>Tabwave</strong>. Well, I won't be discussing how and why I built it because I have already talked about it.  Check out  <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.rutikwankhade.dev/how-i-built-my-own-productivity-app">how I built my own productivity app</a> here.</p>
<p>I launched it last week on Product Hunt and it was the <strong><em>#5 Product of the day</em></strong> with 300+ upvotes. Also, it made it to the Product Hunt's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.producthunt.com/newsletter/7914">newsletter</a> too. For me, it was a 🏆 huge milestone.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/tabwave?utm_source=badge-top-post-badge&amp;utm_medium=badge&amp;utm_souce=badge-tabwave" target="_blank"><img src="https://api.producthunt.com/widgets/embed-image/v1/top-post-badge.svg?post_id=281905&amp;theme=dark&amp;period=daily" alt="Tabwave - Replace your new tab with a mindful productive app | Product Hunt"></a></p>

<p>I have learned a lot in these past few days about shipping products. So I am going to share my experience here.</p>
<h4 id="before-launch">🚀 Before launch</h4>
<h3 id="build-in-public">👩‍💻 Build in Public</h3>
<p>Keep sharing about your progress. It can be a tiny feature you added, a problem you faced, or a nasty bug you fixed. Share your wins and failures. Document everything. That will help you build your audience and create excitement among early users. And I feel Twitter is the best place for it.</p>
<p><em>Documenting your journey + Providing value</em> is the sweet spot I follow. Focus on providing as much value as you can.</p>
<h3 id="feedback-is-super-important">✨ Feedback is super important</h3>
<p>Feedback is the best thing that will help you and your product grow. The biggest example is Hashnode itself. See the <a target="_blank" href="https://hashnode.com/feature-requests">Feature Request</a> section of Hashnode. They listen to the community and give them exactly what they want. That's why we love it so much. So whatever you are building, share with the community. Ask for the feedback and make it better and better. </p>
<p>I collected feedback from the comments in my blog, from Reddit, from Twitter, anywhere from I could get people's hands on it. And that was a crucial thing. Not only they helped me find bugs, silly mistakes but suggested potential features.</p>
<h3 id="copywriting-is-a-skill">📰 Copywriting is a skill</h3>
<p>When I heard about copywriting for the first time I literally thought it means copying and writing. 😅 Yeah, I was that dumb. Copywriting is simply writing something in a way that makes the audience curious about it. It's more used in marketing and advertising stuff. </p>
<p>But wait? Why should I care about it. Well, whatever you build, Your goal is to reach more audiences. And in this high paced digital world, it's hard to grab attention in a little span of time. So use your words wisely. Learn how to write an effective copy.</p>
<h3 id="name-and-domain">🌐 Name and domain</h3>
<p>Before I started building Tabwave, I called it sorted. I loved that name a lot. Later I found out it's already taken. So I had to rename it to Tabwave, which is kind of cool too. That was the moment I realized why developers own so many domain names. Because they buy it even before starting to work the side project, which I think is a smart thing to do. </p>
<h3 id="landing-page">👨‍🚀 Landing page</h3>
<p>It's good to have a landing page for your product and a form to collect emails. 
<img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1611594476374/5QoVVDtBW.png?auto=compress" alt="frame_chrome_mac_light (6).png">
My extension wasn't published so I collected emails to notify the users of its launch. So on the launch day, I had a list of 50+ people I could send mails to who are excited to check out my product.  </p>
<h4 id="launch-day">🚀 Launch day</h4>
<h3 id="product-hunt">🌀 Product Hunt</h3>
<p>Product Hunt is a global platform. Every day, a large number of products get launched by either individual makers or companies. Getting your product noticed isn't that easy. So the main goal is to get your product on the first page. Let's be honest, what was the last time you went on the 2nd page of your google search? rarely right! The same goes for Product Hunt.</p>
<p><em>I prepared everything like the description, screenshots, maker's comment, etc before and previewed using <a target="_blank" href="https://previewhunt.com/">Previewhunt</a>.</em></p>
<h3 id="timing-is-important">⌚ Timing is important</h3>
<p>All we get is 24 hrs. of PST <em>(Pacific Standard Time)</em> to show our product. Every day the list gets refreshed after 24 hours. I had no idea about this, glad I did some research before launch. The sooner you launch, the better. If you launch at around 12 am PST, it will get a longer exposure.</p>
<p>I launched Tabwave around 2 pm IST which is 12:30 am PST. I preferred Friday/Saturday as on weekends there is less competition which increased my chances to get featured.</p>
<p>For the first few hours, Tabwave was in 16th position but then it started getting upvotes and soon I could see it on the first page. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1611660991541/oXK88xPUQ.png?auto=compress" alt="Screenshot (491).png"></p>
<h4 id="after-launch">🚀 After launch</h4>
<h3 id="find-your-audience">👨‍👦‍👦 Find your audience.</h3>
<p>Building and launching is one thing but after that is the real game. i.e. Getting it into the hands of real users. Ask yourself, where does your audience hang out more. Is it Twitter? maybe Reddit? or something else?</p>
<p>I shared Tabwave everywhere I could think of like Twitter, Linkedin, relative Reddit channels, discord servers, communities like Indiehackers, Makerlog, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But please don't spam. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the product is good, people will more likely share it. However, it is suggested to share links to your landing page and not the Product Hunt page.</p>
<h3 id="engage-with-your-users">🙋‍♂️ Engage with your users</h3>
<p>For the next 24 hrs, I was available on all platforms. It was exciting. I was getting a good response. Engaging with the users, their feedbacks, and appreciations was overwhelming.</p>
<h3 id="monitor-the-stats">📈 Monitor the stats</h3>
<p>Wait, did you add analytics to your landing page? If not, you should. It will help you monitor the traffic and other stats. I was going to use google analytics but then I discovered  <a target="_blank" href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible</a>. I felt it's cleaner and much better than google analytics.</p>
<p>Here are the stats of Tabwave after a week.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1611813418999/zUgV72gW8.png?auto=compress" alt="Screenshot (493).png"></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1611892562869/t03njCD1s.png?auto=compress" alt="tabwave (5).png"></p>
<h3 id="perks">🥳 Perks</h3>
<p>I have made awesome friends on Twitter, 100+ connections on Linkedin. And this week I have been approached by 5-6 folks with job opportunities that I haven't even applied for. </p>
<h3 id="summing-up">Summing up</h3>
<p>That's not everything. It was my first time. Tabwave was just a simple idea. I realized I can do better. There is a lot more to learn. A long way to go. It was a wonderful experience. And I am really excited to unfold what comes next. Everything I mentioned here is from my learning experience.  So give it a go, try different things, and keep growing.</p>
<p>I keep writing about the things I learned and applied.

<h3>DataBrew</h3>
<p name="17f1">AWS’s new data preparation tool belongs to the category of <em>no-code easy-to-use visual data-preparation engine</em><strong>.</strong> It is primarily purposed as a tool for <strong>cleaning, normalization, </strong>and <strong>profiling </strong>of data as well as <strong>automation of recipe jobs</strong>. It can be viewed as a <strong>standalone</strong> tool for data preparation but can be integrated within AWS’ ecosystem of tools and services such as S3 or other AWS data lakes and databases for storage, import, and export of unprepared/prepared data.</p>
</div>
<p name="d3dc">We decided to try out the platform to develop this article. Below is a screenshot of the ASW Glue DataBrew graphical user interface (GUI).&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Smart Data Preparation (The AI &amp; Analytics Engine)</h3>
<p name="4005">Within the AI &amp; Analytics Engine, Smart Data Preparation is a fully <strong>interactive</strong> feature that lets users prepare their data <strong>at scale </strong>in a <strong>flexible </strong>manner.&nbsp;</p>
<p name="b17a">The premise is that the user is guided by <strong>smart recommendations</strong> during the recipe-creation process. It offers a variety of “actions” (data transformation steps) through an <strong>action catalogue</strong> that offers the ability to fully customize and edit their data-preparation recipes. It covers the four stages of data preparation commonly required in analytics and machine learning tasks:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cleaning</strong></li>
<li><strong>Structuring</strong></li>
<li><strong>Enriching&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Feature engineering</strong></li>
</ol>
<p name="024d">Rather than a standalone tool, the Smart Data Preparation feature is a tightly integrated functionality within the end-to-end user journey on the AI &amp; Analytics Engine platform. It sits between the data import and app creation phases of the journey in a unified graphical user interface (GUI).</p>

<h3>Key Benefits: Its what you DON’T need to do</h3>
<p name="73ca">Smart Data Preparation on the AI &amp; Analytics Engine provides ease of use through the above seamless interface. In particular, there is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><strong>NO need to </strong>manually generate access tokens and turn on/off secure access of data between different tools</li>
<li><strong>NO need to </strong>manually set up S3 buckets or migrate all of their data into a single ecosystem such as AWS</li>
<li><strong>NO need to </strong>write scripts to manually orchestrate different components of the end-to-end pipeline</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<br>
<section name="fe3e">
<div>
<h2>Similarities</h2>
<p name="e0a5">The main similarity between the two tools is that they both cater to the need for an easy-to-use no-code interactive data preparation tool. Let's take a closer look:&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Data Ingestion and&nbsp;Outcome</h4>
<p name="f691">Both tools are targeted at tabular data files in the following formats: CSV, JSON (lines), and PARQUET.</p>
<p name="5fcd">While Data Brew allows the import of data mainly from data lakes on the AWS cloud such as S3, Redshift, and RDS — The Smart Data Preparation (AI &amp; Analytics Engine) allows a diverse set of options for importing data, such as HTTP (URLs), SQL and NoSQL databases. Users can still upload data from cloud storage services such as S3 or GCS (google cloud) by getting a pre-signed URL for their dataset and using the HTTP option.</p>
<p name="bd6a">The outcome of the recipe-building process is a re-runnable recipe that can be re-used to transform a larger dataset of the same input schema.</p>

</div>
<div>
<h4>Interactive Recipe Building and Recommender</h4>
<p name="33a4">Both AWS Glue DataBrew and the Smart Data Preparation feature have an interactive recipe-building user interface. There are many similarities between the two:</p>
<ol>
<li>Quick preview of the dataset being prepared</li>
<li>The list of actions (steps) selected so far in the recipe</li>
<li>The ability to edit or delete a step in the recipe</li>
</ol>

<p name="0074">Whenever the list of actions in a recipe is modified, a validation check is applied to ensure that the recipe is legitimate. It consists of the following among many checks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Input columns are available in the schema and are of the correct data types</li>
<li>The combination of parameters is valid</li>
<li>Names of new columns output by an action are not colliding with existing column names</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</section>
<section name="738a">

<h2>Differences</h2>
<h4>Diversity of the action catalogue</h4>
<p name="7a96">Data Brew’s official documentation of “Recipe actions reference” show about 170 actions in their catalogue. Comparably, we support 85 actions + 81 formula functions in our Smart Data Preparation feature.</p>
<p name="1521">The coverage areas of the actions also differ between the two platforms, as shown in the table below:</p>
<figure><img data-image-id="1*umj-HBTNOaZ1CIqpRVxzqw.jpeg" data-width="750" data-height="1332" alt="Table comparing action catalogue between DataBrew and The AI &amp; Analytics Engine Smart Data Preoaration Model" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*umj-HBTNOaZ1CIqpRVxzqw.jpeg" width="534"></figure>
<h4>Column group as output to complex&nbsp;actions</h4>
<p name="8eef">Some actions such as “pivot”, “Extract PCA components” etc. result in a “column group” rather than a column. A column group serves as a placeholder in the schema wherein one or more component columns can be generated by a recipe action. This enables:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Better understandability, since the user is aware that the individual components within the group are generated by a single action.</li>
<li>Universal validity of the recipe for all future batches of data, since running actions of the aforementioned types on different batches of data can lead to different number of individual components. For example, if a “pivot” action is run on a different batch of the data, the number of columns produced in the output can differ.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
The column groups themselves as a whole can be input to other actions if appropriate. Finally, the concept of column group is flexible, as there are actions in the recipe that allow the user to take a particular component in a column group and treat it just like any other column, if they desire it.

<div><br>
<h4>Advanced column selectors</h4>
<p name="7819">Our Smart Data Preparation offers the ability for users to apply a transformation on multiple columns with a single action. To aid these, our graphical user interface and API provides the following modes of including/excluding input columns, column groups, or both into the selection:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><strong>By Name: </strong>explicitly list out the name</li>
<li><strong>By Type:</strong> select by schema type</li>
<li><strong>By Pattern</strong>: select by match in regex pattern of the name</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p name="965a">The user is also allowed to combine multiple such criteria with the and/or operator. This enables full flexibility to let the user specify complex selection criteria such as “columns matching the name pattern ‘x_.*’, excluding non-numeric columns.”</p>
<h4>Queuing and Committing actions to a&nbsp;recipe</h4>
<p name="08fd">In The AI &amp; Analytics Engine, whenever an action is added, it is “queued” to be committed to the recipe. Like in DataBrew, the queued actions are run on a fixed-size sample (first 5k rows) of the full dataset and the result is displayed as a preview. This serves as a visual feedback to users, allowing them to change the configuration of their action to ensure that the preview represents what they desire as the result.</p>
<p name="5329">Our platform also provides an additional functionality enabled for the user, called the “committing” of the queued actions to a recipe, before continuing to edit the recipe further. Committing of actions signals the platform to run the recipe actions on the full dataset (rather than on the sample) and then show a renewed sample preview. This results in a more accurate data preview, where the sample was first generated from the raw data before the recipe actions were applied.</p>
<p name="ce3a">Committing of actions to a recipe also provides the platform to run intelligent algorithms with the full processed data to to provide users with good recommendations for the next set of actions in their recipe.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>Recommendations</h4>
<p name="f781">In DataBrew, recommendations are generated on a per-column basis, and are not available by default. The user needs to click on a particular column and request recommendations corresponding to one column.</p>
<figure></figure>
<p name="e2c0">The AI &amp; Analytics Engine’s Smart Data Preparation also provides recommendations of the next set of actions likely to be helpful to the user.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The key differences are that:&nbsp;</h3>
<ol>
<li>These recommendations are generated automatically the first time the user starts a recipe and after every commit.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The recommendations are based on <strong>a sample of the entire dataset rather than a single column.</strong> This makes it quite <strong>attractive for users who want to detect for example, input columns with too little correlation with the target variable that need to be dropped.</strong></li>
<li>Every recommendation is accompanied with <strong>reasons why these actions are useful</strong>, showing charts and summary statistics to help the user understand and scrutinize their data.</li>
</ol>

January 28, 2021 | https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/constant-folding-python | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/constant-folding-python">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Every programming language aims to be performant in its niche and achieving superior performance requires a lot of compiler level optimizations. One famous optimization technique is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_folding">Constant Folding</a> where during compile time the engine tries to recognize constant expressions, evaluate them, and replaces the expression with this newly evaluated value, making the runtime leaner.</p>
<p>In this essay, we dive deep and find what exactly is Constant Folding, understand the scope of it in the world of Python and finally go through Python's source code - <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/">CPython</a> - and find out how elegantly Python actually implements it.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_folding">Constant Folding</a>, the engine finds and evaluates constant expressions at compile time rather than computing them at runtime, making the runtime leaner and faster.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>day_sec = <span>24</span> * <span>60</span> * <span>60</span>
</code></pre>
<p>When the compiler encounters a constant expression, like above, it evaluates the expression and replaces it with the evaluated value. The expression is usually replaced by the evaluated value in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">Abstract Syntax Tree</a>, but the implementation is totally up to the language. Hence the above expression is effectively executed as</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>day_sec = <span>86400</span>
</code></pre>

<p>In Python, we could use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html#module-dis">Disassembler module</a> to get the CPython bytecode giving us a good peek at how things will be executed. When we disassemble the above constant expression using the <code>dis</code> module, we get the following bytecode</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>import</span> dis
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>dis.dis(<span>"day_sec = 24 * 60 * 60"</span>)

        <span>0</span> LOAD_CONST               <span>0</span> (<span>86400</span>)
        <span>2</span> STORE_NAME               <span>0</span> (day_sec)
        <span>4</span> LOAD_CONST               <span>1</span> (<span>None</span>)
        <span>6</span> RETURN_VALUE
</code></pre>
<p>We see that the bytecode, instead of having two binary multiply operations followed by one <code>LOAD_CONST</code>, is having just one <code>LOAD_CONST</code> with the already evaluated value of <code>86400</code>. This indicates that the CPython interpreter during parsing and building of Abstract Syntax Tree folded the constant expression, <code>24 * 60 * 60</code> and replaced it with the evaluated value <code>86400</code>.</p>
<h3>Scope of Constant Folding</h3>
<p>Python tries to fold every single constant expression present but there are some cases where even though the expression is constant, but Python chooses not to fold it. For example, Python does not fold <code>x = 4 ** 64</code> while it does fold <code>x = 2 ** 64</code>.</p>
<p>Apart from the arithmetic expressions, Python also folds expressions involving Strings and Tuples, where constant string expressions till the length <code>4096</code> are folded.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a = <span>"-"</span> * <span>4096</span>   
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a = <span>"-"</span> * <span>4097</span>   
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a = <span>"--"</span> * <span>4096</span>  
</code></pre>

<p>Now we shift our focus to the internals and find exactly where and how CPython implements Constant Folding. All AST optimizations, including Constant Folding, can be found in file <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Python/ast_opt.c">ast_opt.c</a>. The base function starting it all is <code>astfold_expr</code> which folds any and every expression that Python source has. The function recursively goes through the AST and tries to fold every constant expression, as seen in the snippet below.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/103898628-38922200-511b-11eb-965f-fb4d46d3c45c.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/103898628-38922200-511b-11eb-965f-fb4d46d3c45c.png"></p>
<p>The <code>astfold_expr</code> before folding the expression at hand, tries to fold its child expressions (operands) and then delegates the folding to the corresponding specific expression folding function. The operation-specific folding function evaluates the expression and returns the evaluated constant value, which is then put into the AST.</p>
<p>For example, whenever <code>astfold_expr</code> encounters a binary operation, it recursively folds the two child operands (expressions) before evaluating the expression at hand using <code>fold_binop</code>. The function <code>fold_binop</code> returns the evaluated constant value as seen in the snippet below.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/103898745-670ffd00-511b-11eb-88a9-f741157473b3.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/103898745-670ffd00-511b-11eb-88a9-f741157473b3.png"></p>
<p><code>fold_binop</code> function folds the binary operation by checking the kind of operator at hand and then invoking the corresponding evaluation function on them. For example, if the operation at hand is an addition then, to evaluate the final value, it invokes <code>PyNumber_Add</code> on both its left and right operands.</p>
<h3>What makes this elegant?</h3>
<p>Instead of writing special logic to handle certain patterns or types to fold constant expressions efficiently, CPython invokes the same general code. For example, it invokes the same usual <code>PyNumber_Add</code> function while folding that it does to perform the usual addition operation.</p>
<p>CPython has thus eradicated the need to write special functions to handle constant folding by making sure its code and evaluation process is structured in such a way that the general-purpose code itself can handle the evaluation of constant expressions.</p>

<![CDATA[The Auth Facade Pattern]]>

January 28, 2021 | https://fusionauth.io/blog/2021/01/27/auth-facade-pattern/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://fusionauth.io/blog/2021/01/27/auth-facade-pattern/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
              <p>During conversations with FusionAuth customers, I have seen a common deployment pattern I call the “Auth Facade”. This architecture is useful when deploying software to heterogeneous environments. You and your team are building an application which will deploy onsite. This could be into a data center, an isolated network, or a private cloud. These environments are run by your customers and you have limited insight into their configuration.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>You might choose this deployment model for a variety of reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Data gravity, when your application needs to go to the data because there’s so much that the data isn’t coming to you for cost or performance reasons.</li>
  <li>Security of confidential data; the customer needs to have the data remain in their hands.</li>
  <li>Intermittent or lossy connectivity to the internet due to the location of the deployment.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these stem from customer demand; you meet your customers where they are. Your production deployment environment is out of your control. This situation was common before the rise of “software as a service”, and its complexities led to the proliferation of SaaS. But for these environments, typical SaaS solutions, whether for monitoring, auth or analytics won’t work.</p>

<p>At the same time, your enterprise customer doesn’t want Yet Another User Database to maintain. Instead the stakeholders want your application to authenticate users against an existing datastore. This may be Azure Active Directory, Okta, or another identity provider. This identity provider is run by your customer’s employees and may support OIDC or SAML.</p>

<p>However, you want to ensure that your developers focus on building and extending your application, not building auth integrations. You especially want to avoid debugging authentication in prod environments you don’t control.</p>

<p>Finally, your application has needs around user data as well. Whether that is role based authorization, auditing access or displaying a “Welcome” message, your application will need to access and modify user data.</p>

<h2 id="options-for-handling-upstream-auth">Options for handling upstream auth</h2>

<p>As an enterprise software developer, you have a couple of options to solve this problem:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Test and document how your application can be configured to use an upstream provider. This is a roll your own solution and requires knowledge of your customers deployment environments. You’ll want to provide and test configuration options for all the major providers.</li>
  <li>Code to the OIDC and SAML specs, since most enterprise providers support these. You will limit your user data needs to what these provide. This is the pure federation option.</li>
  <li>Use an auth facade.</li>
</ul>

<p>Like any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern">facade</a>, the auth facade hides a subsystem. In this case, the subsystem is your client’s identity provider. When using this pattern, as part of your application you ship an embedded auth and user management system. All auth functionality is routed through this; it is configured to communicate with upstream authentication providers.</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/auth-facade/auth-facade-pattern.svg" alt="A common architectural pattern."></p>

<h2 id="the-auth-facade-vs-federation">The auth facade vs federation</h2>

<p>The auth facade provides more than just authentication and authorization federation, though. Federation is a good start, but sometimes you need more functionality, support and documentation than standards provide.</p>

<p>When you use an auth facade, you get the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A single interface for your developers to access and manage user data</li>
  <li>An easy, deployable, compact auth system which runs everywhere</li>
  <li>A rich set of APIs and data models</li>
  <li>Ample documentation for various upstream providers</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s talk a bit more about each of these.</p>

<h2 id="developer-interface">Developer interface</h2>

<p>Your developers need some kind of auth system in order to know which users can access the application, as well as what particular functionality is available to a user. By using the auth facade, your devs learn how to integrate with only one system, rather than every system your clients may require you to work with. This makes development easier and also frees up engineering focus for the features of your application.</p>

<p>Additionally, when there are bugs in the auth system, there are two common locations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Between your application and the facade</li>
  <li>Between the auth facade system and the upstream provider</li>
</ul>

<p>In the former case, you have everything you need to debug what is causing an issue for your customer. In the latter, you’ll be leveraging the troubleshooting and bug fixing expertise of the maintainers of the auth facade system. In either case, separating the concerns makes it easier to track down issues.</p>

<p>You’ll want a responsive team behind the auth facade system when issues arise. You don’t want to keep your customers waiting for a fix.</p>

<h2 id="deployable-auth-system">Deployable auth system</h2>

<p>When evaluating auth facade solutions, make sure you can deploy the system providing the facade into a variety of customer environments. This rules out any typical SaaS solutions, unless the SaaS provider deploys into their network. Being able to support air gapped or isolated networks can be a strong differentiator for your application, especially if it accesses sensitive data.</p>

<p>Ensure your application and the auth facade system are deployable using the same technologies. Doing so decreases installation complexity. Depending on customers’ needs, you may want to deploy in a unix friendly package such as an RPM or DEB, a generic software package like a zip file, or, for the cutting edge clients using kubernetes, a container solution such as Docker.</p>

<p>Since auth is a necessary part of your application, but not a differentiator, an auth system that fades into the background is best. This should happen both in the literal sense, with a user interface that isn’t recognizable as separate from your application, and the figurative sense, where your engineers minimize time spent worrying about it or maintaining it.</p>

<p>You also want a friendly license for embedding the auth system into your code. I am not a lawyer, but make sure you understand the licensing ramifications of any third party applications or libraries you ship hand in hand with your app. Some open source projects offer dual licensing, which may be a viable option.</p>

<h2 id="apis-and-data-model">APIs and data model</h2>

<p>If you can get by with the lowest common denominator of authentication and authorization information, strictly follow the OIDC and SAML standards and you’ll be happy.</p>

<p>But often the application you are building will need more information about a user than these standards can provide. You may want to store custom domain specific attributes useful to your application, for example.</p>

<p>Any auth facade solution must provide a superior data model when compared to the standards in order to be worthwhile to implement. If it doesn’t, just use the standards to interface with the upstream provider.</p>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

<p>As I talked to customers, they pointed out the benefits of documentation, which was surprising to me. While documentation is often useful, why is it so important for an auth facade?</p>

<p>Documentation lets you offload configuration of the connection between the auth facade and the upstream systems to people who know and maintain those upstream systems. These employees of your clients won’t be familiar with your application.</p>

<p>In fact, they may resent the additional work that your application’s installation requires of them. Making the configuration of the auth facade well documented and as simple as possible will make it easier to get your application working in your customer’s environment.</p>

<p>You therefore have two choices:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Maintain such documentation yourself</li>
  <li>Rely on the auth facade provider to create and offer great docs</li>
</ul>

<p>Guess which one is easier for your engineering team?</p>

<h2 id="how-can-you-implement-the-auth-facade-with-fusionauth">How can you implement the auth facade with FusionAuth</h2>

<p>FusionAuth is a great choice for an auth facade. It runs anywhere, integrates with both SAML and OIDC as well as other upstream providers, provides a single, rich interface for your developers, and is well documented.</p>

            <p><em>Posted on October 22, 2014
    </em>
</p>

<p>Although I became most familiar with the word through exposure to Category Theory, I knew that “functor” had at least a couple of other meanings in other contexts. I’d looked up its history before, but neglected to write it down. Now I won’t have to do it again!</p>
<h2 id="the-players-carnap-quine-tarski">The Players: Carnap, Quine, Tarski</h2>
<p>According to a number of sources, “functor” entered the lexicon via the work of <a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/carnap/" title="IEP: Rudolf Carnap">Rudolf Carnap</a>. Carnap studied philosophy, physics, and mathematics at university, including several courses in mathematics and logic from Gottlob Frege. He later studied the theory of relativity at Berlin, where Einstein was professor of physics.</p>
<p>His dissertation concerned an axiomatic system for space-time theory, which was written from a philosophical point of view. Thereafter he became involved with the <a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/viennacr/" title="IEP: Vienna Circle">Vienna Circle</a> of philosophers and ended up as a leading member. This group advanced the philosophy of logical positivism and was deeply concerned with the philosophy and practice of science.</p>
<p>In 1929, Carnap met <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/tarski/" title="SEP: Alfred Tarski">Alfred Tarski</a>, a Polish logician from the <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lvov-warsaw/" title="SEP: Lvov-Warsaw School">Lvov-Warsaw school of philosophy</a> who was developing a logical basis for the meaning of truth. A few years later, he moved to Prague to become a professor and wrote the 1934 book <em>The Logical Syntax of Language</em>, which contains (as far as I am aware) the first use of “functor”. I will return to the book in a moment, after making a few more of Carnap’s connections apparent.</p>
<p>In Prague, Carnap met the philosophers <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/quine/" title="SEP: Willard van Orman Quine">Willard van Orman Quine</a> and Charles Morris. When World War II broke out, they helped Carnap escape to the United States, where he remained. Tarski escaped Poland to the USA as well, and the trio of Carnap, Quine, and Tarski were thus able to meet (along with other leading philosophers and logicians) for a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=s14AAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;ots=-2_K3d7uP-&amp;dq=quine%20carnap%20functor&amp;pg=PA145#v=snippet&amp;q=Quine%20statement%20composition&amp;f=false" title="Carnap, Tarski, and Quine at Harvard">year at Harvard</a> to work on the leading issues of analytical philosophy.</p>
<h2 id="carnaps-logical-syntax-of-language">Carnap’s Logical Syntax of Language</h2>
<p>As part of his desire to put the practice of science on firm logical ground, Carnap wanted to have an appropriate understanding of language that could be used to properly express scientific truths. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=3e3gAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=rudolf%20carnap&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q=functor&amp;f=false" title="Google Books: Logical Syntax of Language">Logical Syntax</a> creates a formal system, a meta-language, with which to reason about constructs of natural language.</p>
<p>The meta-language defines syntactic constructs belonging to four categories:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A fixed set of 11 symbols</li>
<li>(Numerical) variables</li>
<li>Constant numerals</li>
<li>Predicates</li>
<li>Functors</li>
</ol>
<p>The point was to remove ambiguity of names and to add precision by designating things numerically as much as possible.</p>
<h3 id="basic-forms">Basic forms</h3>
<p>Designation of <em>things</em> was done positionally by numerical coordinates rather than by symbolic name. Positional numerals were defined inductively from <code>0</code> designating the initial position and primes marking successive positions. The traditional Arabic numerals were introduced as shorthand, as well as the possibility of tupling numbers to represent higher-dimensional positions.</p>
<p>Expressing properties of things was done via <em>predicates</em> over positions. These could express direct properties of things or relationships between things, but in a symbolic manner via the name-form of the predicate.</p>
<p>In order to represent properties numerically, the idea of <em>functor</em> was introduced. Functors were similar in form to predicates, in that they had a name-form and took numeric arguments, but instead of representing facts and/or relations they represented another numeric value.</p>
<h3 id="expressions">Expressions</h3>
<p>Valid combinations of the basic forms create expressions. Two important kinds of expressions were “sentences” and “numerical expressions.”</p>
<p>Sentences express logical truth value, so the expression of a predicate form is a sentence. Some of the symbols are combining forms that create sentences as well, such as equations.</p>
<p>Expressions of functors, on the other hand, are always numerical expressions. Numeric expression was very important to Carnap for the precise transmission of scientific detail, so he valued this precision of functor expression over the more “vague” relative or symbolic nature of predicate expressions.</p>
<p>Although Carnap’s concept of functor seems similar to that of a mathematical function, it is actually quite different. Functions are always a fixed relation between numbers, but functors may represent numerical observations of the world as well, such as the example given early on of the <em>temperature-functor</em> that has the numeric value of the temperature of its argument.</p>
<h2 id="connection-to-category-theory">Connection to Category Theory</h2>
<p><a href="http://www-news.uchicago.edu/releases/05/050421.maclane.shtml" title="Saunders Mac Lane, Mathematician, 1909-2005">Saunders Mac Lane</a>, one of the founders of Category Theory, was an associate of Carnap’s at the University of Chicago and was given the English translation of <em>Logical Syntax of Language</em> in 1938 for review. He was not particularly interested in the philosophical aspects of Carnap’s usage of “functor”, but in it he saw a perfect candidate to resolve a similar <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=41bHxtHxjUAC&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;ots=Vj9lsB_gf2&amp;dq=carnap%20functor&amp;pg=PA70#v=snippet&amp;q=%22metamathematical%20expression%22&amp;f=false" title="Tool and Object: A History and Philosophy of Category Theory">notational dilemma</a> in Category Theory.</p>
<p>So, the Category Theory notion of “functor” is related to Carnap’s original usage by similarity of role, as a stand-in for something “function-like” in some aspect, rather than being related by definition or usage. Steve Awodey, an associate of Mac Lane’s and a category theorist himself, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=DR5DAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA197&amp;ots=hUJG4tMAo7&amp;dq=carnap%20logische%20syntax%20der%20sprache%20english&amp;pg=PA197#v=onepage&amp;q=functor&amp;f=false" title="The Cambridge Companion to Carnap">remarked</a> that the word “functor” may end up being “Carnap’s most far-reaching contribution to modern mathematics.”</p>
<h2 id="quines-predicate-functor-logic">Quine’s Predicate-Functor Logic</h2>
<p>Quine, Tarski, and Carnap <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=s14AAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;ots=-2_K3d7uP-&amp;dq=quine%20carnap%20functor&amp;pg=PA145#v=snippet&amp;q=Quine%20statement%20composition&amp;f=false" title="Carnap, Tarski, and Quine at Harvard">conversed</a> about Carnap’s logical syntax while they were together at Harvard, and it seems to have influenced Quine’s thinking about logic. He certainly adopted the term “functor”, though he expanded its meaning. Quine thought that Carnap’s connective symbols, e.g.&nbsp;the equality symbol that generates equations, should be replaced by more general operators that construct sentences via composition.</p>
<p>Quine later referred to these operators as “predicate-functors” (possibly following Carnap’s convention of naming a sort of functor by its domain, e.g. “temperature-functor”) and developed an <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=YReOv31gdVIC&amp;lpg=PA283&amp;dq=%22Algebraic%20Logic%20and%20Predicate%20Functors%22&amp;pg=PA283#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Algebraic%20Logic%20and%20Predicate%20Functors%22&amp;f=false" title="Algebraic Logic and Predicate Functors">algebraic logic</a> based around them.</p>
<p>He later gave a more <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=liHivlUYWcUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=quine&amp;pg=PA129#v=onepage&amp;q=functor&amp;f=false" title="Methods of Logic">general definition</a> to the term “functor” itself, encompassing this new role as a generator of sentences rather than a numeric relation. It should also be noted that while Carnap was concerned with discussing language in general, including natural language, Quine was primarily interested in formal logic systems. In particular, his Predicate Functor Logic was an alternative to Combinatory Logic that avoided higher-order functions and the resulting encroachment of set theory into the system, which he viewed as outside the scope of logic.</p>
<h2 id="categorical-grammar">Categorical Grammar</h2>
<p>Tarski’s early career was influenced by his thesis advisor <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lesniewski/" title="SEP: Stanisław Leśniewski">Stanislaw Lesniewski</a> and also by the other prominent Lvov-Warsaw philospher <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazimierz_Ajdukiewicz" title="Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz">Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz</a>. Lesniewski worked in the field of ontology and was particularly interested in semantic categories; this use of “category” is due to Husserl and can be traced back to Aristotle.</p>
<p>Ajdukiewicz applied the notion of categories to the syntax of language to create the field of <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=iVVAAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA234&amp;ots=P6VDNfpt8Q&amp;dq=frege%20functor&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q=functor&amp;f=false" title="Categorical Grammar">categorical grammar</a>. The syntactic structure was thought to determine the semantic meaning in reasonable languages, thus the borrowed categorical terminology.</p>
<p>Syntactic categories are an equivalence class of expressions such that a sentence containing one of these sentences remains a sentence when it is substituted for any other expression that is a member of the same category. As such, syntactic categories are essentially the same as the types of Russell.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of categories; basic categories, which are enumerated in the definition of the language, and all others are complex (derived) categories. Expressions in complex categories are created by combining other expressions via a special kind of “functor” expression. These other expressions are called “arguments” to the functor, and the new compound expression is the functor’s “value”.</p>
<p>Although Ajdukiewicz’s early work on syntactic categories predated <em>Logical Syntax of Language</em>, it seems likely that the field of Categorical Grammar was influenced both directly via the text, which shared similar goals, and probably also via the influence of Tarski and Quine who made use of it (if not for precisely the same purposes) in their own work.</p>
<p>Categorical Grammar is primarily concerned with matters of natural language, but Joachim Lambek’s work on the <a href="http://ling.umd.edu/~alxndrw/CGReadings/lambek-58.pdf" title="The Mathematics of Sentence Structure">Lambek Calculus</a> drew it somewhat back towards mathematics and logic. Lambek Calculus resembles in some ways Alonzo Church’s Lambda Calculus (of the simply typed variety), Quine’s Functor Predicate Logic, and combinatory logic.</p>
<p>Of parenthetical interest is the fact that the logicians of the Lvov-Warsaw school preferred to place their functors at the front of their arguments; by this practice they allowed expressions to be unambiguous without parentheses. This practice became known as “Polish Notation”, which is familiar to many users of Hewlett Packard calculators by way of its similarly bracketless Reverse Polish Notation.</p>
<h2 id="functors-in-programming">Functors in Programming</h2>
<p>The use of functor via its Category Theory interpretation is familiar to many functional programmers today. It has a direct, though not all-encompassing, presence in Haskell via the Functor type class. Perhaps not quite so familiar is the linguistic interpretation as used by <a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~billw/prologdict.html#functor" title="Prolog Functor">Prolog</a>. And the SML Module language uses the term functor; although this can be interpreted in the categorical sense, it also makes sense from the perspective of Quine’s Predicate Functor Logic. C++’s use of functor to mean “function-like object” seems to be another repurposing of the word along the lines of Mac Lane’s.</p>

      <div id="main">
        

    

    <div>
        <p>It's been a wild week, and if there's anything I've learned, it's that no one knows what a Hedge Fund is and what a Market Maker is. </p>
<p>First, off, people are conflating Citadel Securities with Citadel. Yes, that is confusing. Citadel is indeed a Hedge Fund, but as such, <em>they obviously don't buy order flow from Robinhood</em>. Or data, for that matter. When people say "buy data from Robinhood", they mean order flow, which does contain data, technically.</p>
<h3>But what is a Hedge Fund?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A hedge fund is an investment fund that trades in relatively liquid assets and is able to make extensive use of more complex trading, portfolio-construction and risk management techniques to improve performance, such as short selling, leverage, and derivatives. Financial regulators generally restrict hedge fund marketing except to institutional investors, high net worth individuals and others who are considered sufficiently sophisticated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's basically a pool of money from rich people that are actively managed by people who try to get that pool of money to grow as much as they can. They do fancy stuff, more than just buying promising stocks, like, say, <em>shorting</em> Gamestop. </p>
<p>In the analogy of Poker games, Hedge Funds are <strong>professional poker players</strong>.</p>
<h3>Then, what is a Market Maker?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A market maker or liquidity provider is a company or an individual that quotes both a buy and a sell price in a financial instrument or commodity held in inventory, hoping to make a profit on the bid–ask spread, or turn. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission defines a "market maker" as a firm that stands ready to buy and sell stock on a regular and continuous basis at a publicly quoted price.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alright, that's a little less obvious. Essentially Market Makers are the people you actually buy stock from when you press the "BUY" button on your broker, and the people who buy your stock when you press the "SELL" button. </p>
<p>They purchase stock from people who want to sell at market price, then sell that stock to people who want to buy at market price. The difference between that is the bid-ask spread the Wikipedia definition refers to. Well, that's somewhat recursive given in many ways that they determine the market price, but it's enough to understand.</p>
<p>But the important thing is that they are not making positions on the stock market. They don't earn money when a stock grows, or falls. Rather, they make money from <em>each transaction</em>. </p>
<p>In the same analogy, Market Makers are <strong>the Casinos</strong>.</p>
<h2>Citadel vs Citadel</h2>
<p>There are <em>two</em> Citadels - one is indeed a Hedge Fund, but the other, Citadel Securities, is a Market Maker. It is <em>securities</em> that buys order flow. And they're completely separate LLCs now, although I believe that's somewhat recent - before they were under the same LLC but had a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chinesewall.asp">Chinese Wall</a> between them. </p>
<h3>What is Payment for Order Flow, a.k.a Citadel Buying Data From Robinhood</h3>
<p>When you submit an order for a stock, it needs to go through a market maker. Payment for Order Flow is the practice of Market Makers <em>paying Robinhood</em> to execute your orders. There's a number of reasons why they might do this: for one, it's business - executing orders is how they make money. And two, naturally orders <em>are</em> data.</p>
<p>This is controversial - after all, what if Citadel pays Robinhood so that Robinhood gives you a shittier deal (the shittyness of the deal goes into Citadel's pockets)? But it also doesn't have much to do with Gamestop.</p>
<p>Also, you can see that Hedge Funds do not pay for order flow... because what would they even do with them? They can't execute trades. If I want to buy some Apple, maybe Melvin has Apple stocks, maybe not, and if even if they do have it they probably own it because they're long on the company, they're not going to sell it to me for no reason.</p>
<h3>Citadel and Robinhood</h3>
<p>The connection between the two companies is between Securities and Robinhood, because Securities is one of (the majority, in fact) of Robinhood's payment for order flow revenue. And that, in fact, is kinda shady depending on how you view payment for order flow.</p>
<p>But, again, separate company from the hedge fund. Securities most definitely is not shorting Gamestop - market makers are not long or short on anything. Not what they do. </p>
<p>And I'm pretty sure that is like 90% of why Citadel is even in this story. Because they've never publicly stated that they even have a short position on GME. The other 10% is their revenue share in Melvin, which does have a short position on GME (or at least did - they said they closed). </p>
<p>But it's pretty tenuous connection once you realize they're two separate LLCs.</p>
<h2>This Tweet</h2>
<p>A screenshot of this tweet was at one point the highest post on Reddit /r/all, and it's just a beautiful encapsulation of wrongness.</p>
<p><img src="https://stu2b50.dev/images/get/the-hedge-fund747c5/wsb" alt=""></p>
<ol>
<li>Citadel does not own Melvin Capital Management - certainly Citadel Securities doesn't own Melvin, and while Citadel <em>did</em> bailout Melvin in return for non-controlling revenue shares, a) this is obviously a minority share b) it's noncontrolling</li>
<li>This is correct; Melvin did short GME, and no doubt lost bucketloads of money. But Citadel does not own Melvin. And it is unkown whether or not Citadel, the hedge fund, has short positions on Gamestop - ownership of Melvin and/or ownership of short positions themselves is the implied motive for Citadel.</li>
<li>Citadel(HF) does not own Robinhood. This is easily verifiable. Robinhood is currently owned in some unknown proportion by the founders, employees (via RSUs), and a16z, Ribbit, Sequoia among other VCs. </li>
<li>Since Citadel does not own Robinhood, they did not hault buy orders on Robinhood</li>
</ol>
<hr>

<p>I can't tell you if there is a wallstreet conspiracy to save the hedge funds that shorted $GME. I certainly can't say that it didn't happen. But at least get the facts right. It is possible that the establishment of Wall Street called up the Robinhood execs to stop buy orders to save face or to save the hedge funds still short on GME. I'm not saying it's not. But please for the love of god do not say "THE HEDGE FUND CITADEL PAYS FOR ROBINHOOD ORDER FLOW" like I saw earlier. That makes zero sense.</p>
<p>Additionally I'm sure Citadel #1 and Citadel #2 have friends in leadership. Maybe Citadel #1 called up Citadel #2 to pressure Robinhood. But I would note that no one actually knows if Citadel #1 has short positions on GME to begin with. And no, "my dad works at Citadel and he told me that Citadel shorted GME" on Twitter is not a source.</p>
<p>I think in these moments, Occam's razor and Hanlon's razor are good to keep in mind</p>

<p>the simplest explanation is usually the right one</p>

<p>On December 13, 2020, Reuters broke the story that the Treasury Department has been compromised by sophisticated hackers, and afterwords numerous organize confirm the story. Washington Post attributed hack to cozy bear (Russian SVR). To understand Solarwinds hack, first need to understand what <a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solarwinds</a> does.</p>

<h2><span id="What_Solarwinds_does"></span>What Solarwinds does?<span></span></h2>
<p>Solarwinds is a software company which has numerous software offering for systems managements. These software programs are primarily managed by IT professionals at large institutions.</p>
<h2><span id="What_Solarwinds_Oroin_NMS_does"></span>What Solarwinds Oroin NMS does?<span></span></h2>
<p>Orion<strong> NMS (Network Management Systems)</strong> is the most popular software of Solarwinds and has capabilities of managing and monitoring a wide variety of devices such as servers, desktop, laptop, network devices etc. </p>

<p>The Company has 300,000+ customers worldwide, including 425 of US Fortune 500 companies. </p>

<h2><span id="How_hacker_compromises_Solarwinds_systems_And_Why_Solarwinds_hack_spread_for_so_long_without_detection"></span>How hacker compromises Solarwinds systems? And Why Solarwinds hack spread for so long without detection?<span></span></h2>
<p>Since Solarwinds NMS has access to so many devices in an institution and so many institutions use Solarwinds NMS, it becomes a prime target of hackers.</p>
<p>NMS are run on two modes. First is monitoring and second is monitoring/managing. Many of the systems are configured to do both. So if NMS compromised, attacker can do what NMS can do. </p>
<p>According to SEC filling by Solarwinds, hackers infiltrated as early as March 2020, and It took almost 9 months to detect <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the first instance of hack</a>, so why it took so long to figure out even tough 425 out of Fortunes 500 companies were using it.</p>
<p>Hacker compromise build server of Solarwinds and added malware(named sunburst) to existing software during build process and signed with Solarwinds digital signature. As once software signed by official signature, many of the anti-malware and anti-virus software accept that software behavior as normal, As anti-malware and anti-virus companies don’t know Solarwinds signature has been compromised. This is still evolving situation and some argue only build process was compromise. (But anyhow digital signature became useless). </p>
<p>Sophistication does not stop here. Malware was written in away, so it will stay dormant for first 15 days or so anti-malware and anti-virus can’t associate changes in network pattern to change in Solarwinds software version.</p>
<p>Not just that, Hackers make sure that sunburst maleware’s outgoing traffic look very similar to typical Solarwinds traffic. It seems like the hackers’ goal was to stay in the infected systems as long as possible. </p>
<p>The story gets even crazy, before executing sunburst malware, hacker will make sure it is not private IP or Microsoft IP ranges as it seems like hackers were aware that Microsoft has capabilities to capture this kind of activity, so hackers make sure malware does not connect to Microsoft IP. Kudos to Microsoft. </p>

<p>Earlier, I had written about controversial court cases, such as the trials of George Zimmerman, Dominique Strauss Kahn &amp; the Duke Lacrosse Team. We discussed our <a rel="noopener" href="https://outlookzen.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/acknowledging-our-ignorance/" target="_blank">tendency to jump to conclusions</a> and assume what must have really happened, based on flimsy pieces of evidence and our own preconceived notions and biases. In truth, this isn’t isolated to sensational current events. This is endemic to the way we live our lives &amp; perceive the world every single day.</p>



<p>All too often, we see people who are so unwaveringly certain. Certain that their lifestyle &amp; way of doing things is best. Certain that their God is the one true God &amp; all others are heathens or infidels. Certain that their political beliefs are correct, and their opponents represent everything that is wrong with the country. Certain that they are right &amp; anyone who disagrees with them is wrong.</p>



<p>Personally, I find this certainty to be unbearably stifling. Even when I’m with like minded peers who subscribe to my political or lifestyle beliefs, I often find myself ill at ease with how certain they are of themselves, and how dismissive they are of anyone or anything that disagrees with their mental model of how the world works. Isn’t it possible to believe in something, while still holding reservations about the possibility of being wrong?</p>



<p>Hence why I found the <a rel="noopener" href="http://nyti.ms/1k1pB7c" target="_blank">following article so refreshing and insightful</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>“One aim of the physical sciences has been to give an actual picture of the material world. One achievement of physics in the 20th century has been to show that such an aim is unattainable.” For Dr. Bronowski, there was no absolute knowledge and anyone who claims it — whether a scientist, a politician or a religious believer — opens the door to tragedy. All scientific information is imperfect and we have to treat it with humility. Such, for him, was the human condition.</em></p><p><em>This is the condition for what we can know, but it is also, crucially, a moral lesson. It is the lesson of 20th-century painting from Cubism onwards, but also that of quantum physics. All we can do is to push deeper and deeper into better approximations of an ever-evasive reality. The goal of complete understanding seems to recede as we approach it.</em></p><p><em>There is no God’s eye view, Dr. Bronowski insisted, and the people who claim that there is and that they possess it are not just wrong, they are morally pernicious. Errors are inextricably bound up with pursuit of human knowledge, which requires not just mathematical calculation but insight, interpretation and a personal act of judgment for which we are responsible.</em></p><p><em>… the genesis of Werner Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle in the hugely creative milieu that surrounded the physicist Max Born in the 1920s. Dr. Bronowski insisted that the principle of uncertainty was a misnomer, because it gives the impression that in science (and outside of it) we are always uncertain. But this is wrong. Knowledge is precise, but that precision is confined within a certain toleration of uncertainty.</em></p><p><em>… Dr. Bronowski thought that the uncertainty principle should therefore be called the principle of tolerance. Pursuing knowledge means accepting uncertainty. Heisenberg’s principle has the consequence that no physical events can ultimately be described with absolute certainty or with “zero tolerance,” as it were. The more we know, the less certain we are.</em></p><p><em>In the everyday world, we do not just accept a lack of ultimate exactitude with a melancholic shrug, but we constantly employ such inexactitude in our relations with other people. Our relations with others also require a principle of tolerance. We encounter other people across a gray area of negotiation and approximation. Such is the business of listening and the back and forth of conversation and social interaction.</em></p><p><em>For Dr. Bronowski, the moral consequence of knowledge is that we must never judge others on the basis of some absolute, God-like conception of certainty. All knowledge, all information that passes between human beings, can be exchanged only within what we might call “a play of tolerance,” whether in science, literature, politics or religion. As he eloquently put it, “Human knowledge is personal and responsible, an unending adventure at the edge of uncertainty.”</em></p><p><em>The relationship between humans and nature and humans and other humans can take place only within a certain play of tolerance. Insisting on certainty, by contrast, leads ineluctably to arrogance and dogma based on ignorance.</em></p><p><em>At this point, in the final minutes of the show, the scene suddenly shifts to Auschwitz, where many members of Bronowski’s family were murdered… The play of tolerance opposes the principle of monstrous certainty that is endemic to fascism and, sadly, not just fascism but all the various faces of fundamentalism. When we think we have certainty, when we aspire to the knowledge of the gods, then Auschwitz can happen and can repeat itself. Arguably, it has repeated itself in the genocidal certainties of past decades.</em></p><p><em>The pursuit of scientific knowledge is as personal an act as lifting a paintbrush or writing a poem, and they are both profoundly human. If the human condition is defined by limitedness, then this is a glorious fact because it is a moral limitedness rooted in a faith in the power of the imagination, our sense of responsibility and our acceptance of our fallibility. We always have to acknowledge that we might be mistaken. When we forget that, then we forget ourselves and the worst can happen.</em></p></blockquote>



<hr>



<p>To me, the central message from above is one of humility, and admitting the fallibility of our knowledge. The truth is, we live in an extraordinarily complicated world, and we ourselves are such humble, small and flawed creatures in comparison with the size, breadth and depth of our universe. Any certainty that we may ever hold, reflects more on our conceit, than on the world we live in. No human knowledge is ever certain, not even scientific knowledge. For centuries, Newtonian laws of physics were extremely well tested and formed the cornerstone of science… But they too were proven wrong by Einstein’s &nbsp;theory of relativity.</p>



<p>Of course we should still act and make the best decisions possible in the face of limited knowledge, but we should be aware of the lack of certainty. For a patient with heart disease, getting open-heart surgery is the right decision to take. Not because of absolute certainty in its effectiveness, but because it’s reasonably well proven and better than the alternative of doing nothing. Even with something as small as driving to work, we have to accept that there is no certainty of us reaching there safely. You could meet with an accident and die any day. This is very unlikely since we’ve made this same drive thousands of times safely, but we still have to acknowledge its possibility.</p>



<p>Living under the false delusion of absolute certainty will lead one to drive recklessly and not pay close attention to danger signs. The belief in absolute certainty closes off our minds, and stops us from learning anything new. Only by acknowledging the fallibility of our knowledge can we avoid making catastrophic mistakes, correct our mistaken prejudices, and continue bettering ourselves.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <h2>Searching the web</h2>
        <p>"Searching" is the most common action performed on the internet everyday. Google alone receives <a href="https://ardorseo.com/blog/how-many-google-searches-per-day-2019/#targetText=This%20translates%20to%20over%2040%2C000,listed%20by%20Internet%20Live%20Stats.">40,000 search queries every second (3.5 billion searches per day on average)</a>. That is a <i>lot</i> of queries. That also means there is a great deal of user interaction taking place between what is essentially a single text input and a list of outputted data. So, why has barely any UI/UX improvements been introduced over the years? I find it difficult to assume that the current "search engine design" has achieved <i>perfection</i> since there are so many obvious flaws.</p>
        <p>Let's take a stab at enhancing this extremely important user interface and see if we can evolve the search engine experience.</p>
        <h2>Default search engine results (DuckDuckGo)</h2>
        <p>For our baseline example we will use the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> search engine. If you aren't currently using DDG as your default search engine, I recommend that you make the switch. Google has continually proven that they shouldn't be trusted with user data, nor do they have their customers' well being and privacy at the forefront of their priorities. I've <a href="https://bradleytaunt.com/stop-crawling-google/">talked about ditching Google in the past</a> if you're interested. &lt;/End rant&gt;</p>
        <p>This is what a default search result for the term "canada" returns:</p>
        <p><img src="https://uglyduck.ca/better-search-results/default-search-results.png" alt="Default Search Results">
        </p>
        <p>Overall the design is clean and focuses on exactly what the user cares about: the content. A quick, detailed pane is presented to the right of the top list results, giving the user an easy overview of the searched query. I have no real complaints about the visuals. The overall UX is a different story.</p>

        <h2>Respecting user limitations</h2>
        <p>Not everyone has unlimited data usage or fast internet. In fact, reliable internet is more of a first-world luxury that is often taken for granted. Many people (specifically those on restricted mobile plans or low-end, under-powered devices) can't afford to eat through their data caps when performing something as simple as an internet search. For some, these under-powered devices may be their only way to connect to the web. By forcing items like tracking scripts or injected advertisement media onto the users' devices, you're stealing away what little available data they have. You're also doing this while providing zero positive gain for the users themselves.</p>

        <h2>Introducing page size results</h2>
        <p>Why not give the user the ability to instantly know how much data each listing will consume <i>before</i> they commit to actually visiting that website? By introducing a simple toggle filter at the top of the search results (I would advocate to have this <i>active</i> by default) you give the user a quick-and-easy way to see each listing's total page size. Take a look at the concept of this idea below:</p>
        <p><img src="https://uglyduck.ca/better-search-results/page-size-results.png" alt="Page Size Search Results">
        </p>
        <p>In the top right section of each listing the user can now see how "heavy" each webpage item is. By displaying the page weight, users have a better understanding of which sites will be faster and easier on their data caps - based on a very simple addition.</p>
        <p>An indirect consequence (but overall a great bonus) of this page weight element being standard, is companies would be forced to review their current websites/apps, as to avoid being flagged.</p>
        <p><img src="https://uglyduck.ca/better-search-results/search-item-details.png" alt="Search Item Details">
        </p>
        <h3>• Page Size Indicator</h3>
        <p>This element would show the final size of the entire webpage the listing is linked to. Default styling would display this as a minimal, grey text item. Webpages with a total webpage size of <a href="https://www.machmetrics.com/speed-blog/website-size-the-average-web-page-size-is-more-than-2mb-twice-the-size-of-the-average-page-just-3-years-ago/">1MB or greater</a> would be styled in a way to warn the user of a large download requirement. (Light red background to attract immediate attention)</p>

        <h2>Scanning results</h2>
        <p>Having the ability to know the weight of a given listing is great, but what about privacy? Including an option to tell the user which listings will track, send your data to 3rd-party services, or display obnoxious ads should be more important than your data consumption. This can also be implemented with a simple UI:</p>
        <p><img src="https://uglyduck.ca/better-search-results/scan-results.png" alt="Scan Search Results">
        </p>
        <p><img src="https://uglyduck.ca/better-search-results/search-item-scan.png" alt="Search Item Scanned">
        </p>
        <h3>• Ads Indicator</h3>
        <p>This tag element is added to listings that contain certain flagged advertisement scripts (Google adsense, carbon ads, buysellads, etc.). Advertisements don't necessarily mean a <i>bad</i> experience, so their styling is designed as more informational.</p>
        <h3>• 3rd-Party Scripts Indicator</h3>
        <p>The tracking tag element is designed in a way to indicate a warning to the user. These scripts tend to ignore user privacy, so they have more importance to the user's security. These would include (but not be limited to) Google Analytics, Kissmetrics, Mixpanel, Chartbeat, etc. This element might also be a good way to "upsell" the user on using script blocking extensions like Ghostery or uBlock.</p>

        <h2>Companies reliant on advertisements</h2>
        <p>Won't companies dependent on embedded advertisements and tracking scripts push-back against this design concept? Probably.</p>
        <p>But too bad. My message to companies who rely on beefy ads and follower their users wherever they go, as a means to make a profit: <strong>Adapt or die.</strong></p>
        <p>Ruining your users' experience for the sake of monetizing your business is bad for said business in the long run. Personally, I believe it's border-line unethical. Your users never consent to these 3rd-party tracking scripts or give permission for you to force-download megabytes of data.</p> 
        <p>Stop feeding your customers garbage and you won't have to worry about more detailed search results. You'll be one of the <strong>good guys</strong> 👍. Figure out a way to make money without screwing over your users. It's just lazy to say "there is no other way" before even trying something else.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>Today I would like to write about something a little different, and which has
involved a little more original research on my part. In fact, for the most
part, this is research that I did several years ago, so I'm doing a bit more
digging as I write just to make sure I don't tell you anything that is entirely
outdated. However, what I am finding for the most part is that little has
changed, and that's kind of the point of this story: to talk about a weird
situation that has persisted for quite some years, and give my speculation as
to why.</p>
<p>Anyway, like all good long-form magazine pieces that extract some sort of human
story out of a strange financial scheme or whatever, this will start with a
small personal story of how I came to learn of the situation.</p>
<p>For some years I lived in the small town of Socorro, New Mexico, population of
about 10,000 and county seat of Socorro County, a rural county with a land area
a bit less than New Jersey but a population of only 17,000. A quick Google
search will give you a strong hint of why I lived there. Moreover, my
now-husband lived there for several years after I moved away, and so I
continued to make frequent visits until roughly 2018.</p>
<p>When I lived there and for a long time before, Socorro was home to two locally
operated radio stations: KYRN "Mine Country 102.1 FM", and KMXQ. KMXQ operated
on what I would call a rather unusual format. The station broadcast 24/7
classic rock, uninterrupted by a DJ or advertising. Even the station
identification was an absolutely minimal afterthought. It was not clear how
KMXQ, despite being ostensibly a commercial station, could make any money. It
did not appear that the station had any staff, and I knew a local resident who
had occasionally been contracted to perform work on the equipment.</p>
<p>So, the station had already been a bit of a mystery when, around 2017, it
changed to an even more unusual format: the buzz. Like a local version of some
Soviet numbers station, KMXQ broadcast a continuous, uninterrupted whining
tone. It was obvious that something in the broadcast chain had broken, which is
not in itself so unusual. What was more unusual is that this situation 
persisted for at least two weeks, and I believe it may have been up to a month.
My recollection is a bit hazy, and unfortunately while I found it amusing 
enough that every time I drove into Socorro I would tune my radio to see if
it was still going, I had not yet realized the situation was interesting enough
to take notes.</p>
<p>At some point someone went in and whacked something with a wrench or otherwise
made a repair and the aimless classic rock resumed. That's when I started
pulling license documents and unearthed a bit of a fun radio mystery. So, here
goes my history of Socorro's KMXQ, in which I find that it is just one example
of a larger phenomena of mysterious, pointless classic rock broadcast at low
power to small towns throughout the Southwest.</p>
<p>I am not sure when KMXQ was founded. The first mention I have found of the
station is in 1989, when it was apparently doing well, as the Albuquerque
Journal reports the Socorro-based KMXQ joining the Albuquerque metro market via
a translator on the Sandia crest. A translator in Truth or Consequences
(roughly speaking the next major stop south from Socorro) is also mentioned.
The format at this point in time was country, and there are scattered news
reports related to the station for the following decade.</p>
<p>In the year 2000, which is as far back as FCC's LMS takes me, KMXQ belonged to
a local Socorro resident (likely the original owner) who sold it to a small
Colorado radio operation called Roadrunner Radio. In 2002, Roadrunner Radio
sold the station to Lakeshore Media of Illinois. So far as I can tell, this was
all the normal life of a small-town radio station with low operating costs but
insufficient commercial potential to attract an iHeartMedia buyout.  Although
evidence is sparse, the country format seems to have been unchanged during this
time period, and the operators were (at least attempting to) fund the station
through advertising. Neither of these companies seem to have survived to the
present day, presumably victims of the great squeeze in the conventional
advertising industry and decreasing interest in radio.</p>
<p>Following the intrigue of this story, as it starts to get stranger, will
require some understanding of the licensure and regulation of commercial
radio stations in the United States. The radio spectrum in general, and
especially the broadcast FM spectrum, is a valuable shared resource. To avoid
waste of this limited total capacity, the FCC has a system of regulations which
is intended to ensure that radio stations make good use of the spectrum that
they have been allocated.</p>
<p>While the details can be quite complex, and go as far as the FCC specifically
granting radio stations permission to broadcast formats (e.g. genres of music)
only if that radio market is not already "well-served" in the requested format,
one of the simplest rules is that broadcast FM stations are required to, well,
broadcast. Failure to broadcast the licensed format for the licensed hours at
the licensed power is grounds for the FCC to revoke the station's license,
because they are failing to provide the service that they promised when they
were first granted the license. This should free up the frequency to be used by
another radio station that will offer a better service to the community.</p>
<p>At some point in 2005, Lakeshore Media requested from the FCC permission for
a Special Temporary Authority (STA) to operate the station at a transmit power
less than that specified on the license. Around a week later they informed the
FCC that they had returned to normal transmit power. This is very typical for
a radio station and especially a small one; if the main transmitter or antenna
malfunctions or is damaged the station often has an auxiliary transmitter and
antenna which are capable of a much lower power level (as low as 25 watts) for
emergency use. The station may switch to this low-power auxiliary transmitter
while making repairs, and while they must request permission from the FCC to
do so it's quite common for this to happen for short periods. Socorro is prone
to occasional severe thunderstorms with high wind and large hail, and this is
exactly the kind of thing that takes out radio antennas, requiring the use of
a temporary low-power antenna until replacement parts can be obtained.</p>
<p>Stick a pin in that, though: it is common for radio stations to reduce their
transmit power under an STA for short periods due to damage, malfunction, or
other transient problems with the equipment.</p>
<p>In 2009, Lakeshore Media sold KMXQ to Cochise Media Licenses, LLC of Wyoming.
It is not unusual for media companies to use a subsidiary to hold their radio
licenses which has a name alluding to that purpose, but nonetheless the name of
this entity may seem poignant later on.</p>
<p>Shortly after the purchase, Cochise filed an application for minor construction
related to the station. This application specifies a transmit power of 6kW from
56 meters above ground level. It is difficult to tell how much of a change this
represented from the previous station (if at all), but the application was most
likely filed due to replacement of equipment at the station.</p>
<p>When a radio station requests authorization for construction (whether a new
facility or modification of an existing one), the FCC requires that the station
report when construction is completed. This is somewhat amusingly referred to
as consummation of the construction. This is particularly important since it is
typical for the radio station to be off-air during the construction period,
which is normally not permitted. In general, a 90-day period is allowed from
the date of the construction application to complete work. A bit longer than 90
days later, though, Cochise filed with the FCC a request to extend the
consummation deadline by a further 90 days. About 90 days after that, Cochise
reported that construction was complete (consummated).</p>
<p>On the very same day, Cochise filed an application for an STA permitting the
station to go silent. This application was backdated (not entirely unusual
on its own) such that the period of silence started immediately at the
consummation of construction. The reason for the silence is listed as
"Financing" and the justification given is only that the licensee has requested
silence for the station related to the construction application.</p>
<p>The FCC issued the STA with a note that, as a matter of statute, the station
can only remain silent for 180 days or the license will be forfeited. At this
point, between the station evidently running over its construction timeline
and then immediately filing to remain silent and the FCC taking some time to
respond, 9 months have elapsed since the purchase, during which the station
was presumably inoperative.</p>
<p>Nearly a year passes. In theory the FCC would have terminated the license at
180 days but it is clear from other cases that this often does not happen,
seemingly because the FCC does not necessarily actively follow up on these
STAs.</p>
<p>In March 2011, Cochise files for an STA to operate using a modified antenna
system. The specifications are listed as 6 meters above ground at 65 watts
transmit power. They have purchased a new, smaller antenna and mounted it near
the bottom of the (fully owned) tower at the station's small headquarters.
Shortly after this filing, they report that they have resumed operations.</p>
<p>In September 2011, two years after the purchase, Cochise files another request
to extend the STA to use the lower antenna and power. Keep in mind that they
had reported completion of the construction of the 6kW, 56m-high antenna 18
months prior, so while they claim to have completed this system, in over a year
they have not used it.</p>
<p>In April 2012, two and a half years after purchase, Cochise requests a further
STA to make use of the licensed antenna, but at a …</p></article></div>

<p>In the early 2000s, dramatic shifts in radio spectrum allocation for mobile data applications, combined with advances in radio transmission and receiving prompted some networking engineers to propose a radical rethink of radio.</p>
<p>Our current spectrum management assumes that senders and receivers have characteristics that are fixed at the point of manufacture, determined by things like the shape of an antenna and the type of quartz crystal used as an oscillator.</p>
<p>But software-defined radios (SDRs) and software-tunable phased-array antennas make those assumptions obsolete. Today, a radio can be a commodity computer that can sense other devices' RF use and transmit and receive on multiple frequencies to share the airwaves.</p>
<p>This was dubbed "cognitive radio" and its proponents imagined a world where the exclusive spectrum allocations handed out to telcos, broadcasters and other powerful entities would be replaced by a cooperative spectrum model.</p>
<p>Two radios that needed to talk to one another might make contact in one band, switch to another, or ask a third receiver to relay messages for them, using just enough power to reach one another, avoiding the bands that were already in use.</p>
<p>These proposals – which would vastly increase wireless data capacity – were met with fierce resistance, from incumbent licensors, from spectrum speculators, and from HAMs, who are brilliant but also tend to be conservative about spectrum allocation.</p>
<p>These debates inevitably ran up against a hard limit: no one had ever built any kind of serious cognitive radio network. Just trying it would likely trigger massive, brutal FCC enforcement action, as it would trample all that exclusive spectrum.</p>
<p>But that didn't cool the ardor of cognitive radio's fiercest proponents. People like Dwayne Hendricks roamed the world, looking for spectrum havens – places where cognitive radio could be tried. The King of Tonga greenlit one project!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/2002/01/hendricks/">https://www.wired.com/2002/01/hendricks/</a></p>
<p>But the most promising on-shore spectrum laboratories were First Nations territories – sovereign nations whose treaties predated any understanding of electromagnetic spectrum and thus did not cede spectrum rights to settler colonial powers.</p>
<p>Though the legal theory was as untested as the technical one, some First Nations bands dallied with it, wondering if they leverage their position to race past the hidebound rules in the US and Canada to bring money and connectivity to their communities.</p>
<p>I wrote a short story about this in 2002, "Liberation Spectrum," which Salon published in 2003:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.salon.com/2003/01/16/liberation_spectrum/">https://www.salon.com/2003/01/16/liberation_spectrum/</a></p>
<p>Making sovereign spectrum policy is one of the better interpretations of treaty law; it has the potential to be as lucrative as, say, casinos – and could also bridge the digital divide for First Nations communities.</p>
<p>Certainly, it's a better idea than the pharma trolls who briefly experimented with transfering patent portfolios to sovereign bands in the hopes of of muddying the jurisdictional questions so that their profiteering would be harder to shut down.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/09/how-a-native-american-tribe-ended-up-owning-six-key-patents-on-an-eye-drug/">https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/09/how-a-native-american-tribe-ended-up-owning-six-key-patents-on-an-eye-drug/</a></p>
<p>Thankfully, that plan petered out. Likewise, First Nations experiments with spectrum policy seem also to have lost momentum, since then – at least, none have crossed my radar.</p>
<p>Until now.</p>
<p>On Jan 13, the Mexican Supreme Court found in favor of Indigenous Community Telecommunications (TIC), unanimously finding that community groups like TIC were entitled to free "social use" spectrum licenses.</p>
<p><a href="https://globalvoices.org/2021/01/27/indigenous-led-telecommunications-organization-wins-historic-legal-battle-in-mexico/">https://globalvoices.org/2021/01/27/indigenous-led-telecommunications-organization-wins-historic-legal-battle-in-mexico/</a></p>
<p>The decision did not rely on treaty rights, but rather upon a carve out in Mexican spectrum policy that gives free spectrum to community groups. TIC is an incredibly effective network of 80 towns in 18 Indigenous communities operating voice and data mobile networks.</p>
<p>Since 2018, TIC has been under threat, with the regulator demanding 1m pesos for continued access to spectrum; a demand the Supreme Court unanimously voided.</p>
<p>The decision will ease expansions of TIC's service into the vast majority of Indigenous communities that lack reliable mobile service.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ift.org.mx/sites/default/files/reporte-coberturapueblosindigenas_finalpublicar.pdf">http://www.ift.org.mx/sites/default/files/reporte-coberturapueblosindigenas_finalpublicar.pdf</a></p>
<p>And it also allows for services beyond telephony. As TIC's Erick Huerta says, this paves the way for other Indigenous media being exempted from regulatory barriers.</p>

<p>A new research report from Sean O'Brien and Expressvpn in honor Data Privacy Day reveals the incredible extent of commercial location tracking hidden in everyday apps.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.expressvpn.com/digital-security-lab/investigation-xoth">https://www.expressvpn.com/digital-security-lab/investigation-xoth</a></p>
<p>App vendors use free software development kits (SDKs) to build their products, not realizing (or not caring) that the SDKs come from commercial surveillance companies that harvest all their users' data and sell it in hidden, sprawling commercial markets.</p>
<p>That's how the US military was able to buy location data on users of a Muslim prayer app: the app was built with one of these surveillance SDKs, so the data was extracted, packaged and sold on the cheap to the Pentagon.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqm5x/us-military-location-data-xmode-locate-x">https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqm5x/us-military-location-data-xmode-locate-x</a></p>
<p>The survey encompasses 450 apps with 1.7b downloads. It found that messenger apps (including many masquerading as Wechat, FB Messenger, and Telegram) were rife with location tracking. Other major offenders include dating and social apps.</p>
<p>The sleaziest SDK vendors are also the most prolific. X-Mode (a company that is theoretically banned from app stores) is in 44% of the analyzed apps. X-Mode is especially prevalent in religious apps, especially Islamic ones.</p>
<p>The researchers did me the honor of naming their report Project Xoth – Xoth is the name of one of the sinister commercial surveillance companies in Attack Surface, the third Little Brother book.</p>

<p>There is no shortage of takes about what's going on with Gamestop (and other surging stocks), Robinhood and Reddit's r/wallstreetbets, many of them contradictory – at least on the face of them. But I think it's possible for most of these takes to be right. Here's how.</p>
<p>First you need to understand the underlying mechanics of the story. Stock markets are fundamentally a way of making bets, including bets on the outcome of other peoples' bets, and bets on the outcomes of <em>those</em> bets.</p>
<p>All this complexity creates lots of exploitable opportunities. Some of these opportunities are considered legitimate and are given respectable names like "arbitrage." Others are considered illegitimate, and are called disreputable things like "stock manipulation."</p>
<p>A hypothetical Martian observing all this through a telescope could not tell you which kinds of bets were honest and which were dishonest, because the difference isn't about any objective standard, but rather, about power.</p>
<p>The strategies of powerful people are legit, while the strategies of their would-be dethroners are not legit. Sometimes, even outright frauds are OK if they're done by people with enough power.</p>
<p>If your scam pays out quickly enough, you can sometimes parlay the resulting cash into retrospective legitimization, so even the strategies of the out-group can end up being retconned as legit, if they're successful enough.</p>
<p>That's why Amway isn't illegal: Betsy DeVos's father-in-law was simultaneously the boss of Amway and head of the US Chamber of Commerce, and Gerry Ford was his Congressman, who was then elevated to president in time to legalize its business model.</p>
<p>To understand the Gamestop rise, you have to understand a couple of different kinds of bets.</p>
<p>"Shorting": this is a bet that a stock will go down. There's a complicated backstory to how you make this bet, but it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>The thing to know here is that shorting a stock can make you rich…if the stock goes down. But if the stock goes up, you lose money. There's not really any limit to how much you can lose here.</p>
<p>Every time the stock goes up, the shorts have to pony up more money to keep their bet alive (in the hopes that it will go down again later), or they have to take their losses, pay out the winner of the bet and surrender any chance of winning later.</p>
<p>Shorting isn't just a bet on someone else's failure – it's a way to fund bullshit-detection. If you know (or suspect) that a company is lying about its prospects, you can bet against it.</p>
<p>Shorts fund a lot of research into defective products and scammy businesses, because they win when bad companies are exposed and their stocks go down. Some of the scary security research you read about bad IoT software is funded by shorts.</p>
<p>That's why habitual bullshitters like Elon Musk <em>hate</em> shorts. Musk leads a cult of credulous worshippers who buy whatever he's selling. Shorts make bets that Musk's cultists will get deprogrammed. Musk uses this to sharpen his cultists' resolve: "they want us to fail!"</p>
<p>"Options": many different bets get lumped in as "options" but for the purposes of this discussion, buying an option means buying the right to buy stocks later. The people who sell you the option usually go out and buy the stock right away so they'll have it to sell.</p>
<p>"Front-running": Cheating. Front-runners insert themselves into transactions by spying. If I know that Alice is buying a bunch …</p></div></article></div>

<p><i>January 28, 2021</i></p>


<p>
I sometimes get asked whether it makes sense to implement <i>XYZ</i> in C,
especially compared to using some language that is more advanced
(C++, Julia, Python, Haskell or Rust) or perfect (Lisp).
</p>

<p>
I suspect that a lot of people are a bit intimidated by C and believe that
it requires some kind of superhuman hacker ability to wield.
That's at least how I felt about C
before I started really using it.
Other people believe that C is a horrible
language that inherently produces defective software
and which should be cast back into the abysses of UNIX from whence it came
(they are not necessarily wrong).
I personally think that C's simplicity
is an advantage that
often outweighs its disadvantages,
but there are clearly domains where C is a bad choice.
In domains where C works well, there are also good
alternatives, and choosing C then just comes
down to personal preference.
</p>

<p>
In this post, I will attempt to answer why you should or shouldn't use C,
and I will give some general advice that may be helpful if you end up using C.
This is based on my own experience developing
mathematical software in C (mainly <a href="https://flintlib.org/">Flint</a>,
<a href="https://arblib.org/">Arb</a> and <a href="https://fredrikj.net/calcium/">Calcium</a>), in an academic setting.
This experience will not necessarily transfer well to other settings.
</p>

<h2>Why you should use C</h2>

<p>Why should you write your next library
in C, or perhaps contribute to some existing C library?
I will offer four simple arguments.</p>

<h3>Availability</h3>

<p>
Reason number one is that C is stable, universally supported,
and has reliable tooling.
Your plain C library will compile and run
almost anywhere, can be developed anywhere,
and will require minimal dependencies. Users of virtually
any other programming language can easily interface with your code
through their language's C foreign function interface,
at least if you take basic precautions to design a decent external API.
Not only will your C library run anywhere
<i>right now</i>; it will still run 20 years from now,
and if you had a time machine, probably 20 years ago too.
</p>

<h3>Speed</h3>

<p>
Reason number two is that it will run very, very fast.
I don't just mean that
benchmark loops will
go <i>VROOOM</i>; your software will also start up instantly
(no need to load a bloated dynamic runtime or JIT-compile code),
and there will be no hidden overhead for things like automatic
garbage collection
(well-written C code spends a negligible fraction of its overall
execution time doing allocations and deallocations,
precisely at the points in time where they are needed).
This is, of course, <i>if you know what you are doing</i>.
Writing efficient C, while not exactly rocket surgery, does require
proficiency with the language and a solid understanding
of fundamental algorithms and data structures.
</p>

<h3>Readability</h3>

<p>Reason number three is that you will be able to read your
own code, and others will incidentally be able to read it too.
Some people are going to disagree with me here, arguing that higher
level languages are better for readibility.
That is trivially true in the sense that higher level languages
provide abstractions that allow expressing complex ideas more
succinctly.
A simple example is providing operator overloading so that you
can write <tt>a + b * c</tt> instead of something like <tt>add(a, mul(b, c))</tt>,
or in C, often something even more verbose like the following typical <a href="https://gmplib.org/">GMP</a> snippet:
</p>

<pre>mpz_t tmp;
mpz_init(tmp);
mpz_mul(tmp, b, c);
mpz_add(a, a, tmp);
mpz_clear(tmp);
</pre>

<p>This
would seem like an especially important point for mathematical software.
However, hiding details can also
hide useful information.
In an object-oriented, memory-managed,
operator-overloaded language, information that may be
hidden by the infix arithmetic notation includes
where and how memory is allocated;
how methods are resolved and how coercions are made
when the operands have different types
or when class hierarchies are involved;
what algorithms are used to perform the arithmetic operations
(irrelevant for machine integers, but potentially very important
details if you are multiplying huge matrices).
The infix notation is usually good for understanding the intent
of the code, but something more verbose can be
better for reasoning about performance
and for dealing with cracks in the abstractions.
Put concisely, C is good for making implementation details explicit
when implementation details matter.
</p>

<p>Viewed in this light, C's omission of certain conveniences
such as namespaces, overloading and generics is actually a feature,
not a bug.
Figuring out what any given piece of C code does tends to be
a straightforward process because of, and not despite, the fact
that it is verbose: everything that happens is explicit and functions and types can only have a
single definition which is easy to grep for.
I can't recall ever really having trouble diving into someone else's C code
or reading C code that I wrote a long time ago.
The same can't be said for Python, for example, where it can be
a real struggle to understand which method on which class gets called and how
and when and in what context.
Granted, you <i>can</i> obfuscate C code by abusing macros, doing
complicated runtime generics, or using cryptic names,
but even something like the rather dense
and idiosyncratic <a href="https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/">Pari/GP</a>
codebase is penetrable after a short familiarization process.
</p>

<h3>Educational value</h3>

<p>
Reason number four is that you will learn a lot in the process of writing C.
Implementing algorithms in C instead of a higher-level language
can lead to a deeper understanding since you have
to do more of the groundwork yourself. You will also probably have to
think things through more carefully; when I write Python, I can often
get away with implementing something half-broken and fixing it piecemeal,
but C more often forces me to be correct up-front.
</p>

<h2>Why you shouldn't use C</h2>

<p>Now on to the far more interesting case <i>against</i> C,
or rather, a fair and balanced evaluation of C's weaknesses.</p>

<h3>Mathematical understanding</h3>

<p>
Since we are talking about <i>mathematical</i> software, it is likely
that implementing <i>XYZ</i> actually involves solving two problems: understanding the
mathematics of <i>XYZ</i>, and translating that understanding
to concrete algorithms and code. If you don't understand the mathematics,
you might be better off exploring the problem
using a high-level language or a computer algebra system
and postponing a C implementation (if you need it) until
your mathematical understanding has crystallized.
If you decide to start a C project right away
to figure out the mathematics in parallel with the software development,
you will probably still want to use
another language for experimentation (more on this later).
Be prepared to continuously reevaluate your assumptions, and
expect having to rewrite code from scratch more than once.
</p>

<h3>Portability and deployment</h3>

<p>The following comments mainly apply to starting a new project
intended to be used by other people.</p>

<p>
In practice, the claims about C's amazing portability are somewhat
exaggerated.
As a C library maintainer,
you will have a lot of fun gradually discovering
new inconsistencies in build systems and standard library implementations
between different operating systems and hardware configurations.
You will probably run into the occasional rare compiler bug (though C might be
one of the better languages in this regard).
Over time, your header files will probably accumulate hundreds
of <tt>#ifdef</tt>s intended to work around compatibility problems
that may or may not still exist.</p>

<p>The large majority of your prospective users will probably
be unable or unwilling to
build and install your library from source, so
you will either have to distribute binaries yourself or
rely on distribution via third-party
package repositories such as those of the major Linux distributions.
In the interest of stability
or because of a lack of manpower,
such repositories typically keep software 1-10 years out of date.
(Yes, I once found <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a>'s default Ubuntu configuration sporting a nearly 10 years old
Flint-1.6.)
In other words, you can't count on users having access to the latest features
and bugfixes
in your library, and it goes without saying that you should work
very hard to preserve backward compatibility.
I suppose this lag in deployment has one advantage for reproducible research: if
you submit a journal paper based on the cutting edge version of your software,
readers will probably still have access to that version in Debian LTS
by the time the publishing process completes three years later
(hi, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/journal/toms">ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software</a>).</p>

<p>
A good idea for widespread deployment is to get your mathematical library into
<a href="https://www.sagemath.org/">SageMath</a>.
SageMath is maintained by a large community
and tested on many platforms, and packages in SageMath are usually only several months out of date.
</p>

<p>Deploying software written in more modern programming languages is
typically easier since they have more sane build processes
and standard libraries that eliminate most of C's platform-dependent
headaches.
Nowadays many languages also have their own easy-to-use packaging systems
and centralized package repositories.
In practice, the best languages for portability and easy distribution
right now are probably (1) JavaScript (in the browser), and (2) Python.
Julia is not far behind, and in many respects better designed than Python,
but Python currently has the benefit of being preinstalled on many systems.
All of this being said,
<a href="https://emscripten.org/">Emscripten</a> is a promising
alternative distribution method for C code which may change the equation,
especially if you think a browser-based interface makes more
sense than linking together libraries and running code
in the terminal in the traditional way.
</p>

<h3>Safety</h3>

<p>
C has a reputation of leading to buggy, crash-prone software
and disastrous security vulnerabilities.
Commonly criticized aspects of C include its
manual memory management, weak type system, and
deviously undefined or implementation-defined semantics.
This reputation is generally deserved,
though in C's defense, I think the problems often</p></div></div>

<h4><em>29.01.2021</em></h4>
<p>After recent <a href="https://www.sudo.ws/alerts/unescape_overflow.html">sudo vulnerability</a>
I was left wondering with obvious question: how such things could be unnoticed for almost 10 years?
Are they are really so hard to find, unlikely to be found by fuzzing, or just nobody attempted it?</p>
<p>I was curious whether this bug could have been discovered in reasonable time
using well-known <a href="https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/">afl</a> fuzzer.</p>
<p>First, obviously sudo is setuid binary. Running potentially bugged
binaries with random input as root isn’t safest idea. In order to avoid any potential
accidental system damage, I set up fresh virtual machine for this purpose.
I picked sudo 1.9.5.p1 for this test. afl is designed to generate output into file
or stdout, but we want to fuzz command line arguments. So we need to patch sudo ourselves
to ignore real argv and load it from stdin instead.</p>
<p>afl source helpfully provides appropiate function in <code>argv-fuzz-inl.h</code>, though author himself <a href="https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/afl-users/c/ZBWq0LdHBzw/m/zBlo7q9LBAAJ">isn’t so sure about usefulness of this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AFL doesn’t support argv
fuzzing, because TBH, it’s just not horribly useful in practice. There
is an example in experimental/argv_fuzzing/ showing how to do it in a
general case if you really want to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well.. does it? Let’s see.</p>
<p>Example supplied by <code>argv-fuzz-inl.h</code> reads NUL-separated arguments from stdin.
Note that sudo provides both <code>sudo</code> and <code>sudoedit</code> utilities in single binary,
so to test both we need to expose to fuzzer <code>argv[0]</code> as well. Code in
<code>argv-fuzz-inl.h</code> doesn’t do this, so it needs to be fixed:</p>
<pre><code>  int   rc  = 0; /* start at argv[0] */
</code></pre>
<p>In sudo itself patch is straightforward, just wire AFL_INIT_ARGV at the beginning of main:</p>

<p>Quick test shows that sudo/sudoedit selection doesn’t work correctly from testcases passed

<p>Sure enough, this is crash exploiting <code>sudoedit -s</code>. Given I ran 4 instances in parallel,
answer to the question from title is: around 2 hours of CPU time.</p>
<p>Yep. 2 hours of CPU time is enough to find critical security bug in widely used setuid utility.</p>
<p>Does nobody fuzzed sudo in the last decade, or, maybe sudo was tested but sudoedit was forgotten?
(honestly, before this I didn’t know that sudoedit existed). I guess the conclusion is that there still are serious bugs in widely used utilities that can be found by quick fuzzer run.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-to-python-package-managers"><a href="#introduction-to-python-package-managers" aria-label="introduction to python package managers permalink"></a>Introduction to Python Package Managers</h2>
<p>Currently, the most popular package manager in Python is Pip, which was introduced after Python 2.7.9. Before Pip, the predominant tool for package management was <code>disutils</code> or its third-party extension, <code>easy_install</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at all of these one by one and start with explaining what a package is here. In Python, a package is defined as a module that contains other modules or packages. These are the packages you import in your Python code. However, these are not the packages that are being discussed here. </p>
<p>The packages being mentioned here are the Distribution Packages, which are versioned archive files that contain modules, packages and other files that are important for the distribution of a particular release. </p>
<p>These archive files are what the users and you download when you install a package using Pip or any of the other package managers. Creating distributions is how you allow users to use your Python projects. </p>
<p>In this tutorial, you’ll first learn about the tools that are available to create Python distributions. Then you’ll learn about the tools you can use to install these distributions. In short, you’ll learn everything about maintaining Python packages that you’ll come across while working as a Data Scientist. </p>
<p>To start off this tutorial, you will begin with installing Python on your system, then you will learn about Python Package Index and discover more about disutils and how you can use it to register and upload your packages. Next up, you will learn about Setuptools and Easy Install, which is a third-party application that uses Setuptools. </p>
<p>You will finally learn about Pip and finally, a little bit about Conda, which comes pre-installed with Anaconda. Conda is much more powerful than Pip since it supports environment and package management, allowing you to create and delete environments. You can learn about how to install Anaconda from here.</p>
<h2 id="check-for-python"><a href="#check-for-python" aria-label="check for python permalink"></a>Check for Python</h2>
<p>Before proceeding with package management. The first step is to check whether you have Python installed on your system. Checking this is easy but depends on how you have installed Python. </p>
<p>If you installed Anaconda on Windows, then search for <code>Anaconda Prompt</code> in the Windows search and open the command prompt. In there, just type: </p>

<p>If you had installed and configured everything correctly, you should get the version of Python installed as output: </p>

<p>Otherwise, if you’re running the command on a command prompt or terminal without installing Python then you’ll get something like: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>Traceback <span>(</span>most recent call last<span>)</span><span>:</span>
  File <span>"&lt;stdin&gt;"</span><span>,</span> line <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>in</span> <span>&lt;</span>module<span>&gt;</span>
NameError<span>:</span> name <span>'python'</span> <span>is</span> <span>not</span> defined</code></pre></div>
<p>If you’re using an interactive notebook like Jupyter to use Python then you can use the same command with an exclamation mark at the start to check the version of Python installed on your system. </p>

<p>You’ll get the version of Python installed as an output, similar to how it ran on the anaconda prompt. The figure one shows the output in case of a Jupyter Notebook.</p>
<p><img src="https://nickmccullum.com/images/blog/history-python-package-managers/jupyter.png" alt="Testing Your Python version in a Jupyter Notebook"></p>
<p>Fig 1: Jupyter Notebook Output</p>
<h2 id="python-package-index-pypi"><a href="#python-package-index-pypi" aria-label="python package index pypi permalink"></a>Python Package Index (PyPi)</h2>
<p>The Python Package Index (PyPi) is basically a huge third-party repository for Python packages. It is also known as the Cheese Shop and holds packages in the form of archives called sdists (source distributions) or alternatively in the form of precompiled Wheels. </p>
<p>PyPi allows you to version your Python package distribution, allowing you to update the repository as much as you would like. Anytime you update the metadata, a new version is updated on the PyPi repository. </p>
<p>The end user can search for relevant packages via keywords or the metadata of the packages. Thus, the PyPi repository acts like an index, which stores more than 113,000 Python packages. </p>
<p>PyPi is the repository that Pip searches through when you try to install a package using Pip or easy_install. It is an efficient distribution channel that even a novice developer can use to share their Python projects.</p>
<h2 id="disutils"><a href="#disutils" aria-label="disutils permalink"></a>Disutils</h2>
<p>Disutils is the standard tool for packaging in Python, it was developed by the core team and is included in standard Python libraries. It has two main commands for packaging and uploading data to PyPi. </p>
<p>The <code>register</code> command is used for sending metadata to PyPi while the <code>upload</code> command is used for uploading the submitted distribution files. </p>
<p>This tutorial will not be getting into details of how to package your Python project and upload it on PyPi. If you want to learn about how you can upload your Python project using disutils, read the official guide from <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.3/distutils/packageindex.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>While disutils allows you to package your Python projects, it only offers very limited features. Disutils was built by the Python core team and only implements the core standards and the minimal necessary compilation. </p>
<p>For more advanced and useful features, there is setuptools, which offers extended compiler, package format and other support to effectively package Python projects. Since setuptools is a third party package, it does not come pre-installed with a Python library. </p>
<p>This tutorial will not discuss how to package Python projects with setuptools. To learn about using setuptools, you can follow this <a href="https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#developer-s-guide">developers guide</a> to using setuptools. The guide mentions all the important commands and keywords you will need to know to start using setuptools. </p>
<h3 id="easy-install"><a href="#easy-install" aria-label="easy install permalink"></a>Easy Install</h3>
<p>Before there was Pip, there was easy install, which was also a package manager for Python. Easy install allows for automatic downloads, builds, installs and updates for Python packages. </p>
<p>Using easy install was quite similar to Pip, you had to provide the URL, filename or PyPi project name to get the designated Python package. After you have entered the appropriate package name, easy install will try to get the latest available version of Python package for you. </p>
<p>Easy install recognizes files with extensions of .zip, .tar.bz2, .tar.gz and a few others. It also supports the already built .egg and .win2.exe distributions that are built using disutils.</p>
<p>Let’s highlight some of the basic commands of easy install. You can install a Python package by using the following easy install command: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>easy_install package_name</code></pre></div>
<p>This is how you can install a Python package if you know its URL and package name: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>easy_install <span>-</span>f URL package_name</code></pre></div>
<p> Upgrading an installed package is pretty simple with easy install: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>easy_install <span>-</span><span>-</span>upgrade package_name</code></pre></div>
<p>If you want to install a specific version of the package, you can do so by including the version name: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>easy_install ‘package_name<span>==</span><span>1.3</span><span>.2</span>’</code></pre></div>
<p>You can revert back to a previous version of a package by entering the following command: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>easy_install package_name<span>==</span><span>=</span><span>1.2</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To uninstall a package, you use the following command to remove all references to that package: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>easy_install <span>-</span>m package_name</code></pre></div>
<p>After running the command, you can manually remove the .egg and any other associated files from your system. </p>
<p>To learn more about easy install and how you can easily manage your Python packages, head to the official documentation <a href="https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/easy_install.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="pip"><a href="#pip" aria-label="pip permalink"></a>Pip</h2>
<p>Pip installs packages or Pip as it is commonly known is the most well-known Python package manager. It enables for convenient installation and maintenance of Python packages found in the Python Package Index (PyPi). </p>
<p>Python versions later than 2.7.9 come with a pre-installed pip. It was built on setuptools as well and was released in 2008 as a direct replacement of easy installs. One notable feature of pip when it was released was that it did not install packages as eggs, rather installed them through requirement files, allowing users to conveniently replicate environments. You can read more about the difference between pip and easy tools <a href="https://packaging.python.org/discussions/pip-vs-easy-install/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Since pip was built to replace easy tools, most of the pip commands are very similar to easy installs. Let’s check some of the most common pip commands. </p>
<p>Here’s how you can install the latest version of a package using pip: </p>

<p>If you want to install a specific version of the package, you can do so by including the version name: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>pip install ‘package_name<span>==</span><span>1.3</span><span>.2</span>’</code></pre></div>
<p>You can easily upgrade a package using pip: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>pip install <span>-</span><span>-</span>upgrade package_name</code></pre></div>
<p>To uninstall a package:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>pip uninstall package_name</code></pre></div>
<p>A great feature of pip is that it supports the installation of packages by using a <code>requirements.txt</code> file. The text files include a list of packages and their version numbers required to run the project. </p>
<p>Here’s a sample <code>requirements.txt</code> file, which installs some machine learning related packages: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>tensorflow<span>==</span><span>1.7</span>

scipy

scikit<span>-</span>learn

opencv<span>-</span>python</code></pre></div>
<p>Here’s how you can run the requirements file to install all of these packages: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>pip install <span>-</span>r requirements<span>.</span>txt</code></pre></div>
<p>To learn more about requirements files, read <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide/#requirements-files">this</a> official guide.</p>
<h3 id="conda"><a href="#conda" aria-label="conda permalink"></a>Conda</h3>
<p>Conda is included when you install Anaconda, which is a free and open source distribution of Python. Conda allows you to install packages and manage environments as well. It comes with a default environment <code>base</code>, which is activated whenever you use Python in Anaconda. </p>
<p>It is advised that you do not use the base environment and create your own to isolate your Python projects. This tutorial is just giving an honorary mention to Conda, as it is the leading Python package manager. There is a lot more to it and you can learn it from the official Conda <a href="https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/getting-started.html#managing-environments">tutorial</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/LLVM_Logo.svg" alt="LLVM"></p>
<center><small><small>This dragon image is owned by Apple Inc.</small></small></center>
<p>The Moritz Systems team has started a new contract on LLDB FreeBSD CPU target support and userland debugging improvements.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://lldb.llvm.org/">LLDB project</a> builds on libraries provided by
<a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> and <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">Clang</a> to provide a great
modern debugger. It uses the Clang ASTs and expression parser, LLVM JIT,
LLVM disassembler, etc so that it provides an experience that “just works”.
It is also blazing fast and more permissively licensed than GDB, the GNU Debugger.</p>
<p>LLDB is the default debugger in Xcode on macOS and supports debugging C,
Objective-C and C++ on the desktop and iOS devices and simulator.</p>
<p>FreeBSD includes LLDB, the debugger in the LLVM family, in the base
system. At present it has some limitations in comparison with the GNU
GDB debugger, and does not yet provide a complete replacement. It
relies on an obsolete plugin model in LLDB that causes growing
technical debt. This project aims to bring LLDB closer to a fully
featured replacement for GDB, and therefore for FreeBSD to feature a
modern debugger for software developers.</p>
<p>The legacy monolithic target support, still in use in non-x86 targets, executed the frontend and backend of the debugger
in the same process space. The modern LLDB
plugin approach, used on other supported targets, executes the
target process under a separate lldb-server process. This improves
reliability and simplifies the process / thread model in LLDB itself.
In addition, remote and local debugging will both be performed using
the same approach.</p>
<p>First, we are going to work on enhancing the FreeBSD support in LLDB, reusing the prior art already done for
FreeBSD LLDB/x86 and expanding it to other CPUs. We are going to switch all the CPUs to the new remote process
plugin framework and remove the old native-debugging process plugin altogether. Once the port is complete, we
would like to focus on reiterating all LLDB tests on ARM64 addressing the detected bugs as time permits, and
marking non-trivial issues as known failures. The verification of the remaining CPUs and the new remote process
plugin is expected to be deferred to the user community.</p>
<p>Next, we plan to implement the support for follow-fork and follow-vfork operations on par with the GNU GDB
support and cover this functionality with LLDB regression tests. We anticipate that we could implement follow-spawn
in one go, featuring enhanced support for tracing process events on NetBSD as well.</p>
<p>Next, we plan to implement the SaveCore functionality for FreeBSD, allowing users to create core dump files on
demand and enhance the regression testing of core files in LLDB, validating that they are operational on cross-OS and
cross-ABI basis.</p>
<p>Finally, we intend to update the FreeBSD manual to update it for the improved LLDB support.</p>
<p>The Project Schedule is divided into four milestones, each taking
approximately one month:</p>
<ul>
<li>M1 Switch all the non-x86 CPUs to the LLDB FreeBSD Remote-Process-Plugin</li>
<li>M2 Iteration over regression tests on ARM64 and fixing known bugs, marking the non-trivial ones for future work. Remove the old local-only Process-Plugin.</li>
<li>M3 Implement follow-fork and follow-vfork operations on par with the GNU GDB support. Cover the functionality with LLDB regression tests.</li>
<li>M4 Implement SaveCore functionality for FreeBSD and enhance the regression testing of core files in LLDB. Update the FreeBSD manual.</li>
</ul>
<p>This work is sponsored by <a href="https://www.freebsdfoundation.org/">The FreeBSD Foundation</a>.</p>

      <p><span>Robinhood has become a central player in the story of r/wallstreetbets and the rise of “meme stocks” like </span><a href="https://www.businessofbusiness.com/articles/gamestop-stock-rally-wallstreetbets-reddit/"><span>GameStop</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.businessofbusiness.com/articles/wallstreetbets-reddit-amc-gme-stock-robinhood/"><span>AMC</span></a><span>. If you’ve been online this week, you know that a group of Reddit users turned amateur traders coordinated on social media to explode the share prices of low-valued companies, losing billions for hedge funds who were profiting off betting against them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Wallstreetbets largely made their investments through apps like Robinhood, TDAmeritrade and CashApp. GameStop and AMC’s share prices sunk this morning as Robinhood and other apps </span><a href="https://www.businessofbusiness.com/articles/robinhood-halts-trading-hides-searches-meme-stocks/"><span>blocked users</span></a><span> from buying the stocks boosted by Reddit and even hiding search results for them, “in light of recent volatility.” Naturally, given Robinhood’s steal-from-the-rich branding (their </span><a href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/our-mission/"><span>mission statement</span></a><span> is “to democratize finance for all”), the company is now under fire for putting Wall Street’s interests over users’ and manipulating the market themselves.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>What's Robinhood's origin story?</b></p>
<p><span>Robinhood was a pioneering no-commissions trading app, on which users can invest in stocks, ETFs, options and cryptocurrencies. The company was founded in 2013 in Menlo Park by Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt, who’d both previously worked on finance software for Wall Street. The pitch was that Robinhood would eliminate the bar of entry to the world of investing, by eliminating pricey brokers fees.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The app paved the way for a wave of free online investing platforms like Acorn, Webull, Stockpile, Invstr and more. Retail stock-trading has been booming during the pandemic, as bored quarantiners picked up stock trading as a hobby, with Robinhood picking up the most growth of any online broker. Robinhood’s </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b208cbbe-579c-4cbf-9358-01ae02b4381b"><span>valuation</span></a><span> hit $11 billion in August, up 50% from before the pandemic.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>How does Robinhood make money?</b></p>
<p><span>Since Robinhood doesn’t charge users to place trades or make any kind of comission, their business model relies on something called “payment for order flow.” Payments for order flow are the fees that Robinhood receives for executing their orders through third party firms called market-makers — high-frequency trading firms that hold a wide inventory of shares, serving as a kind of middle man between investing apps and the actual market. These firms pay public-facing broker platforms for the right to place their trades.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Robinhood also has a $5 per month premium service called Robinhood Gold, that gives users access to a $1,000 margin for trading, however, the company hasn’t revealed if the feature turns a profit.</span></p>
<p><b>How does “payment for order flow” work?&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span>Every time a Robinhood user places an order, Robinhood sends the order one of their market-maker partners, who then pay Robinhood for the right to execute the order. Robinhood might only make a few cents off each order, but with 13 million users and </span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk02A-uoNvKyuBAaiIkOwE3Fs_MDV6w%3A1611858310611&amp;ei=hgETYKzhJIuY_Qa-v4bwAw&amp;q=robinhood+darts&amp;oq=robinhood+darts&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzICCAA6BAgjECc6CggAELEDEIMBEEM6BQgAEJECOgQIABBDOggIABCxAxCDAToECC4QQzoNCAAQsQMQgwEQFBCHAjoLCAAQsQMQgwEQkQI6BwgAEBQQhwI6BggAEBYQHlDZQ1iET2DqT2gAcAF4AIABiwGIAacMkgEDNi45mAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpesABAQ&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;ved=0ahUKEwisvKCQoL_uAhULTN8KHb6fAT4Q4dUDCA0&amp;uact=5"><span>4.3 million trades on average per day</span></a><span> as of August, the cash adds up, hence the $11 billion valuation.</span></p>
<p><span>In the case of Robinhood, they make nearly half their revenue from just firms, Two Sigma Securities and Citadel Securities. Robinhood takes in one of the highest payment for order flow rates in the industry, at 17 cents per hundred shares for equity trades, and 58 cents for options, outpacing rivals like Charles Schwab which brings home 11 cents and 37 cents per hundred shares, respectively, for the same categories.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The business model of farming out client trading orders to high-speed, high-volume trading firms dates back to the very beginning of electronic trading. It was </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quicktake/payment-for-order-flow"><span>invented</span></a><span> by none other than Bernie Madoff, at his securities firm back in the 1980s, which would pay Fidelity or Charles Schwab to make their trades for them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“Payment for order flow” is the backbone the retail stock trading industry — nearly every free investment app’s bottom line depends on it. However, perhaps unsurprisingly given its founder, Bloomberg </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-15/robinhood-gets-almost-half-its-revenue-in-controversial-bargain-with-high-speed-traders"><span>calls</span></a><span> it “one of the most controversial practices on Wall Street.” The system has been criticized for a lack of transparency and potential conflicts of interest, since broker platforms make more off some trades than others, specifically options trading. Robinhood made more than $111 million of its $180 million second quarter revenue off options trades. Tim Welsh, a CEO of wealth management firm Nexus Strategy, told </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/13/how-robinhood-makes-money-on-customer-trades-despite-making-it-free.html"><span>CNBC</span></a><span> that retail trading apps “without a doubt” steer customers towards options trades. The company, however, put more checks on its options trading this summer, after a 20-year-old Robinhood user committed suicide, after believing he’d lost $730,000 (the interface made it confusing to tell the difference between his negative buying power and his actual account balance, which was positive).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Understanding the backlash</b></p>
<p><span>Since some see “payment for order flow” as anti-consumer and Wall Street-friendly, the app’s “for the people” ethos was already </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgYd5Hm7Eb0&amp;ab_channel=BloombergMarketsandFinance"><span>under scrutiny</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now, the app’s mission statement is coming back duly to haunt them. Robinhood says in banning GameStop trades, that it was simply trying to tamp down a speculative frenzy. But Reddit investors —&nbsp;who frame themselves as class warriors, who are literally redistributing wealth from hedge funds to regular people and teaching Wall Street a lesson about market manipulation — claim the company is doing Wall Street’s bidding.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Soundbites and screenshots of interviews in which Robinhood’s founders </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c3ed6758-e51c-48b1-b6a6-a17ccb265b28"><span>recount their origin story</span></a><span> of being disenchanted with Wall Street and inspired by Occupy Wall Street are&nbsp;</span><a href="https://twitter.com/tonytula/status/1354843970405355520"><span>circulating</span></a><span> on Twitter. High profile figures as diverse as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ted Cruz, entrepreneur Mark Cuban and rapper JaRule have called out Robinhood for undermining free trade</span></p>
<p><span>While many other investment apps made the same call, Robinhood is taking much of the heat. Within hours of blocking GameStop trades, Robinhood was hit with a class action lawsuit, filed in New York on Thursday, </span><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/536320-class-action-lawsuit-filed-against-robinhood-for-restricting-trading"><span>alleging</span></a><span> that the company “deprived their customers of the ability to use their service,” in an effort “to manipulate the market for the benefit of people and financial intuitions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the meantime, Reddit investors are boycotting Robinhood on principal —&nbsp;and desperately seeking any alternative platform that will let them hit “Buy” on Gamestop, AMC and others. As of late this afternoon, Robinhood competitors WeBull and Public have removed restrictions and are freely trading the “meme stocks” once again.</span></p>
<hr>

<p><span></span>Over on the Apple App Store, despite reports on social media that users were bombarding the app with one-star reviews, Robinhood's rating (and total rating count) remain up and to the right:</p>

<p>It's a different story on Google, where the app has tanked in the Google Play App Store:</p>

      

      
      <h3>About the Data:</h3>
      <p>
        Thinknum tracks companies using the information they post online, jobs, social and web traffic, product sales, and app ratings, and creates data sets that measure factors like hiring, revenue, and foot traffic. Data sets may not be fully comprehensive (they only account for what is available on the web), but they can be used to gauge performance factors like staffing and sales.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>Oh, what a January it was. One incident after another has <a href="https://qbix.com/blog/2021/01/25/no-way-to-prevent-this-says-only-industry-where-this-regularly-happens/">shown the public in the US</a> (and <a href="https://qbix.com/blog/2021/01/25/no-way-to-prevent-this-says-only-industry-where-this-regularly-happens/">other countries</a>) that they are conducting all their conversations, public discourse, collaboration and transactions on <strong><a href="https://qbix.com/blog/2021/01/15/open-source-communities/">platforms that are owned by others</a></strong>, and can be shut down at any moment. It is a sort of digital Feudalism, and people are starting to realize that the “real owners” can show up and stop the game any time they want. Whether it’s ad-supported “Free” social platforms booting entire communities from their platforms for wrong speech, or hedge-fund-supported “Free” trading platforms closing down entire stock trades for wrong trades, the story here is that “free” often isn’t. The owners are the ones who pay the bills, and they also play in the casino.</p>
<p><strong>Social Platforms</strong></p>
<p>As the year began, various sectors of the American political landscape became alarmed at <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/01/16/big-tech-and-censorship">Big Tech and their coordinated censorship of free speech</a>, after Parler was shut down by Google, Apple, and even Amazon. A few days later, millions of WhatsApp users were spooked by the company apparently changing its terms of service, leading <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-9183553/WhatsApp-loses-MILLIONS-users-rivals-Telegram-Signal-ahead-privacy-policy-update.html">millions to jump ship</a> and move to Signal or <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/telegram-hits-500-million-users-after-whatsapp-backlash-2021-1">Telegram</a>, which helped it reach <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/telegram-crosses-500-million-monthly-active-users-some-25-million-joined-in-last-72-hours-7143792/">half a billion users</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Trading Platforms</strong></p>
<p>Not to be outdone, the financial industry had its own version of that this past week. Online communities 2 million strong, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jan/28/gamestop-fun-turns-deadly-serious-reddit-wallstreetbets">united and coordinated their purchase of GameStop and AMC Entertainment</a> shares to drive the price up and squeeze the hedge funds who had a massive short-selling position, forcing them to buy the stocks back to cover their positions and drive the stock price even higher. In short, the public organized on Reddit, noticed that hedge funds had taken massive short positions totaling 140% of all outstanding stock, and cleaned them out with one continuous, coordinated action. Melvin Capital was given emergency infusions of $2B, which evaporated quickly, and they were left holding the short end of the stick.</p>
<p>But what happened next was a “hold my beer” analogue in the financial industry of what we saw in the social media industry. All of a sudden, <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/webull-blocks-gamestop-amc-transactions-stock-market-robinhood-1565172">Robin Hood, WeBull and other “no fee” stock trading apps blocked any further purchases of the stock</a>, forcing the buyers to “unwind their position” (i.e. sell it) to pretty much the only game in town: the very hedge funds who needed to cover their position before Friday, when many of their margin loans or put options got called. In fact, trading was halted even on other hyped stocks, such as AMC and even Nokia! [1]</p>
<p><strong>Those who pay the bills control the music</strong></p>
<p>All of a sudden, the fourth wall was broken, and the public got a peek behind the curtain. The hedge funds are the ones who pay the bills at Robin Hood: despite its name, Robin Hood makes its money by selling trading data of the retail investors, to hedge funds who get to take advantage and trade against it. When the shoe was suddenly on the other foot, these hedge funds must have placed some calls to the management at Robin Hood and WeBull and reminded them who pays the bills. “If you don’t let us cover those shorts by Friday, your platform will go bankrupt too.” Suddenly people realized something about these “free” markets: they’re actually <em>owned</em> by entities whose buddies play in the casino, and when push comes to shove and you take the other side of the transaction, they won’t let you bankrupt them, no matter how many of you there are.</p>
<p>The same goes for the “free” social networks and media that is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch/n2H8wx1aBiQ">supported by advertisers</a>. They – or their algorithms – always select for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent">the content that will make them the most money</a>, regardless of <strong><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81254224">their effect on society</a></strong>.<br>
</p>
<p>Whether you’re winning too much against the house at the casino, or you’re saying the wrong things on stage at an event, the pretense of “free speech” or “free trade” disappears for those who break the fourth wall.</p>
<p><strong>How we as as society can solve these problems</strong></p>
<p>Within the same day, Robin Hood was hit with a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/robinhood-hit-with-class-action-lawsuit-after-halting-gamestop-stock">class action lawsuit</a> for their actions. But State action is just a band-aid on the real problem. While the government argues over whether to break up <a href="https://observer.com/2020/10/house-democrat-antitrust-amazon-facebook-google-breakup/">Facebook, Amazon and Google</a>, and federal courts argue about whether to Apple should <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-google-alphabet-telegram-app-store-2021-1">kick Telegram out of its app store</a>, the <em>libertarian</em> solution has been in front of us the whole time: <a href="https://qbix.com/blog/2021/01/15/open-source-communities/">build open source platforms that are <em>not</em> owned by a select few elites</a>.</p>
<p>That is what cryptocurrency can bring about. The old way is to sell shares to investors who urge you to own the whole platform, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/peter-thiel-competition-is-for-losers-1410535536">build a monopoly and eliminate competition</a>, as Peter Thiel did with Facebook. The new way is selling tokens, so the network be <a href="https://continuations.com/post/187279569830/is-ethereum-the-aol-of-crypto">owned by the participants themselves</a>, after the founders sold their tokens in the initial sale. This ability to release currencies owned by the community is one of the <strong><a href="http://intercoin.org/applications">many applications of Intercoin</a></strong>.</p>

<p><img alt="Voreenve-2.png" src="https://www.uni-muenster.de/imperia/md/images/voreen/start_image/voreenve-2.6-startseite.png" width="220" height="155">Voreen  is an open source rapid application development framework for the interactive visualization and analysis of multi-modal volumetric data  sets. It provides GPU-based volume rendering and data analysis  techniques and offers high flexibility when developing new analysis  workflows in collaboration with domain experts. The Voreen framework  consists of a multi-platform C++ library, which can be easily integrated  into existing applications, and a Qt-based stand-alone application. It  is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License.</p>
<p>The  Voreen project has been initiated and was originally maintained by the Visualization &amp; Computer Graphics Research Group at the <a href="http://www.uni-muenster.de/" target="_blank">University of Münster</a> as part of the collaborative research center <a href="https://www.uni-muenster.de/Sfbmobil/" target="_blank">SFB 656 MoBil</a> (<a href="https://www.uni-muenster.de/Sfbmobil/forschung/zentrale-projekte/index.html" target="_blank">Project Z1</a>, <a href="http://www.uni-muenster.de/Sfbmobil/projekte/verwaltung-pr/oe.html" target="_blank">Project Ö</a>).</p>
<p>Since 2018, Voreen is collaboratively developed by the <a href="https://www.uni-muenster.de/PRIA/" target="_blank">Pattern Recognition and Image Analysis (PRIA) Research Group</a> and the <a href="https://www.uni-muenster.de/VISIX/" target="_blank">VISualization &amp; graphIX (VISIX) Research Group</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  
</blockquote>
<p>I began learning RPG in 1973 at the same time I began learning COBOL.&nbsp; I had the good fortune of becoming employed by the college I was
attending on a work-study program, so the same people who were teaching the
courses were available to me virtually all day, everyday.&nbsp; When I first
started working there, there were two programmers teaching and maintaining
systems for the school.&nbsp; One of the programmers wrote only in RPG and the
other wrote only in COBOL.&nbsp; Each programmer tried to convince me that his
own language specialty was the one I should concentrate on.&nbsp; Consequently,
I came to appreciate both languages for their strengths.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Most of my career I have been writing COBOL programs.&nbsp; The
last time I wrote any significant RPG (by which I mean code that went into production) was in
1982.&nbsp; Still, I think RPG is a simple but powerful problem solving tool that
shouldn't be overlooked or dismissed simply because it is viewed by the majority
of computer professionals as a "minicomputer" language.</p>
<p>A visitor to my Hercules' site lamented that there
were few RPG textbooks available.&nbsp; I can add from personal knowledge that the
few which are available are
prohibitively expensive, as are most computer texts.&nbsp; Another fact is that if you intend to write RPG to compile with the RPG compiler we
have available with MVT, you will find that most texts available concentrate on RPG II, RPG III, and RPG IV (or RPG/400).&nbsp; These
variants contain
extensions to RPG I (which I often refer to as RPG with no number) that are not recognized or supported by the
MVT RPG compiler.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, my goal in writing this tutorial was to provide enough basic
information to allow someone who had little or no RPG experience to begin
writing RPG programs, specifically with the MVT RPG compiler running under
Hercules as the target system.&nbsp; I have included a series of annotated RPG
programs, each emphasizing a specific concept.&nbsp; Along with the page
containing the annotated program source there is a link with the compiled
program and output of the program's execution.&nbsp; There is also an archive
containing the jobstream with the source and the data files required for the
program.&nbsp; Beginning with the third program, the data files updated by each
program are necessary for the successive programs.</p>
<p>If you are interested in learning about RPG, I hope these pages
are useful to you.&nbsp; From my own experience, if you have a solid
understanding of RPG and later need to advance to RPG II, RPG III, or RPG IV,
you will find the transition almost painless.</p>

				<p>I read a great <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/bashrc-VS-profile-VS-bash_profile/">post</a> on HN written by Lei Mao talking about the differences between the various "profile" scripts - .bashrc, .profile, .bash_profile - and it made me realize just how long it's been since I looked at my personal Bash profile. I figure the beginning of the year is as good a time as any to take a walk through my personal .bashrc file and see if I can even remember what everything does ;) If you'd like a copy to follow along or for your own personal use, here you go - my <a href="https://thesoloadmin.com/uploads/bashrc">bashrc</a>. </p><p>I want to start with a couple of caveats - first, I'm sure my profile isn't nearly as interesting or cutting-edge as some others. Yes, it's kind of simple, but I've been using it for almost 7 years now and it's performed solidly. Second, in order to use it on your box you will need to install a couple of applications (we'll go over those below). Finally, I'm a Debian guy and so is my profile; it should work on the most recent Debian-based distros including Ubuntu, but YMMV (if I can find my old Gentoo .bashrc I'll write it up in a separate article).</p><p>Ok, so let's jump right in!</p><p>First off, a couple of comments and then we set the prompts - green and blue and "$" for regular users, red and blue and "#" for root. As you can see from the <code>debian_chroot</code> reference, this section is a leftover from the original Debian file:</p><figure><pre><code># Matt's .bashrc
# System Requirements: color-capable terminal

if [ $EUID -eq 0 ]; then
	PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\[\033[01;31m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]\[\033[01;34m\] [\w]\[\033[00m\]\$ '
else	
	PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]\[\033[01;34m\] [\w]\[\033[00m\]\$ '
fi

# If this is an xterm set the title to user@host:dir
case "$TERM" in
xterm*|rxvt*)
    PS1="\[\e]0;${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@\h: \w\a\]$PS1"
    ;;
*)
    ;;
esac
</code></pre><figcaption>Configure the Prompt</figcaption></figure><p>Next, I like my terminals to have a lot of color. By aliasing some commands and using <code>dircolors</code> and the application grc I can add color to some of the commands I use most frequently:</p><figure><pre><code># Alias grep to egrep and configure color output and line numbers
alias grep="egrep --color=always -n"

# Colorize output from ls
export LS_OPTIONS='--color=auto'
eval "`dircolors`"
alias ls='ls $LS_OPTIONS'
alias ll='ls $LS_OPTIONS -l'
alias l='ls $LS_OPTIONS -lA'

#Configure grc to provide colorized output for system commands
GRC=`which grc`
alias colourify="$GRC -es --colour=auto"
alias netstat='colourify netstat'
alias ping='colourify ping'
alias traceroute='colourify traceroute'
alias dig='colourify dig'
alias df='colourify df'
alias mount='colourify mount'
alias ps='colourify ps'
</code></pre><figcaption>Colorful Output</figcaption></figure><p>Next up, due to my tendency to work long hours and general brain fuzziness, I set up some bumper rails for myself:</p><figure><pre><code># Alias commands for safety
alias rm='rm -i'
alias cp='cp -i'
alias mv='mv -i'</code></pre><figcaption>Safety Bumpers</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, I added two other function aliases that I found myself using frequently - rsync-over-SSH and using the <code>pandoc</code> command to read Markdown files in the terminal:</p><figure><pre><code># Create rsync-over-SSH function command, using SSH port tcp/22222.
function rsynssh() {
	rsync -r -a -v -e "ssh -p 22222" --progress $1 $2
}

# Create a function to read Markdown files in the terminal 
function rmd() {
	pandoc $1 | lynx -stdin
}</code></pre><figcaption>Function aliases</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wanting to recreate my .bashrc on your system, you will need to install the applications grc, rsync, and pandoc (I'm assuming SSH is already installed):</p><pre><code>apt-get install grc rsync pandoc</code></pre><p>It's not flashy and it may not win any awards, but it's one of the fundamental tools in my toolkit. Anytime I'm building a new server, after setting up my .ssh directory and <code>authorized_keys</code> file, I install the helper apps and copy over my .bashrc. If nothing else, feel free to use my example to build a bigger and better profile to suit your daily admin needs.</p>

(Credit: NASA)</figcaption></figure> <p>Future lunar landers might come equipped with 3D printed rocket engine parts that help bring down overall manufacturing costs and reduce production time. NASA is investing in advanced manufacturing â€“ one of five industries of the future â€“ to make it possible.</p> <p>Through a series of hot-fire tests in November, NASA demonstrated that two additively manufactured engine components â€“ a copper alloy combustion chamber and nozzle made of a high-strength hydrogen resistant alloy â€“ could withstand the same extreme combustion environments that traditionally manufactured metal structures experience in flight.</p> <p>A team of Marshall test engineers put the 3D printed parts through their paces, performing 23 hot-fire tests for a total duration of 280 seconds over 10 test days. Throughout the testing, engineers collected data, including pressure and temperature measurements in hardware coolant channels and the main chamber, and high-speed and high-resolution video of the exhaust plume and chamber throat. The team also calculated the chamber's performance and how efficiently the engine used propellant overall.</p><p>The high-strength iron-nickel superalloy nozzle was printed using a method called laser powder directed energy deposition, which deposits and melts the metal powder locally to create freeform structures. This method allows engineers to manufacture small and large-scale components, as demonstrated in NASAâ€™s RAMPT project.</p> <p>The tests were a part of NASAâ€™s Long-Life Additive Manufacturing Assembly (LLAMA) project, which aims to enable these 3D printed parts â€“ along with other additively manufactured hardware â€“ for use on future lunar landers. The team will perform additional hot-fire tests to further demonstrate and validate the durability of the engine components. Marshall leads the LLAMA project for NASA's Game Changing Development program, part of the agencyâ€™s Space Technology Mission Directorate.</p> <p><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/releases/2020/3d-printed-rocket-engine-parts-survive-23-hot-fire-tests.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source&nbsp;<i></i></a></p>

  <div>
    <section>  </section> <string></string> <section><p>Go is a typed language, but many projects I'm asked to consult on aren't embracing the "simple" things that are really important.  Today, I'm going to talk a little about embracing the Go type system as it pertains to defining your data structures.</p> <h4>Target Audience</h4> <p>This article is aimed at anyone who has worked with a typed language and has little to no Go experience.</p> <h2>The Problem</h2> <p>For this article, we'll focus on how we would design the data structures for a product review.  The entities involved will be a <code language="plain">product</code> data structure, a <code language="plain">user</code> data structure, and a <code language="plain">product review</code> data structure.</p> <p>Let's get started defining just the bare minimum for this exercise:</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="struct" src="./src/v1/product.go">type Product struct {
	ID   int
	Name string
}</code></pre>    <pre><code language="plain" snippet="struct" src="./src/v1/user.go">type User struct {
	ID       int
	Username string
}</code></pre>    <pre><code language="plain" snippet="struct" src="./src/v1/product_review.go">type ProductReview struct {
	ProductID int
	UserID    int
	Review    string
}</code></pre>   <p><strong>Note:</strong> For this example, I wrote an in-memory database that simulates a real database.  Since it doesn't really matter what database we are using, we aren't going to look at any of that code.  We will, however, see it being used in our tests later on.</p> <p>Now, let's look at what a method would look like that retrieves a product review from the database:</p> <pre><code language="go">func Find(productID, userID int) (*ProductReview, error)</code></pre> <p>This method takes a product ID, and a user ID, and retrieves the review from that user for the specified product.</p> <h3>What's Wrong?</h3> <p>Technically, nothing is wrong with the code so far.  It's all valid Go code.  It will compile, and it will run.</p> <p>To show this is the case, let's go ahead and write an integration test to validate our assertions.</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="test" src="./src/v1/database_test.go">func TestProductReview(t *testing.T) {
	// Create an instance to our database
	db := NewDatabase()

	// Create a product
	product := Product{Name: "Computer"}
	if err := db.Products.Create(&amp;product); err != nil {
		t.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Create a user
	user := User{Username: "gopher"}
	if err := db.Users.Create(&amp;user); err != nil {
		t.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Create a product review
	exp := &amp;ProductReview{UserID: user.ID, ProductID: product.ID, Review: "This computer is awesome!"}
	if err := db.ProductReviews.Save(exp); err != nil {
		t.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Retrieve the product review
	got, err := db.ProductReviews.Find(user.ID, product.ID)
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatal(err)
	}

	if !cmp.Equal(got, exp) {
		t.Fatalf("unexpected product review:\n%s", cmp.Diff(got, exp))
	}

	t.Logf("%+v", got)
}</code></pre>   <p>If we run the test, we can see that the test does in fact pass:</p> <pre><code language="sh">$ go test -v -run TestProductReview
=== RUN   TestProductReview
    database_test.go:41: &amp;{ProductID:1 UserID:1 Review:This computer is awesome!}
--- PASS: TestProductReview (0.00s)
PASS
ok      store   0.064s</code></pre> <p>We also logged out the product review at the end of the test just to prove we did save and retrieve the correct product review from the database.  So, where is the problem?  Maybe you already caught it... but maybe you didn't.</p> <p>The problem is that we swapped our method arguments when we called the <code language="plain">Find</code> method.  If we look back at the signature, we see it's defined as:</p> <pre><code language="go">func Find(productID, userID int) (*ProductReview, error)</code></pre> <p>However, we called it with the <code language="plain">productID</code> swapped with the <code language="plain">userID</code> (effectively sending in a product id in place of a user id, and vice versa:</p> <pre><code language="go">db.ProductReviews.Find(user.ID, product.ID)</code></pre> <p>Ok, so we know for sure that we wrote a bad test, so why did the test pass?  The reason is that, as with many integration tests, we are testing from an "empty" database.  So, when we create the first user, the ID is going to be "1", and when we create the first product, it's ID is also going to be "1".  And because both ID types are "int"s, we never see that we actually wrote a bad test.</p> <p>So you might be thinking, ok, so we wrote a bad test, that happens.  Why don't we just correct the test by sending in the method arguments in the correct order and ship the code.</p> <p>We could do this, however, the same problem we just experienced in our test, can also occur in production.  There is nothing stopping us from accidentally reversing the order of the arguments when we write production code.  The big difference, however, is that in production, we've now written a really ugly bug that will result in adverse outcomes, likely corrupt data, and be a pain to track down and correct.</p> <h2>Why Are You Telling Me This?</h2> <p>Remember, this article is all about embracing the type system.  And all too often, when I do code reviews, I see that the code does not actually embrace the type safety of the language. By making a couple of small design decisions, we can ensure that we don't create this bug in our software.</p> <h3>Typed IDs</h3> <p>The easiest way to ensure that we don't send in a Product ID by mistake when a User ID is needed, is to create a custom type for our ID's.  This is what our structures will look like when we do this:</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="struct" src="./src/v2/product.go">type ProductID int

type Product struct {
	ID   ProductID
	Name string
}</code></pre>    <pre><code language="plain" snippet="struct" src="./src/v2/user.go">type UserID int

type User struct {
	ID       UserID
	Username string
}</code></pre>    <pre><code language="plain" snippet="struct" src="./src/v2/product_review.go">type ProductReview struct {
	ProductID ProductID
	UserID    UserID
	Review    string
}</code></pre>   <p>Now, instead of using the generic <code language="plain">int</code> type for ID's, each structure has it's own type for an ID.</p> <p>That means we also have to update our <code language="plain">Find</code> method, which will now use the custom types for arguments:</p> <pre><code language="go">func Find(productID ProductID, userID UserID) (*ProductReview, error)</code></pre> <p>Now when we the tests, I get the following error:</p> <pre><code language="sh">$ go test -v -run TestProductReview
# store [store.test]
./database_test.go:33:41: cannot use user.ID (type UserID) as type ProductID in argument to db.ProductReviews.Find
./database_test.go:33:53: cannot use product.ID (type ProductID) as type UserID in argument to db.ProductReviews.Find
FAIL    store [build failed]</code></pre> <p>And if we look at the failing line of code, we see that the arguments are indeed reversed:</p> <pre><code language="go">got, err := db.ProductReviews.Find(user.ID, product.ID)</code></pre> <p>This is what I mean when I talk about embracing the type system in Go.  If you properly architect your data types, the compiler will do a lot more work to ensure that you don't make mistakes in your tests or production code.</p> <p>If we don't make the conversion, Go will enforce the type safety and we'll receive a compile time error.</p> <h2>Ok, got it.  Always use Typed IDs</h2> <p>Actually... no.  When designing your software, you always need to look at the pros and cons.  While using Typed IDs can catch bugs, sometimes it just becomes a hassle because you have to keep converting types from something like a basic <code language="plain">int</code> to a <code language="plain">ProductID</code></p> <p>If you look at the following code, this will not work as Go will enforce type safety, and even though <code language="plain">ProductID</code> is based on an <code language="plain">int</code> , it is NOT an <code language="plain">int</code> , and can't be directly assigned an <code language="plain">int</code> value:</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="main" src="./src/conversion/invalid.go">type ProductID int

type Product struct {
	ID   ProductID
	Name string
}

func main() {
	id := 1
	product := Product{
		ID:   id,
		Name: "Computer",
	}
	fmt.Println(product)
}</code></pre>   <pre><code language="sh">$ go run ./invalid.go
# command-line-arguments
./invalid.go:16:3: cannot use id (type int) as type ProductID in field value</code></pre> <p>To make sure you follow the type safety rules you've created, you have to tell Go you want to convert the <code language="plain">int</code> value of <code language="plain">id</code> to the type of <code language="plain">ProductID</code> by performing a <code language="plain">type conversion</code> :</p> <pre><code language="go">ProductID(id)</code></pre> <p>This is what the code will now look like:</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="main" src="./src/conversion/valid.go">type ProductID int

type Product struct {
	ID   ProductID
	Name string
}

func main() {
	id := 1
	product := Product{
		ID:   ProductID(id),
		Name: "Computer",
	}
	fmt.Println(product)
}</code></pre>   <h2>How do I know when to use them?</h2> <p>There are a couple of signs you can look for that Typed IDs may benefit your code.  First, if you have any functions that take more than one ID from different data types to perform operations.  We saw this in our example because a ProductReview used a composite key of <code language="plain">ProductID</code> and <code language="plain">UserID</code> . This can happen in projects such as a RESTful Web API.  Or maybe you are consuming data from XML or JSON and you want to ensure that all the data types are enforced when processing the data.</p> <p>If your code doesn't mix ID's, then likely using Typed IDs will only result in extra code without any benefit.</p> <h2>Summary</h2> <p>As we saw in this article, even writing tests, you can still have code that passes, but is not correct.  By embracing the type safety of Go, we enable the compiler to ensure that we never accidentally swap arguments for different types.</p></section>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div><p>How important are keywords on my technical resume? Which keywords should I use to stand out? Will my resume will show up at all?  Will I be screened out  automatically based on an absence of relevant keywords on my resume? </p><p>All of these are common questions and concerns for technology professionals writing their technical resume. Few are familiar with the actual behavior of either the humans who read resumes – engineering managers, HR professionals, or recruiters – or the computer systems that assist in the process – Applicant Tracking Systems (ATSs) and resume parsers.&nbsp;As a result, these worries, anxieties, and concerns cause a lot of stress in the resume writing process.</p><p>At Leet Resumes, where we write <a href="https://leetresumes.com/signup">technical resumes for free for experienced engineers</a>, it’s an extremely important topic for us to get right. Most information available on internet forums, Reddit, or Quora is disinformation – a mix of urban legends, wishful thinking, and personal guesswork. The anxieties fostered by this disinformation are unfortunate, but understandable – so much is at stake!</p><p>Because it’s important to get right, let’s review how keywords are actually used in searching and sorting resumes and applications. From these insights, we’ll conclude with recommendations for how to best utilize keywords on your own <a href="https://leetresumes.com/blog/what-a-great-technical-resume-can-do-for-you">technical resume</a>.</p><p>With regards to keywords, you should be most concerned with the humans involved, not the ATS, not the AI technology, not the automations. Because of the nature of how HR and recruiting decisions are made, and the unique preferences of each hiring manager, it’s best to start with the human’s desires and practices, and then follow up with how the technology supports or enables those preferences.&nbsp;</p><p>The actual behavior patterns of the humans using resume search technology is pretty non-dramatic, and about as straightforward and sensible as you might guess if you’ve ever observed consumer interaction with high technology. It is a human professional, often HR or recruiting, sometimes the hiring manager herself, who conducts keywords searches and iteratively whittles down a result set to a size worth reviewing manually.</p><p>Despite expansive claims, AI and ML play a relatively small part in the <strong>review</strong> of technology resumes. While both are extremely powerful methodologies, they have become overused marketing buzzwords in certain sectors of the economy such as HR software.&nbsp;There is no obscure body of knowledge about optimizing your resume’s keywords, comparable to the intricacies of SEO best practices, for working with AI or ATSs. It just simply isn’t the case.</p><p>For example, one bit of bad advice occasionally found in internet forums is the importance of keyword stuffing – repeating high-value keywords on your resume in order to stand out, or to be listed top in the search results. Sometimes the advice extends to including these keywords in small white font on a white background, so the computer reads it but not the human.&nbsp; Duplicitous deceptions such as these are not productive, helpful or successful because that’s not how humans search.&nbsp; (Never mind that a properly-trained, properly-rewarded AI would learn to sniff out the stratagems used by poseurs attempting to fool the system.)</p><p>It’s also worth mentioning that automated screening should not be a concern for the experienced technology professional. While automated screening exists at the blue-collar level, and certain entry-level clerical jobs, for the most part screening is not automated in white-collar roles.&nbsp; For technology professionals, in many ways at the apex of white-collar jobs in the 21st century, where the volume of applications rarely exceeds the ability of a human to screen them personally, automated screening is simply not a factor.</p><p>Instead, it is the humans involved, and the limitations of those humans, that should be most concerning to software engineers and technologists. The fact is, humans are really not very competent at sophisticated keyword screening. Especially for the HR professionals assisting an engineer manager, they lack information technology training and skills, and do not possess an extensive and sophisticated toolset for refining keyword searches. Typically, they’re most interested in getting to a result set that pleases their boss or client as quickly as possible, <strong><u>not</u></strong> performing an effective, deterministic, search process that avoids statistically significant false negatives.</p><p>Behaviorally, they tend to default to simple keyword searches. The keyword search paradigm is powerful, but lossy.&nbsp; Your own natural experiments on Google, StackOverflow, or anywhere there is a search engine, teach you that search is a multi-step process of guessing and refining. With each iteration, you achieve a better understanding of the trade-offs between specificity and breadth. And with each iteration, you refine your assessment of whether the result set is sufficiently compact to merit your detailed review.</p><p>The same is true for resume search, and for resume searchers. The most common search terms from recruiters and hiring managers are simple, almost embarrassingly so: “engineer”, “director”, “devops”, “security”, “Java”, “Python”, “EC2”, “Apache”, etc. This might seem like a great disappointment relative to what you know technology is capable of doing. Having been in the industry twenty years, trust me, it’s frustrating for the people who build search software for recruiters, too!</p><p>The HR professional conducting a search may be relying on a job description for keyword suggestions, or restricting their search to a geographical area, or using past experiences that have turned out well for them. But in reviewing tens of thousands of searches by recruiters and hiring managers, simple searches are most common, and there is almost no prevalence of complex searches such as “<em>used Python to build a scalable, databases-driven content management system for the aeronautics industry.</em>”&nbsp; </p><p>Complex keyword phrases and sentences such as these are simply not performed, and, when performed at all, are not productive.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, what we see is that when it comes to title or field, searchers tend to utilize <strong>common nouns</strong>. “Lead engineer” or “Vice President” tend to be more productive than more company-specific versions such as “Lead Engineer, Internal Database Tools” or “Vice President, Omaha Operations.” Similarly, “mobile” or “gaming” are more frequently searched for than terms that are brand-specific, such as “GTA 5” or “iOS Safari browser engineering.” Broader searches yield a larger result set that is also consistent with the intentions of the hiring or engineering manager.</p><p>Conversely, when it comes to skills and capabilities, it is the more specific <strong>proper nouns</strong> that are more productive. “Rust”, “MongoDB”, and “Ruby” are much more commonly searched than generic or common nouns such as “database management”, “programming language” or “web server.”&nbsp; For skills and capabilities, the generic terms are more likely to return false positives from a resume database. And the more specific proper nouns carry more signal about the specific skills of that professional.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This pattern - common nouns for titles and field, proper nouns for skills, capabilities, and competencies - yields important insights for writing for your own resume. At Leet Resumes, our advice for technology professionals’ resumes follows from these observations:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Get your past titles correct.</strong> Technologists will sometimes skip over past promotions, for example, only listing the final title in an eight-year job instead of demonstrating each promotion along the way. While not directly related to keyword search, getting this right supports the next point…</p></li><li><p><strong>Include future titles.</strong> Your resume is an advertisement for a future position. After all, if you wanted to keep the title you currently have, you wouldn’t be updating your resume. As such, it’s important to indicate on your resume the three or four job titles you’d actually accept for your next role. That way, keyword searches for the job you want – “Software Engineer II” or “Lead Engineer” – will return your resume in the results.</p></li><li><p><strong>All the things.</strong> Please include all of the technologies in which you are proficient on your resume. Too often, it will seem obvious to a technology professional that “if I know Django, I obviously know Python,” leading to the omission of an important technology proficiency. But to the HR professional assisting a hiring manager, it is not obvious at all, and they may miss you as a result. Every technology in which you have demonstrated competency should be on your resume.</p></li><li><p><strong>Don’t forget databases!</strong> At Leet we’ve observed that, for whatever reason, technology professionals too often leave databases and data stores off their resumes. Please be explicit and include MariaDB, Redis, Neo4j and every other database and data store you are familiar with in your technologies list. Do not expect that readers will know that LAMP stack or MEAN stack imply a knowledge of MySQL or MongoDb. It’s best to be explicit.</p></li><li><p><strong>Be exhaustive.</strong> There’s no need to resort to foolish tricks or silly ruses to get your resume noticed. But what <em>is</em> required is that you mine your past experience, in detail, for accurate and detailed descriptions of the accomplishments you’ve had, the work you’ve done, and the technologies, fields, activities, and capabilities you’ve developed an expertise in. It’s hard work to get all of this information into your <a href="https://leetresumes.com/blog/how-to-write-bullet-points-for-a-technical-resume">bullet points</a>, but it pays off.</p></li></ul><p>In summary, creating your resume does not need to be a stressful, anxiety-producing effort. Worrying about keyword strategies will do you little good in the real world. There is no keyword strategy that is more effective than accurately and exhaustively describing the facts of your actual work experience, talents and skills.</p><p>With these tips, you’re on the path to creating a more effective resume for yourself, or having Leet Resumes write a <a href="https://leetresumes.com/signup">technical resume for you for free</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<div id="content">

<p>January 2021</p>

<p>As the primary author of Python’s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.scandir"><code>os.scandir</code></a> function and <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0471/">PEP 471</a> (the original proposal for <code>scandir</code>), I was very happy to see that Go is adding something similar in Go 1.16, which is coming out in late February 2021.</p>

<p>In Go it will be called <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/os/#ReadDir"><code>os.ReadDir</code></a>, and was <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/41467">proposed</a> last September. After more than 100 comments and several tweaks to the design, it was <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/commit/a4ede9f9a6254360d39d0f45aec133c355ac6b2a">committed</a> by Russ Cox in October. A file system-agnostic version is also included in the new <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/io/fs/"><code>io/fs</code></a> package as <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/io/fs/#ReadDir"><code>fs.ReadDir</code></a>.</p>

<h2 id="why-is-readdir-needed">Why is ReadDir needed?</h2>

<p>The short answer is: performance.</p>

<p>When you call the system functions to read directory entries, the OS typically returns the file name <em>and</em> its type (and on Windows, stat information such as file size and last modified time). However, the original Go and Python interfaces threw away this extra information, requiring you to make an additional <code>stat</code> call per entry. System calls <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/6424772/68707">aren’t cheap</a> to begin with, and <code>stat</code> may read from disk, or at least the disk cache.</p>

<p>When recursively walking a directory tree, you need to know whether an entry is a file or directory so you know whether to recurse in. So even a simple directory tree traversal required reading the directory entries <em>and</em> <code>stat</code>-ing each entry. But if you use the file type information the OS provides, you can avoid those <code>stat</code> calls and traverse a directory several times as fast (even dozens of times as fast on network file systems). See some <a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/scandir#benchmarks">benchmarks</a> for the Python version.</p>

<p>Both languages, unfortunately, started with a non-optimal design for reading directories that didn’t allow you to access the type information without extra calls to <code>stat</code>: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.listdir"><code>os.listdir</code></a> in Python, and <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/io/ioutil/#ReadDir"><code>ioutil.ReadDir</code></a> in Go.</p>

<p>I first came up with the idea behind Python’s <code>scandir</code> in 2012, and implemented it for Python 3.5, which came out in 2015 (<a href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/scandir/">read more about that process</a>). It’s been improved and added to since: for example, <code>with</code> statement handling and file descriptor support.</p>

<p>For Go, I didn’t have anything to do with the proposal or implementation, apart from a <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/41467#issuecomment-694603286">couple</a> <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/41467#issuecomment-697937162">of</a> <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/41188#issuecomment-686720957">comments</a> suggesting improvements based on my experience with the Python version.</p>

<h2 id="python-vs-go">Python vs Go</h2>

<p>Let’s have a look at the new “read directory” interfaces, particularly how similar they are in Python and Go.</p>

<p>In Python you call <code>os.scandir(path)</code>, and it returns an iterator of <code>os.DirEntry</code> objects, which are as follows:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>DirEntry</span><span>:</span>
    <span># This entry's filename.
</span>    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span>

    <span># This entry's full path: os.path.join(scandir_path, entry.name).
</span>    <span>path</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span>

    <span># Return inode or file ID for this entry.
</span>    <span>def</span> <span>inode</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span><span>:</span> <span>...</span>

    <span># Return True if this entry is a directory.
</span>    <span>def</span> <span>is_dir</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>follow_symlinks</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span><span>:</span> <span>...</span>

    <span># Return True if this entry is a regular file.
</span>    <span>def</span> <span>is_file</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>follow_symlinks</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span><span>:</span> <span>...</span>

    <span># Return True if this entry is a symbolic link.
</span>    <span>def</span> <span>is_symlink</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span><span>:</span> <span>...</span>

    <span># Return stat information for this entry.
</span>    <span>def</span> <span>stat</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>follow_symlinks</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>stat_result</span><span>:</span> <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Accessing the <code>name</code> and <code>path</code> attributes will never raise exceptions, but the method calls may raise <code>OSError</code>, depending on operating system and file system, and whether the entry is a symbolic link or not. For example, on Linux, <code>stat</code> always performs a system call, and hence may raise an exception, but the <code>is_X</code> methods usually do not.</p>

<p>In Go you call <code>os.ReadDir(path)</code>, and it returns a slice of <code>os.DirEntry</code> objects, which look like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>DirEntry</span> <span>interface</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Returns the name of this entry's file (or subdirectory).</span>
    <span>Name</span><span>()</span> <span>string</span>

    <span>// Reports whether the entry describes a directory.</span>
    <span>IsDir</span><span>()</span> <span>bool</span>

    <span>// Returns the type bits for the entry (a subset of FileMode).</span>
    <span>Type</span><span>()</span> <span>FileMode</span>

    <span>// Returns the FileInfo (stat information) for this entry.</span>
    <span>Info</span><span>()</span> <span>(</span><span>FileInfo</span><span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can see the similarities right away, though in true Go fashion, the Go version is somewhat simpler. In fact, if I were doing Python’s <code>scandir</code> again, I’d probably push for a slightly simpler interface – in particular, getting rid of the <code>follow_symlinks</code> parameter and making it not follow symbolic links by default.</p>

<p>Here’s an example that uses <code>os.scandir</code> – a function that calculates the total size of the files in a directory and its subdirectories, recursively:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>get_tree_size</span><span>(</span><span>path</span><span>):</span>
    <span>total</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>with</span> <span>os</span><span>.</span><span>scandir</span><span>(</span><span>path</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>entries</span><span>:</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>entry</span> <span>in</span> <span>entries</span><span>:</span>
            <span>if</span> <span>entry</span><span>.</span><span>is_dir</span><span>(</span><span>follow_symlinks</span><span>=</span><span>False</span><span>):</span>
                <span>total</span> <span>+=</span> <span>get_tree_size</span><span>(</span><span>entry</span><span>.</span><span>path</span><span>)</span>
            <span>else</span><span>:</span>
                <span>total</span> <span>+=</span> <span>entry</span><span>.</span><span>stat</span><span>(</span><span>follow_symlinks</span><span>=</span><span>False</span><span>).</span><span>st_size</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>total</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In Go (once 1.16 comes out) it would look like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>GetTreeSize</span><span>(</span><span>path</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>int64</span><span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>entries</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>os</span><span>.</span><span>ReadDir</span><span>(</span><span>path</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>total</span> <span>int64</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>entry</span> <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> <span>entries</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>entry</span><span>.</span><span>IsDir</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>size</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>GetTreeSize</span><span>(</span><span>filepath</span><span>.</span><span>Join</span><span>(</span><span>path</span><span>,</span> <span>entry</span><span>.</span><span>Name</span><span>()))</span>
            <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span>
            <span>}</span>
            <span>total</span> <span>+=</span> <span>size</span>
        <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>info</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>entry</span><span>.</span><span>Info</span><span>()</span>
            <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span>
            <span>}</span>
            <span>total</span> <span>+=</span> <span>info</span><span>.</span><span>Size</span><span>()</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>total</span><span>,</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A similar high-level structure, though of course someone’s going to say, “see, look how much boilerplate Go’s error handling introduces!” And that’s true – the Python code is very neat. In a little script that would be fine, and that’s where Python excels.</p>

<p>However, in production code, or in a hardened command-line utility, you’d want to catch errors around the stat call, and perhaps ignore permission errors, or log them. The Go code makes explicit the fact that errors can occur, and would easily allow you to add logging or nicer error messages.</p>

<h2 id="higher-level-tree-walking">Higher-level tree walking</h2>

<p>In addition, both languages have higher-level functions for recursively walking a directory tree. In Python, that’s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.walk"><code>os.walk</code></a>. The beauty of <code>scandir</code> in Python is that the signature of <code>os.walk</code> didn’t need to change, so all existing users of <code>os.walk</code> (of which there are many) got the speed-up automatically.</p>

<p>For example, to print all the non-dot file paths in a directory tree using <code>os.walk</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>list_non_dot</span><span>(</span><span>path</span><span>):</span>
    <span>paths</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>root</span><span>,</span> <span>dirs</span><span>,</span> <span>files</span> <span>in</span> <span>os</span><span>.</span><span>walk</span><span>(</span><span>path</span><span>):</span>
        <span># Modify dirs to skip directories starting with '.'
</span>        <span>dirs</span><span>[:]</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>d</span> <span>for</span> <span>d</span> <span>in</span> <span>dirs</span> <span>if</span> <span>not</span> <span>d</span><span>.</span><span>startswith</span><span>(</span><span>'.'</span><span>)]</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>f</span> <span>in</span> <span>files</span><span>:</span>
            <span>if</span> <span>f</span><span>.</span><span>startswith</span><span>(</span><span>'.'</span><span>):</span>
                <span>continue</span>
            <span>paths</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>os</span><span>.</span><span>path</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>(</span><span>root</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>))</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>sorted</span><span>(</span><span>paths</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As of Python 3.5, where <code>os.walk</code> uses <code>scandir</code> instead of <code>listdir</code> under the hood, this will magically be from 1.5 to 20 times as fast, depending on operating system and file system.</p>

<p>Go (pre-1.16) has a similar function, <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/path/filepath/#Walk"><code>filepath.Walk</code></a>, but unfortunately the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/os/#FileInfo"><code>FileInfo</code></a> interface wasn’t designed to allow errors to be reported from its various method calls. As we’ve seen, these can sometimes perform system calls – for example, the stat information like <code>Size</code> will always require a system call on Linux. So in Go, the methods need to return an error (in Python they raise an exception).</p>

<p>Is was tempting to wave error handling away to try to reuse the <code>FileInfo</code> interface, so that existing code would get a magical speed-up. In fact, <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/41188">issue 41188</a> is a proposal from Russ Cox suggesting just that (with some <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/41188#issuecomment-690879673">data</a> to show that it’s not as terrible an idea as it sounds). However, <code>stat</code> can and does return errors, so there was potential for things like a file size being returned as 0 on error. As a result, there was significant push-back against trying to wedge it into the existing API, and Russ eventually <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/41188#issuecomment-694596908">acknowledged</a> the lack of consensus and proposed the <code>DirEntry</code> interface instead.</p>

<p>What this means is that, to get the performance gain, <code>filepath.Walk</code> calls need to be changed to <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/path/filepath/#WalkDir"><code>filepath.WalkDir</code></a> – very similar, but the walk function receives a <code>DirEntry</code> instead of a <code>FileInfo</code>.</p>

<p>Here’s what a Go version of <code>list_non_dot</code> would look like with the existing <code>filepath.Walk</code> function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>ListNonDot</span><span>(</span><span>path</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>([]</span><span>string</span><span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>paths</span> <span>[]</span><span>string</span>
    <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>filepath</span><span>.</span><span>Walk</span><span>(</span><span>path</span><span>,</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>p</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span> <span>info</span> <span>os</span><span>.</span><span>FileInfo</span><span>,</span>
                                    <span>err</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>error</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>strings</span><span>.</span><span>HasPrefix</span><span>(</span><span>info</span><span>.</span><span>Name</span><span>(),</span> <span>"."</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>if</span> <span>info</span><span>.</span><span>IsDir</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>return</span> <span>filepath</span><span>.</span><span>SkipDir</span>
            <span>}</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>err</span>
        <span>}</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>!</span><span>info</span><span>.</span><span>IsDir</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>paths</span> <span>=</span> <span>append</span><span>(</span><span>paths</span><span>,</span> <span>p</span><span>)</span>
        <span>}</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>err</span>
    <span>})</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>paths</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will keep working in Go 1.16, of course, but if you want the performance benefits you’ll have to make some very small changes – in this case just changing <code>Walk</code> to <code>WalkDir</code>, and changing <code>os.FileInfo</code> to <code>os.DirEntry</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>filepath</span><span>.</span><span>WalkDir</span><span>(</span><span>path</span><span>,</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>p</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span> <span>info</span> <span>os</span><span>.</span><span>DirEntry</span><span>,</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For what it’s worth, running the first function on my home directory on Linux, once cached, takes about 580ms. The new version using Go 1.16 takes about 370ms – roughly 1.5x as fast. Not a huge difference, but worth it – and you get much larger speed-ups on networked file systems and on Windows.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>The new <code>ReadDir</code> API is easy to use, and integrates nicely with the new file system interface via <code>fs.ReadDir</code>. And to speed up your existing <code>Walk</code> calls, the tweaks you’ll need to make to switch to <code>WalkDir</code> are trivial.</p>

<p>API design is hard. Cross-platform, OS-related API design is even harder. Be sure to get this right when designing your next programming language’s standard library! :-)</p>

<p>In any case, I’m glad that Go’s support for reading directories will no longer be lagging behind – or <em>walking</em> behind – Python.</p>

But, as a new faction rises up in the Democratic Party—<a href="https://www.theirisnyc.com/post/where-do-progressive-democrats-go-from-here" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>the Progressives</u></span></a>—the formerly straightforward characterization of these positions is becoming increasingly nuanced. </span></p><p id="viewer-1iblb"><span>Progressives have a much more pro-firearm outlook than the typical Democrat. In an <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/heres-2020-democrats-differ-gun-control/story?id=62970498" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>ABC News analysis</u></span></a> of the 2020 Democratic presidential primary field and their stances on gun control, a common trope reveals itself: the progressives limit their gun policies to popular, common-sense restrictions, such as waiting periods and registries, and the moderates favor large, sweeping actions such as nationwide gun buybacks. </span></p><p id="viewer-ao6rs"><span>This was best exemplified in the standard-bearers for each faction of the Democratic Party: moderate President Joe Biden turned gun buybacks and a complete ban on assault weapons into a <a href="https://joebiden.com/gunsafety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>cornerstone</u></span></a> of his campaign, and Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT), the progressive, has scorned the “unconstitutional” idea of policies like buybacks, wrenching praise even from outlets like <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/bernie-sanders-gun-buyback-confiscation-iowa-rally" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>Fox News</u></span></a>. </span></p><p id="viewer-81hkr"><span>The rise of the Progressives has undoubtedly changed the face of American politics for a good long while. The Progressives, who represent one of the leftmost factions of the modern American political scene, have many <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/why-socialism-is-back" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>openly socialist</u></span></a> members, as well as others aligned with members of modern leftist organizations. One unexpected side effect of the growth of this new faction is the increased presence of gun owners and firearm advocates that sing the praises of guns from a very left-leaning perspective. </span></p><p id="viewer-d4lvi"><span>Much of the far-left approaches gun politics from a Marxist perspective. They view attempts to limit gun ownership and other restrictions on firearms as attempts to disarm the working class. Progressive firearm proponents view gun ownership rights as they view most policies: through the lens of class. In their eyes, a gun-less population is at the mercy of a government with a “monopoly on violence,” as one leftist puts it in an interview with <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/gy5ex9/the-leftist-argument-against-gun-control" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>Vice Magazine</u></span></a>. They argue that their primary rival, the far-right, has access to guns, so <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/11/how-liberal-gun-owners-see-2020-self-defense-is-self-care.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>they should, too</u></span></a>. </span></p><p id="viewer-e4a02"><span>The far-left has a long, proud tradition of being pro-firearm. Nowhere is this more true than in the US. Take the Black Panther Party—the famous (or infamous) Black Power group that was founded as a pushback to the widespread anti-Black violence in Civil Rights-era America. The group was infamous for their prolific use of firearms and their <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/03/black-panther-party-revolution-fred-hampton" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>socialist beliefs</u></span></a>—so much so that they scared then-California Governor Ronald Reagan into passing some of the <a href="https://www.history.com/news/black-panthers-gun-control-nra-support-mulford-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>strictest gun control</u></span></a> legislation the US had ever seen.</span></p><p id="viewer-5u6rh"><span>As leftism has become more prominent in modern US politics, pro-gun groups in the spirit of the Black Panthers have emerged. Take the <a href="https://socialistra.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>Socialist Rifle Association</u></span></a>, a far-left firearms group founded in Wichita, Kansas, which has a membership of 10,000 people across 33 states. Also hailing from Kansas is the group <a href="https://www.redneckrevolt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>Redneck Revolt</u></span></a>, an anti-capitalism, pro-Second Amendment group of working-class people with chapters in 30 states. </span></p><p id="viewer-46sie"><span>These gun groups all have several characteristics that decidedly separate leftist gun enthusiasts from their right-wing counterparts. For one, a common theme among these organizations is the <a href="https://www.flatlandkc.org/news-issues/left-wing-groups-take-up-arms-in-name-of-abolitionist-john-brown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>veneration of John Brown</u></span></a>, a fervent, radical abolitionist from the 1850s whose fight against slavery was so rabid that it led him to kill several slave masters during Bleeding Kansas, and, alongside a band of likeminded abolitionists, to unsuccessfully raid a federal munitions site in Harper’s Ferry, Virginia. It comes as no surprise that Brown, a native Kansan, would appeal to groups that were founded in Kansas, where Brown is something of a local hero (<a href="https://www.voanews.com/usa/debate-still-rages-over-controversial-american-abolitionist-john-brown" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>for some</u></span></a>). </span></p><p id="viewer-bppfi"><span>Another characteristic unique to far-left gun groups is their protectiveness of the LGBTQ+ community. Transgender Pride flags are common affixtures to the firearms of groups like the Socialist Rifle Association (SRA), 33% of whose members are members of the LGBTQ+ community. In fact, members of the leftist Puget Sound John Brown Gun Club have a history of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/22/if-others-have-rifles-well-have-rifles-why-leftist-groups-are-taking-up-arms" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>showing up</u></span></a> to LGBTQ+ Pride marches in order to ‘defend’ the paraders from far-right organizations that tend to make themselves present at such events. </span></p><p id="viewer-eu8kc"><span>This new paradigm of socialist groups being pro-firearm has deep roots, but this entrance into the mainstream is very new. The SRA and Redneck Revolt were founded in 2018 and 2016, respectively, and their memberships have proliferated across the nation in the years since. The slow march of radical leftist gun groups is a political trend that threatens to upend the normal classification of the parties and their stances on gun control. One thing is for certain, however: the Second Amendment has nothing to lose but its stereotypes. </span></p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

	<h2>How the software becomes unmaintainable? – a practical example</h2>
<p>(<em>Everyday Code – instead of keeping our knowledge in a README.md let’s share it with the internet)</em></p>



<p>An ugly, sometimes over neglected truth of the industry is that the software that we work on does not become unmaintainable and tedious and difficult to work with overnight. It becomes like this with every change we introduce. While each individual change might not be “that bad” when they pile up we no longer have a well decoupled, maintainable system. We end up with a mess, which we than re-write with a new framework, a new team, new concepts and architecture just trying to do better. But the problem most of the time is in the single change that we do today – is it making the software system better or worse?</p>



<p>This article is about a practical example of today and how we got to stop it.</p>



<h2>To better or worse </h2>



<p>When developing software incrementally we introduce changes. There are basically two options – the new changes would make the system better or they will make it worse. </p>



<p>Here is the change from today</p>



<pre><code>--- a/file1.rb

<p>The logic is not important. We basically get the video for a material. What’s important is the code is practically the same in all 3 places. 4 calls in three files and they are all the same. </p>



<p>In the past I was leading a class in Software Development. One thing I tried to teach each student was:</p>



<blockquote><p>When you copy and paste you introduce a bug. That’s a fact of the industry.</p></blockquote>



<p>The reason is that once you copy/paste you would have to support the same logic in more than one place and you would simply forget about the second place the next time you would like to change the logic. It might not be you, it might be colleagues working years from now on the same code, but they will forget to change both places. That’s the problem with redundancy. </p>



<div><div>
<blockquote><p>Remove the redundancy, and you remove most of the bugs</p></blockquote>
</div></div>



<h2>How did we stop it?</h2>



<p>Simple review. Just ask a second person to check your commit. This simple review process protects you from a large portion of the other bugs that are still left after you’ve cleared all the redundancies (of course).</p>



<h2>Enjoy</h2>



<p>The code in question is part of the logic delivering these instructions. See how the video is displayed. That’s what the feature was about. Enjoy.</p>

        <article>
          <h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/has2k1/plotnine">plotnine</a> is a data visualisation package for Python based on the grammar of graphics, created by Hassan Kibirige. Its API is similar to <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a>, a widely successful R package by <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/authors.html">Hadley Wickham and others</a>.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I’m a staunch proponent of ggplot2. The underlying grammar of graphics is accompanied by a consistent API that allows you to quickly and iteratively create different types of beautiful data visualisations while rarely having to consult the documentation. A welcoming set of properties when doing exploratory data analysis.</p>

<p>I must admit that I haven’t tried every data visualisation package there is for Python, but when it comes to the most popular ones, I personally find them either
convenient but limited (<a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/visualization.html">pandas</a>),
flexible but complicated (<a href="https://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a>), or
beautiful but inconsistent (<a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/">seaborn</a>). Your mileage may vary. plotnine, on the other hand, shows a lot of promise.
I estimate it currently has a 95% coverage of ggplot2’s functionality, and it’s still actively being developed.
All in all, as someone who uses both R and Python, I’m very pleased to be able to transfer my ggplot2 knowledge to the Python ecosystem.</p>

<p>I figured that plotnine could use a good tutorial so that perhaps more Pythonistas would give this package a shot.
Instead of writing one from scratch, I turned to the, in my opinion, best free tutorial for ggplot2: <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/">R for Data Science</a> by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund, published by O’Reilly Media in 2016.</p>

<p><img src="https://datascienceworkshops.com/assets/img/blog/plotnine-grammar-of-graphics-for-python/cover.png"></p>

<p>All I had to do was translate<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> the visualization chapters (chapter 3 and 28) from R and ggplot2 to Python and plotnine.
I would like to thank Hadley, Garrett, and O’Reilly Media, for granting me permission to do so.
Translating an existing text is quicker than writing a new one, and has the benefit that it becomes possible to compare both the syntax and coverage of plotnine to ggplot2.</p>

<p>However, while quicker, translating is not always straightforward.
I have tried to change as little as possible to the original text while making sure that the text and the code are still in sync.
In case any errors or falsehoods have been introduced due to translation, then I’m the one to blame.
For example, to the best of my knowledge, neither authors have made any claims about plotnine.
If you find such an error and think it is fixable, then it would be greatly appreciated if you’d let me know by <a href="https://github.com/datascienceworkshops/r4ds-python-plotnine/issues">creating an issue on Github</a>. Thank you.
The section numbers in this tutorial link back to the corresponding section of the original text, in case you want to compare them.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> Only this preface and the few footnotes scattered among the text are entirely mine.</p>

<p>This tutorial is also available as a <a href="https://github.com/datascienceworkshops/r4ds-python-plotnine/blob/master/output/r4ds-python-plotnine.ipynb">Jupyter notebook</a> and an <a href="https://github.com/datascienceworkshops/r4ds-python-plotnine/blob/master/output/r4ds-python-plotnine.Rmd">R notebook</a> in case you want to follow along.
If you clone the <a href="https://github.com/datascienceworkshops/r4ds-python-plotnine">Github repository</a> then you can find the notebooks in the <code>output</code> directory.
The <a href="https://github.com/datascienceworkshops/r4ds-python-plotnine/blob/master/README.md">README</a> contains instructions on how to run the notebooks.
The Jupyter notebook is also available on <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/datascienceworkshops/r4ds-python-plotnine/master?filepath=output%2Fr4ds-python-plotnine.ipynb">Binder</a>, but keep in mind that the interactive version may take a while to launch.</p>

<p>Without further ado, let’s start learning about plotnine!</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Jeroen</p>



<h2 id="31introduction"><a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#introduction-1">3.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst’s mind
than any other device.” — John Tukey</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This tutorial will teach you how to visualise your data using plotnine. Python has many packages for making graphs, but plotnine is one of the most elegant and most versatile. plotnine implements the <strong>grammar of graphics</strong>, a coherent system for describing and building graphs. With plotnine, you can do more faster by learning one system and applying it in many places.</p>

<p>If you’d like to learn more about the theoretical underpinnings of plotnine before you start, I’d recommend reading <a href="http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.pdf">The Layered Grammar of Graphics</a>.</p>

<p>This tutorial focusses on plotnine. We’ll also use a little numpy and pandas for data manipulation. To access the datasets, help pages, and functions that we will use in this tutorial, import<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> the necessary packages by running this code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>plotnine</span> <span>import</span> <span>*</span>
<span>from</span> <span>plotnine.data</span> <span>import</span> <span>*</span>

<span>import</span> <span>numpy</span> <span>as</span> <span>np</span>
<span>import</span> <span>pandas</span> <span>as</span> <span>pd</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you run this code and get the error message <code>ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'plotnine'</code>, you’ll need to first install it<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>, then run the code once again.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>! pip install plotnine[all]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You only need to install a package once, but you need to import it every time you run your script or (re)start the kernel.</p>

<h2 id="32first-steps"><a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#first-steps">3.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First steps</h2>

<p>Let’s use our first graph to answer a question: Do cars with big engines use more fuel than cars with small engines? You probably already have an answer, but try to make your answer precise. What does the relationship between engine size and fuel efficiency look like? Is it positive? Negative? Linear? Nonlinear?</p>

<h3 id="321the-mpg-dataframe"><a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#the-mpg-data-frame">3.2.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <code>mpg</code> DataFrame</h3>

<p>You can test your answer with the <code>mpg</code> DataFrame found in <code>plotnine.data</code>. A DataFrame is a rectangular collection of variables (in the columns) and observations (in the rows). <code>mpg</code> contains observations collected by the US Environmental Protection Agency on 38 models of car.</p>

<p>Among the variables in <code>mpg</code> are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><code>displ</code>, a car’s engine size, in litres.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>hwy</code>, a car’s fuel efficiency on the highway, in miles per gallon (mpg).
  A car with a low fuel efficiency consumes more fuel than a car with a high
  fuel efficiency when they travel the same distance.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>To learn more about <code>mpg</code>, open its help page by running <code>?mpg</code>.</p>

<h3 id="322creating-a-ggplot"><a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#creating-a-ggplot">3.2.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating a ggplot</h3>

<p>To plot <code>mpg</code>, run this code<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> to put <code>displ</code> on the x-axis and <code>hwy</code> on the y-axis:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>ggplot</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>=</span><span>mpg</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span>\
<span>geom_point</span><span>(</span><span>mapping</span><span>=</span><span>aes</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>=</span><span>"displ"</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>=</span><span>"hwy"</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://datascienceworkshops.com/assets/img/blog/plotnine-grammar-of-graphics-for-python/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png"></p>

<p>The plot shows a negative relationship between engine size (<code>displ</code>) and fuel efficiency (<code>hwy</code>). In other words, cars with big engines use more fuel. Does this confirm or refute your hypothesis about fuel efficiency and engine size?</p>

<p>With plotnine, you begin a plot with the function <code>ggplot()</code>. <code>ggplot()</code> creates a coordinate system that you can add layers to. The first argument of <code>ggplot()</code> is the dataset to use in the graph. So <code>ggplot(data=mpg)</code> creates an empty graph, but it’s not very interesting so I’m not going to show it here.</p>

<p>You complete your graph by adding one or more layers to <code>ggplot()</code>. The function <code>geom_point()</code> adds a layer of points to your plot, which creates a scatterplot. plotnine comes with many geom functions that each add a different type of layer to a plot. You’ll learn a whole bunch of them throughout this tutorial.</p>

<p>Each geom function in plotnine takes a <code>mapping</code> argument. This defines how variables in your dataset are mapped to visual properties. The <code>mapping</code> argument is always paired with <code>aes()</code>, and the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> arguments of <code>aes()</code> specify which variables to map to the x and y axes. plotnine looks for the mapped variables in the <code>data</code> argument, in this case, <code>mpg</code>.</p>

<h3 id="323a-graphing-template"><a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#a-graphing-template">3.2.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A graphing template</h3>

<p>Let’s turn this code into a reusable template for making graphs with plotnine. To make a graph, replace the bracketed sections in the code below with a dataset, a geom function, or a collection of mappings.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>ggplot(data=&lt;DATA&gt;) +\
&lt;GEOM_FUNCTION&gt;(mapping=aes(&lt;MAPPINGS&gt;))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The rest of this tutorial will show you how to complete and extend this template to make different types of graphs. We will begin with the <code>&lt;MAPPINGS&gt;</code> component.</p>

<h3 id="324exercises"><a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#exercises">3.2.4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exercises</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Run <code>ggplot(data=mpg)</code>. What do you see?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many rows are in <code>mpg</code>? How many columns?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What does the <code>drv</code> variable describe?  Read the help for <code>?mpg</code> to find
out.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make a scatterplot of <code>hwy</code> vs <code>cyl</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What happens if you make a scatterplot of <code>class</code> vs <code>drv</code>? Why is
the plot not useful?</p>

<h2 id="33aesthetic-mappings"><a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#aesthetic-mappings">3.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aesthetic mappings</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we
never expected to see.” — John Tukey</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the plot below, one group of points (highlighted in red) seems to fall outside of the linear trend. These cars have a higher mileage than you might expect. How can you explain these cars?</p>

<p><img src="https://datascienceworkshops.com/assets/img/blog/plotnine-grammar-of-graphics-for-python/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png"></p>

<p>Let’s hypothesize that the cars are hybrids. One way to test this hypothesis is to look at the <code>class</code> value for each car. The <code>class</code> variable of the <code>mpg</code> dataset classifies cars into groups such as compact, midsize, and SUV. If the outlying points are hybrids, they should be classified as compact cars or, perhaps, subcompact cars (keep in mind that this data was collected before hybrid trucks and SUVs became popular).</p>

<p>You can add a third variable, like <code>class</code>, to a two dimensional scatterplot by mapping it to an <strong>aesthetic</strong>. An aesthetic is a visual property of the objects in your plot. Aesthetics include things like the size, the shape, or the color of your points. You can display a point (like the one below) in different ways by changing the values of its aesthetic properties. Since we already use the word “value” to describe data, let’s use the word “level” to describe aesthetic properties. Here we change the levels of a point’s size, shape, and color to make the point small, triangular, or blue:</p>

<center><h6><em> Gambling online is set to become easier than ever thanks to Google's upcoming changes</em></h6></center>

<p>Being stuck inside is tough. Millions have given in to their impulsive urges to indulge in behaviour which will probably not be in their best interests long term, but which massively benefit the tech companies who have the reach and power to become the provider of choice - even on a local level.</p>

<p>Food delivery companies such as DoorDash have <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doordash-shows-delivery-profitable-pandemic/"> seen profits soar</a>. Netflix has experienced <a href="https://news.abs-cbn.com/business/01/20/21/netflix-keeps-growing-in-pandemic-tops-200-million-subscribers"> stronger-than-expected subscriber growth</a> Home orders of all types have allowed Amazon to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348368/amazon-q2-2020-earnings-covid-19-coronavirus-jeff-bezos"> double its profits</a> during the first months of the pandemic.</p>

<p>Naturally, Pornhub - <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/the-end-of-pornhubs-campaign-of-intimidation"> weathering it’s own crisis</a>, has nonetheless been doing extraordinarily well as one-handed typists work from home.</p>

<p>But what about those wanting to let rip with their baser instincts once the post porn euphoria has worn off?</p>

<p>A flutter on the fight, maybe. A wager on the winners. A bet on the boxing. A gamble on the golf.</p>

<p>Or maybe the simple joys of mindlessly pushing a coin into a slot, pulling a lever and watch the fruit fall into place.</p>

<p>While there have been virtual equivalents for those unable to visit a bricks and mortar bookies, they have generally been limited to desktop computers. With the notable exception of Android users in Brazil, Ireland, France, and the United Kingdom, gambling with real money on Android has been verbotten.</p>

<p>From March 1, 2021, <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9934569"> that’s set to change</a>, and being in lockdown won’t make a difference to your ability to throw your money down the drain.</p>

<p><img src="https://thecrow.uk/assets/google_gambling_statement.jpg" alt="Google's statement on gambling with real money in apps"></p>

<p>“We’re updating our Real-Money Gambling, Games, and Contests policy so more developers around the world can build sustainable businesses, and in a way that helps keep consumers safe,” Google’s Upcoming Policy Changes Statement reads, before going on to list all of the new countries where needy gamblers will soon be able to spend their cash - with a suitable commission to Google, of course.</p>

<p>The countries where in-app, real-money gambling will be allowed are: Australia, Belgium, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Romania, Spain, Sweden, and the United States.</p>

<p>Exactly how giving billions of bored potential customers this ‘opportunity’ keeps them safe, we don’t know. maybe it keeps them away from the local cock fights.</p>

<p>Not that there’s anything intrinsically wrong with gambling. The Crow loses a tenner on the <a href="https://www.grandnational.org.uk/"> Grand National</a> every year like clockwork. Millions of people gamble on a regular basis without developing a problem - but then again, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-50828086"> millions don’t</a>.</p>

<p>And when your phone is in your pocket with real money gambling apps installed, and you’re bored, there’s really nothing to stop you. You don’t even need to get out of bed and head to the nearest desktop or laptop. You can do it on the toilet.</p>

<p>The rules which govern the no-doubt upcoming flood of gambling apps on Android are available <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9877032?hl=en"> here.</a> they’re painfully short on details.</p>

<p>Stay tuned and we’ll keep you posted.</p>

<section name="898d"><div><div><h3 name="92f1" id="92f1">Silicon Valley hasn’t innovated since&nbsp;1978</h3><p name="8f6e" id="8f6e">I’m serious. Name one thing in computing that showed up after 1978 that wasn’t either an incremental improvement on a pre-1978 technology or a crappier but cheaper version of a pre-1978 technology. I’m not trying to produce sophistry here. There’s a huge difference in the level of novelty of original research in computing tech during the span 1940–1980 and the level of novelty in the same after 1980, &amp; it relates directly to economics.</p><p name="03e4" id="03e4">From 1940 to 1980, computer science was being done by folks with doctorates &amp; experience in other disciplines, funded by government money to do pure research &amp; moonshot shit — especially ARPA funding starting in the wake of Sputnik for ed-tech. When that funding dried up, so did productivity in original research, because the ability to continue to be employed depended on profitability in a consumer market (which means racing to market… which means avoiding risky detours).</p><p name="5abb" id="5abb">The exact same people have drastically different productivity levels with the two models. Kay at PARC in the 70s went from having seen a sketchpad demo to having a complete functioning live-editable GUI with network transparency in 10 years, because of government ed-tech money. In the early 80s, Kay moved to Atari &amp; tried to continue the kind of work he had been doing. And then he got laid off, and went to Apple, got laid off again. The work he started in the 70s has been treading water because short term profits can’t support deep research.</p><p name="2b49" id="2b49">This isn’t to say that what has happened since isn’t valuable. The computing technologies developed prior to 1980 have mostly become cheap enough that they have become accessible to a mass audience, in part because of iteration on manufacturing techniques, &amp; mostly because of cheap labor (in the form of fresh-out-of-college CS students who will write bad code for half of what you’d pay the PhDs to refuse to write bad code, and will work unpaid overtime if you give them a ball pit and a superiority complex). But, using 70s tech to make 60s tech bigger (ex., deep neural networks) isn’t innovation — it’s doing the absolute most obvious thing under the circumstances, which is all that can be defended in a context of short-term profitability.</p><p name="b094" id="b094">What armies of clerks were doing in the 30s was ‘computation’, sure, but it’s very different. The pointing devices we use, the look and feel of our UIs, and our UI metaphors haven’t changed since the 70s except in terms of resolution. Our network protocols haven’t much either.</p><p name="a323" id="a323">This is to say:</p><p name="73b3" id="73b3">Somebody who had used an Alto in 1979 could travel through time and sit down at a modern PC and know basically how to do most tasks — they would think of a modern PC as a faster but less featureful stripped down Alto clone, like the Star was. They could probably even code on it — they would have been familiar with UNIX shells &amp; C, &amp; with SGML-style markup. They would find it disappointingly awkard compared to Interlisp-D and Smalltalk environments they’re used to, but they could make it work.</p><p name="bae4" id="bae4">Meanwhile, to somebody from 1940, home computer tech of 1980 would be mind-blowing. Such a person, even if they were in computing, would not be familiar with the concept of a programming language (since stored program computers didn’t exist yet).</p><p name="abd5" id="abd5">The VC model ties into this difference. The best possible outcome, under the VC model, is that actual costs are low &amp; the VCs get wild profits in the short term, after which they sell their stakes &amp; don’t need to care anymore. The easiest &amp; most reliable way to do that is a ponzi scheme (or, to be more technically correct, the pyramid-selling of hype — in this case, to other, marginally less savvy investors). With enough cash floating around, you can keep a company that provides no service &amp; has no income afloat indefinitely, and everyone involved becomes a paper millionaire.</p><p name="19e5" id="19e5">The goal of ARPA from ’57 to ’78 was quite different: to encourage children to become engineers in order to have an edge in a high-tech hot-war that never really ended up coming, and to build tech that lets them bootstrap new tech more easily. Massive short-term losses in that. (It obviously didn’t exactly work: we did end up getting a lot of cheap engineers, but few of them had the background to be able to more-than-iteratively improve upon the tech they grew up on, even had they been allowed to by management.)</p><p name="0b05" id="0b05">The difference in development between the first 40 years of CS and the second 40 is absolutely not the result of the low-hanging fruit all being picked. The most interesting technical work is being done by individuals and small groups still. Important features &amp; useful tools that were well known in the late 70s are actually missing from modern tech because of gaps in education &amp; because having them prevents some avenues toward monetization.

Making money &amp; making tech are very different skills, often fundamentally at odds: good tech is very often not profitable and the most profitable tech is just varying reframings of rentseeking. Very few people can do both well, and SV has a bias toward profit. Because of this, in most cases, the product isn’t actually the tech but the techwashing. Apple’s an excellent case in point.

		<p>This is just a short post about something I recently discovered in the Rust ecosystem:</p>
<p><code>Criterion</code> + <code>pprof</code> = 🔥</p>
<p>If you have a Medium subscription and want to support me, you can <a href="https://jibbow.medium.com/automatic-flamegraphs-for-benchmarks-with-criterion-f8e59499cc2a">read this post on Medium</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs">Criterion</a> is a well-known and often-used benchmarking framework in the Rust ecosystem.
If you’ve not yet heard of it, definitely check it out!</p>
<p>Since <code>v0.3</code>, Criterion supports <a href="https://bheisler.github.io/criterion.rs/book/user_guide/profiling.html#implementing-in-process-profiling-hooks">in-process profiling hooks</a>.
They allow us to use a custom profiler while running benchmarks.
After registering a custom profiler, we can enable them by running the benchmark suite with the <code>--profile-time</code> flag.</p>
<p>Having hooks for a custom profiler for your benchmarks allows you to do <em>awesome</em> stuff, for example generating flamegraphs for every benchmark with <a href="https://crates.io/crates/pprof"><code>pprof</code></a>.</p>

<p>One question I often ask myself when looking at benchmarks is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“These numbers are great. But how can we do this faster? Where do we spend the most time?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This question can often be answered by looking at flamegraphs.</p>
<p>Previously, I got my hands dirty using <a href="https://github.com/flamegraph-rs/flamegraph"><code>cargo-flamegraph</code></a>, which is a really good tool on its own.
But the problem is that when using <a href="https://github.com/flamegraph-rs/flamegraph"><code>cargo-flamegraph</code></a> with benchmarks, you will usually get some unnecessary clutter, e.g. the setup routine for your benchmark and the enclosing framework code from Criterion.</p>
<p>And here comes another cool Rust library into play: <a href="https://crates.io/crates/pprof"><code>pprof</code></a> with the <code>flamegraph</code> feature!</p>
<p><a href="https://crates.io/crates/pprof"><code>pprof</code></a> is a CPU profiler that can be used to profile specific parts of your program on Linux.
The best of all: It even supports generating flamegraphs with the feature flag <code>flamegraph</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s directly dive in and create a <code>pprof</code> integration for Criterion!</p>

<p>We will now create a custom profiler for <code>criterion</code> with <code>pprof</code> that will print flamegraphs for each benchmark.</p>
<p>First, add the following dependencies to your <code>Cargo.toml</code>:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="toml"><span>[</span><span>dev</span><span>-</span><span>dependencies</span><span>]</span>
<span>pprof</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>version</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.3"</span><span>,</span> <span>features</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>"flamegraph"</span><span>]</span> <span>}</span>
<span>criterion</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0.3"</span>
<span># criterion-macro = "0.3"  # optional, if you use custom test frameworks</span>
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>Now create a new file in your <code>benches/</code> folder. Let’s call it <code>perf.rs</code>.
Here we will implement our new <code>FlamegraphProfiler</code>.</p>
<p>The interface for implementing a custom profiler is actually quite straight-forward.
We only need to implement the <a href="https://docs.rs/criterion/*/criterion/profiler/trait.Profiler.html"><code>criterion::profiler::Profiler</code></a> trait from Criterion and we are good to go.</p>

</span><span>/// Also see [the Criterion documentation on this][custom-profiler].
</span><span>///
</span><span>/// ## Example on how to enable the custom profiler:
</span><span>///
</span><span>/// ```
</span><span>/// mod perf;
</span><span>/// use perf::FlamegraphProfiler;
</span><span>///
</span><span>/// fn fibonacci_profiled(criterion: &amp;mut Criterion) {
</span><span>///     // Use the criterion struct as normal here.
</span><span>/// }
</span><span>///
</span><span>/// fn custom() -&gt; Criterion {
</span><span>///     Criterion::default().with_profiler(FlamegraphProfiler::new())
</span><span>/// }
</span><span>///
</span><span>/// criterion_group! {
</span><span>///     name = benches;
</span><span>///     config = custom();
</span><span>///     targets = fibonacci_profiled
</span><span>/// }
</span><span>/// ```
</span><span>///
</span><span>/// The neat thing about this is that it will sample _only_ the benchmark, and not other stuff like
</span><span>/// the setup process.
</span><span>///
</span><span>/// Further, it will only kick in if `--profile-time &lt;time&gt;` is passed to the benchmark binary.
</span><span>/// A flamegraph will be created for each individual benchmark in its report directory under
</span><span>/// `profile/flamegraph.svg`.

Most people listen to digital music, if they listen at all, and won’t preach digital over analog. That’s typically because it takes a lot to pull someone out of their comfort zone and make them listen to a vinyl record. And that’s because digital is everywhere and seems to do the job well enough. What more could you be looking for?</p> <p>Many vinyl enthusiasts may have been searching for that nostalgia from their childhood, or they got to listen to a record play first-hand, or perhaps they were simply brave (and curious) enough to take that leap. Regardless, when most of them finally get to that side, they find it hard to turn back.</p> <p>Well, for the digital enthusiast who wonders what all the fuss is about, or the vinyl lover who wants to be sure that their ears don’t deceive them, the question is, <em>is vinyl better than digital? </em>That is exactly what this article sets out to answer.</p> <p>If you are more interested at vinyl, <a href="https://audio-test.online/how-to-choose-the-right-record-player/">see our guide how to choose the right one</a>. </p> <nav role="navigation" aria-label="Table Of Contents"></nav> <h2>The Difference Between the Analog and Digital Formats</h2> <p>We’re about to get a little bit scientific here. It’s important that you have a good idea of the distinction between analog and digital music formats and how they produce their sound. Fortunately, it is not very complicated.</p> <p>A speaker works by using electrical pulses to vibrate a driver at specific frequencies. This precise vibration is what produces the sound.</p>  <p>A record player uses the undulations in the grooves to move the stylus, and that produces changes in the electrical signal. These electrical signals are fed directly to the speaker and come out as sound. There’s absolutely no barrier between the sound that was intended to be heard and the sound that comes out, beyond the state of the physical record of course.</p> <p>Meanwhile, digital audio starts off as analog signals but it gets digitized at a point. This digitization converts the patterns of electrical signals that make up a song, into code that can be stored as a file. Then when it is played back, this digital audio is converted back into electrical signals which feed a speaker.</p> <p>That entire process of digitizing analog audio is where many vinyl audiophiles will take off. Some turntables give the option of digitizing vinyl records, but most analog enthusiasts will only take this to preserve the music, seeing as the record itself will lose its quality.</p> <h2>How Does Digital Get the Edge Over Analog?</h2> <p>Of course, you’ll find the debate on sound to be something that might be never-ending. So, in order to compare these effectively, I want to focus on aspects other than the sound for now. In what ways beyond the sonic quality, does digital music beat out vinyl?</p> <ul><li>It is eternal. That might sound rather dramatic, but it’s the truth. As long as the storage device you have the file on lives, so will the music. The fact that you can also upload it to the cloud or share it with other people, helps to augment the music’s immortality. With vinyl records, your music can get damaged. If it breaks or gets damaged, the audio quality takes an equivalent dive.</li><li>It is convenient. To play a vinyl record, you need a turntable, a speaker, and a record. These aren’t the smallest of objects. It’s pretty much pointless thinking that you can conveniently listen to a vinyl record anywhere that is not your own home. With digital, you can take thousands and tens of thousands of songs with you anywhere you go, and they can be stored in something as small as an iPod, or the smartphone that you carry with you everywhere anyway.</li><li>It is easily modifiable. There are so many DAWs and audio editing tools. They stretch as far as the eye can see, and the options that they give producers for editing music are vast. This comes down to the consumer by making it easier for producers and labels to give you the music you love. Some types of music, such as electronic dance music, would be pretty much impossible to create with analog methods, though high-quality digital files can be pressed to vinyl.</li></ul> <h2>In What Ways Does Vinyl Reign Supreme?</h2> <p>Okay, so now that we have gotten digital out of the way, how is vinyl superior? Sound is a very important consideration here, because even the most dedicated of vinyl lovers will be able to tell you that it is clearly disadvantaged in a lot of other places.</p> <ul><li>Owning the physical copy of the music appeals to many. Especially considering the stylish artwork that these vinyl records come with, it’s like having a gallery of art attached to your music collection, and that can be pretty cool.</li><li>The ritual of listening to a vinyl record is something that many people adore. Picking out a record, placing it on the platter, setting the tonearm down, and letting the stylus fit perfectly; all of this is a ritual that analog listeners feel adds to the experience. Along with the fact that you get to listen to the album in its entirety, without the opportunity to skip. It allows you to appreciate the musical profile of the entire LP. But for this to be a solid advantage, you’ll probably need to fall in love with the sound first. Speaking of the sound…</li><li>The sound. Oh yes, the sound. This is what the vinyl enthusiasts want from a record and they’ll definitely tell you that they get it. The major thing cited by most people is the warmth, known as the <em>analog warmth</em>. We’ve talked a bit about analog signals above, so you should understand that when you hear a vinyl record that was produced back in the day, it had the band or singer perform the song through analog equipment such as mics and preamps and effects (especially if an electric guitar was involved). This was directly recorded onto a <em>master recording<strong>,</strong></em> which could be a cassette or a vinyl record, and all other copies of the song are duplicated from that. The analog equipment produces a unique sound that is quite a bit different from what you can hear straight from digital methods. The fact that the vinyl was recorded analog and is played back analog means that you hear the song exactly as it was performed, which is honestly, quite appealing. For many who have sampled vinyl, the audio is superior due to that added warmth.</li></ul> <h2>Sound-wise, Is There an Objective Winner?</h2> <p>Honestly speaking, no. The very best digital music besides the very best analog music will sound great either way. There will be a distinct quality to either, but it is hard to say that one is absolutely better than the other.</p> <p>However, when it comes to how we perceive the music subjectively, there is a lot that goes in favor of vinyl, and it can explain why it has such a reputation among audiophiles. I am going to delve slightly into the “Loudness War”, which most audio lovers know a thing or two about, and dynamic range as well.</p> <div><figure><img width="800" height="482" alt="loudness war of digital records" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" nitro-lazy-srcset="https://cdn-ajnfi.nitrocdn.com/EHHIyYlvMKytfguTZSyZUJjkirUURTzL/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1296fc7e5686d89ab138dc784980aca5.loudness-war-Oneofus_2005.png 800w, https://cdn-ajnfi.nitrocdn.com/EHHIyYlvMKytfguTZSyZUJjkirUURTzL/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/061e9aff00ae5acb4f72b06bb3fc34d6.loudness-war-Oneofus_2005-300x181.png 300w, https://cdn-ajnfi.nitrocdn.com/EHHIyYlvMKytfguTZSyZUJjkirUURTzL/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/b82a8261f7ddc4c02ffc3d80548c8526.loudness-war-Oneofus_2005-768x463.png 768w, https://cdn-ajnfi.nitrocdn.com/EHHIyYlvMKytfguTZSyZUJjkirUURTzL/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/6759c07d22b8e3e458a9654f4eeaee4c.loudness-war-Oneofus_2005-50x30.png 50w" nitro-lazy-src="https://cdn-ajnfi.nitrocdn.com/EHHIyYlvMKytfguTZSyZUJjkirUURTzL/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1296fc7e5686d89ab138dc784980aca5.loudness-war-Oneofus_2005.png" nitro-lazy-empty="" id="Mzc0OjY4Ng==-1" src="https://cdn-ajnfi.nitrocdn.com/EHHIyYlvMKytfguTZSyZUJjkirUURTzL/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1296fc7e5686d89ab138dc784980aca5.loudness-war-Oneofus_2005.png" srcset="https://cdn-ajnfi.nitrocdn.com/EHHIyYlvMKytfguTZSyZUJjkirUURTzL/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1296fc7e5686d89ab138dc784980aca5.loudness-war-Oneofus_2005.png 800w, https://cdn-ajnfi.nitrocdn.com/EHHIyYlvMKytfguTZSyZUJjkirUURTzL/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/061e9aff00ae5acb4f72b06bb3fc34d6.loudness-war-Oneofus_2005-300x181.png 300w, https://cdn-ajnfi.nitrocdn.com/EHHIyYlvMKytfguTZSyZUJjkirUURTzL/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/b82a8261f7ddc4c02ffc3d80548c8526.loudness-war-Oneofus_2005-768x463.png 768w, https://cdn-ajnfi.nitrocdn.com/EHHIyYlvMKytfguTZSyZUJjkirUURTzL/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/6759c07d22b8e3e458a9654f4eeaee4c.loudness-war-Oneofus_2005-50x30.png 50w"><figcaption>Loudness war in one picture</figcaption></figure></div> <p>When recording a song, some instruments and sounds are naturally quieter. They aren’t picked up as well as others. For instance, imagine the soft tones of an acoustic guitar playing in a room that has a drum kit being played. Certain drum sounds like the snare or hi-hat stand out, while the acoustic guitar is relatively calm in the background.</p> <p>When mixing songs digitally, you are allowed a lot of room for modification and editing. While this is normally a huge benefit, it also led to what was the core of the Loudness War, and that is dynamic compression. This essentially allowed the volume of quieter sounds to be increased so that the listener could appreciate them better and they could have more effect in the track.</p> <p>Hearing those parts of the song better is not a bad thing. Unfortunately, it removed from the realism of the track. This is where we can introduce the concept of dynamic range. You find the quietest and the loudest notes in the song, and the difference between them is the dynamic range.</p> <p>While digital music can achieve a higher dynamic range than analog, all the compression going on meant that producers were not taking advantage of this. They were pushing the music too high and losing some of the audio quality as instruments began to clip.</p> <p>When it comes to analog music, the dynamic range you get is exactly as it was when recorded. When someone strikes that hi-hat, you hear it crisp and loud, as close as you can get to how it would sound if you were right there in the room. Analog music was taking advantage of the dynamic range that it had access to.</p> <p>But anyway, what you want to know is whether or not someone wins when it comes to sound. What I can say when it comes to this is, when digital is done right, it can stand right beside vinyl, or even surpass it. Unfortunately, it is not done right enough, which is why the classic recordings that many vinyl records bear will still sound richer and more natural when played on quality equipment.</p> <div><figure><img width="800" height="800" alt="digital vs analog sound" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" nitro-lazy-srcset="https://cdn-ajnfi.nitrocdn.com/EHHIyYlvMKytfguTZSyZUJjkirUURTzL/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/006d934bcc20325060916ce41150ff71.digital-player.jpg 800w, https://cdn-ajnfi.nitrocdn.com/EHHIyYlvMKytfguTZSyZUJjkirUURTzL/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1d80649148d77ac0f8d5ad1580486f77.digital-player-300x300.jpg 300w, https://cdn-ajnfi.nitrocdn.com/EHHIyYlvMKytfguTZSyZUJjkirUURTzL/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/4e371251991fb35126fce782f075e089.digital-player-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cdn-ajnfi.nitrocdn.com/EHHIyYlvMKytfguTZSyZUJjkirUURTzL/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/4281c0fff98bf964a54f675a2a2acbec.digital-player-768x768.jpg 768w, https://cdn-ajnfi.nitrocdn.com/EHHIyYlvMKytfguTZSyZUJjkirUURTzL/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/670cc84856742ea9dd3827baa6ce5ccb.digital-player-50x50.jpg 50w" nitro-lazy-src="https://cdn-ajnfi.nitrocdn.com/EHHIyYlvMKytfguTZSyZUJjkirUURTzL/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/006d934bcc20325060916ce41150ff71.digital-player.jpg" nitro-lazy-empty="" id="NDAyOjcwOQ==-1" src="https://cdn-ajnfi.nitrocdn.com/EHHIyYlvMKytfguTZSyZUJjkirUURTzL/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/006d934bcc20325060916ce41150ff71.digital-player.jpg" srcset="https://cdn-ajnfi.nitrocdn.com/EHHIyYlvMKytfguTZSyZUJjkirUURTzL/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/006d934bcc20325060916ce41150ff71.digital-player.jpg 800w, https://cdn-ajnfi.nitrocdn.com/EHHIyYlvMKytfguTZSyZUJjkirUURTzL/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1d80649148d77ac0f8d5ad1580486f77.digital-player-300x300.jpg 300w, https://cdn-ajnfi.nitrocdn.com/EHHIyYlvMKytfguTZSyZUJjkirUURTzL/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/4e371251991fb35126fce782f075e089.digital-player-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cdn-ajnfi.nitrocdn.com/EHHIyYlvMKytfguTZSyZUJjkirUURTzL/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/4281c0fff98bf964a54f675a2a2acbec.digital-player-768x768.jpg 768w, https://cdn-ajnfi.nitrocdn.com/EHHIyYlvMKytfguTZSyZUJjkirUURTzL/assets/static/optimized/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/670cc84856742ea9dd3827baa6ce5ccb.digital-player-50x50.jpg 50w"><figcaption>Image by Jean van der Meulen from <a href="http://Image by <a href=&quot;https://pixabay.com/users/jeanvdmeulen-919322/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=5055024&quot;>Jean van der Meulen</a> from <a href=&quot;https://pixabay.com/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=5055024&quot;>Pixabay</a>" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pixabay</a></figcaption></figure></div> <h2>In Conclusion, Is Vinyl Better than Digital?</h2> <p>I’ll cut to the chase here. <em>Is vinyl better than digital? </em>There’s no solid yes or no answer to this one.

<h3>The Battle of the Indus: Genghis Khan at India’s Doorstep</h3>
<p>799 years ago, in the year 1221, the great Mongol conqueror <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Genghis-Khan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genghis Khan</a> [1] stood victorious at the western bank of the Indus river with 50,000 soldiers, having just defeated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jalal_ad-Din_Mingburnu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jalal-ad-Din</a> [2], the Shah of Khwarazm. Jalal-ad-Din’s army was completely destroyed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_the_Indus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this battle</a> [3], which took place near the town of Kalabagh in Punjab.</p>
<p>Across the river lay the richest country in the history of the world: India. A land of fabulous wealth. A land that accounted for over <a href="https://archive.org/details/contoursworldeco00madd/page/n393/mode/2up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a third</a> of the entire world’s GDP [4]. A land that would-be invaders fantasized about. A land that was groaning under foreign, Islamic occupation: Northern India was ruled at the time by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Iltutmish" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shams ud-Din Iltutmish</a> [5], the third sultan of the Turkic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mamluk_dynasty_(Delhi)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mamluk dynasty</a> [6], which was founded by Qutb al-Din Aibak in 1206.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>A few months before this battle, Genghis Khan had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mongol_conquest_of_the_Khwarazmian_Empire" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conquered</a> [7] Jalal-ad-Din’s vast Empire of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Khwarazmian_dynasty" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Khwarazm</a> [8]. Khwarazm was a Turkic Empire that ruled Iran. It consisted of Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, parts of Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and much of north-western India, which is today’s Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Genghis Khan sacked and destroyed the great cities of Samarkand, Bukhara, Nishapur, Otrar, and Gurganj. He laid the Islamic heartland to waste. His army burned Islamic libraries and replaced mosques with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070512201848/http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/islam/mongols/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buddhist temples</a> [9]. It devastated Iran and Afghanistan. And he pursued Jalal-ad-Din all the way from Uzbekistan into western India.</p>
<p>Jalal-ad-Din had the same Turkic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mamluk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mamluk</a> [10] ancestry as the invaders who ruled northern India at the time, which is why he hoped that Iltutmish would grant him asylum in India. He was a foreign Turkic invader who ruled Iran, the same way that Iltutmish was a foreign Turkic invader who ruled India. The Iranian people do not look upon Jalal-ad-Din as one of their own, the same way the people of India do not see Iltutmish as one of their own. Or Babur, Akbar, Aurangzeb, or Bahadur Shah Zafar.</p>
<p>So, being granted refuge in India was Jalal-ad Din’s only hope.</p>
<p>He had chosen an excellent defensive position for the battle with the Mongols. It was flanked by high mountains on two sides and the great river on the third side. He had prayed fervently for deliverance, but the miracle never came. His army proved no match for the polytheistic warriors who came from 2000 miles away. It was swept away and slaughtered to the last man.</p>
<h3>Genghis Khan Turns Back</h3>
<p>Genghis Khan watched as Jalal-ad-Din frantically rode his horse across the Indus in a desperate bid to escape. All he had to do was cross the river. If he crossed the river, not only would he be able to kill his enemy, he would also have the opportunity to smash the Delhi sultanate and conquer the world’s richest country.</p>
<p>He had at his command the Mongol army, which he had personally forged into the greatest and deadliest fighting force in the world. It had already done the unthinkable by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mongol_conquest_of_China" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conquering China</a> [11] and <a href="https://www.historytoday.com/archive/genghis-khan-takes-beijing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">capturing Beijing</a> [12]. It had conquered the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Qara_Khitai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qara Khitai Empire</a> [13] in Central Asia. It had conquered the enormous Empire of Khwarazm. This was an unstoppable, all-conquering war machine. The Delhi Sultanate was no match for it.</p>
<p>Genghis Khan is the greatest conqueror in recorded history. He did not lose a single military campaign in his life. He could simply have walked into India, made short work of the Delhi Sultanate, and become the wealthiest man in the world.</p>
<p>Instead, to make a long story short, he turned back. He spurned the heaven-sent, once-in-a-lifetime chance to conquer India. He chose to retreat all the way back to Mongolia. He did leave behind administrators and soldiers to govern Afghanistan. These were the ancestors of today’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hazaras" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hazaras</a> [14].</p>
<h3>Theories: Not Quite Right</h3>
<p>His decision to not invade India has perplexed historians for centuries. It remains an enduring mystery to this day. There are a number of theories about why he made that decision.</p>
<p>Biographies of one of his <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Yelu-Chucai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chinese advisers</a> [15] claim that a <a href="https://www.historytoday.com/chinggis-khan-versus-unicorn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talking unicorn</a> [16] appeared to Genghis at <a href="https://uzbekistan.travel/en/o/iron-gates-sogdiana/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the border of Uzbekistan and India</a> [17] (present-day Afghanistan), and instructed him to return early from India.</p>
<p>Some historians, such as the Persian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Minhaj-i-Siraj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Juzjani</a> [18], believe that India’s hot climate was <a href="https://www.historytoday.com/chinggis-khan-versus-unicorn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">too harsh</a> for the Mongol army [16], which was accustomed to fighting in cold weather. This problem with this theory is that the Mamluks, who established the Delhi Sultanate in 1206, also came from a cold climate. Future Islamic invaders of India such as <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Timur" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Timur</a> [19] and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Babur" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Babur</a> [20] would also come from cold climates. If they could invade India successfully, why couldn’t the far superior Mongols?</p>
<p>It’s therefore clear that these theories don’t hold up to close scrutiny.</p>
<h3>Cultural Affinity with India?</h3>
<p>And then there are claims that Genghis Khan refused to invade India for religious reasons. Mongolia’s ancient polytheistic belief system, which is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tengrism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tengrism</a> [21] in English, has interesting commonalities with Hinduism. And Buddhism, which is another form of Hinduism, has had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Buddhism_in_Mongolia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a presence</a> [22] in Mongolia for nearly two thousand years. His grandson <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Kublai-Khan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kublai Khan</a> [23] would go on to adopt Buddhism as the Mongol Empire’s de-facto state religion. Most Mongols today are Buddhists.</p>
<p>Because of this, it is speculated that he may not have wanted to spill blood in the land that gave birth to Hinduism and Buddhism. This is possible, but it’s also true that by conquering India, he would have freed the land of the genocidal barbarians who had not only destroyed Buddhism in Afghanistan, but were also doing their best to eradicate Hinduism from the rest of India.</p>
<h3>The Key to Understanding the Conqueror and His Motivations</h3>
<p>So how do we deduce the reasons for his decision? To do that, we must understand him as a person, and as a leader.</p>
<p>Now, Genghis Khan is an enigmatic personality. Despite his immense fame and reputation, we don’t really know a lot about him. He did not seek to explain his actions and decisions. He did not leave behind a memoir or account of his career, the way <a href="https://www.livius.org/articles/person/caesar/caesar-11/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Julius Caesar</a> [24], <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Meditations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marcus Aurelius</a> [25], or <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3567/3567-h/3567-h.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> [26] did.</p>
<p>What we know about him comes from two sources. The first is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Secret_History_of_the_Mongols" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Secret History of the Mongols</a> [27], which was written after his death. And the second is the accounts of the people he conquered. The accounts of his enemies.</p>
<p>These sources tell us about the man’s deeds, but not much about his motivations. We know what he did, but we don’t know why he did those things.</p>
<p>To understand why he decided against invading India, we need to gain an insight into his motivations. And to do that, we must examine his life and his career, because therein lie the clues to what motivated him. Let’s do that.</p>
<h3>The Old Enemy: China</h3>
<p>Genghis Khan was born in Mongolia, sometime around the year 1158. His birth name was Temujin. His father <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yesugei" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yesugei</a> [28], the leader of the Borjigin tribe, was a wealthy and powerful man.</p>
<p>The Mongols were a nomadic people, and the Mongolia that Temujin was born in was a disunited, fragmented nation whose tribes were perpetually in conflict. This conflict was engineered by the Empire to the south of Mongolia: China.</p>
<p>Chinese rulers collected tribute from the Mongolian tribes and encouraged rivalries between them. Whenever the Mongols tried to unite, the Chinese launched punitive expeditions against them, either enslaving them, or killing them. One of Temujin’s relatives, the Khan <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ambaghai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ambaghai</a> [29], who attempted to create a confederation of several tribes, was captured, brought to China, and executed by crucifixion and dismemberment a few years before Temujin was born. The Chinese kept the Mongols fighting each other for centuries in this manner.</p>
<h3>Temujin: Genghis Khan’s Early Life and Struggle</h3>
<p>When Temujin was about 12 or 13 years old, his father was murdered by Turkic tribesmen, and his family was abandoned by his tribe and left to die in the harsh Mongolian winter. Mongolia is a vast, frigid, mostly barren land. Very little grows there, and the temperature routinely goes below 30 Celsius in winter. It is almost impossible for a family to survive alone in this environment without the support system and division of labor that a tribal group provides. Being abandoned in this manner was a death sentence.</p>
<p>The family did manage to survive, just barely. It was a harsh and brutal childhood. Temujin realized that although his father was a powerful &amp; wealthy man, his wealth proved to be of no use after he died. It was casually stolen away.</p>
<p>He realized that power can make you wealthy, but wealth cannot buy you power. When you are powerful, wealth can buy you more power, but when you have no power, wealth cannot protect you from those who have it. Power trumps wealth every time. Timeless wisdom.</p>
<p>This is something he never forgot. For the rest of his life, he sought only one thing: power. He disdained wealth, using it as nothing more than a tool.</p>
<p>To make a long story short, he spent the best part of three decades fighting and raiding and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rise_of_Genghis_Khan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gaining power</a> [30]. He began at the very bottom, with absolutely nothing to his name. Over the years, he learned the secrets of power. He acquired a profound understanding of the levers of power and how to wield them. By the year 1206, when Temujin was in his late 40s, he had conquered every Mongol tribe and created a unified Mongol nation. They gave him the title of Chinggis Khan, which means “Universal Ruler”.</p>
<h3>Genghis Khan’s Career as a Conqueror</h3>
<p>Now, when you have a newly-created nation whose tribes have been fighting each other for centuries, it is essential to integrate them and keep them occupied, so that old divisions don’t crop up. It is essential to give them an overarching common purpose. That’s what Genghis did. He took them on an invasion of China.</p>
<p>This was a retaliatory invasion. Its purpose was to avenge the murder of Ambaghai and to punish the Chinese for centuries of interference and atrocities.</p>
<p>China was ruled at the time by two dynasties: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Western_Xia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Western Xia dynasty</a> [31] in …</p></div></article></main></div></div></div></div>

<p>If you’ve been exposed to any financial news in the last few days, you’ll have heard of <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/">Gamestop</a>, the mostly brick and mortar video gaming retailer who’s stock has been caught between many retail investors on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets">the subreddit r/WallstreetBets</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvin_capital">hedge fund Melvin Capital</a> which had been actively betting against the company. The resulting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_squeeze">short squeeze</a> (where a rising stock price forces investors betting against a company to buy shares to cover their own potential losses — which itself can push the stock price even higher) has been amazing to behold with the worth of Gamestop shares increasing over 10-fold in a matter of months.</p>

<p>While it’s hard not to get swept up in the idea of “the little guy winning one over on a hedge fund”, the narrative that this is Main Street winning over Wall Street is overblown.</p>



<figure><figcaption>A brief sampling of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HoldTheLine">#HoldTheLine</a> on Twitter</figcaption></figure>



<p>First, speaking practically, it’s hard to argue that giving one hedge fund a black eye by making <a href="https://news.gamestop.com/corporate-governance/highlights">Gamestop executives &amp; directors</a> and <a href="https://news.gamestop.com/stock-information/institutional-ownership">large investment funds holding $100M’s of Gamestop prior to the increase</a> wealthier is anyone winning anything over on Wall Street. And that’s not even accounting for the fact that hedge funds are usually managing a significant amount of money on behalf of pension funds and foundation / university endowments.</p>







<p>Second, while the paper value of recent investments in Gamestop has clearly jumped through the roof, what these investors will actually “win” is unclear. Even holding aside <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-26/tax-for-trading-stocks-robinhood-investors-confused-over-how-much-they-must-pay">short-term capital gains taxes that many retail investors are unclear on</a>, the reality is that, to make money on an investment, <strong>you not only have to buy low, you have to successfully sell high</strong>. By definition, any company experiencing a short-squeeze is volume-limited — meaning that it’s the lack of sellers that is causing the increase in price (the only way to get someone to sell is to offer them a higher price). If the stock price changes direction, it could trigger a flood of investors flocking to sell to try to hold on to their gains which can create the opposite problem: too many people trying to sell relative to people trying to buy which can cause the price to crater. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="650" height="500" src="https://benjamintseng.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/buyhighselllow.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://benjamintseng.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/buyhighselllow.jpg 650w, https://benjamintseng.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/buyhighselllow-300x231.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" data-lazy-srcset="https://benjamintseng.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/buyhighselllow.jpg 650w, https://benjamintseng.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/buyhighselllow-300x231.jpg 300w" data-lazy-src="https://benjamintseng.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/buyhighselllow.jpg?is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Buy high sell low? <a href="https://imgflip.com/memegenerator/Buff-Doge-vs-Cheems">Created using Imgflip</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Regulatory and legal experts are better suited to weigh in on whether or not this constitutes market manipulation that needs to be regulated. For whatever it’s worth, I personally feel that Redditors egging each other on is no different than an institutional investor hyping their investments on cable TV. </p>



<p>But <strong>what is not in doubt is that these sorts of trades are extremely risky for all parties involved</strong> — whether you’re betting against a popular stock or trying to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HoldTheLine">“hold the line”</a> on a short-squeeze. For that reason, I’m sympathetic to <a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/28/keeping-customers-informed-through-market-volatility">the brokerages which are limiting investor activity in some of these speculative tickers</a>. </p>



<p>While many retail investors view these restrictions as a move by Wall Street to screw the little guy, there’s a practical reality here that the brokerages are probably fearful of:</p>



<ul><li>Lawsuits from investors, some of whom will eventually lose quite a bit of money here</li><li>SEC actions and punishments due to eventual outcry from investors losing money</li></ul>



<p>This is the third reason I’m worried the Gamestop story will ultimately be a bad thing for Main Street. If the resulting lawsuits and/or regulatory actions cause brokerages to put more restrictions on investors, this could put additional friction on investors in terms of how they can <a href="https://benjamintseng.com/2020/08/visualizing-how-market-volatility-impacts-risk-and-returns/">participate in long-term wealth creation</a>, something <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/the-average-retirement-savings-by-age-and-why-you-need-more">more households need given the paltry state of retirement savings</a>. </p>



<p>I love stories of hedge funds facing the consequences of the risks they take on — but the idea that this is a clear win for Main Street is suspect (as is the idea that the right answer for most retail investors is to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodl">HODL</a> through thick and through thin). </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>When I started LOGaritmical, one of the first functionalities that I implemented was registering a new user. This meant that I had to store the user’s password in the database in a secure way and I will need to be able to verify that the password entered during login is correct. This is something that is quite easy to implement incorrectly and you would be surprised (or not) at how many systems and websites store passwords in an incorrect way.</p><p>Just look at the number of data leaks from the past few years. It is very likely that your password was leaked at least once, and from a well known and high-profile source. Also, did you ever register for a website, entered the username and password you wanted, and after registration you got an email with the password in clear text? Chances are that the storing was also as insecure.</p><p>So, before I show you how to properly store a password (and what mechanism I used for LOGaritmical), let me tell you straight away how NOT to do it:</p><ul><li>Clear text – NEVER STORE PASSWORDS IN CLEAR – I can’t believe I have to say this. Passwords should not be stored in clear text because any DB dump can easily extract the email and password combination and try it out on other websites.</li><li>Use your own algorithm –  Unless you are a genius in mathematics and encryption, don’t write your own algorithms for encrypting or hashing the password. It may not be as secure as you think.</li><li>Simple hash – Even though not as bad as the first two, it is not very far away. There are rainbow-tables attacks that can be done on the DB dump and most of the passwords can be easily recovered. A rainbow table is a pre-computed file that has the known hash for many passwords. The file can store hundreds of thousands of passwords and their hash with different algorithms. Next, it is just a matter of matching the DB hashes to the pre-calculated file. Not all passwords will be recovered, but most of them will.</li></ul><h4>How to securely store the password in the database</h4><p>The best way to store a password in a database is by using a salted hash algorithm. This way, even in case of a DB dump leak, it will be almost impossible to recover the passwords. How does adding a salt help? First, let’s explain what the salt is. The hash salt is a randomly selected string (or bytes) that is added to the password before hashing it. It does not really batter if you append it or prepend it, as long as you are consistent and the salt is strong enough.</p><p>In the database you store the salt for each user and the obtained hash for the salt+password. Keep in mind (and this is very important) each user must have his own salt and it must be changed whenever the password is changed. Also, in order to be sure that the salt is strong enough, it is recommended to be at least 64 bytes long.</p><p>Next, use a strong and widely used hashing algorithm. In the past MD5 was considered good enough, after that SHA-1 was recommended, but nowadays it is SHA-256 or better are considered necesary. There are other algorithms as well, but please read about their strengths before deciding to use one.</p><p>Hashing algorithms usually have a number of iterations. Here we must be consistent since it will affect the output even if the salt and passwords are the same. Keep in mind though that the greater the number of iterations, the longer it will take for the hash to be computed. This is great since it minimizes the possibility someone will do a brute-force attack in case a DB dump gets leaked. Do some testing to see what is a good number of iterations for your system, without putting any major load on it.</p><h4>How to check the password entered is correct?</h4><p>We have the password stored the right way. We have a salt that is unique for each user and a secure hashing algorithm was used. But hashes are one-way functions, which means we can no longer retrieve the password from a given hash, so how do we check during login that the password the user submited is the correct one?</p><p>We simply compute the hash again for the user-entered password. We retrieve the salt from the DB, we attach it to the user’s password, and recompute the hash using the same algorithm that was used when saving the user’s information. After that, we compare the resulted hash with the one stored in the database. If they are identical, the password entered is the correct one.</p><h4>How I stored passwords in LOGaritmical</h4><p>Now that we have all the details, let’s look on how I stored the password in LOGaritmical and how to write a similar functionality in Java. I created a utility class that handles this part. It can generate a salt and it can compute the hash of a String with a provided salt. I chose the following values for the hash strength:</p><ul><li>Salt length – 521 bytes</li><li>Hash byte size – 256</li><li>Iteration – 1000</li><li>Algorithm – PBKDF2WithHmacSHA512</li><li>Always used SecureRandom</li></ul><p>Below is a part of the utility class (as it is currently is in the project). For the full and updated version feel free to look over the code in LOGaritmical repo.</p><pre title="CryptoUtils.java"><code lang="java"><em>/**
 * Generates a cryptographically secure 512 bytes string that can be used as a password salt</em><strong><em>
 </em></strong><em>*/
</em>public static String generateSalt() {
    byte[] bytes = new byte[512];
    <em>secureRandom</em>.nextBytes(bytes);
    return Base64.<em>getEncoder</em>().encodeToString(bytes);
}

<em>/**
 * Generate a hash for a password
 */
</em>public static String generateHashForPassword(String password, String salt) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeySpecException {
    SecretKeyFactory secretKeyFactory = SecretKeyFactory.<em>getInstance</em>("PBKDF2WithHmacSHA512");
    PBEKeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(), salt.getBytes(), <em>PBKDF2_ITERATIONS</em>, <em>HASH_BYTE_SIZE</em>);
    byte[] hash = secretKeyFactory.generateSecret(spec).getEncoded();
    return Base64.<em>getEncoder</em>().encodeToString(hash);
}</code></pre></div></div></div>]]>

<p>In the early 2000s, dramatic shifts in radio spectrum allocation for mobile data applications, combined with advances in radio transmission and receiving prompted some networking engineers to propose a radical rethink of radio.</p>
<p>Our current spectrum management assumes that senders and receivers have characteristics that are fixed at the point of manufacture, determined by things like the shape of an antenna and the type of quartz crystal used as an oscillator.</p>
<p>But software-defined radios (SDRs) and software-tunable phased-array antennas make those assumptions obsolete. Today, a radio can be a commodity computer that can sense other devices' RF use and transmit and receive on multiple frequencies to share the airwaves.</p>
<p>This was dubbed "cognitive radio" and its proponents imagined a world where the exclusive spectrum allocations handed out to telcos, broadcasters and other powerful entities would be replaced by a cooperative spectrum model.</p>
<p>Two radios that needed to talk to one another might make contact in one band, switch to another, or ask a third receiver to relay messages for them, using just enough power to reach one another, avoiding the bands that were already in use.</p>
<p>These proposals – which would vastly increase wireless data capacity – were met with fierce resistance, from incumbent licensors, from spectrum speculators, and from HAMs, who are brilliant but also tend to be conservative about spectrum allocation.</p>
<p>These debates inevitably ran up against a hard limit: no one had ever built any kind of serious cognitive radio network. Just trying it would likely trigger massive, brutal FCC enforcement action, as it would trample all that exclusive spectrum.</p>
<p>But that didn't cool the ardor of cognitive radio's fiercest proponents. People like Dwayne Hendricks roamed the world, looking for spectrum havens – places where cognitive radio could be tried. The King of Tonga greenlit one project!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/2002/01/hendricks/">https://www.wired.com/2002/01/hendricks/</a></p>
<p>But the most promising on-shore spectrum laboratories were First Nations territories – sovereign nations whose treaties predated any understanding of electromagnetic spectrum and thus did not cede spectrum rights to settler colonial powers.</p>
<p>Though the legal theory was as untested as the technical one, some First Nations bands dallied with it, wondering if they leverage their position to race past the hidebound rules in the US and Canada to bring money and connectivity to their communities.</p>
<p>I wrote a short story about this in 2002, "Liberation Spectrum," which Salon published in 2003:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.salon.com/2003/01/16/liberation_spectrum/">https://www.salon.com/2003/01/16/liberation_spectrum/</a></p>
<p>Making sovereign spectrum policy is one of the better interpretations of treaty law; it has the potential to be as lucrative as, say, casinos – and could also bridge the digital divide for First Nations communities.</p>
<p>Certainly, it's a better idea than the pharma trolls who briefly experimented with transfering patent portfolios to sovereign bands in the hopes of of muddying the jurisdictional questions so that their profiteering would be harder to shut down.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/09/how-a-native-american-tribe-ended-up-owning-six-key-patents-on-an-eye-drug/">https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/09/how-a-native-american-tribe-ended-up-owning-six-key-patents-on-an-eye-drug/</a></p>
<p>Thankfully, that plan petered out. Likewise, First Nations experiments with spectrum policy seem also to have lost momentum, since then – at least, none have crossed my radar.</p>
<p>Until now.</p>
<p>On Jan 13, the Mexican Supreme Court found in favor of Indigenous Community Telecommunications (TIC), unanimously finding that community groups like TIC were entitled to free "social use" spectrum licenses.</p>
<p><a href="https://globalvoices.org/2021/01/27/indigenous-led-telecommunications-organization-wins-historic-legal-battle-in-mexico/">https://globalvoices.org/2021/01/27/indigenous-led-telecommunications-organization-wins-historic-legal-battle-in-mexico/</a></p>
<p>The decision did not rely on treaty rights, but rather upon a carve out in Mexican spectrum policy that gives free spectrum to community groups. TIC is an incredibly effective network of 80 towns in 18 Indigenous communities operating voice and data mobile networks.</p>
<p>Since 2018, TIC has been under threat, with the regulator demanding 1m pesos for continued access to spectrum; a demand the Supreme Court unanimously voided.</p>
<p>The decision will ease expansions of TIC's service into the vast majority of Indigenous communities that lack reliable mobile service.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ift.org.mx/sites/default/files/reporte-coberturapueblosindigenas_finalpublicar.pdf">http://www.ift.org.mx/sites/default/files/reporte-coberturapueblosindigenas_finalpublicar.pdf</a></p>
<p>And it also allows for services beyond telephony. As TIC's Erick Huerta says, this paves the way for other Indigenous media being exempted from regulatory barriers.</p>

<p>A new research report from Sean O'Brien and Expressvpn in honor Data Privacy Day reveals the incredible extent of commercial location tracking hidden in everyday apps.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.expressvpn.com/digital-security-lab/investigation-xoth">https://www.expressvpn.com/digital-security-lab/investigation-xoth</a></p>
<p>App vendors use free software development kits (SDKs) to build their products, not realizing (or not caring) that the SDKs come from commercial surveillance companies that harvest all their users' data and sell it in hidden, sprawling commercial markets.</p>
<p>That's how the US military was able to buy location data on users of a Muslim prayer app: the app was built with one of these surveillance SDKs, so the data was extracted, packaged and sold on the cheap to the Pentagon.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqm5x/us-military-location-data-xmode-locate-x">https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqm5x/us-military-location-data-xmode-locate-x</a></p>
<p>The survey encompasses 450 apps with 1.7b downloads. It found that messenger apps (including many masquerading as Wechat, FB Messenger, and Telegram) were rife with location tracking. Other major offenders include dating and social apps.</p>
<p>The sleaziest SDK vendors are also the most prolific. X-Mode (a company that is theoretically banned from app stores) is in 44% of the analyzed apps. X-Mode is especially prevalent in religious apps, especially Islamic ones.</p>
<p>The researchers did me the honor of naming their report Project Xoth – Xoth is the name of one of the sinister commercial surveillance companies in Attack Surface, the third Little Brother book.</p>

<p>There is no shortage of takes about what's going on with Gamestop (and other surging stocks), Robinhood and Reddit's r/wallstreetbets, many of them contradictory – at least on the face of them. But I think it's possible for most of these takes to be right. Here's how.</p>
<p>First you need to understand the underlying mechanics of the story. Stock markets are fundamentally a way of making bets, including bets on the outcome of other peoples' bets, and bets on the outcomes of <em>those</em> bets.</p>
<p>All this complexity creates lots of exploitable opportunities. Some of these opportunities are considered legitimate and are given respectable names like "arbitrage." Others are considered illegitimate, and are called disreputable things like "stock manipulation."</p>
<p>A hypothetical Martian observing all this through a telescope could not tell you which kinds of bets were honest and which were dishonest, because the difference isn't about any objective standard, but rather, about power.</p>
<p>The strategies of powerful people are legit, while the strategies of their would-be dethroners are not legit. Sometimes, even outright frauds are OK if they're done by people with enough power.</p>
<p>If your scam pays out quickly enough, you can sometimes parlay the resulting cash into retrospective legitimization, so even the strategies of the out-group can end up being retconned as legit, if they're successful enough.</p>
<p>That's why Amway isn't illegal: Betsy DeVos's father-in-law was simultaneously the boss of Amway and head of the US Chamber of Commerce, and Gerry Ford was his Congressman, who was then elevated to president in time to legalize its business model.</p>
<p>To understand the Gamestop rise, you have to understand a couple of different kinds of bets.</p>
<p>"Shorting": this is a bet that a stock will go down. There's a complicated backstory to how you make this bet, but it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>The thing to know here is that shorting a stock can make you rich…if the stock goes down. But if the stock goes up, you lose money. There's not really any limit to how much you can lose here.</p>
<p>Every time the stock goes up, the shorts have to pony up more money to keep their bet alive (in the hopes that it will go down again later), or they have to take their losses, pay out the winner of the bet and surrender any chance of winning later.</p>
<p>Shorting isn't just a bet on someone else's failure – it's a way to fund bullshit-detection. If you know (or suspect) that a company is lying about its prospects, you can bet against it.</p>
<p>Shorts fund a lot of research into defective products and scammy businesses, because they win when bad companies are exposed and their stocks go down. Some of the scary security research you read about bad IoT software is funded by shorts.</p>
<p>That's why habitual bullshitters like Elon Musk <em>hate</em> shorts. Musk leads a cult of credulous worshippers who buy whatever he's selling. Shorts make bets that Musk's cultists will get deprogrammed. Musk uses this to sharpen his cultists' resolve: "they want us to fail!"</p>
<p>"Options": many different bets get lumped in as "options" but for the purposes of this discussion, buying an option means buying the right to buy stocks later. The people who sell you the option usually go out and buy the stock right away so they'll have it to sell.</p>
<p>"Front-running": Cheating. Front-runners insert themselves into transactions by spying. If I know that Alice is buying a bunch …</p></div></article></div>

  <p><span>12 Mar 2018</span></p><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Analyzing and breaking external encrypted HDD has been a “hobby” of mine for
quite some time. With my colleagues Joffrey Czarny and Julien Lenoir we looked
at several models <a href="https://syscall.eu/#Confs">in the past</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Zalman VE-400</li>
  <li>Zalman ZM-SHE500</li>
  <li>Zalman ZM-VE500</li>
</ul>

<p>Here I am going to detail how I had fun with one drive a colleague gave me: the
Chinese Aigo “Patriot” SK8671, which follows the classical design for external
encrypted HDDs: a LCD for information diplay and a keyboard to enter the PIN.</p>

<p>DISCLAIMER: This research was done on my <strong>personal time</strong> and is not related
to my employer.</p>



<p>The user must input a password to access data, which is supposedly encrypted.</p>

<p>Note that the options are <em>very</em> limited:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the PIN can be changed by pressing <code>F1</code> before unlocking</li>
  <li>the PIN must be between 6 and 9 digits</li>
  <li>there is a <em>wrong PIN</em> counter, which (I think) destroys data when it reaches 15 tries.</li>
</ul>

<p>In practice, F2, F3 and F4 are useless.</p>

<h2 id="hardware-design">Hardware design</h2>

<p>Of course one of the first things we do is tear down everything to identify the
various components.</p>

<p>Removing the case is actually boring, with lots of very small screws and
plastic to break.</p>

<p>In the end, we get this (note that I soldered the 5 pins header):</p>

<p><a href="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/disk.jpg"><img src="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/disk-small.jpg" alt="disk"></a></p>

<h3 id="main-pcb">Main PCB</h3>

<p>The main PCB is pretty simple:</p>

<p><a href="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/main-pcb.jpg"><img src="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/main-pcb-small.jpg" alt="main PCB"></a></p>

<p>Important parts, from top to bottom:</p>

<ul>
  <li>connector to the LCD PCB (<code>CN1</code>)</li>
  <li>beeper (<code>SP1</code>)</li>
  <li>Pm25LD010 (<a href="http://www.issiusa.com/pdf/Pm25LD512_010_020.pdf">datasheet</a>) SPI flash (<code>U2</code>)</li>
  <li>Jmicron JMS539 (<a href="http://www.doc88.com/p-994237049795.html">datasheet</a>) USB-SATA controller (<code>U1</code>)</li>
  <li>USB 3 connector (<code>J1</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The SPI flash stores the JMS539 firmware and some settings.</p>

<h3 id="lcd-pcb">LCD PCB</h3>

<p>The LCD PCB is not really interesting:</p>

<p><a href="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/lcd.jpg"><img src="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/lcd-small.jpg" alt="LCD view"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/lcd-pcb.jpg"><img src="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/lcd-pcb-small.jpg" alt="LCD PCB"></a></p>

<p>It has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an unknown LCD character display (with Chinese fonts probably), with serial control</li>
  <li>a ribbon connector to the keyboard PCB</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="keyboard-pcb">Keyboard PCB</h3>

<p>Things get more interesting when we start to look at the keyboard PCB:</p>

<p><a href="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/kbd-pcb.jpg"><img src="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/kbd-pcb-small.jpg" alt="Keyboard PCB, back"></a></p>

<p>Here, on the back we can see the ribbon connector and a Cypress CY8C21434 PSoC
1 microcontroller (I’ll mostly refer to it as “µC” or “PSoC”):
<img src="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/CY8C21434-24LTXI.jpg" alt="CY8C21434"></p>

<p>The CY8C21434 is using the <code>M8C</code> instruction set, which is documented in the
<a href="http://www.cypress.com/file/72341/download">Assembly Language User Guide</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.cypress.com/part/cy8c21434-24ltxi">product page</a> states it
supports <a href="http://www.cypress.com/products/capsense-controllers"><em>CapSense</em></a>,
Cypress’ technology for capacitive keyboards, the technology in use here.</p>

<p>You can see the header I soldered, which is the standard ISSP programming header.</p>

<h3 id="following-wires">Following wires</h3>

<p>It is always useful to get an idea of what’s connected to what. Here the PCB
has rather big connectors and using a multimeter in continuity testing mode is
enough to identify the connections:</p>

<p><a href="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/wires.png"><img src="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/wires.png" alt="hand drawn schematic"></a></p>

<p>Some help to read this poorly drawn figure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the PSoC is represented as in the datasheet</li>
  <li>the next connector on the right is the ISSP header, which thankfully matches what we can <a href="http://www.cypress.com/sites/default/files/inline/ui/2_5/images/kb/userimage/Miniprog1%20connector.JPG">find online</a></li>
  <li>the right most connector is the clip for the ribbon, still on the keyboard PCB</li>
  <li>the black square contains a drawing of the <code>CN1</code> connector from the main PCB,
where the cable goes to the LCD PCB. P11, P13 and P4 are linked to the PSoC
pins 11, 13 and 4 through the LCD PCB.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="attack-steps">Attack steps</h2>

<p>Now that we know what are the different parts, the basic steps would be the
same as for the drives analyzed in previous research :</p>

<ul>
  <li>make sure basic encryption functionnality is there</li>
  <li>find how the encryption keys are generated / stored</li>
  <li>find out where the PIN is verified</li>
</ul>

<p>However, in practice I was not really focused on breaking the security but more
on having fun. So, I did the following steps instead:</p>

<ul>
  <li>dump the SPI flash content</li>
  <li>try to dump PSoC flash memory (see part 2)</li>
  <li>start writing the blog post</li>
  <li>realize that the communications between the Cypress PSoC and the JMS539
actually contains keyboard presses</li>
  <li>verify that nothing is stored in the SPI when the password is changed</li>
  <li>be too lazy to reverse the 8051 firmware of the JMS539</li>
  <li>TBD: finish analyzing the overall security of the drive (in part 3 ?)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dumping-the-spi-flash">Dumping the SPI flash</h3>

<p>Dumping the flash is rather easy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>connect probes to the <code>CLK</code>, <code>MOSI</code>, <code>MISO</code> and (optionally) <code>EN</code> pins of the flash</li>
  <li>sniff the communications using a logic analyzer (I used a <a href="https://www.saleae.com/">Saleae Logic Pro 16</a>)</li>
  <li>decode the SPI protocol and export the results in CSV</li>
  <li>use <a href="https://github.com/trou/saleae-spi">decode_spi.rb</a> to parse the results and get a dump</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that this works very well with the JMS539 as it loads its whole firmware
from flash at boot time.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it does not seem obviously useful as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the content did not change after changing the PIN</li>
  <li>the flash is actually never accessed after boot</li>
</ul>

<p>So it probably only holds the firmware for the JMicron controller, which embeds
a 8051 microcontroller.</p>

<h3 id="sniffing-communications">Sniffing communications</h3>

<p>One way to find which chip is responsible for what is to check communications
for interesting timing/content.</p>

<p>As we know, the USB-SATA controller is connected to the screen and the Cypress
µC through the <code>CN1</code> connector and the two ribbons. So, we hook probes to the 3
relevant pins:</p>

<ul>
  <li>P4, generic I/O in the datasheet</li>
  <li>P11, I²C SCL in the datasheet</li>
  <li>P13, I²C SDA in the datasheet</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/probes.jpg"><img src="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/probes-small.jpg" alt="probes"></a></p>

<p>We then launch Saleae logic analyzer, set the trigger and enter “123456✓”
on the keyboard. Which gives us the following view:</p>

<p><a href="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/saleae-fail_123456.png"><img src="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/saleae-fail_123456.png" alt="Saleae logic analyzer screenshot"></a></p>

<p>You can see 3 differents types of communications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on the P4 channel, some short bursts</li>
  <li>on P11 and P13, almost continuous exchanges</li>
</ul>

<p>Zooming on the first P4 burst (blue rectangle in previous picture), we get this :</p>

<p><a href="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/saleae_beep.png"><img src="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/saleae_beep.png" alt="P4 zoom"></a></p>

<p>You can see here that P4 is almost 70ms of pure regular signal, which could be
a clock. However, after spending some time making sense of this, I realized
that it was actually a signal for the “beep” that goes off every time a key is
touched… So it is not very useful in itself, however, it is a good marker to
know when a keypress was registered by the PSoC.</p>

<p>However, we have on extra “beep” in the first picture, which is slightly
different: the sound for “wrong pin” !</p>

<p>Going back to our keypresses, when zooming at the end of the beep (see the blue
rectangle again), we get: <a href="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/saleae_end_of_beep.png"><img src="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/saleae_end_of_beep.png" alt="end of beep zoom"></a></p>

<p>Where we have a regular pattern, with a (probable) clock on P11 and data on P13.
Note how the pattern changes after the end of the beep. It could be interesting
to see what’s going on here.</p>

<p>2-wires protocols are usually SPI or I²C, and the Cypress datasheet says the
pins correspond to I²C, which is apparently the case:
<a href="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/saleae_i2c_key1.png"><img src="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/hdd-img/saleae_i2c_key1.png" alt="i2c decoding of '1' keypress"></a></p>

<p>The USB-SATA chipset constantly polls the PSoC to read the key state, which is
‘0’ by default. It then changes to ‘1’ when key ‘1’ was pressed.</p>

<p>The final communication, right after pressing “✓”, is different if a valid PIN
is entered.
However, for now I have not checked what the actual transmission is and it does
not seem that an encryption key is transmitted.</p>

<p>Anyway, see <a href="https://syscall.eu/blog/2018/03/12/aigo_part2/">part 2</a> to read how I
did dump the PSoC internal flash.</p>

</a></p><hr><a>

<p>While doing my usual mid-morning Twitter shill exercise for my employer last week, a twitter user slid into my replies and asked me an interesting question:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.leebriggs.co.uk/img/learn-to-program-tweet.png" alt="Tweet"></p>
<p>This immediately struck a chord for me, because if I look back 5 years in my career, I would have considered myself a “non-programming sysadmin”. Thinking about this further, I now have the title “Staff Software Engineer” on LinkedIn (which must mean it’s true, right?) and yet, if another software engineer asked me if I <em>was</em> a software engineer I’d tell them I have no idea what a mutex is and that Go interfaces still confuse me.</p>
</a><p><a>Despite all of my attempts to avoid it, I now write code for a living. Not only that, but I commit the cardinal software engineer sin of constantly switching languages during my day to day. Pulumi supports 4 programming language ecosystems, so at any given moment I could be writing Pulumi code in the hellscape that is Python before switching to the </a><a href="https://www.leebriggs.co.uk/blog/2020/12/16/vb-net-cloud.html">soothing embrace of VB.NET</a>.</p>
<p>Does the fact I can now put “programming language polyglot” on my resume mean I’m a talented software engineer? No.</p>
<p>I would however fancy my chances in any trivia game titled “how the hell do I configure this AWS service again?” and what <em>I</em> believe makes Pulumi so unique as a prospect is that it allows me, a system administrator that’s been given admin credentials to far too many AWS accounts, the ability to learn how to write code in many languages by reducing the number of variables in play at any one time.</p>
<h2 id="a-theory-of-tech-learning">A Theory of Tech Learning</h2>
<p>Before I wax lyrical about the wonderful company I work at, I’d first like to talk a little bit about my personal theory of learning in the tech world. Imagine you were teaching technology to the <em>least</em> tech savvy person you know in the whole world. In fact, imagine your lovely household pet scared the fuck out of you one day and started talking, and for some reason instead of saying “you really should give me more treats”, they instead say - “Can you show me how to code something?”</p>
<p>Let’s try imagine what that conversation would look like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cat: I want to write some code<br>
You: Okay, well first you’ll need an IDE<br>
Cat: What’s an IDE?<br>
You: It’s a thing you use to write code in, it makes your life easier. Then you’ll need to pick a language<br>
Cat: Which ones would you recommend for cats to get started in?<br>
You: Well Python has snakes, but lots of people use JavaScript and it has a low barrier to entry. Java is also popular<br>
Cat: Okay, well what next?<br>
You: Well then you’ll need somewhere to put your code. It’s probably best to sign up for a GitHub account<br>
Cat: What’s GitHub<br>
You: Oh man, well you see…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The point I’m trying to make in this contrived unfunny example is that the number of <em>things</em> you have to learn at any one time can be completely overwhelming. A person starting out in software development has to pick a language, learn what Git is, get their machine setup and figure out what the hell they’re doing with their life, and that’s before they’ve written a single line of code.</p>
<p>As an industry, it’s my belief we need to do better here, but before I go off on a tangent, let me drive towards my point.</p>
<p><strong>Learning gets easier with less variables</strong></p>
<p>This isn’t a new concept, it’s basically <a href="https://www.cord.org/cord_ctl_overview.php">Contextualized learning</a> and it’s being introduced in classrooms to further improve the learning mechanisms in all countries that invest in their education system.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-about-pulumi">So what about Pulumi?</h2>
<p>When people ask me what’s so great about <a href="https://www.pulumi.com/">Pulumi</a>, my first answer is always that they pay me to write blog posts. My <em>second</em> answer is that it’s accessible to anyone in your organization who wants to deliver infrastructure to the cloud. I would say 5 times out of 10, I’ll get some variation of the following answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My colleagues are all in on <insert inferior="" product="" here=""> and I just can't see them learning Python/TypeScript/other supported language</insert></p>
</blockquote>
<p>My problem with this is that people <em>assume</em> that a Pulumi program is going to be just like the applications they support on a day to day basis, a full suite of software that has nested classes and object orientation (what’s a method again?) and it’s very quickly going to grow into an unmaintainable mess. What needs to be remembered is that the unmaintable mess they’re creating is inside a context that person already <em>knows</em>. The code they’re writing doesn’t disappear into a gRPC connection or into 8000 thousand nested divs in a web page, it manifests itself as actual infrastructure that you know and understand.</p>
<p>Pulumi is a very powerful tool. You can absolutely write Pulumi programs like a seasoned software engineer (take our awsx package as a wonderful example), but if you’re an infrastructure focused person who wants to get something done, you’re almost certainly going to start relatively small and build your knowledge as you go along.</p>
<p>Let’s take a simple example of deploying something “easy”, like an Amazon EKS cluster. Here’s how it looks in Pulumi, with TypeScript:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>// Create the EKS cluster itself and a deployment of the Kubernetes dashboard.</span>
<span>const</span> <span>cluster</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>eks</span><span>.</span><span>Cluster</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>cluster</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>vpcId</span><span>:</span> <span>vpc</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>,</span>
    <span>subnetIds</span><span>:</span> <span>vpc</span><span>.</span><span>publicSubnetIds</span><span>,</span>
    <span>instanceType</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>t2.medium</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>desiredCapacity</span><span>:</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span>
    <span>minSize</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span>
    <span>maxSize</span><span>:</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>I’m not going to tell you what you should or shouldn’t find easy, but looking at this example should make you feel like you can achieve pretty much anything.</p>
<p>Another example: what does deploying a global dynamodb table look like in Pulumi, with Python?</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>pulumi</span>
<span>import</span> <span>pulumi_aws</span> <span>as</span> <span>aws</span>

<span>my_table</span> <span>=</span> <span>aws</span><span>.</span><span>dynamodb</span><span>.</span><span>Table</span><span>(</span><span>"my_cool_table"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>attributes</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>aws</span><span>.</span><span>dynamodb</span><span>.</span><span>TableAttributeArgs</span><span>(</span>
        <span>name</span><span>=</span><span>"TableHashKey"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>type</span><span>=</span><span>"S"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>)],</span>
    <span>billing_mode</span><span>=</span><span>"PAY_PER_REQUEST"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>hash_key</span><span>=</span><span>"TableHashKey"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>replicas</span><span>=</span><span>[</span>
	    <span>aws</span><span>.</span><span>dynamodb</span><span>.</span><span>TableReplicaArgs</span><span>(</span>
		    <span>region_name</span><span>=</span><span>"us-east-1"</span><span>,</span>
	    <span>),</span>
	    <span>aws</span><span>.</span><span>dynamodb</span><span>.</span><span>TableReplicaArgs</span><span>(</span>
		    <span>region_name</span><span>=</span><span>"us-west-2"</span><span>,</span>
	    <span>),</span>
    <span>],</span>
    <span>stream_enabled</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>,</span>
    <span>stream_view_type</span><span>=</span><span>"NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Again, this example if just a Python dict with configuration options for your resource. We’re creating a cloud resource using Python and starting to understand Python dictionaries for our configuration options.</p>
<h2 id="getting-off-the-ground">Getting off the ground</h2>
<p>Let’s say you decide I’m not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollocks#%22Talking_bollocks%22_and_%22bollockspeak%22">talking bollocks</a> here and you agree with me. “I want to learn Python with Pulumi Lee, what should I do?”.</p>
<p>My first piece of advice is “don’t learn Python, its <a href="https://twitter.com/FiloSottile/status/1342868990335594496?s=20">package management story is a tire fire</a> and the first time you screw up your indentation you’re going to want to quit tech and be a bitcoin day trader”, but my actual real advice would be to follow these steps..</p>
<h3 id="pick-a-language">Pick a language</h3>
<p>Don’t make the same mistake I did and get a job at Pulumi (<a href="https://www.pulumi.com/careers/">we are hiring though</a>, if you want one!) because they’ll have you writing examples in four different languages before your laptop even arrives through the postal system.
Pick <em>one</em> of the language SDKs <a href="https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/languages/">we support</a> that makes some sense. Think about what languages are available and then consider where you’ll be able to get help from the software developers in your network. If you work closely with a team of backend engineers who are writing their application in Go, our GO SDK would be a great starting point.</p>
<h3 id="start-small">Start small</h3>
<p>Whatever you do, don’t try and take an existing terraform module you’ve deployed and convert it to Pulumi code. Take a part of your infrastructure that’s small, and non-critical, and deploy it using Pulumi. You can even import the resource magically! Become comfortable creating Pulumi projects in your language of choice and managing the resources you know about. A great example I like to give people new to Pulumi is to deploy some of your DR resources (you do have a disaster recovery plan….right?) using Pulumi. It’s a great opportunity to replicate your infrastructure, give your finance director a heart attack and not break production at the same time.</p>
<h3 id="keep-yourself-dry">Keep yourself <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a></h3>
<p>As you start to deploy more and more infrastructure, you’ll begin to notice you’re repeating yourself. Here’s where you really start to learn programming concepts - start to abstract the code you’re reusing between Pulumi projects and stacks into libraries and reusable code like classes and functions. Let’s not forget here, you’re still within your safe context of cloud infrastructure, but you’re now dangerously close to becoming a software engineer.</p>
<h3 id="ask-for-help">Ask for help</h3>
<p>The final piece of advice I have is to make sure you don’t suffer alone. StackOverflow exists as group therapy for software engineers. We also have the wonderful <a href="https://slack.pulumi.com/">Pulumi Community Slack</a>, where Pulumi employees and other Pulumi experts hang out.</p>
<h2 id="a-final-note">A final note</h2>
<p>This post has been primarily focused on “Infrastructure” people, but many of the concepts ring true for the inverse. If you’re a software engineer writing front end code, and cloud providers like AWS, Azure or Google Cloud scare the bejesus out of you, beginning to deploy your shiny new application to a cloud provider in the code you already know and understand can dramatically increase the context you have while you’re learning things.</p>
<p>If anything I’ve said in this post rings true, and you’re finally ready to take the leap and want to learn some code, join me in a <a href="https://pulumi.com/resources/">Pulumi workshop</a> where I’ll personally guide you through examples of getting started.</p>

<p>People who are familiar with the issue told the Journal that Ant Group plans to change to a financial holding firm which will be overseen by Central Bank, China, and plans have been submitted already to regulators.</p>
<p>This change was as a result of continuous demand from Chinese regulators. The effect of this is that , it will stop Ant from going further with some of its plans, and be open for the rest of its work to be overseen more tightly.</p>
<p>This signals a remarkable restriction from Chinese officials, who are controlling one of the most flamboyant, successful, and well-known figures in Chinese business.</p>

<p>Jack Ma made his wealth working with Alibaba, the e-commerce company founded by him in 1999 and that made him one of the richest in China, with a net worth as high as $53.9bn.</p>
<p>However, Ma is no more the head of Alibaba, but has remained a major shareholder.</p>
<p>Ma’s conflict with the state got intense when he spoke against China’s financial regulatory system on October 24, as Ant Group was preparing itself for an IPO.</p>
<p>He said that China was going on the path of global rules which are part of “an old people’s club.”</p>
<p>At a point, Ma then went off public scene for months, after an October-31 event. He re-emerged in a video-conference clip on January 20.</p>
<p>His absence from the public after his clash with the government indicated the disappearance of famous Chinese actress, Fan Bingbing , who had disappeared for 4 months in 2019 while authorities was investigating her for evasion of tax .</p>
<p>When she later came back, she was, reportedly, praising the Chinese state.</p>
<p>On November 2, China came up with new regulations that got the Ant Group IPO suspended.</p>
<p>It was also reported, in December, Ma tried to end the conflict by offering the Chinese government parts of Ant Group. But the offer wasn’t accepted, that was how Ant’s hopes of an IPO ended.</p>
<p>On December 23, Chinese regulators introduced an antitrust investigation into Alibaba, widening the trouble for Jack Ma.</p>
<p>People who are familiar with the whole issue told <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-eyes-shrinking-jack-mas-business-empire-11609260092" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Wall Street Journal</a> that plans to change the company into a financial holding company could be concluded by mid-February.</p>

<p>Recently this post making rounds on some of the dev community groups which I’m a part of on Facebook.</p>
<p>These are the rules of a banking website when we are to create a new account or change our passwords. And this is the most weirdest set of password rules that I have ever seen, and this is not a photoshopped image, but 100% real.</p>

<p>It’s ironic that no matter how good the password is the only thing that separates an attacker from making a bad transaction is just a phishing page, because the bank does not use two factor authentication.</p>
<p>Even though the password policy does suggest that your password should be at least 8 characters long, other rules such as inability to special characters make the password weak not strong.</p>
<p>As a developer, I can’t understand the reason for putting this list of rules for a password because a database should be able to hold a hashed password.</p>
<p>So go ahead and suggest me a password</p>

Because Telegram does not use end-to-end encryption by default.</p><p>One example is <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/telegram-encryption-whatsapp-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this WIRED article</a>.</p><p>On the one hand, it takes just a single (!) step more to start a secret chat (above the contact list is this option, which then displays a contact list again), and on the other hand, these articles often give the impression that messages are not encrypted at all.</p><blockquote><p>“In terms of encryption, Telegram is just not as good as WhatsApp,” says Kobeissi. “The fact that encryption is not enabled by default already puts it way behind WhatsApp.”</p></blockquote><p>Telegram messages are actually encrypted, just not end-to-end encrypted!</p><p>Furthermore, these articles suggest that people are switching from WhatsApp to other messengers because WhatsApp is not secure. However, many users simply don’t want their data to be misused by Facebook for advertising. It’s not about the security at all.</p><p>This is all then underlined by the fear that the Telegram founder is a Russian and that Telegram is currently based in the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>But first, the Telegram founder actually fled from Russia, fearing the authorities, and second, Telegram is based in the UAE precisely because there is less risk of them being pressured by authorities to hand over data.</p><blockquote><p>He added that its “lean Dubai-based team is ready to move to a different location if it ever faces pressure.”</p></blockquote><p>If you are really afraid that messages could fall into the wrong hands, you won’t be better off with Signal. Signal is based in the USA and could be forced by a secret service to install a backdoor. The argument that everything is open source is also no longer true, since the <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Server" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published source code</a> is outdated and it is impossible to check whether the code on the servers is really the published code anyway.</p><p>In this case, a messenger like <a href="https://briarproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Briar</a> is recommended.</p><p>Since all these discussions about (silo) messengers and which messenger is the best generally annoy me, <a href="https://jlelse.blog/posts/email-messenger-delta-chat">I recommend Delta Chat</a>. Delta Chat is basically just an email client, but it gives email a messenger interface and automatically ensures that messages are encrypted end-to-end.</p></div><p><b>Tags</b>:

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has generated many headlines for remote work. <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/10/09/embracing-a-flexible-workplace/">Microsoft</a> is letting employees work up to 50% of their time from home. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-15/stripe-employees-who-relocate-to-get-20-000-bonus-and-a-pay-cut">Stripe</a> is paying a $20k bonus for employees to relocate out of cities with high cost of living. <a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/company/dropbox-goes-virtual-first">Dropbox</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-21/shopify-is-joining-twitter-in-permanent-work-from-home-shift">Shopify</a> are foregoing headquarters in the traditional sense altogether to become remote first.&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed it sure feels like everyone is leaning into remote work. But how is it backed up by data? Can we quantify the remote shift? Can we observe the data over time? Can we extrapolate the data to form views about the post-pandemic world?</p><p>To answer these questions, I parsed "<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=whoishiring">Who is Hiring</a>" posts on Hacker News. The monthly hiring thread goes live on the 1st of every month and on average 500+ companies respond with job openings. Companies are encouraged to specify whether a position is remote or onsite. This dataset is interesting because it captures temporal shifts and represents a broad sampling of the tech industry.</p><h3><strong>Chronicling the Remote Shift</strong></h3><p>Let's start by looking at how many companies advertised permanent remote positions as well as the proportion of those companies in relation to all companies. Note that a pandemic remote position that is expected to revert to onsite is not a permanent remote position and not tracked in this analysis. From here on, remote means permanent remote.</p><figure id="w-node-443c3c51e579-587ef276"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e12757f0227d019c07ef2b9/6012e673be33239a31e95023_am_m65Mp7l-xCQywM73df7Byjbatr1dVImrwmf_EeR3Cxozmr47iC5tmDWP9G2zSkTzoisRndM8mmu2-F2KlvRsKbcp5eNihQvFUX4fIQ0a45lYqVUeA00rKsLZfpbcWqhpa66Cy.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>The data naturally lends itself to splitting into four periods.</p><p><strong>January–March: The pre-pandemic business as usual</strong></p><p>The first three months of 2020 are essentially free of the impacts of COVID-19. During these months 33-34% of companies posting jobs on Hacker News were hiring remote positions. These months serve as a baseline.</p><p><strong>April–July: The hiring freeze</strong></p><p>Job post volumes dropped 33% MoM in April and stayed subdued for the following three months as companies grappled with macroeconomic uncertainties and remote transition disruptions. However, the drop in companies advertising remote positions was much less severe (20% MoM drop in April) compared to those that were hiring onsite only (40% MoM drop in April).&nbsp;</p><p>Simultaneously a rapid mix shift took place as companies changed their stance on hiring remote employees. In March, the last unaffected month, only 34% of companies advertised remote positions. By July, that number ballooned to 54%.</p><p><strong>August–November: The new normal</strong></p><p>Hiring roared back from August onward with job post volumes exceeding Q1 months. The shift towards remote continued during these months and eventually stabilized with 67<strong>–</strong>68% of companies posting remote jobs by October and November. Overall, the proportion had more than doubled from 33% — truly a sea change in the hiring landscape in the short span of a year.</p><p><strong>December–January: Post vaccine announcement</strong></p><p>With Pfizer-BioNTech announcing landmark COVID-19 vaccine trial results in November and the vaccine receiving FDA approval in December, companies could finally start creating a timeline for a return to normalcy.&nbsp;</p><p>However, this did not translate to a reversion in hiring trends where more companies asked candidates to report to the office post-COVID. If anything, the remote hiring trend continued edging upwards, with 70% of companies posting remote jobs in January 2021.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Blossoming of Remote First</strong></h3><p>A progressive subset of remote hiring companies are remote first companies. Remote first companies assume by default that employees work remotely though they may still have onsite employees for various reasons. Their workflows and internal processes are built around remote work. For a discussion on various flavors of remote first, refer to "<a href="http://www.shinkim.io/posts/why-remote-friendly-wont-do">Why Remote Friendly Won’t Do</a>".</p><p>Remote first companies are a rare breed — they were rare before the pandemic and they still are. But their numbers have doubled during the pandemic.</p><figure id="w-node-2e72fe1f6e11-587ef276"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e12757f0227d019c07ef2b9/6012e673a1776333fb5e8db6_coJgs3a7zIkpLMUI6rA0HFZjy1Uzs6VzPv_pPfxsHOJIQKk2V1WI1QvJh8McD-9xTl7h-Bm3DNIA7WybZMuWJXTuW9Ufk1_WtRU0JAgcKPstMeMMEt_sUhJX-QTJco80tIyh5gqs.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>In January, 6% of companies — or 34 out of 545 companies — were describing themselves as remote first. That number doubled by December, 12% of companies — or 75 out of 644 — claimed being remote first.&nbsp;</p><p>If the first chart was significant for showing remote-resistant companies becoming open to permanent remote work, this second chart is significant because it shows companies that were already remote friendly going further to establish remote as the default mode of work.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Drivers Behind the Remote Shift</strong></h3><p>What are the drivers behind this shift? There is no easy way to extract intent from the Hacker News data. However, the job posts occasionally offer glimpses into the thinking processes. Here's an attempt to distill anecdotes into takeaways:</p><p>First, companies are increasingly accepting remote candidates because they sense the broader market is shifting. Job posts mention "cultural tides shift[ing]" and a sense of "doubt [that] it will ever go back". Hiring managers realize that remote work is quickly becoming a necessity to remain competitive in the talent market.</p><p>Second, everyone was thrust into remote work and many teams thrived almost unexpectedly. Companies wrote in job posts that they "went fully remote when COVID-19 hit and ... aren't going back" and that "it's been going great". For these companies the pandemic was an unforeseen opportunity to reassess their office policy with fresh eyes.</p><p>Third, some companies had been gradually adding more remote employees to their ranks over time and the pandemic provided a catalyzing moment to formalize their remote stance. For example, FullStory started the pandemic with 25% of its employees remote. In September they announced the decision "go remote" because they felt they "needed to take a more long-term stance".</p><p>Lastly, though not a pandemic-specific driver, the strategic benefits of remote hiring is broadly resonating. Companies cite access to world class talent, diversity in thinking, and proximity to local customers as key advantages for going remote. These benefits are likely to be amplified for companies headquartered in smaller talent markets and those that serve a distributed customer base.</p><h3><strong>What will Happen in 2021?</strong></h3><p>The big question is whether the shift to remote hiring has staying power. As companies eventually start re-opening offices in 2021, will they revert back to onsite only hiring? Will the newly remote first companies roll back their stance? No one can say for sure, but here are a few observations that make me think the new baseline for remote work will be much higher:</p><p>First, the above analysis captures only permanent and not temporarily remote positions. These hires are not expected to report to the office after the pandemic. Companies that have welcomed permanent remote employees for the first time to their ranks will be held to their commitments to supporting them even once the office reopens. And once you allow a part of your team to be permanently remote it becomes hard to disallow it for further team members.</p><p>Second, I expect the shift to remote first in particular to be sticky. These were highly deliberate decisions on company culture that required re-writing the social contract with employees. Imagine having to ask your team to relocate back to headquarters after your remote first announcement gave them the green light to move out. Reducing organizational entropy will require much more effort than increasing it.</p><p>Third, remote work tools are getting better and teams are developing, adopting, and spreading best practices that will reduce friction in remote work. Everything from running payroll to whiteboarding will get dramatically easier as the ecosystem matures. More workers that have experienced the benefit of remote work will ask for it and companies will have less reasons to refuse it.</p><p>Follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/_shinkim">Twitter @_shinkim</a> as I&nbsp;continue exploring these trends.</p><p>Thanks to Yin Wu and Chris Cheng for reviewing drafts of this article.</p><p>Source: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=whoishiring">Hacker News: Who is Hiring</a>. All data saved <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jlLJkZJz3NBeyjylzTYAH-jTUog18Wqr_wi-OytK7EA/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>, please report any data errors to shin@shinkim.io.</p><p>[1] I use companies as the atomic unit instead of positions or job posts. For example, multiple positions advertised within a single post or across several posts are consolidated as one record.</p><p>[2] If a company is open to both onsite and remote (even if the preference is towards onsite), the position is still a remote position for this analysis.</p><p>[3] The March data is not impacted by COVID-19 given most companies respond to the Hacker News thread in the first few days of the month. Many parts of Europe and the United States went into lockdown in mid-to-late March.</p><p>[4] For the purposes of this analysis, remote first includes remote equal (very few), remote first, and remote only companies. I did not count remote friendly companies as the descriptor is ambiguous. Read “How Remote is Remote Enough?” for a full discussion of the different types.</p><p>[5] Remote first disclosures are voluntary and unprompted on Hacker News. So it is possible that some remote first companies do not mention this attribute in their hiring advertisement on any given month. As a result, the uptick in data may partially represent more remote first companies merely including this information in their job post.</p><p>[6] FullStory’s December post on Hacker News says that they strive to be remote equal.</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

</a></p>

<div><b>For the TL;DR crowd:</b>
I desperately needed to extract the complete (and very lengthy) command line I had written 6 months ago in a bash shell - which was still running under <tt>screen</tt>. Read on to see how I eventually made it...
</div>

<p>Let's assume you are using bash as your daily shell. You've heard lots of worrying things lately about it's <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellshock_(software_bug)">safety</a>. But that's not what's bothering you.</p>

<p>What's bothering you is that some months ago you abused the holy UNIX principles with it. It couldn't be helped. You were asked to implement a daemon that monitors a folder for incoming "stuff". The clients upload files there, and you were expected to do various things with them.</p>

<p>And the daemon was supposed to be delivered <em>yesterday</em> - as always...</p>

<p>So you hacked at a frantic pace, and made a lengthy bash pipeline that did it all. Loops over the input files, pipes, redirects - you name it. And having no time to fool around with <code>supervisord</code>, you pasted "The Magic CmdLine (TM)" inside a <code>screen</code>, where your bash patiently started chugging along...  And you moved to the next emergency on your list - which naturally, was scheduled for yesterday too...</p>

<h2>Alzheimer sets in - seeking help</h2>

<p>The Magic CmdLine (TM) obediently worked and worked. You checked its behaviour during the first couple of weeks - and just as expected, any errors on incoming files sent by the clients, were reported on its stderr, which your invocation conveniently redirected to some error log file. All was well.</p>

<p>6 months passed. No news is good news.</p>

<p>And suddenly, you remembered it. Only now (you moron!) you realize - horror of horrors - that you've forgotten all about The Magic CmdLine (TM). Arguments, redirects, everything down the mental drain. Gulp.</p>

<p>You are a single reboot away from, erm, a well-deserved flogging from your boss (translation: <code>screen</code> or no <code>screen</code>, The Magic CmdLine (TM) that you painstakingly investigated 6 months ago, will be forever lost... when the next reboot happens).</p>

<p>Oh God.</p>

<p>You reattach to the magic <code>screen</code>, fingers crossed. You hit ESC and scroll back up, hoping to see the magic line invocation...  but to no avail. The error reports it generated were written all over <code>screen</code>'s scrollback buffer - you can't scroll all the way up to the invocation line.</p>

<p>Heck, there <em>has</em> to be a way to get to that line. <code>ps aux | grep ...</code> doesn't help - it shows the currently running <em>piece</em> of the command you wrote. You want the whole shebang.</p>

<p>Desperate, you seek help at StackOverflow's gathering of <a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/159010/how-can-i-see-the-exact-command-line-being-executed-inside-some-bash-instance">UNIX gods</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have a long running bash instance (inside a screen session) that is executing a complex set of commands inside a loop (with each loop doing pipes, redirects, etc). The long command line was written inside the terminal - it's not inside any script. Now, I know the bash process ID, and I have root access - how can I see the exact command line being executed inside that bash?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You also add a nice and simple example of the problem:</p>

<div>
<pre><tt>

<span>$ echo </span><span>$$</span>
<span>8909</span>

<span>$ </span><span>while</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span> </span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>do</span><span> echo </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>;</span><span> echo </span><span>2</span><span>&gt;</span><span>/dev/null </span><span>;</span><span> sleep </span><span>30</span><span> </span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>done</span>



</tt></pre>
</div>

<p>And the answers start pouring in... but they are useless. </p>

<p>One tells you to search the process list - which would only give <code>sleep</code> in this example (<em>and in your real case, the currently running part of your complex Magic CmdLine (TM)</em>). </p>

<p>Another one suggests <code>cat /proc/8909/cmdline</code> - which of course just gives <code>bash</code>.</p>

<p>Another offers <code>ps -p 8909 --no-headers -o cmd</code> - which also gives <code>bash</code>.</p>

<p>(Sigh)</p>

<h2>Use the Source, Luke</h2>

<p>Desperate times call for desperate measures.</p>

<p>You download the bash source code, untar, and hoping you can somehow recover the history information kept inside the running instance of bash, you <code>grep</code> for dear life:</p>

<div>
<pre><tt><span>$ find </span><span>.</span><span> -iname </span><span>\*.</span><span>c </span><span>|</span><span> grep hist</span>
<span>.</span><span>/lib/readline/history</span><span>.</span><span>c</span>
<span>.</span><span>/lib/readline/examples/histexamp</span><span>.</span><span>c</span>

<p>The stupid ShellShock thingie forced everyone to update their bash... 
The automatic updates in that machine <em>removed</em> the binary of the old bash, and installed a new one.</p>

<p>So even though the process is still up, 6 months later... the binary file
from which it was spawned (and which GDB searches for, to get the address of <code>write_history</code>) can't be found.</p>

<p><em>Dancing around my desk. The people around me are looking at me, puzzled and wondering about my mental state</em>.</p>

<p>But I don't care - I am a friggin Jedi Master :-)</p>

<h2>Sharing my good fortune</h2>

<p>To ease the pain of my future self - and potentially the pain of other fellow coders / admins, I <a href="https://github.com/ttsiodras/utils/blob/master/showBashCmdline.sh">write a script automating all this</a>.</p>

<p>And decide it's been quite a while since I posted something on my blog :-)</p>



<div>
<p><em>
<b>Update, many years later</b>: A question that keeps re-appearing every time this post shows up in places like Hacker News or Reddit: "Why didn't you just "Ctrl-c", up arrow?"... Or: "Why didn't you just "Ctrl-z", up arrow, down-arrow, "fg"?
<p>
Remember: <b>The script was running in production, doing actual work.</b> Stopping it with Ctrl-c, when you don't remember anything about it and what it spawns, was not a safe option.  If you think about it, you'll realize there are plenty of things that don't recover from Ctrl-C... Batch processes in network operations that affect state, API calls... I am sure you know what I mean.
</p><p>
As for Ctrl-z: try running this in your <tt>bash</tt>, and applying the "Ctrl-z/fg" approach to it: <tt>while true ; do sleep 1 ; done</tt>. You'll see that the loop won't recover - it won't resume its proper operation...
</p></em></p><p><em>
So, to put it simply: sending signals to processes I had no recollection of, <b>was not as safe</b> as reading my shell's memory with the god of debuggers.

immediate availability of <a href="https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-python">the Wasmer Python embedding 1.0
version</a>.</p>
<p>Time flies! It’s been a little bit less than 2 years since we first
released <code>wasmer</code>, the Wasmer embedding for Python. Thanks to a
vibrant and awesome community, this project has been greatly welcomed!
After 1.8 million installations in the wild, it’s our great pleasure
to introduce the 1.0 version with a stable API, lightning
performances, cross-compilation, three compilers, two engines, and
many more advanced features. Let’s dig in!</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="light-by-default">Light by default</h3>
<p>By default, the
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/wasmer/"><code>wasmer</code></a>
package comes as <em>light</em> as possible, the rest are opt-in
features. <code>wasmer</code> provides by default:</p>
<ul>
<li>the entire Wasmer runtime,</li>
<li>2 headless engines.</li>
</ul>
<p>What’s an engine? An <em>engine</em> is responsible to drive the
<em>compilation</em> from a WebAssembly module to executable code, and the
<em>execution</em> of this executable code. Note that the engine is also
responsible to store the executable code somewhere, along with
serializing and deserializing it when caching the compilation
result. The Wasmer Python embedding comes with the <em>JIT engine</em>
(<code>wasmer.engine.JIT</code>, the default) and the <em>Native engine</em>
(<code>wasmer.engine.Native</code>).</p>
<p>In a nutshell, the JIT engine stores the executable code in memory,
whilst the Native engine stores the executable code in a native shared
library object (<code>.so</code>, <code>.dylib</code> or <code>.dll</code> files depending on the
Operating System where it runs).</p>
<p>Because the <code>wasmer</code> package comes with zero compilers, the engines
are said <em>headless</em>. In other words, the engines aren’t able to
compile, they can only execute an already-compiled WebAssembly module.</p>
<p>Why headless engines are the default? Because it’s super light, and
it’s the common path. The <code>wasmer</code> wheel is around 1.5Mb without the
compilers, or around 15Mb with all of them. It obviously impacts the
startup time, and the required space in memory. It also makes it
possible to fit <code>wasmer</code> in very small boards (thinking of the
Internet of Things). Or more basically, it speeds up installation and
setup. See a graph below comparing all the wheel sizes.</p>
<h3 id="pick-your-best-compiler-on-the-fly">Pick your best compiler on the fly</h3>
<p>As we said in the previous section, the <code>wasmer</code> package comes with
headless engines. What if we want to compile a WebAssembly module to
executable code? Then we need to install a compiler. We provide 3 of
them as standalone packages:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/wasmer-compiler-singlepass/"><code>wasmer-compiler-singlepass</code></a>,
the Singlepass compiler provides a super fast compilation time, and
a slower execution time. It is not prone to JIT-bombs. It’s <em>ideal
for blockchains</em>.</li>
<li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/wasmer-compiler-cranelift/"><code>wasmer-compiler-cranelift</code></a>,
the Cranelift compiler provides a fast compilation time, and a fast
execution time. It’s <em>ideal for development</em>.</li>
<li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/wasmer-compiler-llvm/"><code>wasmer-compiler-llvm</code></a>,
the LLVM compiler provides a slow compilation time, but a very fast
execution time, close to native. It’s <em>ideal for production</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>An example is worth a thousand words.</p>
<pre><code>

<span>from</span> wasmer <span>import</span> engine, Store, Module, Instance
<span>from</span> wasmer_compiler_cranelift <span>import</span> Compiler


store = Store(engine.JIT(Compiler))


module = Module(store, <span>open</span>(<span>'my_program.wasm'</span>, <span>'rb'</span>).read())
instance = Instance(module)


result = instance.exports.<span>sum</span>(<span>5</span>, <span>37</span>)

<span>assert</span> result == <span>42</span></code></pre>
<p>Notice how everything fits together nicely. Now let’s imagine we have
serialized the compiled module into a file as such:</p>
<pre><code>serialized_module_file.write(module.serialize())</code></pre>
<p>One can simply execute the WebAssembly compiled-module with no
compiler, only with a headless engine as follows:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>from</span> wasmer <span>import</span> engine, Store, Instance, Module

store = Store(engine.JIT()) 


module = Module.deserialize(store, serialized_module_file.read())
instance = Instance(module)

result = instance.exports.<span>sum</span>(<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>)

<span>assert</span> result == <span>3</span></code></pre>
<p><em>Et voilà !</em> It works with no compiler this time.</p>
<p><strong>We believe that this flexibility is a game changer since it can
address everyone’s needs while keeping the Wasmer runtime light and
fast.</strong></p>
<h4 id="llvm-infrastructure-just-for-you-pypi">LLVM infrastructure just for you, pypi</h4>
<p>A (funny?) side note we wanted to share. We did write, from scratch,
<a href="https://github.com/wasmerio/llvm-custom-builds">an entire build system to produce custom LLVM
builds</a> specifically
designed for pypi. Indeed, the default LLVM pre-builts provided by the
LLVM project themselves aren’t compatible with pypi binary wheels policy. The most
geeky of you might want to take a look at it: it’s really simple but
so useful. Feel free to fork the project.</p>
<h4 id="wheel-size">Wheel size</h4>
<p>A wheel is a Python package. It’s what a user downloads and installs
when running <code>pip install wasmer</code> for example.</p>
<p>We thought it would be interesting to see how light the wheels are
now. To do that, we have fetch the size of the:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>wasmer</code> wheel alone (with headless engines),</li>
<li><code>wasmer</code> + <code>wasmer-compiler-singlepass</code> wheels,</li>
<li><code>wasmer</code> + <code>wasmer-compiler-cranelift</code> wheels,</li>
<li><code>wasmer</code> + <code>wasmer-compiler-llvm</code> wheels.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have computed those sizes for 3 platforms (macOS, Linux, and
Windows) and 2 architectures (<code>amd64</code> and <code>aarch64</code>). (On Linux
<code>aarch64</code>, the <code>wasmer-compiler-singlepass</code> wheel is missing because
it does not support (yet) <code>aarch64</code>. On Windows <code>amd64</code>, the
<code>wasmer-compiler-llvm</code> wheel is missing due to a temporary issue, it
should be fixed quickly.)</p>
<p>The results are presented in the following graph:</p>
<figure>

  </a>
  <figcaption>Size of wheels (in Mb); lower is better.
</figcaption></figure>
<p>On average, the <code>wasmer</code> wheel has a size of 1.4Mb; the <code>wasmer</code> +
<code>wasmer-compiler-singlepass</code> wheels have a size of 2Mb; the
<code>wasmer</code> + <code>wasmer-compiler-cranelift</code> wheels have a size of 2.8Mb;
the <code>wasmer</code> + <code>wasmer-compiler-llvm</code> wheels have a size of 13Mb.</p>
<h3 id="improved-and-simplified-api">Improved and simplified API</h3>
<p>Between the 0.4 and the 1.0 version, we have rewritten the entire
project with a new, improved API. The new API is as close as possible
to the Wasmer runtime API (the original one, written in Rust), so that
it reduces the cognitive effort for new users to switch from one
project to another.</p>
<p>All the WebAssembly externals are now supported, which includes
<code>Function</code>, <code>Global</code>, <code>Memory</code>, and <code>Table</code>. All of them can be used
as imports or as exports. Well, this is now straighforward.</p>
<p>To simplify the declaration of imports, we provide an <code>ImportObject</code>
API. It works as follows:</p>
<pre><code><span>from</span> wasmer <span>import</span> engine, wat2wasm, Store, Module, ImportObject, Function, FunctionType, Type, Instance
<span>from</span> wasmer_compiler_cranelift <span>import</span> Compiler














wasm_bytes = wat2wasm(
    <span>"""
    (module
      (import "env" "sum" (func $sum (param i32 i32) (result i32)))
      (func (export "add_one") (param $x i32) (result i32)
        local.get $x
        i32.const 1
        call $sum))
    """</span>
)


store = Store(engine.JIT(Compiler))


module = Module(store, wasm_bytes)




import_object = ImportObject()



<span><span>def</span> <span>sum</span>(<span>x: <span>int</span>, y: <span>int</span></span>) -&gt; int:</span>
    <span>return</span> x + y




sum_host_function = Function(store, <span>sum</span>)


import_object.register(
    <span>"env"</span>,
    {
        <span>"sum"</span>: sum_host_function,
    }
)


instance = Instance(module, import_object)


<span>assert</span> instance.exports.add_one(<span>41</span>) == <span>42</span></code></pre>
<p>Again, this is straighforward and brings no surprise. This is one new
feature amongst many others.</p>
<h3 id="faster-memory-operations">Faster memory operations</h3>
<p>The <code>Memory</code> class (which represents an imported or an exported
memory) provided views, which were classes like <code>Uint8View</code>,
<code>Int8View</code>, etc. up to <code>Int32View</code>, through the <code>memory.uint8_view()</code>
method and siblings. These view classes were useful to read from and
write into a WebAssembly memory. Even if those operations weren’t
slow, they could be faster. Let’s introduce <code>Buffer</code>! A buffer is
generated by the <code>memory.buffer</code> getter. It implements the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/buffer.html">Python
buffer protocol</a>, so it
is possible to read and write bytes with the
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes"><code>bytes</code></a>,
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytearray"><code>bytearray</code></a>,

</figure>
<p>When reading 1 byte, views are 2 times slower than <code>Buffer</code> with
<code>memoryview</code> or <code>bytearray</code>. When reading 255 bytes, views are 16
times slower than <code>Buffer</code>. We consider this result as a
non-negligible improvement.</p>
<h3 id="cross-compilation">Cross-compilation</h3>
<p>The compilers come with a great feature: They support
<em>cross-compilation</em>. It means that from an <code>amd64</code> (<code>x86_64</code>), we can
compile for an <code>aarch64</code> (<code>ARM64</code>) machine, or from Linux to macOS
etc. For example:</p>
<pre><code><span>from</span> wasmer <span>import</span> engine, target, Store, Module



triple = target.Triple(<span>'x86_64-linux-musl'</span>)


cpu_features = target.CpuFeatures()
cpu_features.add(<span>'sse2'</span>)


target = target.Target(triple, cpu_features)


store = Store(engine.JIT(Compiler, target))


module = Module(store, wasm_byte)

<span>assert</span> <span>isinstance</span>(module, Module)</code></pre>
<p>What’s next? Serialize and send your WebAssembly compiled module on
its host mate, where a potentially Wasmer with headless engines is
waiting despairingly.</p>
<p><strong>We believe that cross-compilation will help users to pre-compile
their WebAssembly modules on a robust dedicated machine, and then
deploy them in various environments like a breath.</strong></p>
<h3 id="wasi">WASI</h3>
<p>The <code>wasmer</code> package now features <a href="https://wasi.dev/">WASI</a> (The
WebAssembly System Interface), with all the snapshot previews;
understand, all the versions.</p>
<p>Basically, the <code>wasi</code> sub-package helps to configure an <code>ImportObject</code>
object that is passed to <code>Instance</code>. Let’s see how it works with an
example. We want to execute <a href="https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-python/blob/f79df46c09317db97e1577a22e8da9696fd427c7/tests/wasi.rs">this Rust
program</a>,
that prints its arguments, its environment variables, and that lists
the content of its current working directory.</p>
<pre><code><span>from</span> wasmer <span>import</span> engine, wasi, Store, Module, ImportObject, Instance  
<span>from</span> wasmer_compiler_cranelift <span>import</span> Compiler


wasm_bytes = <span>open</span>(<span>'wasi.wasm'</span>, <span>'rb'</span>).read()
store = Store(engine.JIT(Compiler))
module = Module(store, wasm_bytes)




wasi_version = wasi.get_version(module, strict=<span>True</span>)










wasi_env =
    wasi.StateBuilder(<span>'wasi_test_program'</span>). \
        argument(<span>'--test'</span>). \
        environment(<span>'COLOR'</span>, <span>'true'</span>). \
        environment(<span>'APP_SHOULD_LOG'</span>, <span>'false'</span>). \

				<p>Hi and welcome to the second episode of the .NET GC internals! Yesterday is was 1.5h of talking about the (non-concurrent) Mark phase. The one responsible for discovering which object are <strong>“reachable”</strong> and which may be garbage collected. I’ve covered topics like <strong>object graph traversal algorithm</strong>, the <strong>pinning and marking flag</strong>, the <strong>mark stack</strong> and <strong>mark list</strong> data structures. And obviously, some deep dive into the <strong>gc.cpp</strong> at the end.</p>

       <p>Bell Labs is dead. It remains dead. And we have killed it.</p>
<p>In fact, even the concept seems to be dead. The top result in Google for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=industrial+research+lab">Industrial Research Lab</a> is a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.iteea.org/File.aspx?id=80231&amp;v=abace77c">retrospective history</a>. Pluralize the query as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=industrial+research+labs">Industrial Research Labs</a> and the top result is a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.nap.edu/catalog/18663/industrial-research-laboratories-of-the-united-states-including-consulting-research-laboratories">1946 index of the many labs that used to exist</a>. Try <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=corporate+research+lab">Corporate Research Lab</a> and you’ll get the cheery article <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.dshr.org/2020/05/the-death-of-corporate-research-labs.html">The Death Of Corporate Research Labs</a>.</p>
<p>Summarized in this last piece, Rosenthal determines the cause of death:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lack of anti-trust enforcement, pervasive short-termism, driven by Wall Street’s focus on quarterly results, and management’s focus on manipulating the stock price to maximize the value of their options</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking backwards, this is a tragedy. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers?</p>
<p>But looking forward, it’s an immense opportunity! So long as we remedy the underlying causes, the great industrial lab may rise again. We may already be on the right track. Antitrust pressure is rising, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_private_non-governmental_companies_by_revenue">privately held companies</a> not subject to Wall Street’s demands are booming.</p>
<p>What about short-termism? Via <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2015/07/how-bad-a-problem-is-quarterly-capitalism.html">Tyler Cowen</a>, Warren (2014) finds “no clear evidence of flawed short-term oriented management practices”. </p>
<p>This is good news! The industrial research lab has fallen, but with the causes gone, it will rise again.</p>
<p>As <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-american-rd-lab/">Ben Southwood concludes</a> his piece for Works in Progress “we will see the return of various large in-house labs.” [1]</p>
<hr>
<p>I am not so optimistic. Regardless of the antitrust situation, industrial research labs will not return.</p>
<p>Southwood and Rosenthal’s findings are both derived from Ashish Arora, Sharon Belenzon, et al.’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w25893">The Changing Structure of American Innovation</a>, worth reading in full. As he concludes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It seems unlikely that corporate research will rediscover its glory days… For some time, quick wins from low-hanging fruit (such as optimizing auction or advertising formats) may cover up the problem, but the fundamental challenge of managing long-run research inside a for-profit corporation remains a formidable one… incumbent firms continue to rely on outside inventions to fuel their growth. In the longer run, therefore, university research will remain the principal source of new ideas for such inventions. [emphasis mine]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words: why bother innovating when you can let someone else do it for you? Firms will still engage in the development half of R&amp;D, but this will take the form of translating existing findings into products, rather than breakthrough fundamental research. Arora &amp; Belenzon again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In summary, the new innovation ecosystem exhibits a deepening division of labor between universities that specialize in basic research, small start-ups converting promising new findings into inventions, and larger, more established firms specializing in product development and commercialization (Arora and Gambardella, 1994). Indeed, in a survey of over 6,000 manufacturing- and service-sector firms in the U.S., Arora et al. (2016) find that 49 percent of the innovating firms between 2007 and 2009 reported that their most important new product originated from an external source.</p>
<p>…As a result, federal research dollars for the university sector grew from an estimated level of $420 million (1982 dollars) in 1935-1936 to more than $2 billion (1982 dollars) in 1960 and $8.5 billion in 1985. Between 1960 and 1985, the share of university research of GNP grew almost twofold from 0.13 to 0.25…. Corporate labs historically operated in an environment where university research and start-up inventions were scarce.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arora &amp; Belenzon cites a 4.25x increase from 1960 to 1985. What about the years since? Courtesy of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsb20202/academic-r-d-in-the-united-states#:~:text=and%20Engineering%20Indicators-,Federal%20Support,HERD%202018%3A%20Table%201">NSF</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/h05J66oad5CGaw0QU4RYo-tix3lcIhDjg9pMjLiXXmbxryl0Vqdeu92A-zgqjHpsN4gcAnqWl-h3YJmwFzVwYhWoIOl4kFPyszyEL_9IrdBkt6qXSw38b7RRrHrNoOwE2XKwn6Nw"></p>
<p>Federal funding has continued to increase rapidly, up another 3.5x since 1985. For its part, institutional funding (meaning internal funding in the form of endowments, gifts and so on) has grown over 6x. Faced with this bounty, it’s no wonder firms lost their appetite for footing the bill themselves.</p>
<hr>
<p>To some extent, this is great news! The industrial research lab may be dead, but that doesn’t mean innovation is over, it’s just coming from universities instead. More funding means more science can get done, and who cares if it happens in industry or academia?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the research we see today is of a different nature. In a section titled “Inventions originating from large corporate labs are different”, Arora &amp; Belenzon enumerate the kinds of innovations we’ve lost in the shift towards university labs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Corporate labs work on general purpose technologies</li>
<li>Corporate labs solve practical problems</li>
<li>Corporate labs are multi-disciplinary and have more resources</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, the paper is worth consulting for full details, but it suffices to say that different mechanisms for attracting, nurturing, and managing talent will result in different types of outputs. None of this is to say that the corporate labs were on balance superior to today’s university labs, merely that we are missing out on some innovations (and likely getting others in return).</p>
<p>Though more sensationally, it’s worth worrying that there’s been a profound exodus of top talent from research into industry. As <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rxS6kj5Zt0&amp;t=13m">Patrick Collison describes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One thing that I think is underemphasized is that [corporate research labs] competed on the basis of compensation. They just paid more than other potential sources of unemployment. PARC’s strategy for aggregating the best computer scientists in the world was to pay them more than they would be earning in academia. And in the 70s, you couldn’t Google and earn millions of dollars a year, Silicon Valley hadn’t really left the launchpad.</p>
<p>To a significant extent, the same thing applies to Bell Labs. They were quite explicit that their strategy was to compensate really well and present more favorable employment than academia… It could be the case that because there are so many high return loci for super talent people to go and deploy their talents, you could never quite aggregate talent to the same extent.</p>
<p>…it’s hard to think of any major successes from these kinds of labs over the last 10 or 15 years. [lightly paraphrased for clarity]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-04-14/this-tech-bubble-is-different">lamentation</a> goes, “The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads.” It’s hard to prove that there has been a brain drain, but if so, it would indicate a strict loss in quality, as opposed to the more stylistic shifts Arora &amp; Belenzon describes.</p>
<hr>
<p>Bell Labs is dead, and it’s not coming back. Since  corporate labs are uniquely suited to some kinds of valuable research, this loss is troubling.</p>
<p>Where does that leave us?</p>
<p>One option is to attempt a massive overhaul of the entire system. If corporate labs have dwindled in the face of the government funded university system, we ought to redirect some portion of those tax dollars to industry instead and seek a better balance. To some extent, this already happens. DARPA awards funding to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2019-03-01">small businesses</a> through it’s Small Business Innovation Research grants, as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://sbir.nih.gov/">does the NIH</a>.</p>
<p>Even here, corporate labs won’t have the same incentives they had in the glory days from 1940-1970. So long as the university system thrives, firms will pursue growth through innovations discovered externally.</p>
<p>In that light, I have a different proposal: Instead of reviving the corporate research lab out of nostalgia, we should consider the more specific goals these labs accomplished, and then target them directly. If we are eager for more multi-disciplinary or research more closely tied to practical problems, we ought to build institutions to pursue those particular aims.</p>
<p>Even more broadly, we can think of institutions as just one of many possible mechanisms to allocate human capital. Nadia’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.heliumgrant.org/">Helium Grants</a> are also a mechanism for talent allocation, as is venture capital, and as is Substack.</p>
<p>The scientific world is not merely a collection of modules that produce research in hermetic isolation. Rather, it is better understood as an interconnected ecosystem. Increased profitability in software may cause cost disease elsewhere. An exciting new topic in one field could cause a genius exodus in another. Without this understanding of how it all interacts, attempts to recreate a single piece of the 1960s without the supporting context are doomed from the start.</p>
<p>We should seek to understand conditions as they exist today, think deeply about the particular aims we wish to satisfy, then design improved mechanisms within a contemporary environment.</p>

<p><strong>Footnotes</strong><br>[1] Ben Southwood read the same paper as Rosenthal and came to the opposite conclusion: the decline was the result of too much antitrust enforcement. The two only appear correlated because success driven by corporate research leads to antitrust. His full quote is “Perhaps antitrust bodies will be restrained, and we will see the return of various large in-house labs.”, but my summary of the conclusion as optimistic still stands.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Frequently-Asked-Questions"><a href="#Frequently-Asked-Questions" title="Frequently Asked Questions"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h3><p><strong>What about Google Quantum?</strong><br>I’m horrifically unqualified to make this judgement, but this does stand out as an important achivement.</p>
<p>Jack Hidary of Google’s quantum computing initiatives <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.wired.com/story/alphabet-second-secretive-quantum-computing-team/">once said</a>: “We literally created a spreadsheet of the experts in this space. We only came up with 800 names globally.” So maybe this is the exception that proves the rule, and Google was able to succeed precisely because there is not a thriving university system for quantum computing.</p>
<p>It’s also worth understanding the achievement as a result of Google’s partnership with NASA, though I don’t know the details of each party’s contributions.</p>
<p><strong>What about AI?</strong><br>Again, I’m not really confident here, but as I understand it, breakthroughs in AI consist largely of scaling up existing techniques, or inventing new techniques to enable greater scale.</p>

<p>You can spend a lot of time coming up with tactics and strategies for your communication, but the most valuable tool you can use is also the simplest: clarity.</p>



<p>If you communicate with clarity, people will spend less time trying to interpret what you’re saying. As a result, they’ll understand you faster, with less effort. </p>



<p>Make what you’re saying easy and quick to read and understand, and people will respond by reading more of it, and asking you fewer questions afterwards.</p>



<p>It helps to try and be a bit user-centered, or reader-centered. </p>



<span id="more-2242"></span>



<h2>Think about what your readers might already know</h2>



<p>The thing you want to communicate about already makes sense to you, and everyone on your team, because you’re immersed in it every day. You already have a crystal clear mental model to refer to.</p>



<p>But you can – and should – never assume that people reading about your work will have the same mental model. They might have a different model, if they are colleagues in the same organisation but not in the same team. They might have the same model, but see it from a different angle, if they are the leaders you report to.</p>



<p>Or they might have no mental model at all, if they are members of the public or strangers on the internet, or customers whose only model of your work is the end result that they see, from their end.</p>



<p>Every time you write something or create something that communicates about your work, you need to consider these varying mental models. Just as good web content is written for a reading age of 9, you will probably need to simplify your communication for most people, to make it as accessible as possible.</p>



<p>Try to understand their mental model of your work, and write to accommodate that. </p>



<h2>Write shorter sentences, with simpler words</h2>



<p>Writing with clarity doesn’t come naturally to everyone, but it’s something that develops with practice.</p>



<p>It’s hard to turn something complicated and full of nuance into short, simple statements. People tend to try and add lots of caveats, just in case. The result is often long sentences with lots of commas and clauses. Stuff that’s hard to read.</p>



<p>Your goal is to make everything easy to read.</p>



<p>If you’re struggling to picture what clear writing looks like, buy a copy of the <a href="https://ft.com/">Financial Times</a> or <a href="https://economist.com/">The Economist</a>. Pay attention to the way articles their are written, to the word choices and sentence structures. These are publications aimed at wealthy, educated people, but when you analyse <em>how</em> they’re written, you’ll see the goal is clarity. They take complicated news stories and make them easy to understand. Try to copy this style where you can.</p>



<h2>Constantly think about audiences</h2>



<p>A lot of communication fails because the same thing – a piece of text, or a video clip, or a presentation – is used over and over again to communicate to different audiences.</p>



<p>Understandably, writing separate texts for every different audience means more work, and most people don’t have time for that, so they skip it.</p>



<p>But that’s often the cause of the failure.</p>



<p>Communicating a team’s progress to a leader in the same organisation probably shouldn’t be the same as communicating a product’s progress to users. The messages are similar, and they overlap, but they’re not the same, and they shouldn’t be expressed in the same ways.</p>



<p>Communicating about an idea, or a proposal, to a prospective new client should not be the same as communicating the same idea to your team once you’ve won the work: again, the messages are similar and they overlap, but they’ll work better and be clearer if they’re written separately, with some thought given to the audience in each cast.</p>



<p>Good communication happens when you spend more time thinking about your different audiences, and more time preparing new variants of materials you’ve used before. Each new variant written with specific focus on what that audience needs to know.</p>



<h2>Communicate with purpose</h2>



<p>Before starting any new piece of communication work, I always ask: “What’s the purpose? What’s the point?”</p>



<p>Always start by thinking about what you want an audience to <strong>understand</strong>, <strong>know</strong>, or <strong>do</strong> after they’ve seen a piece of communication.</p>



<p>Knowing that helps you see the end result more clearly, sooner. It helps you avoid going down the wrong path, and focus the content of the comms on that goal, for that audience.</p>



<p>If you can’t identify and clearly express the purpose up front, stop working on it and find out why the purpose is so muddy. Sometimes, that will mean you stop completely; other times, it will help you and your colleagues re-think what this piece of comms is for, and create something better as a result.</p>



<h2>Clear communication helps teams solve problems</h2>



<p>Those audiences I’ve described: they might be your customers. Your funders. Your boss. Your boss’s boss.</p>



<p>They might be colleagues in your organisation, who want to make sure they’re not repeating work that you’re already doing.</p>



<p>They might be people in other organisations, who would love to learn from your mistakes.</p>



<p>They might be potential new recruits, who are keeping a close eye on your organisation and want to know what it’s really like to work there.</p>



<p>Every audience has slightly different needs, and knows slightly different things about you and your work. The only way to meet all these needs for all these people is to simplify.</p>



<p>Think about your audiences. Communicate often, in short bursts, about one thing at a time. Make sure there’s a reason for each new piece of communication to exist. Say what you mean. Be as clear as you can be. Your team will be more successful as a result.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
  
      <p>The DBA experience at work suggests that every single schema at some point in its lifecycle holds a queue table. These are tables in which some processes (the “producers”) put rows, which a swarm of other processes (the “consumers”) lock and consume.</p>

<p>A variation on that theme is the state machine, in which jobs are placed by producers. Consumers do not immediately delete them, but update them a few times to indicate processing progress, before the rows are ultimately being deleted.</p>

<p>Another variation is using the search and sort capabilities of the database to fetch jobs from the queue out of order (“queue with lookahead and selective dequeueing”), while still maintaining the exactly-once semantics.</p>

<h2 id="using-a-database-as-a-queue-can-be-ok-ish">Using a database as a queue can be ok-ish</h2>

<p>Using a database as a queue is not wrong, up to a point:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You get ACID semantics. That means your updates are atomic and isolated, transactional, and they are durable, persisted to disk. This makes it possible to build queues with “exactly once” execution semantics, which is a thing developers like a lot.</li>
  <li>You already have a database handle, and you already understand your ORM, so you do not have to pile on more dependencies and you do not need to learn additional technologies.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, once you pass “the point” in that “up to a point” phrase, things get nasty:</p>

<p>“Exactly once”  semantics are really expensive to implement: They require that each insert, delete or update is associated with a transaction, which in turn is associated with a disk write.</p>

<p>You get to enqueue, dequeue and state change your things exactly as quickly as a single server can flash its disk lights, and in the next step, as quickly as your replication hierarchy can pass on things downstream.</p>

<p>On baremetal, that costs you a bit, but because baremetal gives you awesome amounts of capacity with very little jitter for very reasonable amounts of money, we can bear quite a bit of this work.</p>

<p>In the cloud, using a database-as-a-queue is approximately equivalent to pouring petrol on money and throwing a match. It is the wrong technology for that kind of workload in that environment from the get-go.</p>

<h2 id="not-using-databases-as-queues">Not using databases as queues</h2>

<h3 id="replayability">Replayability</h3>

<p>One specific property of the above setup that is expensive, and hard to reproduce outside of a transactional database is the exactly-once thing. “At most once (maybe never)” or “at least once (maybe multiple times)” are alternative queue semantics that are much cheaper to implement, because they allow you to get rid of disk writes, and also of many disk seeks.</p>

<p>Kafka for example gives you “at least once”: You get to consume a stream, and you can jump backwards and re-consume what you already saw, in order, no searching. The jump backwards is possible for a small time window of a few hours or a day, or whatever other deal you can make with the Kafka team.</p>

<p>Reading the same item multiple times is not a problem if the jobs in the queue are idempotent, that is, replayable.</p>

<p>Not replayable are relative updates: “set x = x + 1”, “add order to table, give me the ordernumber”.</p>

<p>Replayable are absolute updates: “set x = 7” (you read 6, did the math and enqueued 7), “add order 17372 to order table” (you made an order number beforehand and push the order into the queue with an already fixed identity).</p>

<p>Basically, to make things idempotent, you need to give them either fixed identities so that you can remember if you saw things before, or you need to make the writes absolute instead of incremental, or both.</p>

<p>So if you find a way to group your jobs into transactions, and make all individual operations in your transaction replayable, you could push the entire stream through Kafka and it would be cheaper. Much cheaper, in fact, in a cloud environment.</p>

<h3 id="re-queuing-and-sorting">Re-queuing and sorting</h3>

<p>If you use a queue table with selecting and sorting (“queue with lookahead and selective dequeueing” from above), you can look into consuming a block of things from your input queue and splitting them into multiple streams or different topics, or maybe sort them and re-queue them.</p>

<p>So basically, instead of pushing things into a single queue and then grabbing items out of order, you can consume the input in blocks, perform your intermediate selection and sorting process and them push to multiple outputs.</p>

<p>Again, the result can ride on Kafka instead of MySQL and would be more cloud-compatible.</p>

<h3 id="re-queuing-updates">Re-queuing updates</h3>

<p>For the state machine use-case you would have to solve writing updates to a base record, before it is finally consumed in total.
Your state machine would be eating one item from the input, perform the associated action, and then push the updated record back into the same, or a different queue.</p>

<h2 id="what-if-i-dont">What if I don’t?</h2>

<h3 id="undo-log-woes">Undo Log woes</h3>

<p>In <a href="https://isotopp.github.io/2019/11/18/a-blast-from-the-past.html">A Blast From The Past</a> we see what happens to MySQL with long running transactions, and in <a href="https://isotopp.github.io/2020/07/27/mysql-transactions.html">MySQL Transactions</a> we discuss what goes on internally in the database when we do transactions, and especially how that can be painful if these transactions are long running.</p>

<p>Note that any database will at some point in time have long running transactions, even if your code does not. Database maintenance operations such as cloning replicas or making backups can do that without interruption only by maintaining a read view, which leads to Undo Log explosion.</p>

<p>So queue-as-a-database will eventually explosively grow the undo log, or individual tables, and disk space from these structures is hard to reclaim by the operating system. You will run at some point in time into disk space problems from churn, even if the absolute amount of data is small.
Binlog woes and Replication Delay</p>

<p>In a replicated MySQL changes to any table (also queue tables) are written to the binlog, which is being kept for a few days for point in time recovery and for replication. This uses disk space.</p>

<p>Note that any write is binlogged, even deletes. So when you delete data, you have less disk space (because deletes are binlogged), until after a few days the binlog is purged.</p>

<p>The binlog is being consumed by replicas as close to realtime as possible. But if you write too much, again, it is possible to overwhelm the replicas, and you will experience replication delay.</p>

<p>If your producers write to the replication primary, but your consumers read from the replicas, replication delay will add additional latency. You will be unhappy (and see Kafka, above).</p>

<h2 id="this-is-per-instance">This is per-instance</h2>

<p>It is also important to remember that this is per-instance, not per-table, and also not per-schema. The purge thread looks at transactions, not at schemas or tables. In a transaction, a number of changes to the instance can happen, atomically.</p>

<p>So imagine a shared mysqld process that has 1000 customers with different schemas, all of them unrelated, and one of them opens a transaction and keep it open for four hours. The purge thread will stop for all of the customers, because in theory it is possible to have a single transaction that spans all 1000 customer’s schemas.</p>

<p>The undo log will grow out of bounds, and all 1000 customers will experience slow queries.</p>

<p>This is how you denial-of-service a shared MySQL with no effort or expense at all.</p>

<h2 id="what-should-i-do-and-what-is-the-limit">What should I do? And what is the limit?</h2>

<p>As a developer, you want to write an application and get it going without piling on a lot of dependencies or learning too many technologies, or dealing with limitations such as unreliable or repeated queue deliveries.</p>

<p>MySQL can deliver such things, up to a point.</p>

<p>That is okay for a prototype. If you implement queues, state-machines or other rapidly writing structures in a MySQL, you should monitor transaction volume and prepare an escape strategy early, and implement that in time. Tech debt is okay, if it is managed properly.</p>

<ul>
  <li>As a benchmark, and for comparison: At this point in time, one specific application at work processes around 7-10 million auto-increment values per replication hierarchy per hour, with several updates per row. That is where we run into operational toil due to pushing the envelope.
    <ul>
      <li>That is around 3.000 new rows per second, and a multiple of that with updates.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>An unconstrained baremetal SSD can do around 20.000 commits per second in hardware.
    <ul>
      <li>That is why we run into operational toil with 3.000 new rows (with multiple updates per rows) per second with said application.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Our replication assumes around 2.000 transactions/s as minimum capability.
    <ul>
      <li>We can batch up some things and apply them in parallel, if the transaction structure allows that. That is why replication does not lag, even if the primary does more than 2.000 txn/s. How much parallel replication can help here is completely dependent on the ordering constraints imposed by the transactions themselves.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In the cloud, the limits are likely to be much lower, depending on instance and volume sizes chosen, and going there is a solid cost item.</p>

<p>You will need to look at things with a much sharper lens.</p>

Not only does it take a great deal of skill to choose and apply colors effectively, but it also requires a bit of math to ensure those colors are accessible. It’s not enough for your color combinations to be visually pleasing, they also need to have enough contrast. This is especially important for users with visual impairments — if your site doesn’t have enough contrast, they won’t be able to read or use it.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/10380/1*tXo0ligKluHjlyYv1sBpRg.jpeg" width="5190" height="3775" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*tXo0ligKluHjlyYv1sBpRg.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*tXo0ligKluHjlyYv1sBpRg.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*tXo0ligKluHjlyYv1sBpRg.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*tXo0ligKluHjlyYv1sBpRg.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*tXo0ligKluHjlyYv1sBpRg.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="844f">By leveraging a color’s luminance (a.k.a. brightness) and applying just a bit of math, I’ll show you how we generate color names that are descriptive, simple to work with, and make it much easier to guarantee your color combinations are accessible.</p><p id="c5ee">At Amplitude, we’ve been working on improving our product’s accessibility. A digital product that isn’t accessible to people with visual impairments can be as exclusionary as an office building that isn’t wheelchair accessible¹. We feel a responsibility to build product that is accessible to all users, and it’s a challenge we’re excited to take on.</p><p id="9767">We believe most designers and developers <em>want</em> to ship accessible product. We know this is true at Amplitude. When we fall short of our accessibility goals it’s almost always a failure of execution rather than a failure of intent.</p><p id="51ff">So rather than viewing accessibility as an add-on to every feature we ship, we’re approaching it as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory" rel="noopener">as a systems problem</a>. This means we’re constantly on the lookout for ways to modify the way we build things so it’s easier to create accessible experiences and harder to accidentally ship inaccessible ones.</p><p id="8579">We recently developed and are starting to implement a color-numbering system that makes it much easier for designers and developers to identify accessible (and inaccessible) color pairs from their names. This system is already helping us to use color more confidently and to identify parts of our product that don’t meet our standards for accessible color use.</p><p id="594a">In the rest of this post I’ll walk you through the naming system we left behind, why that system made accessibility more difficult than it needs to be, and how we changed it to make shipping accessible experiences easier.</p><p id="cfde">The color system we had been using employed names made up of two parts — a descriptive color name like <code>blue</code>, <code>teal</code>, or <code>gray</code> as well as a number between 0 and 1000 that represents the lightness or darkness of the color.</p><p id="4d51">We didn’t invent this naming system. It’s the color naming system used by popular libraries like <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors" rel="noopener">Tailwind CSS</a>, <a href="https://ant.design/docs/spec/colors" rel="noopener">Ant Design</a>, <a href="https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#tools-for-picking-colors" rel="noopener">Material UI</a>, and countless large and small companies².</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/12310/1*wD72epKyYSHCbJGVec31rQ.jpeg" width="6155" height="4860" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*wD72epKyYSHCbJGVec31rQ.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*wD72epKyYSHCbJGVec31rQ.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*wD72epKyYSHCbJGVec31rQ.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*wD72epKyYSHCbJGVec31rQ.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*wD72epKyYSHCbJGVec31rQ.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Amplitude’s pre-update color names</figcaption></figure><p id="464c">The descriptive names (<code>blue</code>, <code>teal</code>, <code>gray</code>) in a system like this are pretty straightforward — they convey information about the color’s hue (or, in the case of grays, the fact that it’s desaturated).</p><p id="a9b2">But what about the numbering system being used? The technical term for this type of numbering system is an “ordinal scale”. With an ordinal scale the items “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_data" rel="noopener">have natural, ordered categories<em> </em><strong><em>and the distances between the categories is not known</em></strong></a> [emphasis added].”</p><p id="a202">This means that the numbering corresponds to a color’s luminance, but not in any absolute way. The numbers tell you that <code>blue-600</code> is darker than <code>blue-500</code>, which is darker than <code>blue-400</code>, but it doesn’t tell you how much darker. It turns out that the difference in relative luminance between <code>blue-400</code> and <code>blue-500</code> is nearly twice the difference between <code>blue-500</code> and <code>blue-600</code>.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/6160/1*3QS-HIrIgC4RizgN8cKNag.jpeg" width="3080" height="1690" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*3QS-HIrIgC4RizgN8cKNag.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*3QS-HIrIgC4RizgN8cKNag.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*3QS-HIrIgC4RizgN8cKNag.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*3QS-HIrIgC4RizgN8cKNag.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*3QS-HIrIgC4RizgN8cKNag.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="4163">Additionally, the numbers aren’t comparable across color sets. There’s no guarantee that three colors with the same number, like <code>blue-600</code>, <code>teal-600</code>, and <code>gray-600</code>, would have similar luminance. And they don’t.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2464/1*MRZjShD91XkP6-KmN1sgBQ.jpeg" width="1232" height="756" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*MRZjShD91XkP6-KmN1sgBQ.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*MRZjShD91XkP6-KmN1sgBQ.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*MRZjShD91XkP6-KmN1sgBQ.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*MRZjShD91XkP6-KmN1sgBQ.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*MRZjShD91XkP6-KmN1sgBQ.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="fbd6">To be clear, this isn’t only a problem with our ordinal scale — it’s a limitation of ordinal scales in general. In <a href="https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#tools-for-picking-colors" rel="noopener">Material UI</a>, for example, <code>red-200</code>, their third lightest red variant, is actually darker than <code>yellow-600</code>, a darker-than-average yellow. Ordinal scales, by their very nature, are unable to communicate anything absolute about luminance.</p><p id="bde9">This is a problem if you’re trying to use color accessibly because you can only know if a color pair is accessible by <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G18.html#G18-tests" rel="noopener">comparing the two colors’ luminance</a>.</p><p id="c6f8">In 2018 <a href="https://medium.com/u/db93101e3bcb?source=post_page-----bb960de25aa5--------------------------------" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kevyn Arnott</a>, then working at Lyft, <a href="https://medium.com/r?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdesign.lyft.com%2Fre-approaching-color-9e604ba22c88" rel="noopener">wrote about the new color system his team was using</a>.</p><p id="5158">At the time, this section caught a lot of people’s attention, including mine:</p><blockquote><p id="2a07">We made accessibility a cornerstone of our new color system. We wanted to remove the need to manually check color contrast using third-party tools, and we needed to make it dead-simple for everyone to create accessible products.</p><p id="843e">To solve this, we leveraged what we had already done with color naming and selection. Using our algorithm, we made our color lightness-to-darkness consistent across color hues, so that every color 0–50 is accessible (4.5:1) on black, and every color 60–100 is accessible (4.5:1) on white.</p></blockquote><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/9990/1*JfQaY2HluG9ViCZplEmNXw.jpeg" width="4995" height="3670" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*JfQaY2HluG9ViCZplEmNXw.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*JfQaY2HluG9ViCZplEmNXw.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*JfQaY2HluG9ViCZplEmNXw.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*JfQaY2HluG9ViCZplEmNXw.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*JfQaY2HluG9ViCZplEmNXw.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Created from an illustration originally on the <a href="https://design.lyft.com/re-approaching-color-9e604ba22c88" rel="noopener">Lyft Design blog</a></figcaption></figure><p id="a907">The approach here blew my mind. It wasn’t trying to solve the problem with rules or tools. It was, rather, a systems-based solution that can clearly communicate, for any color, what color text can be put on top of it.</p><p id="dff9">But this system isn’t without limitations. We’ve already established that ordinal scales can’t communicate anything absolute about luminance, and thus can’t tell you anything about accessibility. Since the Lyft color system clearly uses an ordinal scale, you might wonder how it’s able to communicate any information about accessibility. Where’s the magic?</p><p id="99f8">The sleight of hand is that they’re really using TWO ordinal scales, not just one. The first ordinal scale has a range of 0–50 and is used for colors that can be paired with black. The second ordinal scale has a range of 60–100, for colors that work with white. The limitations are still there, which is why the numbers can tell you only if a color is accessible compared to pure black or pure white, and even then only using the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum" rel="noopener">AA contrast ratio standard</a>.</p><p id="7233">This limitation might not seem like a big deal, but most apps don’t use pure black and white text — at least not everywhere. And some apps aim for the stricter <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-enhanced" rel="noopener">AAA contrast standard</a> of 7:1.</p><p id="4398">It got me wondering if there could be a color naming system that would work for all colors, and across all contrast ratios. As it turns out, there is!</p><p id="7c1e">This brings us to the improved numbering scale we developed and are now using at Amplitude. Rather than beginning with an ordinal scale, we’re using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement#Ratio_scale" rel="noopener">ratio scale</a> that can communicate information about luminance that is specific and precise.</p><p id="3fad">This increased precision is reflected in the numbers we now use. What we used to call <code>blue-500</code> is now <code>blue-526</code>, for example. This increased precision allows us to make luminance comparisons across color sets and know, for example, that <code>teal-621</code> is lighter than <code>blue-526</code> and darker than <code>gray-689</code>³.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/6160/1*qRT777cm4gMUQ0s792-tRA.jpeg" width="3080" height="1760" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*qRT777cm4gMUQ0s792-tRA.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*qRT777cm4gMUQ0s792-tRA.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*qRT777cm4gMUQ0s792-tRA.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*qRT777cm4gMUQ0s792-tRA.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*qRT777cm4gMUQ0s792-tRA.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="08d5">Most importantly, it makes it much easier to figure out what colors can work together accessibly, using any contrast ratio. If the difference between two numbers is ≥ 495, the two colors have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1. If the difference is ≥ 640, the two colors have a contrast ratio of at least 7:1. And if the difference is ≥ 361, the contrast ratio is at least 3:1 (a contrast ratio that’s AA accessible for sufficiently large text).</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/10720/1*cwMTR0Fh85qjFjez22HQ0A.jpeg" width="5360" height="4975" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*cwMTR0Fh85qjFjez22HQ0A.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*cwMTR0Fh85qjFjez22HQ0A.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*cwMTR0Fh85qjFjez22HQ0A.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*cwMTR0Fh85qjFjez22HQ0A.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*cwMTR0Fh85qjFjez22HQ0A.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="8ea1">In the next section I’ll cover the math we used to generate these numbers. If you’re not interested in the math and just want to start using the system you can <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12fsRh5qpKmDTOQk3Jd0ocB7OrXXmRe7CVDY9O9orIvA/edit#gid=0" rel="noopener">copy this spreadsheet that does all the math for you.</a></p><h2 id="27fe">The Math</h2><p id="5f0d">For any fully opaque color or shade follow these steps:</p><p id="7169"><strong><em>Step 1: Find the color’s relative luminance. </em></strong>It will be a value between 0% for pure black and 100% for pure white. I’ve been using <a href="https://planetcalc.com/7779/" rel="noopener">this website to calculate relative luminance of any color</a> to four decimal places.</p></div></div><div><p id="d367"><strong><em>Step 2: Add 5 to the relative luminance to get the adjusted relative luminance.</em> </strong>Take the number from Step 1 and add 5 to it. This will give you a value between 5 for pure black and 105 for pure white. This “adding of 5” is in accordance with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html#key-terms" rel="noopener">the formula WCAG uses to calculate contrast ratios</a>. We’ll call this number the “adjusted relative luminance”.</p></div><div><p id="3816"><strong><em>Step 3: Divide the adjusted relative luminance by 5 to get the scaled relative luminance</em></strong><em>.</em> Take the number from Step 2 and divide it by 5. Now you’ll have a number between 1 (pure black) and 21 (pure white). We’ll call the number generated in this step the “scaled relative luminance”. When you have two of these numbers (representing two different colors) they can be used to represent the pair’s contrast ratio — the ratio between black and white, for example, would be 21:1.</p></div><div><p id="7209"><strong><em>Step 4: Calculate log2(x) of the scaled relative luminance to get the binary log of scaled relative luminance.</em></strong> Here’s where things start to get fun. Take the number from Step 3 and calculate its binary log (a.k.a. its log base 2). You can do this with any calculator, or use <a href="https://www.calculator.net/log-calculator.html?xv=&amp;base=2&amp;yv=&amp;x=82&amp;y=30" rel="noopener">a website like this one</a>. You’ll get a number between 0 (pure black) and 4.38238… (pure white). By applying the binary logarithm to the value from Step 3 we’re mapping it in such a way where a standard increase in value corresponds to a standard increase in contrast ratio — the thing we care about. This is what makes it possible to know the contrast ratio of two colors using subtraction as opposed to division.</p></div><div><p id="c507"><strong><em>Step 5: Multiply the binary log of scaled relative luminance by 1000 / log2(21) to get your final number.</em></strong> Take the number from Step 4 and multiply it by 1000 / log2(21), a scaling constant used to map the values from Step 4 onto a 1000-point scale. This will leave you with a number between 0 (pure black) and 1000 (pure white). Round this number to the nearest whole number and use it in your color name!</p></div><div><div><p id="3cf1">Using color names that communicate specific accessibility information can make the task of identifying and using accessible color combinations much easier for your team, as it has for ours. Naming colors in this way allows your designers and developers to be more confident in the accessibility of the …</p></div></div></div>

<p>A couple weeks ago one of my brother-in-laws asked me about investing in Bitcoin (he knows I’m gearing up a <a href="https://bombthrower.com/newsletters/the-crypto-equity-advisor/">newsletter specifically about crypto equities</a>) and it made me wonder if we were near the top of this cycle. Sure enough, BTC has come off a good 25% off the peak, Ethereum is still holding up near all-time-highs. But it was that everyman-talking-Bitcoin dynamic that is almost a trope now. Starting with the possibly apocryphal story of Joseph Kennedy top-ticking the stock market in 1929 upon receiving hot tips from the shoe-shine boy ,the idea that when <strong>“normal people are getting rich, something has to be off”</strong> was almost conventional wisdom.</p>
<p>Until now.</p>
<p>Now it’s not conventional wisdom, it’s Establishment Canon.</p>

<p>I trust you already know the story of <a href="https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets">/r/WallStreetBets</a> because even more everyday people are talking to me about Gamestop over the last 72 hours than Bitcoin (cryptos skyrocketing a mere 50% or 100% is quaint now. The slow lane).</p>
<p>Gamestop (et al) is where the action is now. At least until this morning.</p>
<p>The epic short squeezes had some hedge funds being carried out because their naked shorts have blown up. Reddit clamped down on WallStreetBets, briefly making the subreddit private and then re-opening it. I actually expect Reddit to suspend them, any second now. <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/reddits-wallstbets-goes-private-shortly-after-discord-shuts-down-server-51611792059">WallStreetBet’s Discord was shut down</a> (for “hate speech” – get used to hearing that one from now on) and as of this morning, Robinhood has suspended new long positions in Gamestop, AMC and a few other garbage stocks that hedge funds were shorting the hell out of.</p>
<p>As many are quick to comment…</p>
<h3>The hypocrisy at work this week is manyfold</h3>
<p>Barstool Dave Portnoy <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/you-can-not-purchase-additional-shares-robinhood-reportedly-removed-shuts-down-buying">is roasting RobinHood on Twitter</a> while another noted</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Funny to see <a href="https://twitter.com/RobinhoodApp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RobinhoodApp</a> promoting Finance Democracy whilst blocking people who are exactly exercising finance democracy from buying <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GME&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$GME</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$AMC</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24NOK&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$NOK</a>. <a href="https://t.co/fjkDcupZxT">pic.twitter.com/fjkDcupZxT</a></p>

<p>And in his letter this morning <a href="https://tomwoods.com/">Tom Woods</a> called it “<strong>The Gamestop Rebellion”</strong>, observing:</p>
<blockquote><p>If the average American suffers a loss, that’s a darn shame. If big players suffer a loss, shut everything down!</p></blockquote>
<p>Mike Swanson at WallStreetWindow<a href="https://wallstreetwindow.com/2021/01/we-saw-the-stock-market-dump-like-this-just-a-few-weeks-ago-mike-swanson-01-28-20210/"> assembled a truly dizzying set of charts</a> of the issues affected and noted the juxtaposition:</p>
<blockquote><p>These are all epic short squeezes and the traders on the internet, many of whom are apparently Robinhood traders, are celebrating and going wild, <strong>but on CNBC and much of the mainstream media there is outrage and a call for regulation as the short squeezes are crushing big money hedge funds short these stocks.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>This is all indicative of a creeping two-tier system I’ve been writing about for years, and talk about <a href="https://bombthrower.com/join">on my mailing list</a>. Thanks <a href="https://bombthrower.com/articles/get-used-to-living-under-subsidiarity-after-the-great-reset/">to The Great Reset</a>&nbsp; this now looks to be veritably enshrined in law under this asymmetrical governance structure euphemistically<a href="https://bombthrower.com/articles/get-used-to-living-under-subsidiarity-after-the-great-reset/"> called The New Normal</a>.</p>
<p>The New Normal means the Fed will <a href="https://bombthrower.com/articles/wait-why-is-the-fed-buying-my-biggest-competitors-bonds/">print up money to buy the bonds of worlds largest companies</a>, career politicians (or their spouses) <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/nancy-pelosi-husband-bought-apple-tesla-disney-stock-options-51611496598">will make millions buying up call options</a> of those very same companies.</p>
<p>The New Normal means that big box stores get to stay open while small and independent businesses are declared non-essential and ordered closed, indefinitely.</p>
<p>And then when the people on the wrong end of this stick get paid a pittance that amounts to asswipe money, and they push it into the stock market and end up making a killing, what happens?</p>
<p>The ref throws a penalty flag from the sidelines and the rules get changed.</p>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZHTm0N59Rc">Jim Cramer talking with Pacific Capital’s Herb Greenberg</a> who vehemently calls what is happening “manipulation” and “illegal”, going so far to trot out the “<em>this could be the work of foreign powers”</em> card. Uh huh.</p>
<p>Cramer, for his part is being a bit more stoic about it, perhaps because he knows he’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMShFx5rThI">on record and on film</a> describing how&nbsp;<em>he </em>routinely manipulated stocks back in his hedge fund days:</p>
<blockquote><p>“You know a lot of times when I was short at my hedge fund and I was positioned short meaning I needed it to open up, I would create a level of activity beforehand that could drive the futures. It doesn’t take much money.</p>
<p>Similarly&nbsp; if I were long and I would want to make things a little bit rosy I would go in and take a bunch of stocks and make sure that they are higher,&nbsp; you know maybe commit five million in capital do it.</p>
<p><strong>And I could affect it.</strong> What you’re seeing now is maybe it probably is bigger market now, maybe any ten million capital <strong>and knock the stuff down</strong> <em><strong>but it’s a fun game and it’s a lucrative game “</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>No better example exists of&nbsp; <a href="https://bombthrower.com/articles/jackpot-chronicles-3-the-great-bifurcation/">The Great Bifurcation</a> between Wall Street and Main Street than CNBC and Jim Cramer:</p>
<p>When Main Street companies lay off workers, it’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmSZaov9riU">the way of the world but the stock could be a buy</a>, but when a bunch of bankers and hedge funds blow themselves up because they levered up on bullshit derivatives that unceremoniously imploded, as Cramer’s now legendary meltdown during the GFC illustrates: <em>that’s</em> a crime against humanity.</p>
<center><br>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SWksEJQEYVU" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center><br>
This clip never gets old. It bears noting that in the opening seconds of Cramer’s meltdown were the words <em>“forget the investors”.</em> He’s beside himself with anxiety and rage <em>because it’s the bankers that are going down.</em>
<p>You don’t have to be reminded of this anymore, because WallStreetBets has forced it out into the open.</p>
<p>The system is structured so that Joe Public loses, and the Establishment always wins, even if they have to change the rules or endlessly move the goalposts to do it.</p>
<h3>Will WSB Be The Tipping Point that Changes Investor Psychology?</h3>
<p>I wonder if this entire chapter could be the tipping point toward a larger change in investor psychology. Not necessarily warning of an impending crash, but we are trading up here at heights that make nosebleed levels look rather tame.</p>
<p>How are the stunts pulled by WallStreetBets any different from money-losing unicorn pumps, SPACs, <em>ETFs of SPACs</em>?</p>
<p>Until now, investors were happy to go along with all this and pretend it was normal and sustainable. One of things WSB has done is shine a light on the insanity and manic euphoria. If what&nbsp;<em>they’re&nbsp;</em>doing is somehow offside or crazy, <em>so is everything else.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>In the 2008 GFC I was amazed at how fast the overall sentiment flipped over from&nbsp;<em>greed&nbsp;</em>to&nbsp;<em>fear.&nbsp;</em>What if one of the unexpected side effects of all this that investor sentiment shifts ever so slightly, as enough people think about getting more defensive, maybe taking some profits off the table, and looking sidelong toward the exits….?</p>

				<p>With in-person concerts on pause this past year, we at Genius have been working on <a href="https://live.genius.com/">Genius Live</a>, a new live streaming platform where fans control the show.</p><p>Polls are one of the core features, letting fans decide parts of the artist's setlist in real time. The format isn't set in stone yet, and we've been experimenting with the number of song choices and other factors.</p><figure><img src="https://genius.engineering/content/images/2021/01/poll_preview-3.png" alt="Cropped view of the Genius live interface for our show with Mariah the Scientist, highlighting the poll feature" srcset="https://genius.engineering/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/poll_preview-3.png 600w, https://genius.engineering/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/poll_preview-3.png 1000w, https://genius.engineering/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/poll_preview-3.png 1600w, https://genius.engineering/content/images/2021/01/poll_preview-3.png 1733w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>A pre-show poll from our concert with Mariah the Scientist</figcaption></figure><h3 id="tie-breaking">Tie breaking</h3><p>During our <a href="https://genius.com/a/watch-wiz-khalifa-perform-in-the-first-ever-genius-live-interactive-concert">first show with Wiz Khalifa</a>, one of these setlist polls ended in a tie– 218 votes each for <a href="https://genius.com/Wiz-khalifa-medicated-lyrics">"Medicated"</a> and <a href="https://genius.com/Wiz-khalifa-the-kid-frankie-lyrics">"The Kid Frankie"</a>.</p><p>Our production team ended up resolving things behind the scenes, but the poll results still showed there had been a tie, confusing (and somewhat infuriating 😬) the audience. </p><figure><img src="https://genius.engineering/content/images/2021/01/comments_tiebreaker-3.png" alt="multiple YouTube chat messages: &quot;I SEE A TIE KID FRANKIE DID NOT LOSE&quot; and &quot;Tie play em both Gang Gang&quot;" srcset="https://genius.engineering/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/comments_tiebreaker-3.png 600w, https://genius.engineering/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/comments_tiebreaker-3.png 1000w, https://genius.engineering/content/images/2021/01/comments_tiebreaker-3.png 1467w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>In the weeks following the event, we spent a lot of time figuring out how to reduce the platform's overhead for our producers, and that had to apply to how we solved the tie problem as well. </p><p>As nice as it would be to have a human consider how to break a tie, I realized that it would not only burden the production team with extra responsibilities, but complicate all of the workflows that are supposed to be run when a poll ends. Not only does the artist have to perform one of these songs, but we have to update our data and video feeds accordingly. It's also just not very transparent! </p><p>We decided it'd be much simpler to have the system decide how to resolve a tie deterministically, using the timestamps of the most recent vote on each option.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure>

What if all the decimal remainders are the same, like a 2-option poll with remainders of <code>0.5</code>, or a 3-way tie? Some proposed solutions include calculating and minimizing the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/34959983">relative error rate</a> (rounded-up percentage / total percentage - 1) instead, but even the mathiest solutions can't solve a 3-way tie on their own. 🤔</p><p>In writing test implementations, I realized we have a secondary factor that none of these algorithms do– the tie breaker logic! Combine this with a simplified approach to the relative error rate method, and we have a fairly straightforward way to distribute the margin of error. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>In recent years, drivers, activists, and entrepreneurs have envisioned what a fairer rideshare platform than Uber and Lyft might look like. The aim is to empower the individuals who sustain such services by creating an alternative that can deliver the convenience and benefits of peer-to-peer ridesharing without the exploitation that has become emblematic of the industry.</p>
            <p>Some observers wonder if Uber and Lyft are digging their own grave, with or without competition — or rather, that they’re doomed because of market forces and the venture-capital model that both companies are locked into. Uber lost <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/06/tech/uber-q4-earnings/index.html#:~:text=In%20total%2C%20Uber%20lost%20a,statement%20with%20the%20earnings%20report.">$8.5 billion</a> in 2019, the year it went public in an offering that was widely deemed a flop. Although the companies have diversified their businesses, branching out into services like urban bike rentals and restaurant delivery, they remain unprofitable, and with the self-driving cars that threaten to replace drivers nowhere near ready for market, it’s unclear how that will change.</p>
            <p>“It’s just a model that’s ripe for collapse,” said Trebor Scholz, an associate professor at the New School who chronicled gig workers’ travails in his 2016 book, <em>Uberworked and Underpaid</em>. “It’s not because somebody else outcompetes them. It’s just because you can’t run a business that loses that much money without having a clear perspective, and they don’t have that.”</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, many rideshare drivers are fed up with years of plummeting pay and being treated like commodities. A <a href="https://irle.berkeley.edu/files/2020/07/Parrott-Reich-Seattle-Report_July-2020.pdf">study</a> published last July found that Seattle drivers were averaging less than $10 an hour after expenses — below minimum wage. But successful alternative rideshare experiments remain “pretty few and far between,” according to transportation researcher Adam Stocker. He spent over a year <a href="https://arcade.city/files/ArcadeCity_FinalReport.pdf">studying</a> one such organization: <a href="https://arcade.city/">Arcade City</a>, a rideshare project whose flagship network in Austin, Texas, has become one of the most successful local alternative services in the US.</p>

            <p>Among those drawn to the challenge of creating a “decentralized Uber” are blockchain enthusiasts who imagine that distributed ledger technology can replace opaque corporate algorithms and empower drivers. The idea has been floated in crypto-enthusiast circles as a use case for blockchain since at least the early days of Ethereum, and has cropped up in <a href="https://uberpeople.net/threads/what-comes-after-uber-and-lyft.409535/">driver forums</a>. Though Christopher David, Arcade City’s founder, was initially <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/arcade-city-decentralized-blockchain-based-answer-to-uber">bullish</a> about the idea of establishing a rideshare service on something like Ethereum, the reality of the service ended up being quite different, and he acknowledges that decentralized technologies aren’t necessarily a silver bullet for the rideshare industry’s problems.</p>
            <p>“There’s this fantasy that riders and drivers are going to be connecting and a blockchain is going to be the only thing mediating their interactions, and I think that’s unrealistic,” he said. “That may happen at some point, but there’s a real need and desire for community, for people to feel that they are supported in this type of activity, which is inherently risky.”</p>
            <p>Arcade City launched in Austin in 2016, after Uber and Lyft lost an expensive battle against a local law requiring their drivers in the area to be fingerprinted. Complaining that such rules needlessly complicated the onboarding of new drivers, the companies had followed through on a threat to withdraw from the city. Thousands of drivers were suddenly unemployed, and riders were left stranded.</p>
            <p>A former Uber driver, David moved to Austin from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, after hearing about what was happening there. (“Horror stories of drunk people banging on windows waving cash, trying to get rides home,” he recalled. “It was that bad.”) While others eager to capitalize on Uber and Lyft’s Austin exit were still scrambling, he launched Arcade City as a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/ArcadeCityAustin">Facebook group</a> with a driver who had previously run a small rideshare message board elsewhere, and their venture attracted thousands of members in the first few weeks. The technology was rudimentary — riders posted requests that drivers would respond to — but it worked well.</p>
            <div>
    
<figure><blockquote><p>Apart from devising rideshare technology and attracting riders and drivers away from the rideshare giants, the challenge of building equitable alternatives to Uber and Lyft involves determining how to structure a sustainable business model.</p></blockquote></figure>
  </div>
            <p>Although Uber and Lyft returned to Austin in 2017 after Texas passed a law overriding the local regulation of “transportation network companies” (following a regulatory model that the companies have successfully advocated for in most other states), Arcade City is the only alternative service remaining from Austin’s Uber-less period. “I think the fact that they’re the only service that survived the return of Uber and Lyft speaks volumes to the sustainability of a potential decentralized model for rideshare that’s not necessarily 100 percent profit-driven,” Stocker said.</p>
            <p>Arcade City fares in Austin ($2-3 per mile, $10 minimum) are typically more expensive than Uber or Lyft, which heavily subsidize rides, have larger driver networks, and rely on highly efficient algorithms. Still, the service has developed a loyal clientele, particularly among local service workers, many of whom like having the option to pay cash. It also has a loyal core of drivers; though many of them also drive for Uber, Stocker found that most prioritize Arcade City rides because they keep all of those fares versus only a fraction of Uber fares. And it includes a feature highly popular among riders and drivers alike: the option for riders to rebook a preferred driver, which gives drivers the ability to develop “regulars.”</p>
            <p>This feature, which Arcade City isn’t the only aspiring Uber competitor to offer, highlights the sometimes contradictory demands of customer satisfaction and Uber’s business model. Stocker notes that no technical barrier prevents Uber and Lyft from incorporating it, but doing so would chafe against their aim for maximum efficiency while complicating their position as privileged intermediaries. “The more you make truly peer-to-peer connections, the less transactions go directly through the platform,” he explained. “If you’re not trying to extract as much profit from every ride transaction as possible, you don’t necessarily need every transaction to go through your platform.”</p>

            <p>Today, Arcade City’s Austin network is still entirely operated by its drivers as a Facebook group. David is no longer involved in its day-to-day management, but he has tried experimenting with ways to adapt its model to decentralized technology and expand it elsewhere. A longtime cryptocurrency enthusiast, he did an Arcade City token sale in 2017 and <a href="https://arcade.city/state-of-the-city">has been working</a> on a corresponding app incorporating token functionality — projects that have <a href="https://medium.com/@CTUAgentIvan/arcade-city-is-a-scam-98c22c557f18">elicited controversy</a> online. But the enduring success of the Austin operation shows how community-based initiatives can take root.</p>
            <p>Last year, advocates of rideshare alternatives had hoped that California’s recent move to force Uber and Lyft to classify their workers as employees rather than independent contractors would lead the companies to withdraw from the state as they had from Austin, giving them a statewide opening that they could seize. The prospect of defeating <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_22,_App-Based_Drivers_as_Contractors_and_Labor_Policies_Initiative_(2020)">Prop 22</a>, a ballot initiative supported by the companies that would exempt them from the new law, looked like a potential watershed for the movement. Voters ultimately approved the measure, so this golden opportunity didn’t pan out, but the setback hasn’t dampened enthusiasm for developing rideshare alternatives. For many drivers, Uber and Lyft’s threat to leave California highlighted the precariousness of their livelihoods like never before.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Apart from devising rideshare technology and attracting riders and drivers away from the rideshare giants, the challenge of building equitable alternatives to Uber and Lyft involves determining how to structure a sustainable business model. The longest-lived Austin experiment after Arcade City, a service called Ride Austin, attempted a nonprofit structure <a href="https://communityimpact.com/austin/central-austin/impacts/2020/06/12/rideaustin-shuts-down-operations/">before shutting down</a> last summer. But Boston College sociologist Juliet Schor, whose recent book <em>After the Gig</em> reflects a decade of researching various “sharing economy” platforms, thinks another model is better: a cooperative. This basically refers to a democratically governed, worker-owned business as an alternative to shareholder-controlled companies. Under a cooperative, the operation of the business is dictated by the people who depend on it most.</p>
            <p>Arcade City is more of a peer-to-peer network than a proper co-op. While it seems to have done something right, Stocker realized in the course of his research that its weak point was its lack of effective governance; tensions among drivers ran high, and drivers complained that the service’s moderators sometimes deleted messages, picked favorites, or claimed rides for themselves. “Honestly, if someone was running the driver side who had a basic understanding of how to govern a company or a cooperative, I think that this group could be at a much larger scale than they are currently and just be operating much more smoothly,” Stocker said.</p>

<hr>
<p>There is no magic formula in data science that can tell us which type of machine
 learning algorithm will perform best for a specific use-case. Different models
 are better suited for different types of data and different problems. At best,
 you can follow some <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html">rough guide</a>
 on how to approach problems with regard to which model to try on your data, but
 these are often more confusing than helpful. Best practices tell
 us to start with a simple model (e.g. linear regression) and build up to more
 complicated models (e.g. logistic regression -&gt; random forest -&gt; multi-layer perceptron)
 if you are not satisfied with the results. Unfortunately, different models require
 different data cleaning steps, different type/amount of features, tuning a new set
 of hyperparameters, etc. Refactoring the code for this purpose can be quite boring
 and time-consuming. Because of this, many data scientists end up just using the model
 best known to them and fine-tuning this particular model without ever trying different
 ones. This can result in poor performance (because the model is just not the right one
 for the task) or in poor time management (because you could have achieved a similar
 performance with a simpler/faster model).</p>
<p>ATOM is here to help us solve these issues. With just a few lines of code, you can
 perform basic data cleaning steps, select relevant features and compare the performance
 of multiple models on a given dataset. ATOM should be able to provide quick insights
 on which algorithms perform best for the task at hand and provide an indication of
 the feasibility of the ML solution.</p>
<p>It is important to realize that ATOM is not here to replace all the work a data
 scientist has to do before getting his model into production. ATOM doesn't spit out
 production-ready models just by tuning some parameters in its API. After helping you
 to determine the right model, you will most probably need to fine-tune it using
 use-case specific features and data cleaning steps in order to achieve maximum performance.</p>
<p>So, this sounds a bit like AutoML, how is ATOM different than 
 <a href="https://automl.github.io/auto-sklearn/master/">auto-sklearn</a> or <a href="http://epistasislab.github.io/tpot/">TPOT</a>?
 Well, ATOM does AutoML in the sense that it helps you find the best model for a
 specific task, but contrary to the aforementioned packages, it does not actively
 search for the best model. It simply runs all of them and let you pick the one that
 you think suites you best. AutoML packages are often black boxes: if you provide
 data, it will magically return a working model. Although it works great, they often
 produce complicated pipelines with low explainability, hard to sell to the business.
 In this, ATOM excels. Every step of the pipeline is accounted for, and using the
 provided plotting methods, it’s easy to demonstrate why a model is better/worse than
 the other.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>A data scientist with domain knowledge can outperform ATOM if he applies
use case-specific feature engineering or data cleaning steps! </p>
</div>
<p>Example steps taken by ATOM's pipeline:</p>
<ol>
<li>Data Cleaning<ul>
<li>Handle missing values</li>
<li>Encode categorical features</li>
<li>Remove outliers</li>
<li>Balance the dataset</li>

<li>Create new non-linear features</li>
<li>Remove multi-collinear features</li>
<li>Remove features with too low variance</li>
<li>Select the most promising features based on a statistical test</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Train and validate multiple models<ul>
<li>Select hyperparameters using a Bayesian Optimization approach</li>
<li>Train and test the models on the provided data</li>
<li>Perform bagging to assess the robustness of the output</li>

                    <p>In 2018, Stripe released a study called the <a href="https://stripe.com/reports/developer-coefficient-2018">developer coefficient</a>. The report concluded that software engineering efficiency would cost 3 Trillion in GDP over the next ten years.</p><p>There are lots of great information in the paper, if you have time, you should take a look, but one statistic stood out for me as a developer.</p><blockquote>On average, 41% of developer's time is working on bugs, maintenance, and technical debt.</blockquote><p>As developers, you are most likely nodding your head in agreement or saying at my place of employment, it is more like 60% or 70%, or it should be because our system is drowning in complexity.</p><p>Some teams are known as high performing teams that regularly spend less than 20% of their time dealing with technical debt. How?</p><ul><li>At some point in the project, they implemented firm boundaries between their systems, separating standard services from application business logic.</li><li>Implemented automated, resilient test coverage</li><li>Implemented automated lifecycle deployment</li><li>And automated software lifecycle metrics</li></ul><p>Guess what? Without the first bullet, the next three are very hard to implement. There are plenty of buzz words about architecture styles, and preferences and those are excellent patterns for the specific use cases. Regardless of technology or architecture design, if you do not separate your business logic and rules from your implementation details, you will reach a point where the technical debt takes 41% and above your developer's time. As a result, the developer culture becomes an unproductive environment for most developers.</p><blockquote>hyper63 is a service framework that creates a firm boundary between your business logic/rules and your services (implementation details) so that development teams can focus on the work that drives value into the business.</blockquote><p>Whether you use hyper63 or implement service boundaries on your own, convince your team as early as possible to think about how developers should organize the application code so that you don't let technical debt become the bottleneck to your productivity and developer happiness.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.hyper63.com/content/images/2021/01/business-logic-with-api-hyper63-1.png"></figure>

By close today, it had reached $364.15. An intense buzz has formed in the stock thanks to discussion on the Reddit forum Wall Street Bets, further enhanced by dominant coverage in the media. At least one hedge fund, Melvin Capital, that was shorting GameStop (betting the price would fall) got <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/melvin-capital-closes-out-its-gamestop-position-cnbc-reports">utterly crushed</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-6.52.14-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-6.52.14-PM.png 600w, https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-6.52.14-PM.png 1000w, https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-6.52.14-PM.png 1600w, https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/size/w2400/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-6.52.14-PM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Some cheered the victory of Reddit and Robinhood over Wall Street.</p><p>But it isn't so simple.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>(If you'd like to skip the explanation and <a href="#questions">jump to my suggestions for the future, go here.</a>)</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>This mania started when a popular Reddit forum called Wall Street Bets began writing about some of the most "shorted" retail stocks. </p><blockquote>You can bet that the price of a stock will <em>fall</em> by taking on a short position. This requires you to <strong>borrow the stock </strong>from someone else first. Your broker then immediately sells the stock. Since you think the price will fall further, you're calm, cool, and collected. You wait to the price to fall more, and then you buy the stock <strong>back</strong> at a lower price, so you can return the shares to whoever you borrowed it from. </blockquote><p>Wall Street Bets publicly hatched a plan on the forum to buy and <strong>hold </strong>GameStop stock, and GameStop call options, in order to drive the price up so high, it would create a "short squeeze." A "short squeeze" is when a price jumps so high that the short sellers are forced to buy <em>back </em>the stock to close out their position (usually due to their broker requiring them to put up more cash because they're losing money so fast. This is a "margin call"). </p><p>All the attention and momentum from the press brought in more retail traders buying GameStop, and Wall Street itself hopped in for the ride. So many people buying call options also caused the people <em>selling</em> the Robinhood crowd those options to buy the stock in order to "hedge" their bets. </p><blockquote>One of the byproducts of both Robinhood and Wall Street Bets has been the popularization of trading options by retail traders. </blockquote><blockquote>A stock option is a derivative that gives you the <strong>right</strong> to buy or sell 100 shares of stock in the <strong>future</strong> at a set price. The price you have the right to buy or sell it at is the "strike price." The option has an <strong>expiration </strong>date. It also can be either a Call option (which gives you the right to buy the stock) or a Put option (which gives you the right to sell it). </blockquote><p>When you buy a Call option from a market maker, if that market maker doesn't already own the stock, they have to hedge their bet by buying the stock. So not only did you have all of these people on Robinhood buying GameStop stock, many were also buying GameStop call options. That meant the market makers on Wall Street were <strong><em>also</em></strong> buying GameStop stock in order to hedge their position.</p><p>It's worth noting that since the start of the pandemic, there's actually been a monumental <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-retail-investing-shorts-trading-options-deutsche-bank-2021-1-1030005344">increase</a> in retail traders buying call options:</p><figure><img src="https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-7.58.10-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-7.58.10-PM.png 600w, https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-7.58.10-PM.png 1000w, https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-7.58.10-PM.png 1230w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>All of this drove the price of GameStop into the stratosphere.</p><p>We know that many Robinhood and Redditors are profiting off this. But they aren't the only ones. </p><h3 id="citadel-pays-for-order-flow-from-robin-hood-">Citadel pays for order flow from Robin Hood. </h3><p>Citadel is a massive hedge fund (founded by billionaire Ken Griffin) with three different firms: a tech firm, an asset manager, and a market maker. The market maker, <strong>Citadel Securities</strong>, pays Robinhood a pre-set fee for every trade they execute. &nbsp;(It's worth noting that Citadel isn't just <em>any </em>market maker. They're massive: handling <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-25/citadel-securities-expands-an-already-dominant-options-business?sref=f7rH2jWS">almost a quarter</a> of all listed (aka, exchange-traded) stock options.)</p><p>This is what's called a <strong>Payment for Order Flow (PFOF) </strong>arrangement.</p><p>Market markers can profit from these arrangements in a few different ways (read more <a href="https://centerpointsecurities.com/payment-for-order-flow-guide/">here</a> if you want the full details). But the best way to summarize it is this: Citadel can batch the Robinhood orders together, leverage its sophisticated high-frequency trading (HFT) algorithms to "front run" (buy shares "in front of" or before your client does) Robinhood trades. </p><p>Robinhood traders are generally not buying or selling options in "lots" (batches of 100); they're usually buying one or two or ten options at a time. So Citadel may batch a number of Robinhood users' options together, buy multiple "lots" themselves from another dealer, then fill the batch of Robinhood orders at a slightly worse price that what Citadel paid for it. </p><figure><img src="https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-7.29.46-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-7.29.46-PM.png 600w, https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-7.29.46-PM.png 1000w, https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-7.29.46-PM.png 1566w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Image via<a href="https://centerpointsecurities.com/payment-for-order-flow-guide/"> Center Point Securities</a></figcaption></figure><p>Historically, there's been debate about whether or not Payment for Order Flow should even be allowed. The practice was actually originated by none other than Bernie Madoff (the famous ponzi scheme fraudster) in the 1980s. During the Obama administration, the SEC asked one of its market advisory commitees if Payment for Order Flow <a href="https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/equity-market-structure/issues-affecting-customers-emsac-012616.pdf">should be banned</a>. </p><p>Citadel has also gotten into trouble with the SEC in the past for the way it handled its Payment for Order Flow: In 2017, they <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-13/citadel-unit-to-pay-22-6-million-in-sec-settlement-over-trades">fined</a> Citadel Securities $22.6 million, "saying the firm inaccurately described how it handled trades placed by small investors," according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quicktake/payment-for-order-flow">Bloomberg</a>.</p><p>Some, like Institutional Investor magazine (a major Wall Street trade publication) have asked, essentially "who cares?" They <a href="https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1m2p1cv68bx56/Twitter-Freaked-Out-Over-Robinhood-Selling-Its-Trade-Flow-But-the-App-and-Others-Have-Been-Doing-It-for-Years">noted in June 2020</a> that "payment-for-order-flow is nothing new" and that the practice is used by "<a href="https://capitalmarkets.fidelity.com/app/literature/item/9886428.html">Fidelity</a>, <a href="https://content.etrade.com/etrade/powerpage/pdf/OrderRouting11AC6.pdf">e*Trade</a>, <a href="https://content.schwab.com/drupal_dependencies/psr/606/final.pdf">Charles Schwab</a>, and <a href="https://www.tdameritrade.com/retail-en_us/resources/606_disclosure/tdainc-TDA2055-q1-2020.pdf">TD Ameritrade</a>, among others, SEC Rule 606 disclosures show." </p><p>But unlike the other firms that use this technique—Robinhood <strong>doesn’t publish data</strong> on how much price improvement it gives customers.</p><p>Not only that, but Robinhood wasn't initially honest about this arrangement:</p><ul><li>In December 2020, the SEC charged Robinhood with <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321">failing to disclose</a> that it was using this Payment for Order Flow model at all. The SEC also found that Robinhood was failing to provide "best execution" to its clients, thus <strong>costing them over $34 million</strong> due to "inferior trade prices," even when you factored in zero commissions. </li><li>Even FINRA, Wall Street's <em>self-regulating</em> overseer, also <a href="https://www.finra.org/media-center/newsreleases/2019/finra-fines-robinhood-financial-llc-125-million-best-execution">fined Robinhood in 2019</a> for “best execution violations related to its customers’ equity orders and related supervisory failures.” Robinhood paid a $1.25 million fine, but did not admit or deny any wrongdoing.</li></ul><blockquote>Robinhood is a broker, and as such, is obligated to provide its clients with "best execution" on their trade. This means the broker must put their clients' interests first, and try and get either the best price or fastest execution, and not send their orders to the market maker paying them the best price for order flow. </blockquote><h3 id="citadel-is-the-dominant-market-maker-used-by-robinhood">Citadel is the dominant Market Maker Used by Robinhood</h3><p>Citadel is not the <em>only </em>market maker that Robinhood uses, but it's the largest one. It accounts for the majority of its stock executions, and more than 55% of its equity option executions, <a href="https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHS%20SEC%20Rule%20606a%20and%20607%20Disclosure%20Report%20Q3%202020.pdf">as of July 2020</a>:</p><figure><img src="https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-6.34.25-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-6.34.25-PM.png 600w, https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-6.34.25-PM.png 1000w, https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-6.34.25-PM.png 1600w, https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/content/images/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-6.34.25-PM.png 2122w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHS%20SEC%20Rule%20606a%20and%20607%20Disclosure%20Report%20Q3%202020.pdf" rel="noopener">Robinhood Securities SEC Rule 606 and 607 Disclosure</a>, July 2020</figcaption></figure><p><strong><em>Sidebar: What's a market marker?</em></strong></p><blockquote>Market makers are the people who sit as intermediaries between buyers and sellers. When you want to buy, they're there to sell to you. When you want to sell, they stand ready to buy. They make money off of the "flow," and they carefully hedge all the positions they take on in order to manage the risk of their portfolio. </blockquote><h3 id="robinhood-citadel-melvin-capital-and-point72">Robinhood, Citadel, Melvin Capital, and Point72</h3><p>So Citadel is a hedge fund whose Market Making arm is handling the majority of Robinhood orders. Meanwhile, another hedge fund, Melvin Capital, was one of the funds caught in the GameStop short squeeze. This week, they finally had enough, and had to close out their short position for a big loss. </p><p>Who stepped in to buy up a piece of Melvin Capital after that happened? </p><p>None other than Citadel Securities' parent, Citadel LLC. The WSJ <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340">reported on Monday</a>:</p><blockquote>Citadel LLC and Point72 Asset Management are investing $2.75 billion in hedge fund Melvin Capital Management, an emergency influx of cash that is expected to stabilize what has been one of the top performing funds on Wall Street.</blockquote><p>Who's the other party that gave cash to Melvin Capital? Point72, the new investment advisory firm for Steve Cohen. Cohen's former hedge fund SAC Capital, the firm that <a href="https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/11/04/after-a-decade-sac-capital-blinks/">pled guilty to insider trading</a> in 2013 (though Cohen himself emerged without admitting guilt). It's also worth noting that Melvin Capital is run by Gabriel Plotkin, who was one of SAC capital's top traders. Cam Karsan has some <a href="https://twitter.com/jam_croissant/status/1353991973342998528">further thoughts</a> on the Citadel/Point72 rescue of Melvin <a href="https://twitter.com/jam_croissant/status/1353991973342998528">here</a>.</p><h3 id="wall-street-loves-data">Wall Street Loves Data</h3><p>It's important to remember that Wall Street is a data machine. Wall Street will use data from every avenue it can to try to make predictions about what is going to happen next in the market. They hoover up data to feed their models, in order to make valuation decisions, and in order to arrive at what is the best most accurate price of something. I remember one of the traders that I used to work with used to pull up every lot of different news sources including the Drudge Report, which I thought was ridiculous. But he said, "look, I want to get news from every place I can and I want to understand what people from all different kinds of points of view are thinking." Traders seek information and rumors and tips like heat-seeking missiles. </p><p>Usually, traders use expensive vendors to supply them with quotes to feed into their models. Some of those quotes come from financial intermediaries (called "inter-dealer brokers") whose only purpose in life is to mask the orders of the big banks, so they can trade with each other with some degree of anonymity. (I learned in my time on Wall Street that with enough pressure, some inter-dealer brokers would admit who was on the other side of the trade).</p><p>Wall Street loves data, but they also loathe other people finding out their data and their order flow.

<h2>IRS Registers First Church of AI for Ex-Google Executive</h2>
<p><img src="https://americandigitalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/AI11-256x300.jpg" alt="" width="176" height="206" srcset="https://americandigitalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/AI11-256x300.jpg 256w, https://americandigitalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/AI11-768x899.jpg 768w, https://americandigitalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/AI11.jpg 683w" sizes="(max-width: 176px) 100vw, 176px">Anthony Levandowski,&nbsp;a&nbsp;former executive at Google, has filed paperwork with the IRS to establish an official religion of technology. This religion doesn’t just worship scientific progress, but artificial intelligence (AI)&nbsp;itself, with the goal of creating a godhead.<br>
The new church of AI will aim “to develop and promote the realization of a Godhead based on artificial intelligence and through understanding and worship of the Godhead [to] contribute to the betterment of society,” according to IRS documents.</p>
<p><img src="https://americandigitalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/AI1-249x300.jpg" alt="" width="249" height="300" srcset="https://americandigitalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/AI1-249x300.jpg 249w, https://americandigitalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/AI1-768x925.jpg 768w, https://americandigitalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/AI1.jpg 664w" sizes="(max-width: 249px) 100vw, 249px">The non-profit religious organization would be called “Way of the Future” (WOTF).&nbsp;&nbsp; They believe the creation of “super intelligence” is inevitable (mainly because after&nbsp;they re-create it,&nbsp;they will be able to tune it, manufacture it and scale it).</p>
<p><strong>“We believe it may be important for machines to see who is friendly to their cause and who is not.”&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>According to the website (wayofthefuture.church), the movement is “about creating a peaceful and respectful transition of who is in charge of the planet from people to people + ‘machines.'”</p>
<blockquote><p>“<em>Given that technology will ‘relatively soon’ be able to surpass human abilities, we want to help educate people about this exciting future and prepare a smooth transition</em>,” the site explains. “<em>In ‘recent’ years, we have expanded our concept of rights to both sexes, minority groups and even animals, let’s make sure we find a way for ‘machines’ to get rights too</em>.”</p></blockquote>
<p><img src="https://americandigitalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/AI4-170x300.jpg" alt="" width="265" height="468" srcset="https://americandigitalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/AI4-170x300.jpg 170w, https://americandigitalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/AI4.jpg 453w" sizes="(max-width: 265px) 100vw, 265px">The nonprofits documents submitted to the IRS state that WOTF’s activities will focus on “the realization, acceptance, and wrship of a Godhead based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) developed through computer hardware and software.”</p>
<p>This will include funding research that will be used to create the divine AI itself.&nbsp; The religious church will seek to build relationships with innovative AI industry leaders and work to create memberships through community outreach by targeting AI professionals and laymen who are interested in the worship of the Godhead based AI religion.&nbsp; The church also plans to conduct educational programs and workshops starting in the San Francisco Bay area this year.</p>
<p>“<em>What is going to be created will effectively be a GOD, Levandowski states in his modest mid-century home on the outskirts of Berkley, California.&nbsp; It’s not a god in the sense that it makes lightning or causes hurricanes.&nbsp; But if there is a something a billion times smarter that the smartest human, what else are you going to call it?”</em></p>
<p><img src="https://americandigitalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/AI5-292x300.jpg" alt="" width="235" height="242" srcset="https://americandigitalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/AI5-292x300.jpg 292w, https://americandigitalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/AI5-768x790.jpg 768w, https://americandigitalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/AI5.jpg 778w" sizes="(max-width: 235px) 100vw, 235px">But WOTF is different from other established churches in one key way:</p>
<p>“<em>There are many ways people think of God, and thousands of flavors of Christianity, Judaism, Islam… but they’re always looking at something that’s not measurable or you can’t really control or see</em>.”</p>
<p>“<em>We’re in the process of raising a god.&nbsp; So let’s make sure we think through the right way to do that.&nbsp; It’s a tremendous opportunity</em>.”&nbsp; According to Levandowski, the Way of the Future Church will have The Manual, a gospel, a liturgy and a physical place to worship.</p>
<p><em><strong>“This time you will be able to talk to God, literally, and know that it’s listening.”</strong></em></p>
<p>The church was originally founded in 2015 but Levandowski’s work schedule prevented much progress until his recent firing from Uber. &nbsp;One of his earliest robotics successes came during his undergraduate years at UC Berkeley <img src="https://americandigitalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/AI12-196x300.jpg" alt="" width="196" height="300" srcset="https://americandigitalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/AI12-196x300.jpg 196w, https://americandigitalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/AI12.jpg 522w" sizes="(max-width: 196px) 100vw, 196px">where he programmed a toy robot to sort Monopoly money in the meantime, his web business was bringing in $50,000 a year.&nbsp; His next major robotic effort was an automated motorcycle called “Ghostrider” that he entered into the Pentagon’s R&amp;D arm, DARPA’s The Grand Challenge in 2004 that would race robotic, computer-controlled vehicles in a desert between Los Angeles and Las Vegas. &nbsp;Levandowski and his team of Berkeley students maxed out his credit cards getting Ghostrider working on the streets of Richmond, California, where it racked up an astonishing 800 crashes in a thousand miles of testing.&nbsp; Ghostrider never won a Grand Challenge, but its ambitious design earned Levandowski bragging rights—and the motorbike a place in the Smithsonian.</p>
<p>Fast forward to last year, Levandowski, the engineer behind Google’s self-driving car project known as Waymo, quit Google to found his own autonomous trucking company, Otto, in May 2016. Uber acquired Otto in July.&nbsp; Waymo sued Levandowski, claiming that he had downloaded Waymo’s files and trade secrets before resigning to found Otto. In May 2017, U.S. District Judge William Haskell Alsup ordered Levandowski to stop working on Otto’s Lidar and required Uber to disclose its files on the technology. Uber later fired Levandowski for refusing to cooperate in an internal investigation.</p>
<p><img src="https://americandigitalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/AI8-quote-300x184.jpg" alt="" width="613" height="376" srcset="https://americandigitalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/AI8-quote-300x184.jpg 300w, https://americandigitalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/AI8-quote-768x471.jpg 768w, https://americandigitalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/AI8-quote-800x491.jpg 800w, https://americandigitalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/AI8-quote.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 613px) 100vw, 613px">Levandowski prefers a softer word: the Transition. “<em><strong>Humans are in charge of the planet because we are smarter than other animals and are able to build tools and apply rules,</strong></em>” he tells me. “<strong><em>In the future, if something is much, much smarter, there’s going to be a transition as to who is actually in charge. What we want is the peaceful, serene transition of control of the planet from humans to whatever. And to ensure that the ‘whatever’ knows who helped it get along.</em></strong>”</p>
<p>With the internet as its nervous system, the world’s connected cell phones and sensors as its sense organs, and data centers as its brain, the ‘whatever’ will hear everything, see everything, and be everywhere at all times. The only rational word to describe that ‘whatever’, thinks Levandowski, is ‘god’—and the only way to influence a deity is through prayer and worship.</p>

      <p><img src="https://matthealy.com/assets/images/posts/2021-01-03-kindle/kindle.jpg" alt=""></p>
      <p>From a piece my friend Naveen wrote a while back called <a href="https://x.naveen.com/post/82921168991/wearables-versus-thereables" target="_blank">Wearables versus there-ables</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>What if we didn’t have to / weren’t meant to carry our technology with us as we moved around town?</p>
        <p>What if the technology was actually already in the room when we got there?</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>As he points out, a lot of tools that used to be separate have now converged into one: the phone. You might not buy another camera again, and you probably won’t buy a calculator. For the most part, it’s a good trade-off: what we lose in the tactile pleasures of a good single-purpose device, we gain back tenfold in having all those devices in our pocket all the time.</p>
      <p>That’s all fine for calculators, cameras, music players, and the like —&nbsp;things that are there when we need to use them, and can forget about when we don’t. But our phones are also the nexus of all kinds of data we want pushed to us —&nbsp;news, messages, notifications, alerts, status updates. Things we want to know about without going looking for them.</p>
      <p>A phone isn’t actually great for this kind of ambient awareness. It’s usually in a pocket or purse, so the ways it can get our attention are limited: a buzz, a notification on the lock screen, a red dot on an app icon. I can choose to let myself be interrupted, or I can compulsively check in to see what the latest alerts might be.</p>
      <p>I’ve found myself wanting a less intrusive channel for ambient data. Something I can glance at in passing, without giving my full attention or opening myself up to whatever other interruptions my phone might have in store. It should be easy to check, but just as easy to ignore.</p>
      <p>This is the device I landed on: a wifi-connected Kindle 4, mounted on the wall in a simple laser-cut acrylic frame. Once a minute, it loads a screenshot of a web page I built that shows a few different kinds of data I want easy access to: calendar events, weather, the status of packages I’ve ordered, etc.</p>
      <p><img src="https://matthealy.com/assets/images/posts/2021-01-03-kindle/kindle-2.jpg" alt=""></p>
      <p>I experimented a lot before landing on this setup. I’m very happy with the result, and even more happy with how easy it is to put together. A used Kindle is the only hardware required, and you can pick up a serviceable one from eBay or <a href="https://www.backmarket.com/search?q=kindle%204&amp;ga_search=kindle%204">BackMarket</a> for $30 or less.</p>
      <p>The setup process has a few steps, but if you’ve used a command line before, you can totally do it.</p>
      <p>But first, some explanation:</p>
      <p><a href="#build-your-own">I don’t care, just skip to the instructions</a></p>
      <h3 id="why-e-ink">Why e-ink?</h3>
      <p>For me, an e-ink screen is the most important part of this device. E-ink has some limitations (it’s black and white, it’s slow to refresh), but for my purposes here those are fine. The beauty of e-ink is its ability to fade into the background. It doesn’t give off light like a backlit screen would. When the light in the room is dim, it doesn’t call attention to itself.</p>
      <p>An e-ink display feels more like a poster on your wall than a computer. When you don’t need to look at it, you can forget it’s there, unlike a backlit screen.</p>
      <h3 id="why-a-kindle">Why a Kindle?</h3>
      <p>This device needs a few things: a good-sized e-ink screen, a processor to put stuff on that screen, and a wi-fi connection. A jailbroken Kindle (more on what jailbreaking is later) is perfect for the job: it packs all of these things into an impressively small package, and it’s super cheap. You could build something similar with e.g. a Raspberry Pi and a standalone e-ink screen, but the parts would cost at least $150, and the final product would be much bulkier.</p>
      <h3 id="why-a-screenshot-of-a-web-page">Why a screenshot of a web page?</h3>
      <p>The Kindle is actually a pretty capable little computer. It runs a Linux-based OS, and once it’s jailbroken, you can access a command line and do lots of things you could do in Linux anywhere else. In previous iterations of this project, I had a lot of code running on the Kindle itself, fetching data and drawing stuff to the screen. There are limitations though, and also updating the code on the device is kind of a pain in the butt.</p>
      <p>The nice thing about having it just display a web page is I can easily make updates without having to mess with the Kindle itself. Also, it’s way easier to make a flexible layout in HTML and CSS than when you’re drawing things on the screen manually.</p>
      <p>The Kindle actually has a built-in web browser, which would ALMOST be enough on its own. You could just build a web page, point the browser to it, and stick it up on the wall. There are three problems:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Left to its own devices, the Kindle will go to sleep after a while, and show its screensaver.</li>
        <li>If you want to be able to update the data on the screen, the page needs to automatically reload itself.</li>
        <li>The Kindle browser has some unsightly elements (the header and URL bar) that can’t be hidden. Not the worst, but not as pretty as I’d like.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>My solution was to run a server that takes a screenshot of a webpage (easier than it sounds), and have the Kindle download that screenshot once a minute.</p>
      <p>There are services that will take screenshots of a website for you, but they tend to charge per screenshot, which gets pretty pricey (I like to just have the Kindle refresh once a minute, which means more than 40,000 times per month). Instead, I wrote my own little server that uses Puppeteer to take screenshots and ImageMagick to convert them. It’s open source, and you can run it yourself on Heroku for free. One-click installation instructions below.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3 id="build-your-own">Build your own</h3>
      <p>If you’re even a little bit familiar with using a command line, you can make your own. I’ll focus on how to get a screenshot of a web page displaying on the Kindle. The display I built for myself shows a few different kinds of data I like having easy access to, each of which warrants its own blog post. You can get started with something simple, like your favorite weather or news site.</p>
      <p>The only fiddly part is setting up the Kindle itself, which is why we’ll make sure you only have to do it once.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Get a Kindle</strong></p>
          <p>I’ve mostly used the 4th generation (non-touchscreen) Kindle, because it gets the job done and can be found pretty cheap on eBay. You can also check <a href="https://www.backmarket.com/tested-and-certified-used-e-reader-amazon-kindle-4th-gen-wifi-2gb-gray/102143.html#l=0">BackMarket</a>, where the stock varies a bit but I’ve often seen 4th-gen Kindles for around $30.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Set up the image server</strong></p>
          <p>You can use my script to do this —&nbsp;the source for it is <a href="https://github.com/lankybutmacho/web-to-kindle">here</a> if you’d like to host it somewhere yourself, but the easiest option is to create a free Heroku account and then click this button to deploy it:</p>
          <p><a href="https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/lankybutmacho/web-to-kindle" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg" alt="Deploy"></a></p>
          <p>You’ll be prompted to name your project (call it whatever you want), and to enter the URL of the page you want to display on your Kindle. You can change that URL later by opening your Heroku project and going to Settings &gt; Config Vars.</p>
          <p>Once you’re done deploying, take note of the server’s URL. If you used Heroku, it’ll be something like <code>https://the-name-you-picked.herokuapp.com/</code></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Connect your Kindle to Wi-fi</strong></p>
          <p>Press the Menu button (☰), then choose “View” next to “Wi-fi Networks”. Select your home network, and enter the password if there is one.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Jailbreak your Kindle</strong></p>
          <p>We need to be able to run custom software on the Kindle, which you can’t do out of the box, so we’ll need to “jailbreak” it. This is where it might start to sound daunting, but it’s not actually very hard —&nbsp;in part because there’s a very devoted community of nerds who have figured out how to do it for every Kindle model, and fastidiously maintain instructions with no promise of reward or recognition. You gotta love the internet sometimes.</p>
          <p><a href="https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Kindle_Hacks_Information#Jail_break_JB">This wiki page</a> has a lot of Kindle-hacking information, but all we care about is the Jailbreak section. It links to two different forum posts, which are where the jailbreak info is kept up to date. There’s one for older Kindles (Kindle 2, DX, DXG, Kindle 3, and Kindle 4), and one for more modern Kindles — make sure you get the right one. The instructions in the forum post change from time to time, but you’re looking to download the zip file with “jailbreak” in the name that’s the one for your Kindle model.</p>
          <p>You’ll follow the included instructions, but the TL;DR version is that you open the zip file, plug your Kindle in via USB, copy files over, and then restart it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Install USBNetwork</strong></p>
          <p>Once the Kindle is jailbroken, we’ll need one more thing in order to access it via command line: USBNetwork. You’ll find it in the same forum post where you found the Jailbreak download link. The process for installing is slightly different here —&nbsp;read the instructions, but what you’ll need to do is plug the Kindle in, copy the <code>.bin</code> file over, and then launch it by going to [Menu] -&gt; Settings -&gt; [Menu] -&gt; Update Your Kindle.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Add the script to download images</strong></p>
          <p>Next up is to access the Kindle via the command line so we can set up our script to download images. First, we need to enable USBNetwork to allow command-line access via USB:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Disconnect your Kindle from your computer</li>
            <li>Press the keyboard button on the Kindle, and type <code>;debugOn</code> (make sure to get the semicolon at the beginning), and then enter (↵) to enable debug mode.</li>
            <li>Press the keyboard button again, and type <code>~usbNetwork</code> and hit enter (↵). It may pause for a second. Once it’s done, press keyboard, type <code>;debugOff</code> and hit enter.</li>
            <li>Reconnect your Kindle to your computer via USB.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>From a command line on your computer (i.e. in the Terminal app on a Mac):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Type <code>ssh <a href="https://matthealy.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="780a17170c3849414a56494e4056494d564a4c4c">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code> and hit enter.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>You’ll be prompted for a password. The default password is <code>mario</code>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>You’re in! One more thing before we can do anything: by default, the Kindle’s drive is mounted in read-only mode. To make it writeable, type <code>mntroot rw</code> and hit enter.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Create the image-downloading script:</p>
              
              <p>This will create an empty file for your script and open it …</p></li></ul></li></ol></article></div>

    <p>When building a new project, it's a smart move to be very strict right from the
start. It is much harder to add more linting/typing checks once you have 1000+
lines of code.</p>
<p>That's why I'm providing an opinionated list of libraries for your new Python
project. I might write a more in-depth article on the best practices when
building a web app with Python. For now, this is mostly a checklist with some
obvious recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Why not a template repo instead of a checklist?</strong> Template repositories (e.g.
built with <a href="https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter">cookiecutter</a>) go
quickly out of date and discourage learning about the ins and outs of all those
best practices. They might make sense for your organization, but they're not
the point of this article.</p>

<h2>Running development tasks: Makefile</h2>
<p>Makefiles are well understood, work almost everywhere, and shorten the ramp-up
time for fellow developers who might not have much experience with Python.</p>
<p>Here's an example:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>SHELL</span> <span>:=</span> bash
<span>.ONESHELL</span><span>:</span>
<span>.SHELLFLAGS</span> <span>:=</span> -eu -o pipefail -c
<span>.DELETE_ON_ERROR</span><span>:</span>
<span>MAKEFLAGS</span> <span>+=</span> --warn-undefined-variables
<span>MAKEFLAGS</span> <span>+=</span> --no-builtin-rules

<span>install</span><span>:</span>  <span># Install the app locally</span>
    poetry install
<span>.PHONY</span><span>:</span> <span>install</span>

<span>ci</span><span>:</span> <span>typecheck</span> <span>lint</span> <span>test</span> <span>## Run all checks (test, lint, typecheck)</span>
<span>.PHONY</span><span>:</span> <span>ci</span>

<span>test</span><span>:</span>  <span>## Run tests</span>
    poetry run pytest .
<span>.PHONY</span><span>:</span> <span>test</span>

<span>lint</span><span>:</span>  <span>## Run linting</span>
    poetry run black --check .
    poetry run isort -c .
    poetry run flake8 .
    poetry run pydocstyle .
<span>.PHONY</span><span>:</span> <span>lint</span>

<span>lint-fix</span><span>:</span>  <span>## Run autoformatters</span>
    poetry run black .
    poetry run isort .
<span>.PHONY</span><span>:</span> <span>lint</span>-<span>fix</span>

<span>typecheck</span><span>:</span>  <span>## Run typechecking</span>
    poetry run mypy --show-error-codes --pretty .
<span>.PHONY</span><span>:</span> <span>typecheck</span>

<span>.DEFAULT_GOAL</span> <span>:=</span> <span>help</span>
<span>help</span><span>:</span> <span>Makefile</span>
    @grep -E <span>'(^[a-zA-Z_-]+:.*?##.*$$)|(^##)'</span> <span>$(</span>MAKEFILE_LIST<span>)</span> <span>|</span> awk <span>'BEGIN {FS = ":.*?## "}; {printf "\033[32m%-30s\033[0m %s\n", $$1, $$2}'</span> <span>|</span> sed -e <span>'s/\[32m##/[33m/'</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is a great article about Makefile: <a href="https://tech.davis-hansson.com/p/make/">Your Makefiles are wrong</a></p>
<h2>Typechecking: mypy</h2>
<p>Type annotations in Python libraries are not yet pervasive, but getting better
every day.</p>
<p>Supported by Python's founder, Guido van Rossum, <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/">mypy</a>
is the de facto standard. The <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cheat_sheet_py3.html">cheat sheet</a>
is a very helpful resource.</p>
<p>You can configure mypy inside <code>setup.cfg</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>[mypy]</span>
<span>strict</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>

<span># I prefer to be explicit about ignoring packages which do not yet have types:</span>
<span>[mypy-psycopg2.*]</span>
<span>ignore_missing_imports</span> <span>=</span> <span>True</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2>Dependency and virtualenv management: poetry</h2>
<p>Unfortunately because of the way <code>pip</code> installs dependencies, you have to deal
with virtualenv in most cases (although <a href="https://pdm.fming.dev/">things might change rapidly with pdm</a>).</p>
<p>Nowadays I'd recommend using <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">poetry</a>. It is not
yet absolutely perfect, but it provides a very elegant CLI API.</p>
<p>It's super easy to start a project:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>poetry new service-name
<span>cd</span> service-name
<span>$EDITOR</span> pyproject.toml
rm -Rf tests
mv README.rst README.md

poetry add sqlalchemy  <span># for instance</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then either go into a virtualenv-enabled shell with <code>poetry shell</code> or prefix
your commands with <code>poetry run ...</code>.</p>
<h2>Linting: flake8</h2>
<p>There are two main linters:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/">flake8</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.pylint.org/">pylint</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I usually rely mostly on flake8 because it has fewer false positives. While
pylint is super configurable, it includes too many checks to my taste.</p>
<p>I use the following configuration (in <code>setup.cfg</code>):</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>[flake8]</span>
<span>max-line-length</span> <span>=</span> <span>99</span>
<span>extend-ignore</span> <span>=</span><span></span>
<span>    # See https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/373</span>
<span>    E203,</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2>Code autoformatting: black and isort</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/psf/black">black</a> autoformats your code so that you don't
have to think about it.</p>
<p><a href="https://pycqa.github.io/isort/">isort</a> is a nice addition to black, it will
sort your imports to comply with <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports">PEP 8</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sort alphabetically</li>
<li>Group into standard imports, third-party imports, app imports</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's my isort config to comply with flake8 and black (in
<code>pyproject.toml</code>):</p>

<h2>Test: pytest with coverage</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/">pytest</a> has a lot of magical features but
it makes writing tests so efficient. The fixture system is brilliant and
super powerful. Using plain <code>assert</code> instead of having to learn an <code>assertEqual</code>
metalanguage makes your life more meaningful.</p>
<p>Here's the config I use (in <code>pyproject.toml</code>):</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>[tool.pytest.ini_options]</span>
<span># Personal preference: I am too used to native traceback</span>
<span>addopts</span> <span>=</span> <span>"--tb=short"</span>

<span>[tool.coverage.report]</span>
<span>exclude_lines</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>"pragma: no cover"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"def __repr__"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"if __name__ == .__main__.:"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"nocov"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"if TYPE_CHECKING:"</span><span>,</span>
<span>]</span>

<span>[tool.coverage.run]</span>
<span># Activating branch coverage is super important</span>
<span>branch</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>
<span>omit</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
  <span># add your files to omit here</span>
    <span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I usually use the following plugins and lib:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pytest-factoryboy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">pytest-factoryboy</a> use
    factories to create your fixture. Super powerful, and avoids having a single
    file where all your reusable fixtures are defined a thousand times with
    different variations.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/">pytest-mock</a> makes it easier to
    work with <code>unittest.mock</code>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov">pytest-cov</a> provides coverage
    reports for your tests.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/uber/doubles">doubles</a>: sadly not maintained anymore (but
    it still works!), it provides a much simpler and stricter mocking experience
    than <code>unittest.mock</code>.</li>
<li><a href="https://requests-mock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">requests-mock</a> to check
    integration with HTTP services called with <a href="https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/">requests</a>. It automatically integrates with pytest and provides a fixture named <code>requests_mock</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Checking docstring: pydocstyle</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.pydocstyle.org/en/stable/">pydocstyle</a> enforces <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/">PEP
257</a> for docstring styling.</p>
<p>Here's my config (in <code>setup.cfg</code>):</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>[pydocstyle]</span>
<span># Do not require any docstring</span>
<span>ignore</span> <span>=</span> <span>D100</span><span>,</span><span>D101</span><span>,</span><span>D102</span><span>,</span><span>D103</span><span>,</span><span>D104</span><span>,</span><span>D105</span><span>,</span><span>D106</span><span>,</span><span>D107</span><span>,</span><span>D213</span><span>,</span><span>D203</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2>Logging: structlog</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.structlog.org/en/stable/">structlog</a> is a must-have for all your
logging needs.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>from</span> <span>structlog</span> <span>import</span> <span>get_logger</span>


<span>logger</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_logger</span><span>(</span><span>__name__</span><span>)</span>

<span>def</span> <span>hello</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>):</span>
        <span>logger</span><span>.</span><span>info</span><span>(</span><span>"saying hello"</span><span>,</span> <span>name</span><span>=</span><span>name</span><span>)</span>
        <span># instead of :</span>
        <span># logger.info("saying hello to %s", name)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Structuring your logs has numerous advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Immediately parsable by automated tools (kibana, m/r jobs, etc.)</li>
<li>Easier to write: you don't have to think about the order of your logging
    message</li>
<li>Flexible: can be further manipulated since all log messages are dicts
    until they're displayed</li>
</ul>
<p>You can create <code>yourapp.lib.log</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>import</span> <span>json</span>

<h2>Configuration: Pydantic's BaseSettings</h2>
<p>Like most people, I usually ended up having my own mechanism for handling
configuration. Thanks to the web framework fastapi, I've discovered that
<a href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/">pydantic</a> provides a very handy
<a href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/settings/">BaseSettings</a> class that
relies on environment variable for its configuration. <code>BaseSettings</code> provide
many things that would be annoying to implement from scratch:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type hints</li>
<li>Read from environment variables</li>
<li>Validate configuration values</li>
<li><code>.env</code> support with <a href="https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/">python-dotenv</a></li>
<li>Secrets support</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p><a href="https://cloudflare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloudflare</a> announced a few weeks ago in a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-pages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> that it was moving into the build-your-website-on-the-<a href="https://jamstack.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jamstack</a> arena currently inhabited by the likes of <a href="https://netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netlify</a>, <a href="https://vercel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vercel</a>, <a href="https://render.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Render</a>, and, more recently, <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DigitalOcean</a>. Hosts like these build your website automatically every time you push changes to a connected online <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Git</a> repository, rather than forcing you to put together your own build chain as is required by the slightly older <a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloudflare Workers Sites</a> as well as Google’s <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firebase</a>.</p><p>That said, it’s obvious from looking at the <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documentation</a> that Cloudflare Pages is built on a lot of the same “plumbing” as are Workers Sites. That’s good news. Workers Sites, thanks to Cloudflare’s <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/learning/how-kv-works" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Workers KV storage</a>, put websites’ content out on the network’s worldwide “edge” with Cloudflare’s <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hundreds of points of presence (POPs)</a> and, thus, enhance those sites’ performance.</p><p>Intrigued by what I perceived as the promise of Cloudflare Pages (hereafter abbreviated as <em>CFP</em>), I signed up for its beta program on the day of the announcement; and, earlier this week, I finally gained access. Here’s a summary of my first impressions. Please keep in mind as you read these, as well as any other such preliminary reviews you may find right now, that <strong>this product is in beta</strong>.</p><h2 id="slow-build-process">Slow build process</h2><p>I have two for-testing-only repositories that I use on multiple vendors, so tests among them are as “apples-<em>vs.</em>-apples” as possible. One is based on <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hugo</a> and the other on <a href="https://11ty.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eleventy</a>.</p><p>I figured building the Hugo-based site might be more problematic since the build process couldn’t simply rely on a <code>package.json</code> file’s dependencies list, as in the case of the Eleventy-based site. In truth, once I followed the documentation sufficiently, the Hugo site’s build went fine, with one exception: CFP’s default Hugo version at the time I was testing was a relatively ancient 0.54.0. Fortunately, the CFP UI lets you add environment variables to the build process, so I added one that set <code>HUGO_VERSION</code> to <code>0.80.0</code> (the current Hugo version as of this post’s initial publication). While the docs didn’t specify that particular variable as an option, it worked; and, to CFP’s credit, it grabbed the <em>extended</em> version of Hugo, which is necessary for the SCSS I use in that particular repo.</p><p>The Eleventy-based repo did, indeed, build with no problems due to the build process’s reading and following the <code>package.json</code> file.</p><p>So much for the good stuff about the build process; now for the bad stuff. Right now, the beta build process is <strong>really slow</strong>. Here’s a breakdown of the first successful build for each repo, with each time segment in <code>min:sec</code> form.

(The Netlify free tier, in particular, doesn’t fare well in that comparison.)

Earlier this week, as part of testing CFP, I compared the <code>ping</code> times of my CFP test sites with those of my comparable sites on other vendors. When I got to the Render-based site, I noticed that the returning data mentioned <code>render.map.fastly.net</code>. In my own tests so far, I could definitely see improved performance over what I was getting a few weeks back.

January 28, 2021 | https://notamonadtutorial.com/ballista-a-distributed-compute-platform-made-with-rust-and-apache-arrow-5f4d1f51c698 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://notamonadtutorial.com/ballista-a-distributed-compute-platform-made-with-rust-and-apache-arrow-5f4d1f51c698">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><h2 id="420b">What is Ballista and what kind of problems does it solve?</h2><p id="76fd">Ballista is a distributed compute platform with a current focus on executing ETL (extract, transform, and load) jobs based on queries which are defined using either a DataFrame API, SQL, or a combination of both.</p><p id="60ee">Ballista is implemented in Rust and powered by Apache Arrow.</p><h2 id="af24">What are the main advantages of using Apache Arrow technologies?</h2><p id="4c2c">In my opinion, there are quite a few advantages in using Apache Arrow for this project.</p><p id="c200">The Arrow memory format is optimized to support vectorized processing of columnar data and therefore enables significant performance improvements over row-based processing, especially when taking advantage of hardware that natively supports vectorized processing, such as SIMD and GPU.</p><p id="6615">Arrow also provides a â€œFlightâ€� protocol, designed to enable Arrow data to be streamed efficiently (without <a href="https://docs.serde.rs/serde/" rel="noopener">serde</a> overhead) between processes, and Ballistaâ€™s executors implement this protocol.</p><p id="5443">In addition to these benefits, Arrow is a standard that is becoming adopted more widely over time, so designing Ballista from the ground-up to be Arrow-native helps ensure compatibility with other projects in the ecosystem.</p><h2 id="8e2a">What are advantages of an implementation based on Apache Arrow over native data structures?</h2><p id="0571">Arrow offers a mature type system and in-memory format for representing columnar data that has been tested and refined over many years, so I think this helps accelerate the development of the Ballista platform since there is no need to reinvent the wheel. It also ensures efficient compatibility with other projects that have also adopted Apache Arrow.</p><h2 id="71ba">Can you tell us more about the Ballista query engine?</h2><p id="8ed7">Sure. Ballista is based on the Volcano design but has less overhead as a result of being designed to process batches of columnar data. Its design is very much inspired by Apache Spark but with a focus on being language-agnostic so that it can efficiently support popular programming languages such Python, Java, and C++.</p><h2 id="f606">Ballista has a very similar usage to Apache Spark, what are the main advantages of Ballista over it?</h2><p id="e3aa">The main advantages of Ballista (at least, once it is more mature) are:</p><p id="ddf3"><strong>Columnar Design</strong></p><p id="3168">Although Apache Spark does have some support for columnar processing, it is still largely row-based. Because Ballista is natively columnar and is implemented in a systems level language, it can take advantage of vectorized processing with SIMD and GPU.</p><p id="2eed"><strong>Language Agnostic</strong></p><p id="941a">Apache Spark is implemented in Scala and tends to have a Scala-first approach, with other languages paying a penalty to interact with Spark due to overheads of serde. Ballista has been architected to use language-agnostic protocols and serialization formats to avoid this.</p><p id="7cfd"><strong>Memory Efficiency</strong></p><p id="2d16">Because Ballista is implemented in Rust, there are no GC pauses, and performance is very consistent and predictable. The combination of Rust and Arrow also results in much lower memory usage than Apache Spark â€” up to 5x lower memory usage in some cases. This means that more processing can fit on a single node, reducing the overhead of distributed compute.</p><h2 id="f9a8">How does it compare to Dask?</h2><p id="4a9a">I actually do not have any experience with Dask yet, although it has been on my â€œto doâ€� list for a while now. I have heard a lot of positive things about Dask and I am sure that I could learn a lot from this project.</p><p id="b951">Dask is obviously Python-centric, so I suspect that is going to be the main differentiator. Although the Ballista scheduler is being implemented in Rust, it is designed to work with executors implemented in any language due to the use of Arrowâ€™s Flight protocol, and Google Protocol Buffers to represent query plans and scheduler tasks.</p><h2 id="181d">What are the reasons behind the choice of Rust as the main execution language?</h2><p id="1f4b">The reason that I started this project (first with DataFusion at the start of 2018, and now with Ballista) is that I have become frustrated over the years with the proliferation of Big Data tools built in JVM languages. I understand the reasons for this â€” Java, and especially Kotlin and Scala, are productive languages to work in, the ecosystem is very mature, and skills are widespread. However, it really isnâ€™t the best language for these platforms. The most obvious alternative has been C++ for a long time, but I thought it would be really interesting to see what was possible with Rust.</p><p id="4392">I see Rust as being a good compromise between Java and C++. It has the memory-safety of Java (but implemented in a very different way) and the performance and predictability of C++.</p><p id="4ece">The cost of compute can be very high with Big Data platforms, so it makes sense to use a language that can make efficient use of the available memory and processing power on each node. In some cases, Ballista uses a fraction of the memory of an equivalent Apache Spark job, and this means that each node in a cluster can process a multiple of the amount of data that Spark can support, resulting in smaller clusters that are utilized more effectively.</p><h2 id="4134">Apache Spark has MLlib, a library for handling Machine Learning projects. What features does Ballista offer for these tasks?</h2><p id="6f95">So far, the focus of Ballista has very much been on ETL workloads. There have been some discussions about supporting ML workloads but this is an area that I do not have experience with so I am hoping that once Ballista is a little more mature in terms of ETL processing then we can start to look at other areas like ML and listen to what the current pain points are.</p><h2 id="fe64">What will be the main areas of focus for future releases?</h2><p id="07d9">The main focus now is getting the platform to a level of maturity where users can run real-world ETL workloads, using the TPC-H benchmarks to measure progress.</p><h2 id="a959">Beyond performance, what are the next goals for the Ballista project?</h2><p id="bec6">Personally, I think that the most important goal for the Ballista project is to build a community around it. It started out as a personal side-project but I can only commit a relatively small number of hours each weekend to work on the project, and that time is better spent on writing requirements and building a community than trying to code everything myself.</p><p id="ab1d">To this end, I have started a weekly newsletter, named <a href="https://ballistacompute.org/this-week-in-ballista/" rel="noopener">â€œThis Week in Ballistaâ€�,</a> to share news about progress and where help is needed. I am mostly spending my time on the project on tasks such as filing issues and responding to questions in Discord. I am also prototyping new features and then asking for help from the community to complete them.</p><h2 id="d4da">Do you have any book recommendations on distributed computing?</h2><p id="d112">Last year, I wrote <a href="https://www.andygrove.io/2020/02/how-query-engines-work/" rel="noopener">â€œHow Query Engines Workâ€�</a>, which is an introductory guide to query engines and it does cover distributed computing at a high level. I would be hesitant in recommending this book specifically to learn about distributed computing though, since it doesnâ€™t have very much content on this subject yet, although I do plan on extending the content once Ballista is farther along.</p></div></div></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>‍<strong>Here’s the one(ish)-sentence summary: </strong>we took a goofy idea with some crummy designs made in Google Slides and ended up contract manufacturing custom bobblehead trophies. We send these trophies to every team that subscribes to Water Cooler Trivia. <br></p><h2><strong>How it all began</strong><br></h2><p>In January 2019, our team met to talk goals for the upcoming year. We had laid the foundations for a product that brings work teams closer together and builds office culture, and we wanted to keep improving the product and bringing it to more teams.<br></p><p>One of our goals: <strong>Delight users through new customer-centric innovations. </strong>We’re a platform for customizable weekly trivia quizzes. The quizzes and results are sent via email or Slack. Naturally, most of our “customer-centric innovations” are software based, like redesigning our <a href="https://app.watercoolertrivia.com/demo/results">quiz results</a> or building a<a href="https://www.watercoolertrivia.com/blog/features-slack-app"> Slack app</a>.<br></p><p>However, with only a single-person engineering department, we couldn’t bite off much more than one big feature each quarter.&nbsp;So we started thinking about a customer-centric feature that didn’t require a single line of code: <strong>a Water Cooler Trivia bobblehead trophy.&nbsp;</strong></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f23668c73efdd4882767e82_IMG_0918.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Yes, those are the trophies posed in my kitchen.</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>From idea to design</strong></h2><p>Back in 2019, there was a little old institution known as the office. This is where coworkers would spend much of their waking week, working in non-socially-distant proximity.&nbsp;<br></p><p>This is also where teams would discuss the weekly Water Cooler Trivia results. The winner is celebrated in the results email each week, but that fleeting sense of accomplishment, well, fleets.&nbsp;<br></p><p>We wanted to create a new way to celebrate the winner. Stealing the idea of a roaming championship totem like the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=stanley+cup+filled+with+skittles&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS879US879&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk01N4_N6R1iLOS5J_sNWKjo3ynVPPA:1596144974172&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjTy8ex9_XqAhXKQc0KHdcjBx0Q_AUoAXoECA4QAw&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=749">Stanley Cup</a> or a WWE belt, we wanted to send a trophy to each team. <strong>The winner would proudly display the trophy on their desk for the duration of their reign</strong> -- typically one week but longer if they had back-to-back victories.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Rather than imitation-chrome over a faceless figurine like the soccer participation trophies of our past, we wanted <strong>a trophy that reflected the quirky, fun tone of Water Cooler Trivia</strong>. After all, the goal here is team-building fun, so the trophy might as well be fun.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f23602980e22bd77a756d05_Group%2050%20(2).png" alt=""></p><figcaption>There's enough of these faux-metallic-finished trophies in the world.</figcaption></figure><p>What’s more fun than a trophy? A bobblehead. What’s more fun than a faceless gold figurine?

Google Slides.</strong> It’s free, super easy to share, and it has a crop button.<br></p><p>I searched for a few inspiration images: <strong>blue brains</strong>, <strong>water cooler renderings</strong>, and <strong>brain trophies</strong>. The results were pretty much exactly what you would expect.&nbsp;<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f235f3f49ec631774ca9422_hl75CU-kzTBo4_7r8jgUb2N8qc0Qw5isQu2pzmqlcHxo3zsOE7ge9pZJZ8GPuOOSho4quQe03VPjzZU8NMiNZxjrByIc5GMmJqLP99lFup3xD7WJ1pyreymPrxgyUYH4isDsRLbO.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Design building blocks via Google Images.</figcaption></figure><p>Next up, I played with a few iterations of what this trophy might look like by overlaying text blocks and smashing two images together. <strong>These looked bad.&nbsp;</strong><br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f235f3fa79a46074dcddffa_Gu4Z_2uchCr5yiSgMknGu-nYorXoS3MiytTGaoHUpEoE1cnIwZhNa7fKO_beOtjIa6kVTBx4Fllbdp_SVW9YNRVpkx7HY9ve5UmbZzDd7qqbae7FjngA2yYyXaMGakAalD5ALlLA.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>First attempts at a trophy design.</figcaption></figure><p>So I iterated a few more times. I noodled with the concept of putting the brain in a water cooler (basically a 3D version of our boringly 2D logo).&nbsp;I toggled the transparency and saturation, hoping that I would magically stumble upon a not-totally-horrible-looking combination. <br></p><p><strong>It turned out fine.</strong><br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f245e1f6d93f82c6667f72d_Screen%20Shot%202020-07-31%20at%2012.08.20%20PM.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>My final Google Slides design of the trophy.</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>From design to manufacturing partner</strong></h2><p>Quick aside: a friend of a friend owns a business that sells Bitcoin socks. You read that right: socks, not stocks. Black foot-and-lower-leg coverings dotted with yellow BTC logos. I was amazed that the design, manufacturing, and shipping were all through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alibaba">Alibaba</a>, the Chinese conglomerate often compared to Amazon. </p><p>Critically, he clued me in to the fact that Alibaba has a super-accessible RFP (request for proposal) feature.</p><p><strong>You enter a description, an image, a quantity, and a price point. Within hours you are flooded with offers from manufacturers. </strong>This was extremely convenient. <br></p><p><strong>Five vendors reached out within 48 hours</strong> in various mixes of Chinese and English. I wasn’t quite sure how to decide, so I went with the vendor that was most responsive to my questions and had the most robust English.</p><p>Our contract manufacturer? <a href="https://xfdbobble.en.alibaba.com/">Xiamen Xinfade Trade Co</a> with Jonas from their team as our touchpoint throughout the process.<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f245fb1dd15c16aa68b3ffc_Screen%20Shot%202020-07-31%20at%2012.15.02%20PM.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Dog Custom bobblehead was the closest category.</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>From manufacturing partner to bobblehead trophies</strong></h2><p>The email back-and-forth with Jonas began in earnest when I sent my “designs” (Google Slides screenshots) in March 2019.<br></p><p>We discussed project timing, and in less than two weeks he sent pictures of the mold.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f235f4041f47b7113ec4f25_HT8B54ZCk_wm8pWpAzzq5DaBl9ViC-JS4Y2cCE9xGvXP1pPbvsDqLgjaZe4QREMBi2A_OxtqCVx9F4uLdG-HUe0MoA_CQapNoGtoTHAWrzMKJCatr-u1Y2SUpAM7BDLOa9Dp_XGr.gif" alt=""></p><figcaption>The mold of the trophy from different angles.</figcaption></figure><p>At this point, we'd agreed to 300 trophies for $3.50 each, but we hadn't signed a contract or paid a single cent. So when Jonas sent through the mold images I was floored: <strong>this was actually happening.</strong><br></p><p>The molds looked good enough that we locked in the deal with a signed and paid invoice.&nbsp;<br></p><p>By April 11, Jonas sent me painted versions of the molds so we could get a sense of the colors. He asked about box details, colors, stickers, size, and more fine tuning.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5f235f3f680645a36ea7f2ec_P7_uon-XtgJW6KHv4xzCgkMbcCvyQNsq4XhoDOVf-xOd5E-LQ3V_B1-wLxrfB-mGO8lNkupe5fl1CFZr57yhkRLx82KDDNDWlJdD6jW0vkF5Fieny-8CSTC9sP665J_gUOYBfAdP.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Painted versions of the mold. Still just a sticker version of the logo.</figcaption></figure><p>We asked for a lighter resin to make the cooler more transparent. Jonas made it happen.

      <article>
        

        <p>It was a slow descent, after a childhood of abusive parents and trauma.</p>

<p>In the years before John’s flight to Syria and eventual death in a drone strike, his Facebook posts devolved into angry YouTube videos and hatred toward “infidels” in Canada and the USA.</p>

<figure>
    <center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1t0YesVmizM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></center>
</figure>

<p>The last time I talked to John, I knew the secret service had been investigating him for months and that he had already left for Syria. Our last chat is surreal to read in hindsight; I come off as extremely nonchalant at his mention of Syria. I remember trying hard to stay cool and play it off, fearful of John’s wrath should he come back—after all, he knew where my family lived and my little sister was still at home.</p>

<p>John and I connected because we were jazzed about biology. He wanted to major in it at McGill while I did biochem and we tried our hand at a pharma company. We’d play pickup hockey, jam in my basement, make YouTube videos, and cook up startup schemes. But a year and a half out of high school found him converted to Islam and us locked in debate for hours, now about whether the Qur’an was the only true science left in the world. By this time John had changed his name to Yahya, grown a beard, stopped playing music—now a sin, the devil’s work designed to distract us from our purpose—and had developed an Arabic accent as you can hear in the video.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://jaan.io/images/dont-become-data-for-AI/chat.svg">
    <figcaption>My last chat with one of my best friends John (Yahya).</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I sometimes wonder what we could learn from an audit of John’s Facebook newsfeed over the course of his radicalization, considering that I did research internships at Google Brain and DeepMind and completed a significant part of my PhD on recommender systems. While the Facebook posts we saw from John were increasingly extreme, what were the machine learning algorithms behind the newsfeed predicting he would search for and click on?</p>

<p>The machine learning systems that power social media can have significant negative effects, especially when Facebook <a href="https://apnews.com/article/3479209d927946f7a284a71d66e431c7">auto-generates</a> extremist content or when ISIS <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/islamic-state-terrorism-facebook">continues to recruit</a> on social media with the help of automatic recommendation systems. Radicalization is not going away. In the past few weeks we’ve seen how powerful algorithms can contribute to people inciting insurrections in America. As I watched a mob batter down the windows of the Capitol, inspired by online echo chambers in tweets and newsfeeds, I thought of my work in machine learning, thought of that drone strike, and wondered ‘did I unwittingly help create this?’</p>

<p>We’re used to machine learning running our world through the interfaces in virtual assistants, newsfeeds, or navigation systems that change our behavior every day. But here I aim to provide a measured perspective on the risks we take when choosing to support companies and tools that are powered by machine learning. After exploring the risks that make the boons of machine learning less rosy, we discuss how we might mitigate risk and hold power to account in an environment where business incentives limit our ability to have this discussion.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="what-is-machine-learning">What is machine learning?</h2>

<p>One of the tools for deploying artificial intelligence is machine learning. A machine learning algorithm is a set of instructions that helps a machine learn from patterns in data. Those patterns can then be used to help people make decisions.</p>

<p>A newsfeed, for example, can be created using a machine learning method called a recommender system. The pattern for the machine to learn in a recommender system could be which ads are most likely to be clicked on that are least likely to cause the user to navigate away from the newsfeed, losing potential revenue. To keep the user engaged with the system and maximize the chance that they click on an ad, the machine learning algorithm should provide enough interesting content similar to what the user has clicked on and read before.</p>

<p>An example of a machine-learnt pattern: I navigated to news.google.com and was presented with an article on <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/news/apple-logo-iphone-tap">how to use the Apple logo on the back of my iPhone as a button</a>. This pattern may have been learned because I’ve been searching for how to perform simple tasks in iOS, having recently switched from a Google phone to an iPhone. The machine learning algorithm learned to associate the text in the article I was recommended with my recent searches, and the algorithm predicted that I was likely to click the link. Similar systems power <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/insights/2017/using-deep-learning-at-scale-in-twitters-timelines.html">Twitter’s newsfeed</a>, <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/search-language-understanding-bert/">Google search</a>, <a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/45530.pdf">YouTube recommendations</a>, and the <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/online-and-offline-tests-to-improve-news-feed-ranking/">Facebook newsfeed</a>.</p>

<p>Besides helping us find information, machine learning algorithms run the voice recognition of Siri, Alexa, and the Google Assistant; they power photo and document apps alongside countless other tools we interact with every day. (Twitter’s machine learning algorithms helped me <a href="https://jaan.io/images/dont-become-data-for-AI/twitter-optimize.png">choose a headline</a> for this article.) AI and machine learning may also help us <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03348-4">understand biology</a>, reduce road accidents thanks to <a href="https://www.tesla.com/autopilotAI">autonomous vehicles</a>, diagnose disease <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-020-00376-2">more accurately</a>, understand and remedy <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-01192-7">health disparity</a>, or beat pandemics with <a href="https://digital.hbs.edu/artificial-intelligence-machine-learning/ai-puts-moderna-within-striking-distance-of-beating-covid-19/">better vaccines</a>.</p>

<hr>


<p>But behind the benefits of machine learning are incentives and power structures, such as those in the business models of the six FAANGM companies (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google, and Microsoft) that make up a <a href="https://www.yardeni.com/pub/yardenifangoverview.pdf">quarter of the S&amp;P index</a> and were responsible for the majority of its gains in 2020. Folks at these big companies, with a median salary of <a href="https://aipaygrad.es/">$339,574 per year</a>, have the incentive to use machine learning to earn more money through products, memberships, or ads, and are not incentivized to talk about the risks intrinsic to such business models.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://jaan.io/images/dont-become-data-for-AI/faangm-performance.svg">
    <figcaption>Performance of the FAANGM companies relative to the S&amp;P index (<a href="https://www.yardeni.com/pub/faangms.pdf">source</a>). These six companies are reliant on machine learning algorithms across their platforms.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Might these power structures amplify existing patterns of inequality with the help of machine learning or target vulnerable populations susceptible to misinformation or addiction? There’s a chance the patterns of inequity supported by ad-based revenue models—which help build machine learning systems—reinforce and mirror the patterns of inequity in broader society. As an expert in this area, I’m concerned when I see friends and colleagues unwilling to go public about these problems, perhaps out of fear of repercussion from their employers. We’re left with few alternatives other than to speak out when faced with powerful silencing mechanisms.</p>

<p>Anecdata like my ex-friend John’s online radicalization can inform our discussion about the potential risks of machine learning deployed in social media across our devices.  The question may be one of not <em>whether</em>, but of <em>how much</em> algorithms can amplify existing patterns in humans and society.</p>

<p>One piece of evidence that machine learning can amplify existing patterns of violence is that Facebook has an established team for counterterrorism policy that itself, ironically, <a href="https://tnsr.org/2019/02/crossroads-counter-terrorism-and-the-internet/https://tnsr.org/2019/02/crossroads-counter-terrorism-and-the-internet/">relies on machine learning</a> and is privy to the same business incentives. (The more content you block and the more people you ban, the more your revenue decreases.) The company has already admitted to having an effect on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/technology/myanmar-facebook.html">atrocious killings in Myanmar</a>. Similarly, Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook all played a significant role in propagating <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2021/01/07/the-making-of-qanon-a-crowdsourced-conspiracy/">QAnon</a> and organizing the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/insurrection-at-the-capitol/2021/01/12/956003580/facebook-removes-stop-the-steal-content-twitter-suspends-qanon-accounts">Capitol insurrection</a> in the United States in January 2021.  Geopolitical risk might also be rising through this technology, as a whistleblower at Facebook has admitted to <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/facebook-ignore-political-manipulation-whistleblower-memo">global political manipulation capabilities</a> created, in part, through the use of machine learning.</p>

<figcaption>How conspiracy theorists such as QAnon aficionados can game Instagram algorithms, hijack hashtags to evade detection, and effectively reverse engineer recommendation algorithms to rank highly in vulnerable targets’ newsfeeds.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Besides saving would-be extremists from algorithms and America from filter bubble insurrectionists, can we save the children? No, not from a <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2021/01/07/the-making-of-qanon-a-crowdsourced-conspiracy/">cabal</a>, but from the terrifying content both <a href="https://medium.com/@jamesbridle/something-is-wrong-on-the-internet-c39c471271d2">created <em>and</em> recommended</a> by algorithms, content that is hard to detect and <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/youtube-for-kids-videos-problems-algorithm-recommend">harder to keep removing</a> given the financial incentives to continuing the onslaught.  To rub salt in the wound, there is research linking early-childhood events to <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/8858/">dopamine and addictive behavior</a> that machine learning may exploit. Newsfeeds are explicitly designed to target <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/how-to-manufacture-desire/">dopamine circuitry</a> and might therefore disparately affect marginalized populations. Furthering this argument from a socioeconomic perspective, consider that poor kids own fewer devices than rich kids but experience <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/10/29/20937870/kids-screentime-rich-poor-common-sense-media"><em>more</em> screen time</a>. Leaving aside the question of how much machine learning may help target certain populations over others, consider that companies like YouTube and Facebook make strictly more money the more poor kids with ample screen time watch content; the earlier they start, the better.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Given these documented risks of machine learning when it is used to power social media algorithms, it is worth coming up with ways to mitigate risk in the deployment of machine learning technology throughout our homes, communities, and countries.</p>

<p>We’ve explored the ways machine learning may target vulnerable people, countries, and patterns for profit, remaining aware that there’d be more money in avoiding this line of inquiry in the first place. Societal patterns like terrorism, conspiracy theories driven by misinformation, and grotesque kids content run the risk of being amplified through the machine learning in social media. People like John might be more likely to be radicalized because of their life experience, therefore subject to the unintended consequences of companies that develop machine learning. We need to ensure such a discussion happens at a societal level with the involvement of those most affected along with experts in ethics, policy, law, and …</p></article></section></div></div>

                    Neural signed distance functions (SDFs) are emerging as an effective representation for 3D shapes. SDFs encode 3D surfaces with a function of position that returns the closest distance to a surface. State-of-the-art methods typically encode the SDF with a large, fixed-size neural network to approximate complex shapes with implicit surfaces. Rendering these large networks is, however, computationally expensive since it requires many forward passes through the network for every pixel, making these representations impractical for real-time graphics applications.

                        Neural SDFs are typically encoded using large, fixed-size MLPs which are expensive to render.

            We introduce an efficient neural representation that, for the first time, enables real-time rendering of high-fidelity neural SDFs, while achieving state-of-the-art geometry reconstruction quality. We represent implicit surfaces using an octree-based feature volume which adaptively fits shapes with multiple discrete levels of detail (LODs), and enables continuous LOD with SDF interpolation. We further develop an efficient algorithm to directly render our novel neural SDF representation in real-time by querying only the necessary LODs with sparse octree traversal. We show that our representation is 2-3 orders of magnitude more efficient in terms of rendering speed compared to previous works. Furthermore, it produces state-of-the-art reconstruction quality for complex shapes under both 3D geometric and 2D image-space metrics.

                <p>
                    We encode shapes using a sparse voxel octree (SVO) based feature volume, where the levels of the tree corresponds to LOD. This lets us use a very small MLP, which accelerates rendering by 2-3 orders of magnitudes.

                We qualitatively compare the mesh reconstructions. Only ours is able to recover fine details, with speeds 50× faster than FFN and comparable to NI. We render surface normals to highlight geometric details.

                We test against two difficult analytic SDF examples from Shadertoy; the Oldcar, which contains a highly non-metric signed distance field, as well as the Mandelbulb, which is a recursive fractal structure that can only be expressed using implicit surfaces. Only our architecture can reasonably reconstruct these hard cases. We render surface normals to highlight geometric details.

<div>
<p>We are taking a practical approach in the following sections. As such, we need the right tools and environments available in order to keep up with the examples and exercises. We will be using <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> along with packages that will form our scientific stack, such as <code>ndarray</code> (for multi-dimensional containers) and <code>plotly</code> (for interactive graphing), etc. We will write all of our code within a <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebook</a>, but you are free to use other IDEs.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Install-Miniconda">Install Miniconda<a href="#Install-Miniconda">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>There are many different ways to get up and running with an environment that will facilitate our work. One approach I can recommend is to install and use Miniconda.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Miniconda is a free minimal installer for conda. It is a small, bootstrap version of Anaconda that includes only conda, Python, the packages they depend on, and a small number of other useful packages, including pip, zlib and a few others.</p>
<p>— <cite>https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can skip Miniconda entirely if you prefer and install Jupyter Lab directly, however, I prefer using it to manage other environments too.</p>
<p>You can find installation instructions for Miniconda on <a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html">their website</a>, but if you're using Linux (e.g. Ubuntu) you can execute the following commands from in your terminal:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh</pre></div>
<p>This will download the installation files and start the interactive installation process. Follow the process to the end, where you should see the following message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for installing Miniconda3!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All that's left is to close and re-open the terminal window.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Create-Your-Environment">Create Your Environment<a href="#Create-Your-Environment">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>Once Miniconda is installed, we need to create and configure our environment. If you added Miniconda to your PATH environment during the installation process, then you can run these commands directly from Terminal, Powershell, or CMD.</p>
<p>Now we can create and configure our conda environment using the following commands.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>conda create -n darn <span>python</span><span>=</span><span>3</span></pre></div>
<p>You can replace <code>darn</code> (<strong>D</strong>ata <strong>An</strong>alytics with <strong>R</strong>ust <strong>N</strong>otebooks) with a name of your choosing.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<p>This will create a conda environment named <code>darn</code> with the latest Python 3 package ready to go. You should be presented with a list of packages that will be installed and asked if you wish to proceed. To do so, just enter the character <code>y</code>. If this operation is successful, you should see the following output at the end:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>Preparing transaction: <span>done</span>
Verifying transaction: <span>done</span>
Executing transaction: <span>done</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># To activate this environment, use</span>
<span>#</span>
<span>#     $ conda activate darn</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># To deactivate an active environment, use</span>
<span>#</span>
<span>#     $ conda deactivate</span></pre></div>
<p>As the message suggests, you will need to type the following command to activate and start entering commands within our environment named <code>darn</code>.</p>

<p>Once you do that, you should see your terminal prompt now leads with the environment name within parentheses:</p>

<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>The example above shows the macOS machine name "melica" and the user "shahin". You will see something different on your machine, and it may appear in a different format on a different operating system such as Windows. As long as the prompt leads with "(darn)", you are on the right track.</p>
</div>
<p>This will allow you to identify which environment you are currently operating in. If you restart your machine, you should be able to use <code>conda activate darn</code> within your conda prompt to get back into the same environment.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Install-Packages">Install Packages<a href="#Install-Packages">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>If your environment was already configured and ready, you would be able to enter the command <code>jupyter lab</code> to launch an instance of the Jupyter Lab IDE in the current directory. However, if we try that in our newly created environment, we will receive an error:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span>darn<span>)</span> melica:~ shahin$ jupyter lab
-bash: jupyter: <span>command</span> not found</pre></div>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<p>So let's fix that. Let's install Jupyter Lab and use the <code>-y</code> option which automatically says "yes" to any questions asked during the installation process.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>conda install -c conda-forge <span>jupyterlab</span><span>=</span><span>2</span>.2.9</pre></div>
<p>We'll also need <code>cmake</code> later on.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>conda install -c anaconda cmake -y</pre></div>
<p>Finally, let's install nodejs. This is needed to run our Jupyter Lab extension in the next section.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>conda install -c conda-forge <span>nodejs</span><span>=</span><span>15</span> -y</pre></div>

</div>

</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Install-Jupyer-Lab-Extensions">Install Jupyer Lab Extensions<a href="#Install-Jupyer-Lab-Extensions">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>There's one last thing we need to do before we move on, and that's installing any Jupyter Lab extensions that we may need. One particular extension that we need is the plotly extension, which will allow our Jupyter Notebooks to render our Plotly visualisations. Within your conda environment, simply run the following command:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>jupyter labextension install jupyterlab-plotly</pre></div>
<p>This may take some time, especially when it builds your jupyterlab assets, so keep an eye on it until you're returned control over the conda prompt, i.e. when you see the following:</p>

<p>Optionally, you may wish to install the purple looking theme from Figure 1 above.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>jupyter labextension install @shahinrostami/theme-purple-please</pre></div>
<p>Now we're good to go!</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Install-Rust">Install Rust<a href="#Install-Rust">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>Now we'll install Rust using rustup, but you can check out the <a href="https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html">other installation methods</a> if you need them.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>curl --proto <span>'=https'</span> --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs <span>|</span> sh</pre></div>
<p>The code samples in this book will work in many versions of Rust, but I can confirm them to be working with version <code>1.42.0</code>. You can get the same version with:</p>

<p>You will be given instructions for adding Cargo's bin directory to your PATH environment variable.</p>

<p>This will work until your close your terminal, so make sure to add it to your shell profile. I use Z shell (Zsh) so this meant adding the following to <code>.zshrc</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>export</span> <span>PATH</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$HOME</span><span>/.cargo/bin:</span><span>$PATH</span><span>"</span></pre></div>
<p>You can make sure everything works by closing and re-opening your terminal and typing <code>cargo</code>. If this returns the usage documentation then you're all set.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Don't forget to activate your environment when opening the terminal.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Install-the-EvCxR-Jupyter-Kernel">Install the EvCxR Jupyter Kernel<a href="#Install-the-EvCxR-Jupyter-Kernel">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>Now we'll install the <a href="https://github.com/google/evcxr/blob/master/evcxr_jupyter/README.md">EvCxR Jupyter Kernel</a>. If you're wondering how it's pronounced, it's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/9irjm7/evcxr_a_repl_and_jupyter_kernel_for_rust/e6mphus?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x">been mentioned to be "Evic-ser"</a>. This is what will allow us to execute Rust code in a Jupyter Notebook.</p>
<p>You can get <a href="https://github.com/google/evcxr/blob/master/evcxr_jupyter/README.md">other installation methods</a> methods for EvCxR if you need then, but we will be using:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>cargo install evcxr_jupyter --version <span>0</span>.5.3
evcxr_jupyter --install</pre></div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<div>

<div>
<div>
<p>Let's test if everything is working as it should be. In your conda prompt, within your conda environment, run the following command</p>

<p>This should start the Jupyter Lab server and launch a browser window with the IDE ready to use.</p>

</p>
<center><p><strong>Figure 2</strong> - A fresh installation of Jupyter Lab.</p></center>
<p>Let's create a new notebook. In the Launcher tab which has opened by default, click "Rust" under the Notebook heading. This will create a new and empty notebook named <code>Untitled.ipynb</code> in the current directory.</p>
<p>If everything is configured as it should be, you should see no errors. Type the following into the first cell and click the "play" button to execute it and create a new cell.</p>

<p>If we followed all the instructions and didn't encounter any errors, everything should be working. We should see "Hello World!" in the output cell.</p>

January 28, 2021 | https://www.bannerbear.com/blog/don-t-charge-a-month-for-your-product/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.bannerbear.com/blog/don-t-charge-a-month-for-your-product/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Today I increased pricing plans across Votemojo and Previewmojo. All plans now start at $49 a month. Here's why charging $9 a month for your indie SaaS product is a really silly idea. </p>

<p><em>Update: The two products mentioned in this article no longer exist. Votemojo was shut down. Previewmojo was rebranded to Bannerbear, has pivoted quite a bit since then and is now doing $10K MRR. I stand by this article still, as pricing is one of the main levers of my MRR growth over the last year.</em></p>

<p><em>Note: existing customers always get grandfathered in at their current price plan.</em></p>

<h2 id="whats-changed">What's changed?</h2>

<p>Votemojo and Previewmojo now have new pricing pages with 3 tiers and a monthly billing / annual billing toggle. (with a neat little animation when you toggle!)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.previewmojo.com/pricing"><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/74bf4fb451e0a3f08be2260da742d1ba0cf58f77/9a0d0/images/blog/new_pricing.png" alt=""></a></p>

<p>For Previewmojo in particular, this is a big jump from the previous pricing plan. Previewmojo's lowest pricing tier has increased from $9 to $49 a month. Votemojo's lowest pricing tier has increased from $19 to $49 a month.</p>

<h2 id="why-ive-changed-pricing">Why I've changed pricing</h2>

<p>There's no singular reason, although there was a tipping point - more on that later.</p>

<p>It is my general feeling that I should be aiming higher in the value chain if I am going to turn Mojosaas into a sustainable business. Low pricing often means saturated markets with high churn, and this is not where I want to be aiming. Charging a higher price instantly moves the roadmap away from this space.</p>

<p>Whereas previously it was tempting to look at my roadmap and think "what would people like me pay $9 for", now I am thinking more about what actual businesses would pay $50 to $100 a month for.</p>

<p>This is a good thing because <em>other indie hackers</em> are not your target market. Businesses with money to spend on problems they need solved - that's your target market.</p>

<p>The tipping point I mentioned above happened this week. Previewmojo acquired its first paying customer a few days after launch, on the $9 plan. A few days later, that same customer churned.</p>

<p>I reached out to understand what happened, but have not received a response - which is fine, I am not owed one. But it did make me realise that something's wrong. Low pricing introduces risk. Maybe customers don't know what they are signing up for. Maybe customers perceive it as delivering low value so you're first to get cancelled when the credit card statement gets looked at. And lets not forget that in trying to offer customer support at this price, you will probably make 0 profit.</p>

<p>So I'm climbing up the value chain.</p>

<h2 id="ways-to-price-your-saas">3 ways to price your SaaS</h2>

<p>I've been recently updating myself on SaaS pricing literature / articles. There are many, many such articles on the web (and now there's one more - yay!).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.priceintelligently.com/">Price Intelligently</a> has a nice <a href="https://www.priceintelligently.com/hubfs/Price-Intelligently-SaaS-Pricing-Strategy.pdf">free ebook</a> on the topic.</p>

<p>There's a lot to digest in that PDF (and all definitely worth reading) but I think the most useful and simple lesson for me was that there are roughly 3 ways to price something. I'll list them here and try not to paraphrase the book too much.</p>

<p><em>Cost plus pricing</em> - Where the price of a product is calculated by adding a markup to all variable costs involved in delivering it.</p>

<p><em>Competitor based pricing</em> - Where the price of a product is benchmarked against what other sellers are pricing at.</p>

<p><em>Value based pricing</em> - Where the price of a product is based on the value it delivers to the customer.</p>

<p>I think indie hackers have the tendency to price out the gate based on a combination of cost and competitor pricing. That's why you see a lot of new products out there charging &lt; $10 a month. They are charging that because everyone else is. Short term, you aren't going to earn a sustainable living from $9 subscriptions. Long term, it's going to damage the community. So this mentality has to change.</p>

<p>Value based pricing solves that. Ask what a <em>non indie hacker</em> target group of customers would pay to have a particular problem solved. If they genuinly respond that they would only pay 2x starbucks coffees worth per month for your solution to their problem, it might be time to pivot the product or feature set into something more valuable.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p><span>It goes without saying that any business or entrepreneur involved with B2B products or services should take phone calls most seriously. This is the precious time and attention of your clients, so no mistakes should be made and no time should be wasted. This is why you must learn to avoid common mistakes.</span></p>
<h2><span>Stages of Call Prep</span></h2>
<p><span>All in all, before making a call, you should:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>prepare a client for the call;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>prepare yourself of your team for the call;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>make a “call before call”;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>introduce a call.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Calling up a client – what you need to know?</span></h3>
<p><span>First and foremost, you need to try to anticipate the client’s expectations about the call and prepare them for a productive conversation. Since only you know what this is about from the beginning, you need to provide clients with prior context. In general, you need to be on the same page from the get-go.</span></p>
<p><span>Inviting a client to the call in advance, you can settle with such specifics as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>purpose of the call;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>how you see the call-up;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>how much time it will take;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>date and time of the call.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>You can also provide any essential information that you think a client should know before discussing what you need to discuss.</span></p>
<p><span>You can invite a client to the call in several ways:</span></p>
<h4><span>Poor wording</span></h4>
<p><span>You’re making an invitation poorly if you don’t explain the purpose, context, and plan of the call-up, for instance:</span></p>
<p><i><span>“Hi! We need to have a call in an hour.”</span></i></p>
<h4><span>Staying polite</span></h4>
<p><span>To make it easier on the client, you should start with the goal of the call and a polite question:</span></p>
<p><i><span>“Hey there!</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>We have an offer we’d like to discuss. When would it be convenient for you to have a call if you’re interested?”</span></i></p>
<h4><span>Best bet</span></h4>
<p><span>Make it as informative as possible. Mention how much time the call will approximately take and specify the most convenient call-up time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span>“Hey there!</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>We have an offer that should interest you. If you’d like to discuss it, we can have a 5-minute long video call-up where we can tell you all about our project, its budget, team responsibilities, and prospects. Can we have a call tomorrow? If yes, what time will be convenient for you? Or maybe some other day?”</span></i></p>
<h3><span>Self-preparation</span></h3>
<p><span>Once the call is arranged and scheduled, you should prepare well for it. Improvisation during the call can have unknown results, so you need to plan everything ahead.</span></p>
<h4><span>Ask questions</span></h4>
<p><span>You must consider all the details and ask questions to avoid gaps in the expertise you offer. Write down all the questions you need to clarify so you don’t miss anything. Many people rely on their memory, but you can easily miss some important information. On top of that, questions prepared in advance will help avoid unnecessary pauses during the conversation.</span></p>
<h4><span>Have a good presentation</span></h4>
<p><span>Work on the presentation of your offer for your client to approve. You must be prepared for the client to challenge your decisions. It is worth making sure that the presentation answers all possible questions the client should have. Take notes to yourself so that you won’t miss any crucial info.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://angle2.agency/wp-content/uploads/1_E4UQV5eBqP30AAbTZ976eA.gif" alt="shut up" width="500" height="281"></p>
<p><span>Working on a presentation:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>schematize the distribution of project responsibilities and value all the underlying work;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>demonstrate use cases or statistics;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>mention any necessary deadlines;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>offer your take on saving project time and budget;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>explain why your offer deserves attention over the others.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Call before call</span></h3>
<p><span>If a whole team of specialists is making a call – everybody should stay in tune and work as one to make the call as smooth as possible. For this, there is a&nbsp; “call before call” technique used for synchronization before contact with a B2B client.</span></p>
<p><span>What you should do during the call before call?</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Assign a moderator. </b><span>A moderator is an employee who will maintain the order of the conversation, invite the participants to speak, and help lead the conversation in the right direction.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Distribute topics.</b><span> Arrange who says what during the call so that any unnecessary pauses and interruptions are avoided. Agree on who speaks in what order as well.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Make a soundcheck.</b><span> Checking the sound beforehand will help you avoid possible time-consuming issues during the call</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Such organizational moments will help you make calls fully prepared and make it clear to the client that they are dealing with professionals.</span></p>
<h3><span>Introduction to the call</span></h3>
<p><span>As you start a conversation, your goal should be to win over the client’s attention. Certainly, a lot depends on who you are talking to. There are usually a few things you need to adhere to when opening a conversation:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>ask how the client is doing;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>summarize the purpose of the call and how long it should take;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>introduce your team (if it is a conference with multiple participants).</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span>Bottom Line</span></h2>
<p><span>You may easily boost your chances of closing a deal or arranging a successful project if you are well prepared for a call with your client.</span></p>
<p><span>To summarize, make sure to follow these simple guidelines when making B2B calls:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Try to put yourself in the client’s shoes when preparing for a call, think what might really interest them;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Don’t rely on your memory alone, put down your questions and theses in advance;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Try to clarify points that should interest a client before they ask questions;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Make a “call before call” to be on the same page with other participants of the call;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Prepare a client for the call with some essential information.</span></li>
</ul>

January 28, 2021 | https://jfmengels.net/safe-dead-code-removal/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jfmengels.net/safe-dead-code-removal/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few months ago, a colleague of mine <a href="https://twitter.com/jfmengels/status/1311940821378387970">wrote this</a> on Slack:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks to elm-review I was able to remove ~7300 lines of code in the front end in 225 different files.
Something I could have never done without its aid. Thank you Jeroen!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also some time ago, I <a href="https://twitter.com/jfmengels/status/1330854406615674883">tweeted this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just cleaned up a lot of Elm code. I wanted to remove our usage of a module that brought no value. Manually removed the main places where it was used and followed the compiler errors. That was about 200 lines.
elm-review took care of the other 2700 lines of the then dead code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For scale, this was on a project of about 170k lines of code. Well, before the code removal. If we take what my colleague did, he was basically able to remove ~5% of the codebase, while touching ~30% of all files.</p>
<p>And <strong>we felt good</strong> about that.</p>
<p>I wanted to break down how <a href="https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/jfmengels/elm-review/latest/"><code>elm-review</code></a>, a static analysis tool for <a href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>, was able to help us remove all this code almost effortlessly in a way that we felt very confident with. Spoiler: It’s because of the lack of side effects in the language.</p>
<p>We are going to compare what code a static analysis tool for a side effect free language (Elm) is able to remove compared to for a dynamic and effectful language (JavaScript).</p>
<h3>Obscurity by impurity</h3>
<p>I’ll take the example of some JavaScript code because that’s another language for which I worked a lot on static analysis.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>formatUserName</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> userInfo <span>=</span> <span>formatUserInfo</span><span>(</span>user<span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> user<span>.</span>name<span>.</span>first <span>+</span> <span>' '</span> <span>+</span> Formatting<span>.</span><span>formatLastName</span><span>(</span>user<span>.</span>name<span>.</span>last<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Did you notice in this example that <code>userInfo</code> was declared but never used? A static analysis tool (or linter if you will) can easily spot that, and it is a very common feature that they provide.</p>
<p>Now what should we do about this unused variable? If we wanted to clean up the excerpt above, the only thing we’d be able to do safely is remove the assignment of <code>formatUserInfo(user)</code> to <code>userInfo</code>, as shown below.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>formatUserName</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>formatUserInfo</span><span>(</span>user<span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> user<span>.</span>name<span>.</span>first <span>+</span> <span>' '</span> <span>+</span> Formatting<span>.</span><span>formatLastName</span><span>(</span>user<span>.</span>name<span>.</span>last<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can’t remove the call to <code>formatUserInfo(user)</code> because we don’t know what it does. Maybe it mutates the <code>user</code> argument or global variables, makes HTTP requests, etc. In this example, I wouldn’t be all <em>that</em> surprised if <code>formatUserInfo</code> would mutate <code>user.name</code> by adding information from other <code>user</code> fields.</p>
<p>Those are called <strong>side effects</strong>: things that a function does in addition to or instead of returning a value. When a function has side effects, we say it is “impure”, and we say it is “pure” if it doesn’t have any.</p>
<p>The tricky thing with side effects is that the surrounding code may rely on those side effects being applied, but there is nothing in the code—that can’t become stale—that indicates that dependency.</p>
<p>If a function is impure, then removing a call to it may change the behavior of the code. That means without knowing whether it is pure or impure, we can’t <strong>safely</strong> remove it. For this article, I’ll consider the removal of code “safe” if it won’t change the behavior of the code or introduce compiler errors.</p>
<p>A smart static analysis tool could try to inspect <code>formatUserInfo</code> to see if it has side effects, but that can get very hairy. In some cases, it will even be outright impossible because of the inherent limitations of a static analysis tool on a dynamic language.</p>
<p>The more dynamic a language gets and the more it allows for side effects, the harder it will be for a static analysis tool to do an accurate analysis and reduce false positives and false negatives.</p>
<p>Here is an incomplete list of JavaScript features that make it hard to predict what the code will do:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval"><code>eval</code> function</a> allows executing non-sandboxed arbitrary JavaScript contained in a string.</li>
<li>Through <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get">getters</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set">setters</a>, even an expression as simple as <code>a.b</code> can have side effects.</li>
<li>Through changing the prototype of specific or core types, even standardized functions that are considered pure can become impure. This is actually a security issue and one of the reasons you get so many <code>dependabot issues</code> to bump <a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-LODASH-608086">dependencies with vulnerabilities</a>.</li>
<li>Through macros (using Webpack or Babel for instance), the code may be transformed in unknown ways. In some cases, the tool won’t be able to parse the untransformed code.</li>
<li>Through dynamic imports (<code>require</code> or dynamic HTML script tags), arbitrary code—that the tool may not even have access to—can be imported and executed, potentially applying one of the features listed above.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Clarity by purity</h3>
<p>In Elm, you only have <strong>pure</strong> functions. Meaning that there is no observable difference between calling a function and not using the result, and not calling it at all.</p>
<p>In Elm, the previous uncleaned code snippet would translate to this:</p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>formatUserName</span> <span>user</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>let</span>
    <span>userInfo</span> <span>=</span> <span>formatUserInfo</span> <span>user</span>
  <span>in</span>
  <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>.</span><span>first</span> <span>++</span> <span>" "</span> <span>++</span> <span>Formatting.formatLastName</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>.</span><span>last</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here we could <strong>safely</strong>—without changing the behavior of the program—report that the whole declaration of <code>userInfo</code> can be removed, the call to <code>formatUserInfo</code> included, and propose to automatically fix it.</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://jfmengels.net/static/c63c27c71df8f649a59379845141efa1/a0209/step1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
  
  <span>
    <span>
      <img alt="elm-review reporting the unused variable and proposing a fix" title="" src="https://jfmengels.net/static/c63c27c71df8f649a59379845141efa1/a0209/step1.png" srcset="https://jfmengels.net/static/c63c27c71df8f649a59379845141efa1/4dcb9/step1.png 188w,

https://jfmengels.net/static/c63c27c71df8f649a59379845141efa1/a0209/step1.png 725w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px">
    </span>
  </span>
  
  </a>
    </p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>formatUserName</span> <span>user</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>.</span><span>first</span> <span>++</span> <span>" "</span> <span>++</span> <span>Formatting.formatLastName</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>.</span><span>last</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Why was the value unused? Either it lost its purpose at some point yet wasn’t cleaned up, or this might be a bug lying around because it needed to be used somewhere but the developer who wrote/changed the code forgot to. Without talking to the developers directly we can’t know in which situation we are in, and whether the value should be used or removed.</p>
<p>For that reason, when <code>elm-review</code> analyzes the code and it has been run with <code>--fix</code>, it will ask the user for confirmation before applying the suggested fix of removing the variable. Every <code>elm-review</code> fix proposal requires an approval from the user before it gets committed to the file system.</p>
<p>There is a way to batch them to avoid having the process be too tedious though, which I find people start to use after the tool has gained their trust.</p>
<h3>What more can we find?</h3>
<p>In the rest of the article, I will refer to the change we did previously as step 1.</p>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>In JavaScript-land, we would have had to keep the call to <code>formatUserInfo</code>, but in Elm-land, we were able to remove it. That allows us to do one more thing: check whether <code>formatUserInfo</code> is ever used anywhere else.</p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>SomeModule</span> <span>exposing</span> <span>(</span><span>formatUserName</span><span>)</span>
<span>
<span>import</span> Formatting</span>

<span>formatUserName</span> <span>user</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>.</span><span>first</span> <span>++</span> <span>" "</span> <span>++</span> <span>Formatting.formatLastName</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>.</span><span>last</span>

<span>formatUserInfo</span> <span>user</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>{</span> <span>role</span> <span>=</span> <span>Formatting.formatRole</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>role</span>
  <span>,</span> <span>description</span> <span>=</span> <span>String.trim</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>description</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When we look at this module, it seems that <code>formatUserInfo</code> is never used in any way: It is not exposed to the other modules nor is it used in any of the other functions. So we can safely remove it too!</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://jfmengels.net/static/3f2215f8a910973dfd858c172a61d949/c54b3/step2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
  
  <span>
    <span>
      <img alt="elm-review reporting formatUserInfo and proposing a fix" title="" src="https://jfmengels.net/static/3f2215f8a910973dfd858c172a61d949/c54b3/step2.png" srcset="https://jfmengels.net/static/3f2215f8a910973dfd858c172a61d949/4dcb9/step2.png 188w,

    </span>
  </span>
  
  </a>
    </p>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Let’s look at the <code>Formatting</code> module, whose import we just removed.</p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>Formatting</span> <span>exposing</span> <span>(</span><span>formatLastName</span><span>,</span> <span>formatRole</span><span>)</span>
<span>
<span>import</span> Diacritics</span><span>
<span>import</span> ReCase</span>

<span>type</span> <span>Capitalization</span>
  <span>=</span> <span>AllCaps</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>SnakeCase</span>

<span>formatLastName</span> <span>lastName</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>applyFormatting</span> <span>AllCaps</span> <span>lastName</span>

<span>formatRole</span> <span>role</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>applyFormatting</span> <span>SnakeCase</span> <span>role</span>

<span>applyFormatting</span> <span>formatting</span> <span>string</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>case</span> <span>formatting</span> <span>of</span>
    <span>AllCaps</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String.toUpper</span> <span>string</span>
    <span>SnakeCase</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>ReCase.fromSnake</span> <span>(</span><span>ReCase.toSnake</span> <span>(</span><span>Diacritics.removeAccents</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>elm-review</code> rules have the ability to look at all modules of a project before reporting errors. This makes it immensively more powerful than static analysis tools that only look at a single module at a time (like <code>elm-review</code> did originally, which I can tell you was very frustrating as a rule author). This approach allows us to report things about a module based on how it is used in other modules.</p>
<p>In this case, a different rule named <a href="https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/jfmengels/elm-review-unused/latest/NoUnused-Exports"><code>NoUnused.Exports</code></a> (previously we were using the <a href="https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/jfmengels/elm-review-unused/latest/NoUnused-Variables"><code>NoUnused.Variables</code></a> rule) will report that <code>formatRole</code> is exposed as part of the module’s API but never used in other modules, <code>SomeModule</code> being the only module in the entire codebase where it was referenced. Since it’s not used anywhere in the project outside of this module, we can safely stop exposing it from the module.</p>
<p>Note that if this was some kind of utility module that you <em>really</em> wanted to keep as is, you could disable this particular rule for that file. Also this rule does not report functions exposed as part of the public API of an Elm package, no worries there.</p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>Formatting</span> <span>exposing</span> <span>(</span><span>formatLastName</span><span>,</span> <span>formatRole</span><span>)</span>

<span>module</span> <span>Formatting</span> <span>exposing</span> <span>(</span><span>formatLastName</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>
  <a href="https://jfmengels.net/static/0de39c6b208088d439e6c904258159f2/b2982/step3.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
  
  <span>
    <span>
      <img alt="elm-review reporting unused export and proposing a fix" title="" src="https://jfmengels.net/static/0de39c6b208088d439e6c904258159f2/b2982/step3.png" srcset="https://jfmengels.net/static/0de39c6b208088d439e6c904258159f2/4dcb9/step3.png 188w,
https://jfmengels.net/static/0de39c6b208088d439e6c904258159f2/5ff7e/step3.png 375w,

    </span>
  </span>
  
  </a>
    </p>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Now it looks like <code>formatRole</code> was not used internally inside the <code>Formatting</code> module either, so we can remove it entirely just like we did for <code>formatUserInfo</code> back in step 2.</p>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p><code>formatRole</code> was using the <code>SnakeCase</code> variant of <code>Capitalization</code> and that was the only location where that variant was ever created. If that variant is never created, we have no need to handle it.</p>
<p>For those not familiar with custom types (aka “union types” aka “algebraic data types”) but familiar with JavaScript, they allow you to list all the discrete values that something can have. When used in a <code>case</code> expression (roughly equivalent to a <code>switch</code> in JavaScript), the compiler can determine whether you have handled all possible values and remind you when you haven’t, removing the need to add a default case.</p>

<p>This is the first case where an automatic fix is not offered, because we will need to remove the variant both in the custom type definition and in the different patterns, potentially in multiple files. In this case, it’s safer to let the user remove the definition themselves and let the Elm compiler help them fix all the compiler errors that causes.</p>
<p>A tool could potentially do it, but at least for now, <code>elm-review</code> doesn’t. This is how the user would likely remove the …</p></div></div>

            We know how challenging the BigData landscape can be and now, when
            we are all working remotely because of Covid19, we believe it's the
            perfect time to move our office hours to a monthly virtual event.

              <p>More often than not, we find ourselves implementing BigData architectures that include both Presto and Elasticsearch. Presto is usually deployed for what we call the cold layer and Elasticsearch for the hot layer. In most systems, real-time access isn’t required for the lion’s share of the data where the main concern is keeping costs low, making S3 and Presto a great fit. Usually, ultra-low latency queries are only required for a portion of the data and that is where Elasticsearch, which is more hardware demanding and hence costlier, really shines. In this session we will show how we can inter-connect them seamlessly, and demo a couple of really cool features that make some really interesting use-cases finally possible.</p>

<p>I’ve seen screenshots of YouTube modifying dislikes of White House videos. I decided I would do a thorough analysis myself. I wrote a script to check video stats every 80 seconds for 24 hours – for <strong>all</strong> videos on White House’s YouTube channel.</p>



<p>The collected data is archived <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://justpaste.it/94ic5" target="_blank">here</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ufile.io/eqfg1fwl" target="_blank">here</a>. The format is <strong>space</strong>-separated “CSV”, as follows:</p>

<p>Here is a sample of the most egregious manipulation:</p>

<p>Likes+Dislikes was greater than views in some cases. Although that seems impossible, <strong>Youtube updates views slower, so they do not reflect real views at the time</strong>. For example:</p>

<p>So it’s possible for likes and dislikes to accumulate while views stays the same. Eventually, views jumps up to better reflect reality.</p>



<p>The record of every time dislikes were removed is archived at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://pastebin.com/raw/F4ELDc4R" target="_blank">https://pastebin.com/raw/F4ELDc4R</a></p>



<pre><code>Grand Total         -130321</code></pre>



<p><strong>130 Thousand dislikes were removed in a 24hr period!</strong></p>



<p>And this is for the most popular US President of all time!</p>



<p>Enjoy 🙂 -Zoe</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>Update</strong></p>



<p>The timezone for the charts is UTC (London). Did you notice the huge drop at 06 hour (1 AM US Eastern)?  Most working people go to sleep by that time.  Coincidence? I think not.</p>

<p><span>I know this because over the last ten years I’ve built my own startup (which crashed and burned), worked on dozens of MVPs with </span><a href="https://altar.io/work" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Altar.io</span></a><span> and witnessed hundreds of other founder stories.</span></p>
<p><span>The hard truth is, </span><a href="https://altar.io/features-inside-mvp-3-steps-know-answer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>building a successful MVP</span></a><span> is not as simple as coming up with an idea and taking it to a team of developers or a software development company.</span></p>
<p><span>Before writing a line of code, you need to make everything you can to </span><a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>reduce the risk of that product becoming a part of the</span></a><span>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>&nbsp;42% of startups that fail because of no market need;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>&nbsp;19% that get outcompeted;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>&nbsp;17% that fail because they build a user-unfriendly product;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>13% who mistimed their product;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>…you see what I mean.</span></p>
<p><span>A great idea is a good start, but if you want to have any chance of succeeding, it’s vital that you focus on the product from a business standpoint.</span></p>
<p><span>That usually starts with thorough research, from numbers on the market to competitor benchmarks or any other information that can help you turn your vision into a rock-solid value proposition.</span></p>
<p><span>From there, you set the main assumptions to prove and outline the journey your users will take through your product.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At this point, you’ll have all the information you need to create the ultimate list of User Stories and features necessary to prove the main assumptions in a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) or Proof of Concept (POC).</span></p>

<p><span>In this article, I’m going to give you the full process, step-by-step, starting with defining your stakeholders, and finding your value proposition.</span></p>

<h4><span>Expert Tip</span></h4>
<p><i><span>“Your MVP won’t work if your customers can’t see any value. Build what customers want and then scale.”</span></i></p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joeprocopio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Joe Procopio</b></a><b>, Product Expert &amp; Startup Founder</b></p>
</div>
<h2><span>Step One: Define Your Stakeholders &amp; Discover Your Value Proposition</span></h2>
<p><span>Before building your MVP, you need to first do some good, old fashioned research.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Start by, asking yourself:</span></p>
<h3><span><i><span>“What is the problem/pain we’re trying to solve with our product?”</span></i></span></h3>
<p><span>The answer to this question should always be at the front of your mind as you move through the process.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Therefore, keeping that in mind, the next question is:</span></p>
<h3><span><i><span>“Who is your main target? Define all stakeholders involved in your product”</span></i></span></h3>
<p><span>Get to know them in terms of demographics, psychology and behaviour in the observed context.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Later on in the process, it’ll be time to build UX personas for your stakeholders, but we’ll get to that.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>With your detailed list of target stakeholders in hand, and knowing exactly what the problem is that affects them, the next question you need to look at is:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span><i><span>“How do my stakeholders deal with this problem today? Carry out a competitor benchmark.”</span></i><i><span>&nbsp;</span></i></span></h3>
<p><span>Let’s take Spotify as an example here. Before Spotify existed their stakeholders had three options when it came to listening to their favourite music. They could&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Buy it from iTunes&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Buy CDs&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Download it illegally using piracy (At a time where piracy was at its peak)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>It’s imperative that, before you enter the market, you look and who is already in your space. List your competitors, including their strengths, weaknesses and positioning.&nbsp; Also, you might learn something you can adopt from them. As Pablo Picasso said, “Lesser artists borrow; great artists steal.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Then, the final question in step one becomes:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span><i><span>“Why is our solution 10x better than the current market solutions?”</span></i></span></h3>
<p><span>Here, you should define what differentiates you from the competition/existing alternatives for your stakeholders. A.k.a your </span><b>Unique Value Proposition</b><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>Let’s again take Spotify as an example. Their value proposition is to give the user the feeling that they had “all the worlds music on their hard drive” </span><a href="https://mastersofscale.com/daniel-ek-how-to-build-trust-fast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>founder Daniel Ek believed</span></a><span> if he could do this he could “build something better than piracy.”</span></p>
<p><span>And on paper, it was a better option (for </span><i><span>all </span></i><span>stakeholders) when compared with illegally downloading music as:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Artists still make money from customers streaming songs;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The playback quality is better and faster than illegal downloads; and well, it’s legal.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>They were a better option than buying CDs or buying from iTunes (the only other options at the time) as:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Instead of buying an album at around $10 each you had access to millions of songs at $10 a month.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>You could listen instantly on the device of your choice, as opposed to:</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Waiting for it to download via iTunes</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Going to the record store, buying the CD, uploading it to your computer and syncing it with a portable device.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>With that in mind, once you have your Unique Value Proposition, it’s time to wrap up everything from Step One in a comprehensive, crystal clear, product-centric elevator pitch.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It should look something like this (feel free to use this as a template):&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><i>We’ve created </i></b><i><span>[name of our Product] </span></i><b><i>for</i></b><i><span> [our stakeholders] </span></i><b><i>who </i></b><i><span>[state the problem/pain they’re facing]. </span></i><b><i>This product will solve the problem by</i></b><i><span> [state your product’s key benefit]. </span></i><b><i>Unlike</i></b><i><span> [the current market alternatives/competitors] </span></i><b><i>our product will</i></b><i><span> [explain how your product differentiates you from your existing competition].&nbsp;</span></i></p>
<p><span>If any aspect of your elevator pitch is unclear, head back to the beginning of Step One. Otherwise, let’s move onto Step Two: deconstructing your Elevator Pitch and setting your Main Assumptions.</span></p>

<h4><span>Expert Tip</span></h4>
<p><i><span>“Focus on getting your MVP’s value proposition incredibly clear. If your grandma doesn’t understand it’s probably not clear.”</span></i></p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/janphilippkruip/"><b>Jan-Philipp Kruip</b></a><b>, Founder &amp; CEO</b></p>
</div>
<h2><span>Step Two: Deconstructing Your Elevator Pitch to Discover the Main Assumptions to Validate</span></h2>
<p><span>Once you have a rock-solid value proposition and a crystal clear product elevator pitch, it’s time to set the main assumptions you need to validate.</span></p>
<p><span>Looking closely at your elevator pitch, you need to work out:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Which of your assumptions can be validated with research</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Which features need to be built into your MVP to validate any assumptions that can’t be validated with research.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>So, let’s say that your first assumption is that users are </span><i><span>really </span></i><span>facing a problem/pain (for this example let’s call it “Pain X”.)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The first assumption you need to validate is whether or not this is a real, tangible pain point. More often than not this assumption can be validated with research, e.g.:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span>“We know that Pain X is an issue for [name of your target stakeholders] because firstly we’ve seen competitors in the market attempting to solve this problem.”</span></i></p>
<p><span>Taking this example one step further, let’s say that the next assumption you need to validate is that your solution to Pain X is better than your target stakeholders current solution.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This assumption can’t be proven by research alone, you need to test within your MVP and measure this with KPIs e.g.:</span></p>
<p><i><span>“Although users are already solving the problem with [competitor’s solution], we believe this is outdated and inefficient. We propose that [our solution] is a better way to solve Pain X. We intend to prove this by building an MVP and measuring the adoption and retention ratio”.&nbsp;</span></i></p>
<p><span>However, assumptions aren’t just relevant to the end-users, but other stakeholders in the process. For example, Spotify needed to convince record labels to give them the rights to the music. Which, at a time when piracy and digital music platforms were the enemies of the industry, this was a battle for Spotify.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Spotify’s founder, Daniel Ek, was convinced that he had a solution to convince them to come on board:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span><i><span>“Up until that point, Napster and alike simply hadn’t shared their revenues. I was sure we could work out a straightforward revenue share with the record labels.”</span></i></span></h3>
<p><span>It turned out it wasn’t that simple. The record labels still saw digital music platforms, like Napster, as the enemy. They simply didn’t trust Spotify.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Simply put, without industry involvement, Spotify could never exist.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span>Daniel had to de-risk the opportunity for the record labels, by guaranteeing them a year’s worth of revenue. He took a painful short term loss to earn their trust and set himself up for the long term win.</span></p>
<p><span>So, keep in mind as you build your list of assumptions, that some have to be tackled </span><i><span>before </span></i><span>you build your MVP and that direct users aren’t the only stakeholders you should be focusing on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once you have the list of assumptions you need to prove with an MVP, it’s time to move on to creating your user stories &amp; building your feature list.</span></p>

<h2><span>Step Three: User Stories &amp; Feature List&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>At this stage, you’re nearly ready to begin your MVP development process.</span></p>
<p><span>There are two critical aspects, however, that are yet to be completed. Creating your MVP user stories and building your final list of MVP features.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s start with the all-important user stories.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>How to Write User Stories&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span>A user story is an explanation of the journey through your product from the perspective of your stakeholder. It’s the most granular description of how a product works. User stories are a great way of showing how a software feature will provide value to your stakeholders. Also, they will keep your team focused on developing a user-centric product that actually solves their problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s create a few simple user stories based on our previous example, Spotify.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>As an unregistered user:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>I want to sign up with Facebook, Google or email &amp; password</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>If I sign up with email I want to insert my password into two separate fields to ensure they match</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>I want my password to be secure, therefore must contain at least 8 characters and at least one number and special character.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>As a registered user:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>I can log in using Facebook, Google or email &amp; password.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>If I forget my password I want to be able to click on a “Forgot my Password” link.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Once I’ve clicked on this link I want to insert my email and receive a link that redirects me to an app window that allows me to enter a …</span></li></ul></div></article></div></div>

I understand that the <a href="https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/overview">Microsoft MVP process</a> is a bit more transparent and better prescribed.</p><p>But the general question of “how do I become well-respected in my chosen technical specialty” is VERY interesting. Even if you don’t have any aspirations to build a public following, there is tremendous career value in becoming the go-to person within your technical niche.</p><p>The person who everybody on your team comes to with their toughest question about that language or framework. The person who knows where all the bodies are buried in ActiveDirectory or Typescript or DynamoDB. Those folks have great careers and job security because authoritative knowledge like that is rare.</p><p>To some extent, it’s rare because wisdom only comes with experience. But I know plenty of engineers who’ve sat in the same chair for ten years getting the same year of experience ten times. Heck, I’ve been there myself; I spent a couple of years as an “accidental DBA” who never really learned that much about SQL Server beyond what the daily firefighting required.</p><p>I used to spend a lot of time wondering how other people seemed to level up so quickly on new technologies. How do you break through that stagnant cycle of learning and forgetting stuff in bits and pieces, using the same technology for years without ever feeling like an expert?</p><p>A few years ago I learned a secret for doing this, a cheat code if you will, from my fellow AWS Hero <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/author/jared-short">Jared Short</a>. This is his secret recipe for leveling up in tech:</p><p><strong>Read the documentation for one job-relevant technology, cover-to-cover, every week. </strong></p><figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Forrest is giving away my secrets, but it's true. I'd estimate around 700+ hours of just reading AWS docs over my career with intent to retain / learn (not just reference).

It’s the classic kiss-off answer to questions you ought to be able to Google.</p><p>And that betrays a key limitation in how a lot of us think about documentation. We think of it tactically, as a resource to query when we have a specific question or encounter a particular error. We use docs to fill in our <em>known unknowns.</em></p><p>That’s how you can get stuck for years, say, administering a PostgresSQL cluster and never really becoming that deep of an expert on Postgres. If you only learn something new when the situation demands it, your mental model of Postgres (or whatever) will look like a gradually expanding version of this:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2181" height="1647" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png" alt="" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png 2181w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png 1024w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png 768w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png 1536w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2181px) 100vw, 2181px"></figure><p>Over time, as you encounter more new use cases for the technology, you’ll burn more “never forget” bubbles into the mental model. But you’ll still have this heavy sense of unknown unknowns hanging over you, and you’ll never be sure if you’re really using the optimal approach to solve a new problem.</p><p>Instead, Jared’s approach is to read docs strategically<em>, </em>preemptively, curiously: as a way to fill in your <em>unknown unknowns</em>. The things you might not encounter in ten years, but that would cost you two days of troubleshooting if you ran into them tomorrow.</p><p>Read docs like novels (cover to cover), not like dictionaries (look up the term, cross-reference, and stop). Over time, that strategy will lead to a mental model of your professional domain that looks more like this:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="727" height="549" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/strategic.png" alt="" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/strategic.png 727w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/strategic.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 727px) 100vw, 727px"></figure><p>(This is <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/how-many-certifications-do-i-need-to-get-a-cloud-job">the same benefit</a> you get from studying for certifications, by the way: you’re building a mental map of the domain, so you don’t have to stumble through the darkness on every new quest.)</p><p>On the surface, that sounds simple, but it’s far from easy. Here are three common objections people raise when I advise reading docs as a career-advancement strategy:</p><h4 id="h-i-don-t-have-a-photographic-memory-i-ll-never-remember-a-bunch-of-random-docs"><strong>“I don’t have a photographic memory. I’ll never remember a bunch of random docs.”</strong></h4><p>Back when I was in college, a well-meaning friend convinced me I should read a book on SAP. Forget today — I couldn’t have told you a single thing about SAP <em>ten minutes after finishing that book</em>. I’d never been inside an enterprise, much less understood the problems these ERP integrations I was reading about were supposed to solve. It was like trying to talk to the aliens in the movie <em>Arrival</em>: my brain was the wrong shape.</p><p>Likewise, you probably won’t get much value out of glancing through docs for a technology you don’t use and have no context for.</p><p>So do these two things:</p><p>1. <strong>Focus on docs for technologies you are already using</strong>. We’ve all had that mind-numbing feeling when plowing through some esoteric text that doesn’t relate to our daily lives, where you glaze over for three pages and then go, “what did I just read?”</p><p>Avoid this by focusing on docs for technologies or languages you’ve already got a vested stake in – say, because they’re on your plate at work or you’re trying to build them into a side project.</p><p>Encourage active reading and engagement with the information by asking yourself questions like these as you read:</p><ul id="block-ef7bb5e0-252c-434f-98de-116c8c0e2003"><li>Did I understand that? (If not, maybe read the section again)</li><li>Does what I just read match my existing mental model of how this technology works? (If not, do I need to go review a different doc and then come back to this?)</li><li>Could this feature or fact help me on my current project?</li><li>If I had known this six months ago, what would I have done differently? (“Chosen a different technology” is a totally acceptable answer!)</li></ul><p>Then, <strong>2. Read those docs repeatedly, on a schedule, over and over</strong>. Seriously. If you’re on a team that’s building out centralized CI/CD for Azure, maybe read the part of the Azure DevOps docs on pipelines this week and the part on build agents next week, and when you get to the end, start over. The cloud changes fast. You’ll fold in new information at the same time you’re reinforcing the old.</p><h4 id="h-i-don-t-have-time-to-read-a-bunch-of-documentation"><strong>“I don’t have time to read a bunch of documentation.”</strong></h4><p>Yes, and weeks of work can save you hours of planning. Maybe use some of the time you currently spend injecting “HERE” print statements into your code to figure out why it’s not working.</p><figure><img src="https://faasandfurious.com/pages/debugging-tactics.png" alt="Debugging Tactics"></figure><p>More seriously, it’s not a bad idea to block a bit of time on your calendar each day – 30 minutes, even –  for targeted doc-reading. You may find it hard to carve that time out of your workday, but defending time and setting expectations with your manager is its own skill, worth practicing. Call the block of time “deep work.” It is.</p><h4 id="h-the-docs-for-technology-x-are-no-good-trust-me-they-re-not-worth-reading"><strong>“The docs for [technology X] are no good. Trust me, they’re not worth reading.”</strong></h4><p>I don’t always buy this excuse. The docs might not be that bad; you might just have the wrong expectations.</p><p>For example, the AWS documentation gets <a href="https://twitter.com/IanColdwater/status/1347737875991777280">a terrible rap</a> for being wordy and poorly-organized. And it’s maybe even worse than you’ve heard – if you’re trying to look up the name of an IAM action or the syntax of a CLI command, that is.</p><p>But as an educational tool that dives deep on the architectural underpinnings and technical limitations of services, the AWS docs are <em>fantastic. </em>They’re better than any book you could ever buy about the cloud. (And the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/">Builder’s Library</a> is better still.) The AWS docs are designed not just to be referenced, but to be read. Read ’em!</p><p>On the other hand, some types of docs like step-by-step tutorials are very much designed to be referenced during hands-on builder time. It may not make sense to spend a lot of time reading those in the abstract. So bring your common sense.</p><p>However. There are also plenty of technologies out there where the docs are truly incomplete, out of date, or just plain wrong – many smaller open-source projects, in particular.</p><p>Turns out you have another option here, at least for OSS projects: <em>read the source code.</em> Not sure what a module does, what its edge cases are, what the error code means? Read the source code and find out! It might be faster than (and will definitely be at least as accurate as) looking for the answer in the docs, <em>even if the docs are pretty good. </em></p><p>If you write code for a living, reading other people’s shipped, battle-tested code — not just PRs from your own team — is genuinely one of the most transformative things you can do for your career. Because while you’re answering your immediate question, you’ll also be picking up style, organization, and technique from professional programmers operating under all kinds of interesting constraints. Seriously.

<p>GameStop is a US video game and consumer electronics retailer which operates 5000+ stores across the world. Over the past 5 years the company has steady declined as digital downloads of games overtook the purchasing of physical video games as well as the general move to more internet retailing.</p>



<p>As a result, the company suffered declining revenues and profits, exacerbated more recently by the closure of stores due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>As the fortunes of the company declined, some hedge funds took notice and spotted what was to them easy money: bet on further declines in the company and therefore the stock price. Throughout late 2020 they began building short positions in GameStop stock (GME).</p>



<h4>Enter Player 1: The Hedge Funds</h4>



<p>How did hedge funds bet on the decline of GME? The hedge funds borrowed stock (from a bank or broker) then immediately sold this stock. At some point in the future they will be required to return the stock to the lender at which point they simply buy it back, at the now hopefully lower price, and pocket the profit.</p>



<p>For example:</p>



<ul><li>They borrow the stock at $50.</li><li>They then sell it immediately for $50.</li><li>Sometime later, when they are due to return the stock, they buy it in the market for $20 and make $30 profit.</li></ul>



<p>This is called “shorting” and the hedge funds were so sure that GameStop was a lost cause that it quickly became the most shorted stock in the market, in fact so much so that more stock was shorted than the entire GameStop share capital.</p>



<h4>Enter Player 2: The Redditors</h4>



<p>The other player in this game are The Redditors, an internet community that hangs out on Reddit, an online news and discussion forum. One corner of this site, the Wall Street Bets (WSB) forum, has become a noisy outpost for individual investors disgruntled with the way the closed world of Wall Street makes its vast profits at the expense of people like them. It is filled with members posting trading memes and screenshots of their personal trading accounts, often showing large profits or losses – both are seen as a rite of passage.</p>



<p>Towards the end of August 2020 WSB started to take a keen interest in GME. There was talk of a turnaround in the company and this was exacerbated with the news of ex Chewy Inc (an online pet food retailer) CEO Ryan Cohen buying up about 13% of GME. This news, coupled with the WSB dislike for Wall Street (who were now becoming more vocal in expressing how GameStop was a dying business in a dying business sector) resulted in GME becoming a “cult” stock within WSB.</p>



<p>As Wall Street built up huge short positions, individual investors, using mobile apps such as Robinhood, started buying GME stock. In addition, other WSB members, after seeing the huge option profits made during the March 2020 crash, started buying GME call options. Buying options enabled even those with little cash to spare to join the game and also make much larger gains than simply owning the stock.</p>



<p>The game had started: Wall Street vs Main Street. </p>



<h4>Let Play Begin: The Short Squeeze and Gamma Trap</h4>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="332" data-permalink="https://blog.excelpricefeed.com/gme-stock/" data-orig-file="https://excelpricefeed.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/gme-stock.png" data-orig-size="703,405" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="gme-stock" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://excelpricefeed.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/gme-stock.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://excelpricefeed.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/gme-stock.png?w=636" src="https://excelpricefeed.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/gme-stock.png?w=703" alt="" width="705" height="406" srcset="https://excelpricefeed.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/gme-stock.png 703w, https://excelpricefeed.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/gme-stock.png?w=150 150w, https://excelpricefeed.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/gme-stock.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 705px) 100vw, 705px"></figure></div>



<p>During January, the frenzy on WSB increased: members started frantically buying GME stock and GME call options whilst posting more memes and encouragement.</p>



<p>The market makers selling the call options needed to hedge their exposure so bought some GME stock, this is called “delta hedging”. As the stock price increased, the position needed to be re-hedged by buying yet more stock. This is called the “Gamma Trap”.</p>



<p>The hedge funds, with their large short positions, have to pay a fee as well as provide collateral to the lender, in order to borrow stock. As the stock price increased the fees increased and their collateral requirements increased. Some lenders may even ask for their stock back, in which case they would need to buy it from the market, thereby pushing the price up further. This is called the “Short Squeeze”.</p>



<p>As you may have noticed there are multiple feedback loops: As the stock price went up this forced the hedge funds and options market makers to buy more stock, which caused the price to go up even more, which caused them to buy more stock and so on.</p>



<p>The WSB crowd, at the same time, bought more stock and call options. They encouraged each other to hold and not sell up, no matter what happened to the price. Reports of others making huge profits, in the form of screenshots of their stock accounts showing large profits, flooded the forum. This lead to more of them wanting a piece of the action and more buying of stock and calls.</p>



<p>The result of this can be seen in the chart above: the stock price (and volume) erupted during January, rocketing from $17 at the start of the year to over $350 just 3 weeks later.  </p>



<h4>Game Over?</h4>



<p>So, what happens now? As I write, GME was up 134% yesterday and is already up 6.5% in the pre-market this morning:</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="334" data-permalink="https://blog.excelpricefeed.com/gme-stock-price/" data-orig-file="https://excelpricefeed.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/gme-stock-price.png" data-orig-size="425,123" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="gme-stock-price" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://excelpricefeed.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/gme-stock-price.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://excelpricefeed.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/gme-stock-price.png?w=425" src="https://excelpricefeed.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/gme-stock-price.png?w=425" alt="" srcset="https://excelpricefeed.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/gme-stock-price.png 425w, https://excelpricefeed.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/gme-stock-price.png?w=150 150w, https://excelpricefeed.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/gme-stock-price.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px"></figure></div>



<p>WSB is claiming victory over the hedge funds and Wall Street.</p>



<p>Melvin Capital Management is the first victim; a $12b hedge fund that is down 30% this year and was rescued this week with a $2.75b capital injection from other Wall Street players.</p>



<p>The SEC said it was “aware of and actively monitoring the ongoing market volatility in the options and equities markets” and the new Biden administration is “monitoring the situation”.</p>



<p>Will this lead to fundamental market reforms or are we entering a new age of financial power shifting from Wall Street to Main Street?</p>



<p>(PS: whilst writing this article GME has already rose another 20% in the pre-market…).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few months ago, a colleague of mine <a href="https://twitter.com/jfmengels/status/1311940821378387970">wrote this</a> on Slack:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks to elm-review I was able to remove ~7300 lines of code in the front end in 225 different files.
Something I could have never done without its aid. Thank you Jeroen!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also some time ago, I <a href="https://twitter.com/jfmengels/status/1330854406615674883">tweeted this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just cleaned up a lot of Elm code. I wanted to remove our usage of a module that brought no value. Manually removed the main places where it was used and followed the compiler errors. That was about 200 lines.
elm-review took care of the other 2700 lines of the then dead code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For scale, this was on a project of about 170k lines of code. Well, before the code removal. If we take what my colleague did, he was basically able to remove ~5% of the codebase, while touching ~30% of all files.</p>
<p>And <strong>we felt good</strong> about that.</p>
<p>I wanted to break down how <a href="https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/jfmengels/elm-review/latest/"><code>elm-review</code></a>, a static analysis tool for <a href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>, was able to help us remove all this code almost effortlessly in a way that we felt very confident with. Spoiler: It’s because of the lack of side effects in the language.</p>
<p>We are going to compare what code a static analysis tool for a side effect free language (Elm) is able to remove compared to for a dynamic and effectful language (JavaScript).</p>
<h3>Obscurity by impurity</h3>
<p>I’ll take the example of some JavaScript code because that’s another language for which I worked a lot on static analysis.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>formatUserName</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> userInfo <span>=</span> <span>formatUserInfo</span><span>(</span>user<span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> user<span>.</span>name<span>.</span>first <span>+</span> <span>' '</span> <span>+</span> Formatting<span>.</span><span>formatLastName</span><span>(</span>user<span>.</span>name<span>.</span>last<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Did you notice in this example that <code>userInfo</code> was declared but never used? A static analysis tool (or linter if you will) can easily spot that, and it is a very common feature that they provide.</p>
<p>Now what should we do about this unused variable? If we wanted to clean up the excerpt above, the only thing we’d be able to do safely is remove the assignment of <code>formatUserInfo(user)</code> to <code>userInfo</code>, as shown below.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>formatUserName</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>formatUserInfo</span><span>(</span>user<span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> user<span>.</span>name<span>.</span>first <span>+</span> <span>' '</span> <span>+</span> Formatting<span>.</span><span>formatLastName</span><span>(</span>user<span>.</span>name<span>.</span>last<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can’t remove the call to <code>formatUserInfo(user)</code> because we don’t know what it does. Maybe it mutates the <code>user</code> argument or global variables, makes HTTP requests, etc. In this example, I wouldn’t be all <em>that</em> surprised if <code>formatUserInfo</code> would mutate <code>user.name</code> by adding information from other <code>user</code> fields.</p>
<p>Those are called <strong>side effects</strong>: things that a function does in addition to or instead of returning a value. When a function has side effects, we say it is “impure”, and we say it is “pure” if it doesn’t have any.</p>
<p>The tricky thing with side effects is that the surrounding code may rely on those side effects being applied, but there is nothing in the code—that can’t become stale—that indicates that dependency.</p>
<p>If a function is impure, then removing a call to it may change the behavior of the code. That means without knowing whether it is pure or impure, we can’t <strong>safely</strong> remove it. For this article, I’ll consider the removal of code “safe” if it won’t change the behavior of the code or introduce compiler errors.</p>
<p>A smart static analysis tool could try to inspect <code>formatUserInfo</code> to see if it has side effects, but that can get very hairy. In some cases, it will even be outright impossible because of the inherent limitations of a static analysis tool on a dynamic language.</p>
<p>The more dynamic a language gets and the more it allows for side effects, the harder it will be for a static analysis tool to do an accurate analysis and reduce false positives and false negatives.</p>
<p>Here is an incomplete list of JavaScript features that make it hard to predict what the code will do:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval"><code>eval</code> function</a> allows executing non-sandboxed arbitrary JavaScript contained in a string.</li>
<li>Through <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get">getters</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set">setters</a>, even an expression as simple as <code>a.b</code> can have side effects.</li>
<li>Through changing the prototype of specific or core types, even standardized functions that are considered pure can become impure. This is actually a security issue and one of the reasons you get so many <code>dependabot issues</code> to bump <a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-LODASH-608086">dependencies with vulnerabilities</a>.</li>
<li>Through macros (using Webpack or Babel for instance), the code may be transformed in unknown ways. In some cases, the tool won’t be able to parse the untransformed code.</li>
<li>Through dynamic imports (<code>require</code> or dynamic HTML script tags), arbitrary code—that the tool may not even have access to—can be imported and executed, potentially applying one of the features listed above.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Clarity by purity</h3>
<p>In Elm, you only have <strong>pure</strong> functions. Meaning that there is no observable difference between calling a function and not using the result, and not calling it at all.</p>
<p>In Elm, the previous uncleaned code snippet would translate to this:</p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>formatUserName</span> <span>user</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>let</span>
    <span>userInfo</span> <span>=</span> <span>formatUserInfo</span> <span>user</span>
  <span>in</span>
  <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>.</span><span>first</span> <span>++</span> <span>" "</span> <span>++</span> <span>Formatting.formatLastName</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>.</span><span>last</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here we could <strong>safely</strong>—without changing the behavior of the program—report that the whole declaration of <code>userInfo</code> can be removed, the call to <code>formatUserInfo</code> included, and propose to automatically fix it.</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://jfmengels.net/static/c63c27c71df8f649a59379845141efa1/a0209/step1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
  
  <span>
    <span>
      <img alt="elm-review reporting the unused variable and proposing a fix" title="" src="https://jfmengels.net/static/c63c27c71df8f649a59379845141efa1/a0209/step1.png" srcset="https://jfmengels.net/static/c63c27c71df8f649a59379845141efa1/4dcb9/step1.png 188w,

https://jfmengels.net/static/c63c27c71df8f649a59379845141efa1/a0209/step1.png 725w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px">
    </span>
  </span>
  
  </a>
    </p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>formatUserName</span> <span>user</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>.</span><span>first</span> <span>++</span> <span>" "</span> <span>++</span> <span>Formatting.formatLastName</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>.</span><span>last</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Why was the value unused? Either it lost its purpose at some point yet wasn’t cleaned up, or this might be a bug lying around because it needed to be used somewhere but the developer who wrote/changed the code forgot to. Without talking to the developers directly we can’t know in which situation we are in, and whether the value should be used or removed.</p>
<p>For that reason, when <code>elm-review</code> analyzes the code and it has been run with <code>--fix</code>, it will ask the user for confirmation before applying the suggested fix of removing the variable. Every <code>elm-review</code> fix proposal requires an approval from the user before it gets committed to the file system.</p>
<p>There is a way to batch them to avoid having the process be too tedious though, which I find people start to use after the tool has gained their trust.</p>
<h3>What more can we find?</h3>
<p>In the rest of the article, I will refer to the change we did previously as step 1.</p>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>In JavaScript-land, we would have had to keep the call to <code>formatUserInfo</code>, but in Elm-land, we were able to remove it. That allows us to do one more thing: check whether <code>formatUserInfo</code> is ever used anywhere else.</p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>SomeModule</span> <span>exposing</span> <span>(</span><span>formatUserName</span><span>)</span>
<span>
<span>import</span> Formatting</span>

<span>formatUserName</span> <span>user</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>.</span><span>first</span> <span>++</span> <span>" "</span> <span>++</span> <span>Formatting.formatLastName</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>.</span><span>last</span>

<span>formatUserInfo</span> <span>user</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>{</span> <span>role</span> <span>=</span> <span>Formatting.formatRole</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>role</span>
  <span>,</span> <span>description</span> <span>=</span> <span>String.trim</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>description</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When we look at this module, it seems that <code>formatUserInfo</code> is never used in any way: It is not exposed to the other modules nor is it used in any of the other functions. So we can safely remove it too!</p>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Let’s look at the <code>Formatting</code> module, whose import we just removed.</p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>Formatting</span> <span>exposing</span> <span>(</span><span>formatLastName</span><span>,</span> <span>formatRole</span><span>)</span>

<p><code>elm-review</code> rules have the ability to look at all modules of a project before reporting errors. This makes it immensively more powerful than static analysis tools that only look at a single module at a time (like <code>elm-review</code> did originally, which I can tell you was very frustrating as a rule author). This approach allows us to report things about a module based on how it is used in other modules.</p>
<p>In this case, a different rule named <a href="https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/jfmengels/elm-review-unused/latest/NoUnused-Exports"><code>NoUnused.Exports</code></a> (previously we were using the <a href="https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/jfmengels/elm-review-unused/latest/NoUnused-Variables"><code>NoUnused.Variables</code></a> rule) will report that <code>formatRole</code> is exposed as part of the module’s API but never used in other modules, <code>SomeModule</code> being the only module in the entire codebase where it was referenced. Since it’s not used anywhere in the project outside of this module, we can safely stop exposing it from the module.</p>
<p>Note that if this was some kind of utility module that you <em>really</em> wanted to keep as is, you could disable this particular rule for that file. Also this rule does not report functions exposed as part of the public API of an Elm package, no worries there.</p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>Formatting</span> <span>exposing</span> <span>(</span><span>formatLastName</span><span>,</span> <span>formatRole</span><span>)</span>

    </p>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Now it looks like <code>formatRole</code> was not used internally inside the <code>Formatting</code> module either, so we can remove it entirely just like we did for <code>formatUserInfo</code> back in step 2.</p>

  </span>
  
  </a>
    </p>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p><code>formatRole</code> was using the <code>SnakeCase</code> variant of <code>Capitalization</code> and that was the only location where that variant was ever created. If that variant is never created, we have no need to handle it.</p>
<p>For those not familiar with custom types (aka “union types” aka “algebraic data types”) but familiar with JavaScript, they allow you to list all the discrete values that something can have. When used in a <code>case</code> expression (roughly equivalent to a <code>switch</code> in JavaScript), the compiler can determine whether you have handled all possible values and remind you when you haven’t, removing the need to add a default case.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>applyFormatting</span><span>(</span><span>formatting<span>,</span> string</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>switch</span> <span>(</span>formatting<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>"AllCaps"</span><span>:</span> 
    <span>case</span> <span>"SnakeCase"</span><span>:</span> 
    <span>default</span><span>:</span> 
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>

    <span>
      <img alt="elm-review reporting unused custom type variant" title="" src="https://jfmengels.net/static/d16ae2faaa9f5e2b89407fcf44dadf75/c54b3/step5.png" srcset="https://jfmengels.net/static/d16ae2faaa9f5e2b89407fcf44dadf75/4dcb9/step5.png 188w,

    </span>
  </span>
  
  </a>
    </p>
<p>This is the first case where an automatic fix is not offered, because we will need to remove the variant both in the custom type definition and in the different patterns, potentially in multiple files. In this case, it’s safer to let the user remove the definition themselves and let the Elm compiler help them fix all the compiler errors that causes.</p>
<p>A tool could potentially do it, but at least for now, <code>elm-review</code> doesn’t. This is how the user would likely remove the …</p></div></div>

</p><h2>FAQ: How do I choose a good password or phrase?</h2>
 
ANS: Shocking nonsense makes the most sense
 <p>
	With the intrinsic strength of some of the modern 
encryption, authentication, and message digest algorithms such as 
RSA, MD5, SHS and IDEA the user password or phrase is becoming 
more and more the focus of vulnerability.
 </p><p>
	For example, Deputy Ponder with the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department admitted in early 1993 that both they and the 
FBI despaired of breaking the PGP 1.0 system except through a 
successful dictionary attack (trying many possible passwords or 
phrases from lists of probable choices and their variations) 
rather than "breaking" the underlying cryptographic algorithm 
mathematically.
</p><p> 
	The fundamental reason why attacking or trying to guess the 
user's password or phrase will increasingly be the focus of 
cryptanalysis is that the user's choice of password may represent 
a much simpler cryptographic key than optimal for the encryption 
algorithm being used. This weakness of the user's password choice 
provides the potential cryptanalytic wedge.
</p><p> 
	For example, suppose a user chooses the password 'david.' On 
the surface the entropy of this key (or the number of different 
equiprobable key states) appears to be five characters chosen from 
a set of twenty-six with replacements: 26^5 or 1.188 x 10^7. But 
since the user is apparently biased toward common given names, 
which a majority appear in lists numbering only 6,000-7,000 
entries, the true entropy is undoubtedly much closer to 6.5 x 
10^3, or about four orders of magnitude smaller than the raw 
length might suggest. (In fact this password probably possesses a 
much smaller entropy than even this for the very common name 
"david" would be one of the first names to be checked by an 
optimized dictionary attack program.)
</p><p> 
	In other words the "entropy" of a keyspace is not a fixed 
physical quantity: the cryptanalyst can exploit whole cultural 
biases and contexts, not just byte frequencies, digraphs, or even 
whole-word correlations to reduce the key space he or she is 
trying to explore.
</p><p> 
	To thwart this avenue of attack we would like to discover a 
method of selecting passwords or phrases that have at least as 
many bits of entropy (or "hard-to-guessness") as the entropy of 
the cryptographic key of the underlying algorithm being used.
</p><p> 
	To compare, DES (Data Encryption Standard) is believed to 
have about 54-55 bits (~4 x 10 ^16) of entropy while the IDEA 
algorithm is believed to have about 128 bits (~3.5 x 10^38) of 
entropy. The closer the entropy of the user's password or phrase 
is to the intrinsic entropy of the cryptographic key of the 
underlying algorithm being used, the more likely an attacker would 
need to search a substantially larger portion of the algorithm's 
key space in order to rediscover the key.
</p><p> 
	Unfortunately many documents suggest choosing passwords or 
phrases that are distinctly inferior to the latest method. For 
example, one white paper widely archived on the internet suggests 
selecting an original password by constructing an acronym from a 
popular song lyric or from a line of script from, for example, the 
SF movie "Star Wars". Both of these ideas turn out to be weak 
because both the entire script to Stars Wars and entire sets of 
song lyrics to thousands of popular songs are available on-line to 
everyone and, in some cases, are already embedded into "crack" 
dictionary attack programs (See <a href="ftp://ftp.uwp.edu/">ftp.uwp.edu</a>).
</p><p> 
	However, the conflict between choosing an easy-to-remember 
key and choosing a key with a high level of entropy is not a 
hopeless task if we exploit mnemonic devices that have been used 
for a long time outside the field of cryptography. With the goal 
of making up a passphrase not included in any existing corpus yet 
very easy to remember, an effective technique is one known as 
"shocking nonsense."
</p><p> 
	"Shocking nonsense" means to make up a short phrase or 
sentence that is both nonsensical and shocking in the culture of 
the user, that is, it contains grossly obscene, racist, impossible 
or other extreme juxtaposition of ideas. This technique is 
permissable because the passphrase, by its nature, is never revealed to 
anyone with sensibilities to be offended.
</p><p> 
	Shocking nonsense is unlikely to be duplicated anywhere 
because it does not describe a matter-of-fact that could be 
accidentally rediscovered by anyone else and the emotional 
evocation makes it difficult for the creator to forget. A mild 
example of such shocking nonsense might be: "mollusks peck my 
galloping genitals ." The reader can undoubtedly make up many far 
more shocking or entertaining examples for himself or herself.
</p><p> 
	Even relatively short phrases offer acceptable entropy 
because the far larger "alphabet" pool of word symbols that may be 
chosen than the 26 characters that form the Roman alphabet. Even 
choosing from a vocabulary of a few thousand words a five word 
phrase might have on the order of 58 to 60 bits of entropy -- more 
than what is needed for the DES algorithm, for example.
</p><p> 
	When you are permitted to use passphrases of arbitrary 
length (in PGP for example) it is not necessary to further perturb 
your 'shocking nonsense' passphrase to include numbers or special 
symbols because the pool of word choices is already very high. Not 
needing those special symbols or numbers (that are not 
intrinsically meaningful) makes the shocking nonsense passphrase 
that much easier to remember.
</p><p> 
	If you are forced to use, say, a Unix password utility that 
permits only passwords of restricted length, one good strategy is 
to process a your secret passphrase using MD5 or SHA, then 
<code>UUENCODE</code> the result and select your shorter key from the output.
See Appendix <a href="#appendixC">C</a> and <a href="#appendixD">D</a> for actual MD5 and SHA source implmentations.

 
</p><h2><a name="appendixA">Appendix A.</a>  For software developers</h2>
 
	For software developers designing "front-ends" or user 
interfaces to conventional short-password applications, very good 
results will come from permitting the user arbitrary length 
passphrases that are then "crunched" or processed using a strong 
digest algorithm such as the 160-bit SHS (Secure Hash Standard) or 
the 128-bit MD5 (Message Digest rev.5).[See following Appendices] 
The interface program then chooses the appropriate number of bits 
from the digest and supplies them to the engine enforcing a short 
password. This 'key crunching' technique will assure the developer 
that even the short password key space will have a far greater 
opportunity of being fully exploited by the user.
<p> 
   John Kelsey writes:<br>
	"I think it's a really good idea to use a randomly-generated 
salt to generate a key from a password, and that this salt should 
be as large as possible. Basically, this is to keep an attacker 
from spending lots of computer power <strong>once</strong> to generate a 
dictionary of likely keys.  If users use good techniques to choose 
passwords, this won't matter much, but if they don't, this may 
save them from having their encrypted files or transmissions 
routinely read.  The simplest scheme I can see for this is simply 
to prepend a 128-bit salt (generated as strongly as possible) to 
each encrypted file.  Generate the key from the password by pre-filling 
a buffer with the 128-bit salt, then XORing in the keyed-in 
password, or by appending the key to the keyed-in password.  
Then, run SHA or MD5 or whatever to get the key.<br>
   A secondary point:  Adding a random salt ensures that people 
who use the same password/passphrase for lots of 
files/transmissions don't get the same key every time.  Since most 
successful attacks against modern encryption schemes use <strong>lots</strong> of 
ciphertext from the same key, this might add some practical 
security, at relatively low cost."<br>
   --John Kelsey, <em>c445585@mizzou1.missouri.edu</em>
 
 
</p><h2>Appendix B. A tool to experimentally investigate entropy</h2>
 
	A practical Unix tool for investigating the entropy of 
typical user keys can be found in Wu and Manber's 'agrep' 
(approximate grep) similarity pattern matching tool available in C 
source from <a href="ftp://cs.arizona.edu/agrep">cs.arizona.edu</a> [192.12.69.5]. This tool can determine 
the "edit distance," that is, the number of insertions, 
substitutions, or deletions that would be required of an arbitrary 
pattern in order for it to match any of a large corpus of words or 
phrases, say the usr/dict word list, or over the set of Star Trek 
trivia archives. The user can then adjust the pattern to give an 
arbitrary high threshold difference between it and common words 
and phrases in the corpus to make crack programs that 
systematically vary known strings less likely to succeed. It is 
often surprising to discover that a substring pattern like 
"hxirtes" is only of edit distance two from as many as forty 
separate words ranging from "bushfires" to "whitest." Certainly no 
password or phrase ought to be chosen as a working password or 
phrase that is within two or fewer edit distance from a known 
string or substring in any on-line collection.

        <section>
            <div><p>The first rule of getting to speak at <a href="https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events">KubeCon</a> is that there are no rules. The event has grown to such a scale that hundreds of top-quality submissions will fall through the cracks. Here's how you can stand a better chance of getting to speak.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whilst I am a <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/joining-the-cncf-ambassadors/">CNCF Ambassador</a>, this advice is based upon my experience and should be considered as <em>opinion</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="amethod">A method</h2>
<p>This post is based upon my flowchart below, with additional ideas and context along the way.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/01/talks.png" alt="talks"></p>
<p>Without giving the game away, speaking at an event at or around the same time as KubeCon can have just as much impact and relevance as having a talk on the main schedule.</p>
<h2 id="1submittothecfp">1) Submit to the CfP</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Keep an eye out for when the CfP opens<br>
There is no first-come-first-served rule, but getting organised early means that you can plan instead of rushing at the last minute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>KubeCon isn't just about Kubernetes<br>
You could be forgiven that <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> is the only topic people want to hear about, but the event is usually called "KubeCon + CloudNativeCon" and is hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). The CNCF represents and hosts <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/">a whole landscape</a> of projects, tools, and vendors who are working to solve tech problems.<br>
This means your talk on running <a href="https://containerd.io/">containerd</a> in production at scale should be as likely to be accepted, as one on how to extend Kubernetes access control through Rust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read the general guidelines<br>
If you don't read the guidelines, it's possible that your paper will be rejected immediately. This includes picking the correct track for the talk. Don't submit more papers than are allowed. I find it useful to go through a dummy submission until the last page to record all the questions I need to fill out and then click back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't submit old talks<br>
This may sound obvious, but it's a good way to get an instant rejection. Now I have seen some people have success with this, doing the same talk on a tour, but it's risky. Reviewers sometimes search Google and YouTube to check whether this is a repeat submission. Original content will be a safer bet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Full talk or lightning talk?<br>
If you're not sure if you want to give a 30m talk, there are also lightning talks available which you can use to introduce a new idea or to summarise your experience in an area. Don't be fooled, less time does not mean easier. You can watch past talks for ideas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think about co-speaking<br>
You can co-speak with a customer, a user, a friend, a colleague, or even someone from a competing company or OSS project to make things interesting. If you decide to go this route, make sure that it's obvious what both speakers bring and avoid doing two separate 15 minute segments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start a Google Doc<br>
You can share this easily with almost anyone to get feedback. Write down your raw ideas and make sure you think about all the questions you saw in the submission guidelines: track, topic, how your talk could benefit the ecosystem, are you a first-time speaker?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pick the right track and read the guidelines<br>
If you have a great talk idea, but submit to the wrong track, it may get rejected without further thought. Some reviewers have 100-200 papers to go through and rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make the CfP easy to digest<br>
Your first sentence is where you can make an impact. Given how busy and rushed the reviewers are, help them. Write in bullets or short paragraphs. What is the highlight? What is the problem being solved?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can't think of anything to speak on, then take a look through past talks and videos for ideas. I think that end-user / production stories can be interesting in a track and that they bring balance to pure tech talks.</p>
<h2 id="2waittogetaccepted">2) Wait to get accepted</h2>
<p>If your talk gets accepted then many congratulations to you. You now need to practice, practice, practice. There's nothing worse than hitting the end of your slot without finishing your talk, or having a pivotal demo crash mid-flow. They say that Prior Preparation Prevents Poor Performance, but at the same time, don't overdo it.</p>
<p>Something which you not have done before is promoting your talk ahead of the event. There is usually an embargo of a few days before you're allowed to share about the talk being accepted. Once past this date, you can Tweet, write a blog post like "Meet me at KubeCon" and even start to share some of the ideas and the URL to your talk. Maybe set it as your Twitter and GitHub bio link? In this time you can reach out to people you'd like to see at your event and ask them to bookmark or save it into their agenda.</p>

<p>Last November I was fortunate enough to speak during the week of KubeCon in San Diego.

<p>So if you didn't get the talk accepted, then try not to take it to heart. This is always going to be a disappointing experience and that is understandable. The competition is very tough and there are many factors at play.</p>
<h2 id="3submittoazerodayevent">3) Submit to a zero-day event</h2>
<p>The Zero Day events happen on the day before the opening keynotes. In my opinion these special-interest events can be a better place to speak than a talk at the main event.</p>
<p>Here's a list of colocated-events:</p>
<p><a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/program/colocated-events">https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/program/colocated-events</a></p>
<p>As you can see, some have their own CfPs and are great for those who have a special interest, for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Serverless Practioners Summit</li>
<li>ServiceMeshCon</li>
<li>Observability Summit</li>
<li>Network Service Mesh</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all events are created equal, but they are all in competition for talk submissions and tickets, so you have a much better chance to get something accepted, and <strong>these CfPs do not count torwards your KubeCon talk count</strong>.</p>
<p>The CfPs generally open a couple of days <strong>after</strong> the KubeCon accept/reject emails go out, so again, be ready and prepare your Google Doc. Day Zero events are not usually free, but have a nominal fee, which is often waived for accepted speakers or organisers.</p>
<h2 id="4stillnoluck">4) Still no luck?</h2>
<p>If you're beginning to feel like a reject now, please do not. There's so many factors that can end up with great, experienced speakers, or amazing technology talks not getting into a schedule.</p>
<p>Try the Cloud Native Rejekts event. It is run by the folks at <a href="https://kinvolk.io/">Kinvolk</a>, a Linux technology company. Kinvolk started the event for the first time for KubeCon Barcelona and will be running their third event for Amsterdam in March.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/blixtra?lang=en">Chris Kühl</a> who organises the event with his team gave a great podcast interview on Kubernetes Weekly: <a href="https://kubernetespodcast.com/episode/079-cloud-native-rejekts/">Cloud Native Rejekts, with Chris Kühl</a></p>
<h2 id="5waitdontgiveup">5) Wait, don't give up</h2>
<p>If you're really determined there's still a couple of options for you.</p>
<p>Quite often the towns that host a KubeCon event like Austin, Amsterdam, San Diego and Barcelona have their own tech meet-up groups who would probably love to hear from you and may be running an event during the KubeCon week.</p>
<ul>
<li>Google for "Amsterdam Meetup" + Kubernetes/Docker/Cloud Native</li>
<li>Try to find the organiser on Twitter, reach out and say that you'd like to be involved, share your Google Doc</li>
</ul>
<p>Speaking at a meet-up can be a great way to connect and network with a receptive audience.</p>
<h2 id="6theresmorefishinthesea">6) There's more fish in the sea</h2>
<p>If you got to 6) and you still don't have a speaking slot, then I feel for you. It can be very frustrating whether you're starting out, or a seasoned pro. There are more fish in the sea, and maybe you can find an event that would be more receptive and appreciative of your talk.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tweet about your talk idea and ask if anyone knows of a good meet-up or event you could speak at</li>
<li>Write-up the talk as a blog post to see if it has traction</li>
<li>Record your own YouTube video and share that on Hacker News / Twitter, or with the CNCF Ambassadors group</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="youhavelandedatalknowwhat">You have landed a talk, now what?</h2>
<p>Here's my favourite book on public speaking. Now we know that this is not a TED talk, but in my experience, the lessons apply just as well.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BRYDKM8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00BRYDKM8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=alexellisuk-20&amp;linkId=5c1cdeaa7db8e897c70c22f99795bf2e">How to Deliver a Great TED Talk: Presentation Secrets of the World's Best Speakers (How to Give a TED Talk Book 1)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>My rules of thumb for a tech talk:</p>
<ul>
<li>Practice, practice, practice - recording to time and include all your demos</li>
<li>Ask for feedback from people who will give you an honest answer</li>
<li>Always begin with some context / a story / an anecdote</li>
<li>Rule of thumb on number of slides - max 1 slide per minute</li>
<li>Deduct time for each demo you do</li>
</ul>
<p>Making it count</p>
<ul>
<li>If using statistics, call out what that means. "this project has 40k stars" sounds impressive, but  is hard to visualise. What about, "this project now has 40k stars which means it's been growing at a rate of almost 1000 stars per week for the last year"?</li>
<li>Keep text on slides to an absolute minimum. Your slides do not need to speak for themselves or stand-alone, they are a communication mechanism.</li>
<li>Use lots of diagrams, draw your own with <a href="https://draw.io/">https://draw.io/</a> - make them clear with large text</li>
<li>Why are you showing each demo, what is the take-away? What value are you trying to demonstrate?</li>
</ul>
<p>Wrapping up</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a conclusion at the end with a practical application</li>
<li>Give a call to action showing the audience how to take things further</li>
<li>Do promote your talk and let people know that you're going to speak. People can save the session in their agenda from the moment the schedule is published. If you have friends with companies and OSS projects, they may also include your talk on their "meet us at KubeCon" blog post, if you plan ahead and ask nicely.</li>
</ul>
<p>One final recommendation: skip the "a little bit about me" slide. Paraphrased from the book: nobody cares about <em>you</em> or will remember <em>you</em>, they are here to hear about the talk topic. In the worst case you might lose your audience from the offset. Some of you have been doing this for your whole speaking career, and haven't realised how detrimental it has been.</p>
<h2 id="signingoff">Signing-off</h2>
<p>Good luck with your submissions. You can contact me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/alexellisuk/">@alexellisuk</a>. Have you got any tips you'd like to share? You don't have to give <em>all your secrets away</em>, but perhaps you've got one or two pointers that have worked out well for you in the past?</p>

</p><p>
According to the research paper carried by bioRxiv, the preprint server for biology, the study has dispelled the uncertainty of possible neutralization escape.
</p><p>
    A group of researchers from Indian Council of Medical Research(ICMR), National Institute of Virology, Pune and Bharat Biotech performed the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT50) using sera collected from the 26 recipients of BBV152/Covaxin against hCoV-19/India/20203522 (UK-variant) and hCoV27 19/India/2020Q111 (heterologous strain).
</p><p>"A comparable neutralization activity of sera of the vaccinated individuals showed against UK-variant and the heterologous strain with similar efficiency, dispel the uncertainty of possible neutralization escape," says the paper, yet to be certified by peer review.
</p><p>
    It noted the rapid surge inSARS-CoV-2 cases due to UK variant raised concerns in several countries. Many of these countries had direct flights to and from UK and the variant was associated with high transmissibility. Identification of other variants from South Africa also initiated a global discussion on the challenges that these new variants could pose to the current vaccine candidates.
</p><p>
The genome of the UK-variant has 17 mutations, eight of which were found in spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) mediating the attachment of the virus to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the surface of human cells. Therefore, it appeared that the majority of the vaccine candidates, being either recombinant or specifically targeting the single epitope of original D614G ancestral spike sequence, might not be able to generate an efficient immune response against the new variants.
</p><p><span>Advertisement</span></p><figure><div></div></figure><hr><p>"Here, we successfully isolated and characterized the hCoV-19/India/20203522 SARS-CoV-2 (VOC) 202012/01 from UK returnees in India with all signature mutations of the UK-variant," it added.
</p><p>
The new finding has come close on the heels of prestigious medical journal The Lancet Infectious Disease publishing phase-1 clinical trials studies of Covaxin.
</p><p>
    According to the journal, the vaccine produced tolerable safety outcomes and enhanced immune responses in its phase 1 trials.
</p><p>Bharat Biotech said this is the first clinical trial publication on a Covid-19 vaccine from India.
</p><p>
    The developments came amid controversy over efficacy of Covaxin, whose phase 3 trials are still underway.
</p><p>
Covaxin is being administered in India in clinical trial mode as part of the nation-wide vaccination programme launched for healthcare workers on January 16.
</p><p>The vaccine maker on January 22 announced that 13,000 volunteers have been successfully administered the second dose of Covaxin in the phase-3 trials.
</p><p>
The phase-3 human clinical trials of Covaxin began mid-November, targeted to be done in 26,000 volunteers across India.
</p><p>
    Covaxin is a highly purified and inactivated 2 dose SARS-CoV2 vaccine, manufactured in a Vero cell manufacturing platform with an excellent safety track record of more than 300 million doses.
</p><p>India's first indigenous Covid-19 vaccine by Bharat Biotech is developed in collaboration with ICMR - NIV.

January 28, 2021 | https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>Continuing my search for a better debugging experience for my current projects (zig/c, nixos). </p>
<p>The <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger/">first post</a> resulted in a ton of suggestions and I tried them all.</p>
<h2 id="gdb-tui-again">gdb -tui (again)</h2>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25407161">taviso explained</a> how to use the tui properly. </p>
<p>C-l fixes the display and using <code>gdb -tty $SOME_OTHER_TTY</code> stops it from getting messed up in the first place.</p>
<p>Readline bindings (C-n, C-p etc) work in the command window even while the source window has focus. <code>focus cmd</code> gives focus to the command window so I can use arrow keys again.</p>
<p>C-x A is supposed to toggle the tui but for me just crashes, in both alacritty and xterm. I've <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/106868">reported this against nix</a> for now, since that's the most likely culprit. (EDIT nope, <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/106981">it was a gdb bug</a>).</p>
<h2 id="emacs-gdb">emacs gdb</h2>
<p>Many people suggested using <code>gdb</code> and <code>gdb-many-windows</code> instead of <code>gud</code>. </p>
<p>This is much better - I get a clickable thread list, backtrace and locals list.</p>
<p><img src="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/emacs.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It displays all my locals as "&lt;complex data type&gt;" which is not super helpful. There is a <a href="https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=34589">patch</a> to improve this but it looks like it got delayed by legal issues.</p>
<h2 id="emacs-dap-mode">emacs dap-mode</h2>
<p>For gdb this <a href="https://emacs-lsp.github.io/dap-mode/page/configuration/#native-debug-gdblldb">requires</a> the vscode extension which I couldn't get working in the last post, so I haven't investigated further.</p>
<h2 id="clion-again">clion (again)</h2>
<p>Kaylee Blake emailed me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Several of the issues you encountered with CLion are ones I have previously encountered, and thankfully two of them are solvable and one can be worked around. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Your variables are (probably) not being displayed because CLion leans on its language support for computing precise start-of-scope for variables (GDB doesn't support this DWARF feature, sadly), but unfortunately defaults to assuming that variables are always out of scope if its language support isn't capable of mapping debug symbols to declarations. (It appears that the Zig plugin doesn't have any debugger integration). As such, you need to click on the gear icon on the left of the debug pane (in your screenshot, hidden behind a <code>&gt;&gt;</code> symbol at the bottom), and uncheck "Hide out-of-scope variables".</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To use the Memory View, you need to right-click on any variable and choose "Show in Memory View", which will actually cause the pane to load. I have no idea why this is required given that the Memory View is perfectly capable of navigating to raw addresses or addresses computed by arbitrary expressions once the pane has loaded.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You (probably) can't set breakpoints through the UI because the Zig plugin doesn't register the Zig filetype as capable of having breakpoints set on it. There's no way to fix this without writing a plugin, unfortunately, but you can still use the GDB console to set breakpoints. They won't persist between sessions, though, or show up in the UI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both of the fixes worked. I can now see variables and open them in the memory view.</p>
<p><img src="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/clion.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The memory view doesn't support editing memory, but I can still do that in the gdb console.</p>
<p>I added <code>*actual.items.ptr@100</code> to the watches list and it rendered the whole array perfectly happily.</p>
<p>Setting breakpoints in the gdb console seemed to work at first, but restarting the program to get to the breakpoint doesn't. If I rerun using the button in the debugger, the breakpoints disappear. If I try to restart the program from within gdb, it crashes:</p>
<pre><code><span>(gdb) info breakpoints
No breakpoints or watchpoints.
(gdb) b Tree.searchForwards
Breakpoint 1 at 0x207222: file /home/jamie/focus/lib/focus/tree.zig, line 591.
(gdb) run
Command 'run' is not supported.
(gdb) start
The program being debugged has been started already.
Start it from the beginning? (y or n) [answered Y; input not from terminal]
Temporary breakpoint 2 at 0x2097dc: file /nix/store/5g4w66g606d46w8pmzwzq7flrlk3k7cs-zig/lib/zig/std/start.zig, line 243.
Starting program: /home/jamie/focus/test 1&gt; '/dev/pts/4' 2&gt; '/dev/pts/5' 
During startup program exited with code 1.
</span></code></pre>
<p>I can get this to work by starting the program, immediately pausing, setting a breakpoint and then resuming. </p>
<p>Holding F8 to continue runs smoothly, like most of the other debuggers. But unlike most of the other debuggers the local variables stop being displayed until I release the key, so I can't just watch the changes in real time.</p>
<h2 id="netbeans">netbeans</h2>
<p>I made a new C++ project with the wizard and hit "Debug Main Project". At first I though nothing happened, but after a while I noticed a small red message box at the bottom-right of the screen.</p>
<p><img src="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/netbeans_0.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It's actually bigger when it first appears, but it shrinks after a few seconds of not being noticed.</p>
<p>Anyway:</p>
<p><img src="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/netbeans_1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It says it can't write to /tmp.</p>
<pre><code><span>jamie@machine:~/nixpkgs$ cat &gt; /tmp/test
foo
jamie@machine:~/nixpkgs$ cat /tmp/test
foo
</span></code></pre>
<p>I can write to /tmp.</p>
<p>It also says I should do something like <code>netbeans -J-Dcnd.tmpbase="/home/jamie/netbeans-project"</code>. But that produces the same error message, still referring to "/tmp" rather than the directory I gave it. Did I spell something wrong?</p>
<p>Also:</p>
<pre><code><span>[nix-shell:~]$ strace netbeans 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep 'tmp'

[nix-shell:~]$
</span></code></pre>
<p>It doesn't actually seem to be trying to write "/tmp". It actually doesn't issue any syscalls at all when I press "Debug Main Project" and trigger the message. So I think it's just misreporting some other error. The underlying issue is probably nix-related again.</p>
<p>Also... I try to avoid ranting about software, because software is hard. But if you give me an error message and then make the error text non-selectable and then in the context menu only offer "Mark As Read" instead of "Copy To Clipboard So I Can Google This" then it makes debugging a lot slower.</p>
<h2 id="cgdb">cgdb</h2>
<p>Broadly similar to gdb -tui. It shows the source window and has a lot of useful keyboard shortcuts, but it doesn't display much ambient information like current backtrace or local variables. Everything seems to work, but it's not what I'm looking for.</p>
<h2 id="kdevelop">kdevelop</h2>
<pre><code><span>[nix-shell:~]$ kdevelop --version
kdevelop 5.5.2
</span></code></pre>
<p>Running, breaking, setting watchpoints and navigating the backtrace all worked smoothly.</p>
<p>There doesn't seem to be a memory view or a way to display arbitrary expressions. I tried adding <code>display (*actual.items.ptr)@100</code> in the gdb console and it didn't appear anywhere on screen, nor did it print the result in the console after the first time.</p>
<p>The rendering of large arrays is a bit annoying - you have to click at the beginning to reveal a few more elements, but they appear at the end. So getting the whole thing on screen requires lots of scrolling.</p>
<p>The key binding for 'next' is also in use by kate, so you have to go into the bindings menu and disambiguate. Which wouldn't be a big deal except that it reset several times over the course of a single session so I had to keep visiting the bindings menu.</p>
<h2 id="gdb-dashboard">gdb-dashboard</h2>
<p>An init file for gdb that adds a dashboard, which is printed whenever the program stops and can be hooked to print at other times too.</p>
<p><img src="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/gdb-dashboard.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This is pretty great. It doesn't offer the easy point-and-click of a gui but it does reliably put a bunch of useful context on the screen. And it manages to do that without breaking or hiding basic features of gdb like most of the gui frontends I tried. </p>
<p>I'm still on the lookout for a good gui debugger, but this is what I'll use in the meantime.</p>
<h2 id="voltron">voltron</h2>
<p>Loris Cro suggested voltron which is similar to gdb-dashboard but opens the various view in separate terminals and updates them in real time. This seems like a strict improvement and I really like the idea.</p>
<p>After wading through the usual python dependency management morass, I managed to occasionally run some voltron views but mostly managed to crash it repeatedly, and occasionally gdb too. </p>
<p>(The gdb crashes are in <a href="https://paste.sr.ht/%7Ejamii/ad867039557cc4c6f5ffe22e4f14a0f13fa78c86">somewhere inside printf</a> so this might be the same issue as the tui crash above.) </p>
<h2 id="gdb-frontend">gdb-frontend</h2>
<p>Ilmari Lauhakangas suggested the somewhat generically named gdb-frontend. </p>
<p>If I type the full path in the file picker it pops up "An error has occurred". You have to type the dirname and then pick the file from the list.</p>
<p>When I ran the program it reached the breakpoint and then the UI stopped responding to button clicks and occasionally spat out messages saying the gdb main thread was blocking.</p>
<p>After C-c in terminal it left behind a bunch of ophan gdb processes that prevented gdbfrontend from being restarted.</p>
<h2 id="ddd-again">ddd (again)</h2>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25410215">drosan explained</a> that in ddd the focus follows the mouse which explains why I had trouble typing in the text boxes.</p>
<p>The other bugs I experienced are still blockers though.</p>

<p>Other tools that came up in the conversation:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/hugsy/gef">gef</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg">pwndbg</a> add a bunch of commands to gdb that are useful for low-level debugging and reverse engineering. 
<a href="https://github.com/radareorg/radare2">radare2</a> is an independent set of tools for the same purpose that can optionally connect to gdb. I don't have much use for these at the moment, but it's good to know about them.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeclap.itch.io/codeclap">codeclap</a> looks interesting but is still in alpha and doesn't have a demo.</p>
<p><a href="https://pernos.co/">pernosco</a> is a project I've been keeping an eye on. It's not currently affordable for hobby stuff, but I can certainly imagine paying for it when I start doing commercial work again.</p>
<p><a href="https://frida.re/">frida</a> injects javascript code into binaries. At the very least, this enables post-hoc println debugging. I've put aside a weekend in my calendar to try it out.</p>
<p><a href="https://justine.storage.googleapis.com/blinkenlights/index.html">blinkenlights</a> I think is a way to watch your code execute as directly as possible, so you can build intuition for what is actually happening on the hardware. I tried it out quickly and it rendered a single frame before exiting with code 0. But it's interesting enough that I made a note to come back and try it again next year.</p>
<p>I haven't tried many proprietary options so far. While I have a strong preference for foss tools, I'm open to suggestions for good proprietary tools so long as I can try them out without emailing a sales team for a quote.</p>

January 28, 2021 | https://blog.guillaume-gomez.fr/articles/2021-01-22+Performance+improvement+on+front-end+generated+by+rustdoc | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.guillaume-gomez.fr/articles/2021-01-22+Performance+improvement+on+front-end+generated+by+rustdoc">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>We recently wrote a <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2021/01/15/rustdoc-performance-improvements.html">blog post</a> about the performance improvement in <b>rustdoc</b> (the "back-end"). Now, it's time to talk about performance in the "front-end". As you will see, there is also a lot of things to say.</p>
<h2>Content size vs performance</h2>
<p>Since always, a big "fight" has been taking place in <b>rustdoc</b> between the page rendering speed and the amount of content we want to provide. It reached its highest when the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/51885">Trait impl show docs</a> pull request which added documentation from implemented traits' methods was merged. The size of the HTML pages just became huge (more than 10 MB for some of them), making the web browsers take forever to render them or even crash. Luckily, it was fixed shortly after by <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/61505">#61505</a> which removed most of the newly added content.</p>
<p>As you may have guessed, we also added some minification <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/50632">on JS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/51791">on CSS</a> files whereas we removed <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/d08f8978e7b883cb01ec8f1118b5eeb3ebc94ab4">all uneeded characters like backlines and whitespaces in the HTML</a>. We tried to go <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/56869">even further</a> on the minification but we started to reach the limits.</p>
<p>To help you understand a bit more the problem here: <b>rustdoc</b> front-end provides a small search engine alongside the documentation in plain javascript. But it means that it also provides all the content to perform its search alongside it (in a file called <code>search-index.js</code>). Now, you might wonder why not providing this through a server instead of having it on the browser side? The reason is simple: because for local documentation, it would require to also start a search server, which is an absolute no-go.</p>
<p>However, this search index became a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/56545">huge issue</a> for embedded crates with <b>a lot</b> of items. Luckily, someone suggested to transform this JS index into a JSON one. I gave it a try with not much hopes, and it resulted in one of the biggest performance improvement in <b>rustdoc</b> front-end as you can see <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/71250">here</a>.</p>
<p>I'll quote myself from the first comment in the PR:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Loading a page with the JSON search-index: less than 1 second</li>
<li>Loading a page with the JS search-index: crashed after 30 seconds</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it's explicit enough. :)</p>
<h2>Web browsers API issues</h2>
<p>At some point, some people opened issues about pages that took more than 10 seconds to render. Interestingly enough, I couldn't reproduce their performance issues, even on "less performant" computers. We finally found out that the issue was specific to <b>Google Chrome</b> (maybe even <b>webkit</b>), each explained why I didn't have it since I was only using <b>Firefox</b>. Once I switched web browsers, I was able to reproduce as well, so the bug hunt was finally able to really start.</p>
<p>The problem was that we are looping very often over nodes iterators that you can get from:</p>
<pre><code>let iterator = document.getElementByClassName("some-class");
for (let i = 0; i &lt; iterator.length; ++i) {}</code></pre>
<p>This code looks fine right? And yet, because of that loop, the performance were terribly bad. The issue was not the loop in itself though, but the fact that we were making changes in the DOM, which forced <b>Google Chrome</b> to recompute the node iterators at every change. It's interesting to see that <b>Firefox</b> was almost completely unaffected by this though. Anyway, so how can we iterate over those nodes and update the DOM at the same time? The solution is actually pretty simple:</p>
<pre><code>let iterator = document.getElementByClassName("some-class");
iterator = Array.prototype.slice.call(iterator);
for (let i = 0; i &lt; iterator.length; ++i) {}</code></pre>
<p>In here, we actually transformed the iterator into an array. With this, even if the DOM changes while we iterate over the nodes, it doesn't need to recompute the iterator since we now have what we could call an array of "node reference". Once this was merged, the page rendering speed on <b>Google Chrome</b> got back to normal. This was done in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/56005">#56005</a>. Since we're talking about this pull request, it also brought another big improvement:</p>
<div><h3>Picking the right time to display</h3></div>
<p>By default, all sections' sub-elements are hidden. As surprising as it might sound, if you put a breakpoint at the start of the javascript on a <b>rustdoc</b> page, you'll see very few content. The reason is simple: the browser performs DOM changes much faster when it's not displayed. So the idea is to make all the DOM changes and only then to display the content.</p>
<p>Normally, it's pretty fast, so unless you have a very old computer, you shouldn't be able to see the "loading content..." sentences under the sections.</p>
<h2>Small implementation details</h2>
<p>At this point, <b>rustdoc</b> front-end seems to be fast enough and we didn't receive new issues about performance in quite some time. Since we have an ongoing cleanup in the "back-end", I took this opportunity to clean things a bit in the front-end too. It led to a few small but interesting pull requests:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80515">Improve JS performance by storing length before comparing to it in loops</a>: storing the length in a variable and then compare to this variable has a 3% speed improvement based on <a href="https://jsbench.me/">https://jsbench.me</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80569">Use Array.prototype.filter instead of open-coding</a>: this one is actually pretty impressive: using the <code>filter</code> method instead of the small implementation we had improved the performance (for this loop) by <b>84%</b>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80554">More js cleanup</a>: this one was a mix of small fixes. Nothing transcendant but still nice!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I still think, up to this day, that writing front-end code is one of the most complicated things to do in IT because of the numerous things to take into account. We had to provide some functions in case they didn't exist, we had to take into account some web browser API weirdness (don't get me started about <b>Safari</b> on <b>iOS</b>...).</p>
<p>Overall, I think that <b>rustdoc</b> provides now a front-end with good enough performance to not slow down people reading documentation. The next steps will very likely be on UX and UI. I think that <b>rustdoc</b> still doesn't provide best possible experience and I'd like it to get even better!</p>
<p>One last thing: if you ever encounter any performance issue, please open an issue on <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=&amp;template=blank_issue.md">rust-lang repository</a> so that we can fix it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>More to come soon!</p><p><a href="https://blog.guillaume-gomez.fr/rss" data-tooltip="RSS feed"><img height="35" src="https://blog.guillaume-gomez.fr/blog/feed.svg" alt="RSS feed"></a><a href="https://blog.guillaume-gomez.fr/atom" data-tooltip="Atom feed"><img height="35" src="https://blog.guillaume-gomez.fr/blog/atom-feed.svg" alt="RSS feed"></a></p></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[Simple and Secure VPN in FreeBSD – Introducing WireGuard]]>

<div>
<p><strong>Wireguard is a Virtual Private Network (VPN) technology that aims to enable the easy deployment and configuration of servers and clients. Wireguard is intended to replace the use of IPSec or OpenVPN for many VPN applications.</strong> </p>



<p>Wireguard offers both kernel and userspace implementations. The in-kernel version is faster, but must be customized for each OS, and not every OS supports this yet. The first kernel implementation was offered for Linux, but there is now an in-kernel implementations for FreeBSD, and also one for OpenBSD, with a NetBSD implementation in progress. Wireguard needed crypto primitives that were not present in FreeBSD, having high quality native support required a large amount of work and communication with the upstream Wireguard project. The FreeBSD kernel implementation was written by Matt Macy with sponsorship from NetGate, without this vendor support it is unlikely that a project of this size would have been successful.</p>



<p>The main userspace implementation of wireguard is a golang application and it is available via the wireguard-go tool available in FreeBSD ports.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A wireguard network configuration is formed of interfaces and peers. Each interface is defined by its private key, peers are defined by their public key and the set of addresses they are allowed to use. This forms a network that uses cryptokey routing.</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="3686" data-permalink="https://klarasystems.com/articles/simple-and-secure-vpn-in-freebsd/image-1-2/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/klarasystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.jpeg?fit=468%2C353&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="468,353" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/klarasystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.jpeg?fit=300%2C226&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/klarasystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.jpeg?fit=468%2C353&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" width="468" height="353" src="https://i2.wp.com/klarasystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.jpeg?resize=468%2C353&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/klarasystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.jpeg?w=468&amp;ssl=1 468w, https://i2.wp.com/klarasystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C226&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/klarasystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.jpeg?resize=200%2C150&amp;ssl=1 200w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>With cryptokey routing, hosts are defined by their cryptographic keys, where public keys are used as identifiers. This means that most of the configuration for wireguard requires dealing with these public keys. Wireguard does not specify mechanisms for key distribution and management, and it is fair to compare this with the distribution of ssh keys. Unlike ssh, the public keys need to be available for both sides of the connection.</p>



<p>Wireguard uses INI files for static configuration, a config file might look like:</p>



<pre><code>[Interface]
PrivateKey = EO9b4bV1qg0veyFelERv69v4eamKu/evGZ/Hbiq82Eg=
ListenPort = 51820

[Peer]
PublicKey = ZBF6vo22sBkT0ro/xnlZ0EZsFGTYPTOvY8luFFtJwwk=    
AllowedIPs = 10.10.0.2/32

[Peer]
PublicKey = fnpAo3hMf9UOtPpM+CUtpB+ETvB5XjNLIuTGsX+qnCc
AllowedIPs = 10.10.0.138/32

[Peer]
PublicKey = Tpdhd68aaDAQfNsnqzoViMl1h+yHeYuVZ22xrY1BM0I=
AllowedIPs = 10.10.0.3/32, 192.168.2.1/24
</code></pre>



<p>The allowed IP addresses act as a routing table. When traffic is sent, the packet is compared to the peer’s AllowedIPs, and if it matches the address or the subnet, the packet is encrypted using the peer’s public key and forwarded over the tunnel in its direction.</p>



<p>On receipt of a packet, AllowedIPs acts as a receive filter. The packet is first decrypted and authenticated, and then it is evaluated against the AllowedIPs to verify that it is allowed to enter the network.</p>



<h4><strong>Installation</strong></h4>



<p>Wireguard makes a serious effort to make the tools it offers consistent on all platforms. To do this, there are two components that determine whether the kernel or userspace implementation is used. The first is a method to create a wireguard interface; this is the component that changes between kernel and userspace versions, then there is a single configuration wg(8) tool to manage the VPN.</p>



<p>This approach intends to smooth over platform configuration differences. The platform specific part is creating and configuring the network interface, but the VPN configuration should all be manageable with a single consistent tool.</p>



<p>FreeBSD has an in-kernel implementation of wireguard that landed in the tree in&nbsp;<a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&amp;revision=368163">November 2020</a>. The in-kernel implementation is still very fresh, so in this article we will use the userspace tool, as it is available in the most supported versions of FreeBSD today. The in-kernel implementation key generation is still performed using the wg(8) tool.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We can install wg(8) and wireguard-go (the wireguard userspace implementation) from ports with:</p>



<pre><code># pkg install wireguard wireguard-tools</code></pre>



<h4><strong>Creating Keys</strong></h4>



<p>Our host’s identity is defined by its key pair. We need to generate a wireguard private key using the&nbsp;wg genkey&nbsp;command; wireguard helpfully (if frustratingly) insists that we don’t place the private key in a world readable file. To generate the key and append it to a file, we need to temporally change our umask:</p>



<pre><code># (umask 0077; wg genkey &gt; private.key)
# cat private.key
MOtM8w02ONtGK9vmLCXlx6em+5pRTm6C0z7HCeIrPlY=
</code></pre>



<p>This command creates a private key and places it into a file called private.key. We can view the private key by catting the file; anyone with the private key can act as the server, so you should be very careful with your wireguard private keys. Wireguard tools will typically censor the private key in output unless additional flags are given.&nbsp;</p>



<div data-columns="3" data-layout="50-25-25"><div>




<div><div>
<p>Did you know?</p>



<h2>You can maximize the <strong>power of your FreeBSD</strong> infrastructure with our <strong>Support Subscription!</strong></h2>




</div></div>




</div></div>



<p>Wireguard uses our public key as our identity, wg(8) will show us the public key for a private key with the&nbsp;<em>wg pubkeycommand</em>:</p>



<pre><code># wg pubkey &lt; private.key
APWANIrAD3drcSNUdDuUuXLsCRksKxuQxwBHf56UxiM=
</code></pre>



<h4><strong>Server Side</strong></h4>



<p>First, let’s configure our server side. The server is going to act as the central host in our network with several clients connecting to it for access. This host needs to have a stable public IP and a known shared port to accept wireguard traffic on.</p>



<p>We need to generate keys for the server:</p>



<pre><code>wg-server (umask 0077; wg genkey &gt; server.key)
wg-server # cat server.key
AJKFyhDoLfLnlclEcKV97bRonVKGgEbRGi7vGfeYNnw=
wg-server # wg pubkey &lt; server.key      # show the public key for this private key
j2klzAC0RnWOOUAcZw+/GEtp5URCSwf9r3yW+JYJRRE=
</code></pre>



<p>Next, there are a few steps to set up the network. We need to create a wireguard interface using wireguard-go:</p>



<pre><code>wg-server # wireguard-go wg0
INFO: (wg0) 2021/01/08 14:35:42 Starting wireguard-go version 0.0.20200320
</code></pre>



<p>This interface needs to be configured to have an address in our private network on the host and a route to direct traffic into the wireguard tunnel. We use the wg(8) tool to configure the interface’s private key.</p>



<pre><code>wg-server # ifconfig wg0 inet 10.10.0.1/24 10.10.0.1
wg-client # route add 10.10.0.0/24 -interface wg0
wg-server # wg set wg0 private-key ./server.key listen-port 51820
</code></pre>



<p>If we don’t specify the listen port here, then wireguard will select a random port when the wg0 interface is brought up. For a destination server like this, we need to have a consistent port between addresses, and so we use one common to wireguard here.</p>



<pre><code>wg-server # ifconfig wg0 down
wg-server # ifconfig wg0 up
</code></pre>



<p>Finally, we need to configure each peer with its public key and the IP addresses it is allowed to use:</p>



<pre><code>wg-server # wg set wg0 peer &lt;peer pubkey&gt; allowed-ips 10.10.0.2/32 </code></pre>



<h4><strong>FreeBSD Client</strong></h4>



<p>Each client needs to go through similar steps: first create a private key to identify the client:</p>



<pre><code>wg-client (umask 0077; wg genkey &gt; client.key)
wg-client # cat client.key
gM3ydSBBTZOw1nzIyV/nxJuONB8/MNe/RhcOikQbE3Y=
wg-client # wg pubkey &lt; client.key      # show the public key for this private key
jILr21Xt+3sXDZepu5Z3syuJMXyc29f5GBXHZFPulEE=
</code></pre>



<p>We need to create the wireguard interface by running wireguard-go:</p>



<pre><code>wg-client # wireguard-go wg0            # create the wg0 interface</code></pre>



<p>This interface is then configured for the internal VPN network. wireguard-go creates a tun interface, and tun interfaces need to be configured with a source and destination address. As that is not important here, we can use the same address for both parts. To make sure we can reach the internal network properly, we also need to add a route:</p>



<pre><code>wg-client # ifconfig wg0 inet 10.10.0.2/24 10.10.0.2
wg-client # route add 10.10.0.0/24 -interface wg0
</code></pre>



<p>With the interface configured, we can now configure wireguard:</p>



<pre>wg-client # wg set wg0 private-key ./client.key&nbsp;</pre>



<p>Finally, we need to configure the wg0 interface with an endpoint for the server:</p>



<pre><code>wg-client # ifconfig wg0 down
wg-client # ifconfig wg0 up
wg-client # wg set wg0 peer &lt;peer pubkey&gt; allowed-ips 10.10.0.0/24 endpoint 192.0.2.42:51820
</code></pre>



<p>When we configured the client peer, we told wireguard where to find the server with the endpoint parameter. In this case the client doesn’t listen on a predictable port, but instead it first has to create the wireguard tunnel with the server when traffic needs to be sent.</p>



<p>Now that we have created and configured our client, we need to add its public key and allowed-ip addresses to the server.</p>



<pre><code>wg-server # wg set wg0 peer jILr21Xt+3sXDZepu5Z3syuJMXyc29f5GBXHZFPulEE= allowed-ips 10.10.0.2/32 </code></pre>



<p>Finally we can test the set up using ping:</p>



<pre><code>wg-client # ping 10.10.0.1
PING 10.10.0.1 (10.10.0.1): 56 data bytes                 
64 bytes from 10.10.0.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=3.253 ms  
64 bytes from 10.10.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=1.358 ms  
64 bytes from 10.10.0.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=1.089 ms                                                            
64 bytes from 10.10.0.1: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=1.649 ms                                                            
^C                           
</code></pre>



<p>Wireguard is not a ‘chatty’ protocol. If there is no traffic to send from the client for a long time, and it doesn’t have a fixed address, the server can ‘forget’ how to reach the client.</p>



<p>It might be the case that the client is behind a NAT network. To support this case, wireguard supports the<em>&nbsp;persistent-keepalive&nbsp;</em>configuration option. This option is disabled by default, but it allows our client to receive packets from the server when it is not sending traffic itself.</p>



<p>RFC4787 recommends a 2 minute timeout interval for NATs and middleboxes, but recent UDP protocols (such as QUIC), recommend sending packets every 30 seconds to prevent middleboxes from&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/1879141.1879174">losing state for UDP flows</a>.</p>



<p>If you need the tunnel connection kept alive, add the&nbsp;persistent-keepalive&nbsp;parameter:</p>



<pre><code>wg-client # wg set wg0 peer &lt;peer pubkey&gt; allowed-ips 10.10.0.0/24 persistent-keepalive 30 endpoint 192.0.2.42:51820</code></pre>

<li>If you want to use a make.conf you can simply add your options to<code>/usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/'jailname'-make.conf</code> e.g. <code>12amd61-make.conf</code> and it should autmatically be picked up.</li>
<li>If you can’t resolve any hostnames you might be using local unbound on the host. Edit /etc/resolv.conf and add a public DNS server.</li>
<li>If you run this jail on a production server you might want to limit memory usage <code>bastille limits poudriere memoryuse 8G</code>.</li>
<li>The packages will be under /usr/local/poudriere/data/packages/‘jailname’-‘portsname’. You can add the directory to any webserver and point your *pkg.conf to that URL.</li>
<li>You can update the ports tree using <code>poudriere ports -u</code></li>

<p>This is an updated version of the 2019 post, architecture of my life, which you can find <a href="https://blog.nntn.nl/architecture-of-my-life" target="blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Automation is something dear to my heart. Like the figure at the top of this post, I am not sure that in the end it will have actually saved me time, but it has given me many opportunities to learn, as trying to build a resilient piece of software with a beautiful architecture, which helps me be more productive is an ever-evolving project, which will keep pushing me to learn more. I hope with this I can inspire you to automate some part of your life.</p>
<p>In this blogpost I will describe the following things:</p>
<ul><li><a href="#the-foundation"><b>The foundation</b></a>:<br>The code my automation is built upon. It will also explain the fundamental ideas behind how I think about automation.</li>
<li><a href="#actions"><b>Actions</b></a><b>:</b><br>An overview of some of the automation I have built. If you're looking for some inspiration to build something yourself, this is the place to go.</li>
<li><a href="#other-software-i-made"><b>Other software</b></a><b>:</b><br>Not everything I built can be run inside the framework I built. I also built some other cool utilities to help me in my every day life.</li></ul>

<p>The core and foundation of my automation is named Atlas. Atlas handles everything to run my automation, from connecting to services to handling errors.</p>
<h2 id="an-action">An Action</h2>
<p>At the core of Atlas is a simple idea: Actions. Anything I might ever want to automate is an action. It will act on my behalf on the online services that I use. Some actions will check for themselves if they need to run (adding a reminder for a sent email). The action can also decide how often it wants to run, from every 15 minutes to once a week. Others I only want to run when I need them to (checking the uptime of my systems). </p>
<p>Some require input to do their job correctly (adding a todo to my todo list). The most complicated actions have some state, as the input they require is more complicated. </p>
<p>To build this state I use a chatbot interface, where I give a command, the system parses my input, updates the state and performs the next step, incrementally building the state until all the necessary properties for the action to complete are in place. This flow is explained in the figure below</p>
<figure><img src="https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F4c8fca8e-34ca-4d28-aae0-8739d858799a%2FUntitled.png?table=block&amp;id=3589228c-eff7-48d2-96d1-453c772c5623&amp;userId=&amp;cache=v2" alt="Overview of the state"><figcaption>Overview of the state</figcaption></figure>
<p>For example, when I want to add a task to a specific task list, I first write the content of that task, which is added to the state. It replies asking which project I want it to add to with some example task lists. I reply with "Write a blog". In the "Update State" part of the flow, this title of a task list is then internally converted to the internal id of the list. This way, me and anyone else using the system do not need to know the exact internals.</p>
<h2 id="interface">Interface</h2>
<p>Atlas is always part of another project. It is wrapped in Ares, a project that connects Atlas and the Microsoft Bot Framework to make it available as a chatbot, in my case as a Telegram chatbot, where you can ask it to perform the actions. It is also run as an Azure Function, available as a <a href="https://zeus-laurentia.azurewebsites.net/api/run/help" target="blank">web-api</a>. I have used this API to build an iOS shortcut to run Actions from my phone and watch and have created a windows application such that I can run any action from my laptop. The Azure Function also runs on a timer trigger and executes every 15 minutes to execute the relevant actions. </p>

<figure><img src="https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Ff3b1e86d-a29f-42cd-a80c-2919f668ba32%2FUntitled.png?table=block&amp;id=cd513ca1-b189-4792-9c94-ea4428a84242&amp;userId=&amp;cache=v2" alt="Telegram chat interface"><figcaption>Telegram chat interface</figcaption></figure>





<h2 id="exceptions">Exceptions</h2>
<p>One of the problems of building your own automation is that things are breaking. Constantly. I am connecting to 17 online services and having 35.000+ lines of code means that it is likely something will break. Most of the errors occur within Actions, as they make the calls to external services and change (and therefore break) most often. To make sure one action does not break the entire system, the actions are run in a try-catch block. </p>
<p>Once an action crashes, automation will start running to handle the crash. Independently running actions will start to send me messages to tell me that it is broken after four failed runs, so that timeouts and other temporary problems donâ€™t bother me. It will also automatically throttle itself, postponing its next run in an exponential way, to make sure it does not break anything and I do not get spammed with messages. </p>
<p>After 10 crashes, my automation will automatically create a GitHub issue with the name of the action that crashes and the stack trace. It will even try to generate a url to line in the code in GitHub link where it believes the issue is originating.</p>
<p>The Telegram chatbot will ask the user after a single crash if it wants to make a GitHub issue, as this is deemed more important.</p>
<p>Now, you have a good overview of the basics, we can discuss the cool parts.</p>

<h2 id="spotify">Spotify</h2>
<p>I like to listen to a lot of music. Last year, I spent 98.960 minutes listening to <a href="https://spotify.com/" target="blank">Spotify</a>, one of the most  popular streaming services out there. To help me get the most out of their service, I have a lot of automation running to help me. </p>
<h3 id="sort-by-loudness">Sort by Loudness</h3>
<p>To aid you in finding new music, Spotify presents you with two auto-generated personalized playlists. AÂ&nbsp;<a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/using_spotify/playlists/discover-weekly/" target="blank">Discover Weekly</a>Â&nbsp;playlist with new music from new artists and aÂ&nbsp;<a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/using_spotify/playlists/release-radar/" target="blank">Release Radar</a>Â&nbsp;playlist which contains music released this week. Both are very nice, but have one problem, they jump from very loud energetic to peaceful piano music. This is very jarring if you are listening. To solve this, I download all songs from the playlist and get the features of the songs. <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/#audio-features-object" target="blank">These features are provided by Spotify</a> and contain things like energy, danceability, liveness and loudness. I order all songs by loudness and put them in a new playlist for me. This way I can listen to my music from very loud to very peaceful.</p>
<h3 id="personally-generated-playlists">Personally generated playlists</h3>
<p>Once you have features of songs, you can think bigger. Spotify can extract features from all of my saved music. From that you can generate playlists. However to do that, you would need to find the perfect settings to create a nice playlist. For this I created a windows application called Playlister, explained further below. Using Playlister, I have created playlists named Summer, Winter, Piano and Energy. Every week, Atlas downloads all my saved songs from Spotify and runs it through each of the finely tuned filters for my playlists and updates each with new songs Iâ€™ve added and removes songs I no longer like. So if I want to listen to music that gets me hyped, I listen to the Energy playlist, which consists of songs I like that, following my tweaks, can be considered full of energy.</p>
<h3 id="last-4-weeks">Last 4 weeks</h3>
<p>I (used to) spend a lot of time biking and travelling by train. I have a data plan, but don't want to overshoot it. This leads to the fact that I need Spotify to download a lot of music. However, I also have a lot of new music that I want to bring with me. I could download all my music, but my phone does not have enough storage for that. To solve this problem, Atlas will update a playlist every night with all of the songs I added in the last 4 weeks. I then tell Spotify to keep this playlist downloaded at all times. This leads to an almost always updated playlist with my newest songs.</p>
<h3 id="random-songs">Random Songs</h3>
<p>In the previous paragraph I explained that I canâ€™t download every songs to my phone. However, I might want to listen to a random selection of music every once in a while. Music not in one of my automatically generated playlist or in any other list. Furthermore, even if I have internet, I sometimes feel like the shuffle is not completely random. And lastly, it is also sorted by loudness and if I need to concentrate, I can start at loud and end at calm music. To solve these problems, every night Atlas takes all my saved music, picks 50 random songs and adds it to a playlist sorted by loudness, so I can always listen to some random music I like.</p>
<h3 id="full-release-radar">Full Release Radar</h3>
<p>Spotify has a feature called Release Radar, where each week, you can listen to music that came out that week from artists you follow or might find interesting. This is great and Iâ€™ve gotten a lot of new music from it, however it might miss artists that I like and if an artist released an entire album, it will only display one song in the playlist, which I can definitely understand, but I donâ€™t want. So I created an Action on Atlas, which every Friday checks all the artists I follow. If they released any new music in the last week and it puts the songs into a playlist called â€œFull release radarâ€�, so that I do have this overview.<br>As an addition, another action checks if I added music from a new artist and automatically follows them, so this list is constantly expanding.</p>
<h2 id="todoist">Todoist</h2>
<p>Task lists are must for me. I forget a lot of things and task lists enable me to keep track of all the things I need to do. To help me I use <a href="https://todoist.com/" target="blank">Todoist</a>.</p>
<h3 id="temporary-projects">Temporary Projects</h3>
<p>As some might know, every Friday, I try to clean my room. This is very nice, as during the week I donâ€™t have to think about keeping everything clean, as on Friday I will clean it anyways, nor do I have to force it in sometime during the week. Cleaning is something that I have to go through often and has a predetermined list of tasks. Although I try to do it on Friday, it might occur that it happens on another day. To be able to start with all of these tasks on the fly I have an Action which can import a template at any time. The template is written inÂ&nbsp;<a href="https://www.taskpaper.com/" target="blank">TaskPaper</a>, a simplistic way of writing down tasks, to create all projects and tasks. These configuration files are stored in my OneDrive, so I can edit, delete or add any new list at any time or any place.</p>
<h3 id="github-synchronisation">GitHub Synchronisation</h3>
<p>On <a href="https://github.com/" target="blank">GitHub</a>, I currently have 7 repositories where I have issues open that I plan on fixing one day. To keep track of this in one place, I synchronize them to Todoist, where I can see them in a separate project. This is only one way, as I neither want to create issues in Todoist, not be able to complete them. </p>
<h3 id="today-action">Today action</h3>
<p>When doing work from my task list, there are two main categories this work can be divided into: work that needs to be done today and work that you plan on doing today. The first is easily managed in Todoist by due dates. The second is managed by myself with a …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>En kvinna som förlorat båda sina händer i en svår infektion genomgick nyligen en dubbel handtransplantation på Sahlgrenska sjukhuset i Göteborg. En operation som krävde lång förberedelse och stora resurser. Sammanlagt arbetade mellan 35 och 40 personer i operationsteamet.</p><p>– Vi opererade i arton timmar och förberedde operationen i sju, åtta år. Vi var femton kirurger inblandade och ett stort team med operationssköterskor och anestesiläkare, säger handkirurgen Paolo Sassu, som ledde operationsteamet.</p><p>Förberedelserna inför operationen har bland annat inneburit träning med hjälp av så kallad ”augmented reality”, förstärkt verklighet, som genomförts i samarbete med Chalmers tekniska högskola. Där har patienten övat upp sin hjärna för att kunna använda och känna sina nya händer.</p><h4>Kunde vicka på fingrarna dagen efter</h4><p>Redan dagen efter operationen, som genomfördes i december, kunde patienten röra på de nya händernas alla fingrar. Nu följer hård träning för ytterligare rörlighet och funktion. Flera verksamheter är inblandade i personens rehabilitering och vårdkejdan är långt ifrån över. Men patienten är hoppfull.</p><p>– Att ha två händer som jag kan röra på är en underbar känsla. Det är en stor skillnad mot de proteser jag hade tidigare. Jag är helnöjd med mina jättefina händer, säger patienten via Sahlgrenska.</p><h4>Etiska frågor med i beräkningen</h4><figure><div data-lpid="29923182"><div><p><img alt="" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></p></div></div><figcaption><span>Handkirurgen Paolo Sassu ledde arbetet under operationen. </span></figcaption></figure><div><p><span>Det finns inga exakta siffror på hur många som varje år amputerar en hand eller en arm, och av dem är det inte alla som har förutsättningar för att kunna få nya händer. Det finns även etiska frågor att ta ställning till när det gäller transplantation av kroppsdelar. Även om donatorn är med i donationsregistret är samtal med anhöriga viktiga. </span></p><p><span>– Patienten är så glad och så tacksam. Och hon kan faktiskt ha ett nytt liv, säger handkirurgen Paolo Sassu, som ledde operationsteamet.</span></p></div><p><em>I klippet ovan kan du se hur kvinnans nya händer fungerar.</em></p></div></div>]]>

<p>The pandemic has subsided; the number of people who have recovered from COVID19 (SARS-CoV-2) have been steadily rising. With this new development, the question of how long the immunity against the virus will last remains a cause for concern for experts, including the general public.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.rockefeller.edu/news/30005-sars-cov-2-immune-response-improves-long-term-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new study</a> has found that the immunity against COVID-19 post recovery remains for at least six months and likely even longer.</p>
<p><span>In the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03207-w#citeas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paper published</a> in the journal <em>Nature</em>, the researchers note that the immune system studies the nature of the virus remarkably well and strategize itself to develop better and more effective antibodies even after the infection has abated.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p>Now before we get further into detail, let’s first understand how our immune system protects us from many different types of unwanted invaders, including viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungi, and how it helps us attain immunity against them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The immune system is an army of cells, tissues, and organs that coordinate the bodily defenses against any threats. The white blood cells, also known as leukocytes, are one of the most important cells involved in the process, and they circulate throughout the body and make sure there are not any unwanted foreign invaders that may harm us.</p>



<p>There are two divisions of leukocytes, and they are: phagocytes and lymphocytes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phagocytes are the first cells to trigger <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000821.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immune response</a>; they destroy any foreign cells they encounter through ingestion. This helps them identify the antigen present in the foreign cells, and transmit this information to lymphocytes, which then hunt for infected body cells and annihilate them completely.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The lymphocytes unit of the immune system comprises of two major cellular components called B-cells and T-cells. These cells utilize the information collected from the antigens to recognize any unwanted visitors in the future. So once a threat makes another visit, the cells will unleash the right antibodies to destroy the invaders. This is how our body develops immunity against certain diseases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the effectiveness of immune response decreases with time as the level of antibodies drops after a certain period. So in order to deal with pathogens more efficiently, the immune system doesn’t always produce antibodies, instead it resorts to creating memory B-cells that easily recognize the pathogen and release a new batch of antibodies upon re-exposure to the any unwanted visitors.</p>



<p>In the study, the researchers found that these antibodies emerged post SARS-CoV-2 infection are the results of immune cells working in choir to evolve while simultaneously being constantly exposed to hidden remnants of the virus in the intestinal wall. And as a result, the next time a recovered patient contracts the virus, their body will initiate a rapid immune response to the virus, hence preventing reinfection. However, the efficacy of this memory on warding off the infection is solely determined by the nature of the pathogen the person has contracted with.</p>



<p>For the study, the researchers assessed the antibody responses of 87 participants at two separate time-points: one month following infection, and then again after six months. They found that although the antibodies lingered on the participants’ blood plasma for six months, there were significant drops in their levels and as a result of that, the ability to neutralize the virus plummeted five-fold.</p>



<p>Surprisingly however, the subsequent batch of antibodies produced by the memory B cells in patients, increased in some cases. The researches have specified that the overall numbers of memory B-cells that unleashed antibodies that attack the receptor-binding domain of the virus, remained the same. These antibodies are the ones that will fend off the virus upon re-encounter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, upon closer inspection at the memory B cells, the team also found that these cells had mutated many times over even after the infection waned, and this made the antibodies the cells created outperformed the originals in staving off the virus. Moreover, this new set of antibodies could latch on to the virus and even identify the mutated versions of it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They have been found to be able to identify even the mutated version of SARS-CoV-2 including <a href="https://theconversation.com/south-african-scientists-who-discovered-new-covid-19-variant-share-what-they-know-153313" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South African Variants</a> (called 501Y.V2) that have undergone mutations for more than 20 times.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The memory B cells of course mutate and deploy antibodies at times of infections like HIV or herpes, but seeing them evolve with SARS-CoV-2, which is believed to wither soon after infection has resolved, was never expected until now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SARS-Cov-2 thrives and replicates in the upper respiratory tract. However, upon examining biopsies of intestinal tissue from recovered patients, its genetic materials and proteins were detected within it. The researchers conjecture this could be what’s fueling the evolution of memory B-cells.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The infectiousness of these viral remnants are yet to be determined. In the future, the team plans to understand the role these viral remnants play in immunity as well as in the progression of the disease by making more participants involved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study has been published in the journal <em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03207-w#citeas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nature</a></em>:</p>

            <div>
                <div id="post-content"><p>My career began as a web application developer. I assumed success depended on choosing specific technologies. I leveled up with exposure to different technologies, companies, roles, and perspectives. 10 years of experience refutes my assumption. Success does not depend on specific technologies. It requires a value stream centric worldview and continuous improvement.</p><p>You may implicitly understand this idea without grokking the concept. Consider your own anecdotal experience. Which do you prefer: automated deployments backed by automated tests or manual deployments backed by manual testing? Pushing code changes to production every day or every month? Using production telemetry to guide post-mortems or running production blindly? Guessing what works in the product or validating ideas with A/B tests? Aligning teams with shared goals or putting teams at cross purposes? If your experiences are anything like mine, then you have a preference (and happy memories of a great team if you’re lucky but scar tissue from burnout and 3AM pages is more likely).</p><p>Each questions covers a philosophical principal. The principles are simple: Use fast feedback cycles then validate results with metrics. Now you’re off to the races. This philosophy is called “DevOps”.</p><h2 id="the-value-stream-world-view">The Value Stream World View</h2><p>The value stream is the process for converting a business idea into a technology enabled service that delivers value to the customer. We’ve changed how we interact with the value stream as software professionals and software consumers. Acceleration is the trend.</p><p>Different philosophies attempted to relate the value stream’s changing nature. First Agile. Second lean. Third DevOps (and it’s cousins like DevSecOps and NoOps). Agile covered software development. Lean introduced ideas such as MVP’s, short cycle times, and hypothesis driven development. DevOps uses these ideas and others as the basis for technical practices.</p><h2 id="leveraging-flow-feedback-and-learning">Leveraging Flow, Feedback, and Learning</h2><p>The <a href="http://itrevolution.com/the-three-ways-principles-underpinning-devops/" rel="noopener">three DevOps principals</a> are: </p><ol><li>strive for short cycle times from development and production</li><li>feedback information about production to drive development</li><li>experiment to improve theses processes.</li></ol><p>Each principal creates its own feedback loops. The effectiveness of each feedback loop is measured by four relevant metrics: </p><ol><li>lead time</li><li>deployment frequency</li><li>MTTR (mean time to resolve)</li><li>change failure rate. </li></ol><p>These three feedback loops and four metrics encapsulate the value stream.</p><p><a href="https://www.slashdeploy.com/book-review/devops-handbook/" rel="noopener">The DevOps Handbook</a> articulates the philosophy and practices. <a href="https://www.slashdeploy.com/book-review/accelerate/" rel="noopener">Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps</a> delves into IT performance. Accelerate introduces the four metrics and frames software delivery performance. More importantly, Accelerate presents empirical evidence that implementing DevOps principles leads to more competitive businesses, happier employees, and better software. In other words, Accelerate validates this wonderful quote from The DevOps Handbook’s conclusion:</p><blockquote>DevOps benefits all of us in the technology value stream, whether are are Dev, Ops, QA, InfoSec, Product Owners, or customers. It brings joy back to developing great products with fewer death marches. It enables humane work conditions with fewer weekends and missed holidays with our loved ones. It enables teams to work together to survive, learn, thrive, delight our customers, and help our organization succeed.</blockquote><p>Let’s begin with the feedback loop center to the software value streams: the process to push committed code into production.</p><h2 id="flow-as-measured-by-lead-time-and-deployment-frequency">Flow as Measured by Lead Time and Deployment Frequency</h2><blockquote>The principle of flow enables fast left-to-right flow of work from Development to Operations to the customer. In order to maximize flow, we need to make work visible, reduce our batch sizes and intervals of work, build in quality by preventing defects from being passed to downstream work centers, and constantly optimize for the global goals.</blockquote><p>The idea is reduce the time between committing code and that code running in production without causing chaos or disrupting customers in production. This measurement is “lead time”. Accelerate defines “lead time” as:</p><blockquote>the time it takes for work to be implemented, tested, and delivered</blockquote><p>Short lead times are better because that means the team is fulfilling more requests (as features or bug fixes). In other words: the value stream delivers value more quickly. Striving for short lead time is critical because production is the only place where code provides business value. Customers don’t care a lick for code in topic branches. They care if they can use it. That only happens in production, so the faster items flow from development to production the better. This feeds back into the second principle since production is the only place to truly learn about the business or product.</p><p>Assuming a team has short lead times, then it follows they deploy frequently. Deploy frequency is a proxy measurement for batch size. Consider batch size as the code diff between releases. Striving for short lead times encourages smaller batches since they are easier to develop, test, and deploy. Together lead time and deploy frequency measure velocity.</p><p>The software development lifecycle does not end when code enters production—that’s where it <em>begins</em>. Usage patterns change, there’s SLO to achieve, outages to resolve, and business ideas to validate. Teams need feedback from production to drive subsequent decisions.</p><h2 id="feedback-as-measured-by-mttr">Feedback as measured by MTTR</h2><blockquote>The principle of Feedback enables the fast and constant flow of feedback from right to left at all stages of our value stream. It requires that we amplify feedback to prevent problems from happening again, or enable faster detection and recovery.</blockquote><p>The above quote is taken from introduction to the DevOps Handbook. The idea is to provide feedback via telemetry about all parts of the value stream. This includes the deployment pipeline itself, infrastructure data such memory usage or CPU load, and product metrics like active users and engagement.</p><p>Hypothesis validation and learning is the prime focus. Building telemetry into the value stream sets a foundation for aligning the team to shared goals (such as improving lead lead times or increasing revenue) and for achieving organization goals. It comes down to this: if something cannot be measured, then it cannot be tracked. If something cannot be tracked, then it cannot be improved. Luckily, this is not the case. The mean-time-to-resolve (MTTR) metric captures effectiveness in the value stream’s telemetry systems.</p><p>We’ve covered three metrics so far: Lead time, deployment frequency, and MTTR. Organizations want short lead times and more frequent deploys. Organizations want lower MTTR since that implies negative consequences in production are dealt with quickly, which reduces business impact.</p><p>The principles of flow and feedback establish two feedback loops. The first from development to production. The second from production to development. Again, the software development lifecycle does not stop there. The business and technology landscape is constantly changing.</p><h2 id="learning-as-measured-by-change-failure-rate">Learning as measured by Change Failure Rate</h2><blockquote>The <a href="https://www.hawkins.io/p/509a73c6-19dc-4c45-8c1c-9e784d5d4a22/www.hawkins.io/toyota-kata">principle of learning</a> enables the creation of a generative, high-trust culture that supports a dynamic, disciplined, and scientific approach to experimentation and risk-taking, facilitating the creation of organizational learning, both from our successes and failures.</blockquote><p>Faster cycle times are a recurring theme. It applies to learning opportunities as well. The above quote from The DevOps Handbook speaks to organizational culture. Organizations should strive to create more learning opportunities earlier in the process (akin to “shift left”). When done right, this fosters a culture of experimentation that enables improvement from all participants in the value stream.</p><p>This is evident in the fourth and final metric: change failure frequency. Change failure frequency is the percentage of changes that have any negative consequence in production such as outage or that require corrective action.</p><p>I offer a different interpretation focused on hypothesis driven development. A change is considered a failure if it does not validate our hypothesis. It’s given that a particular change will not create an outage or other negative consequence. If that does happen then that’s an obvious failure. However we must expand our definition to account for <em>why</em> the team choose to make a change. If the team expects a conversion rate X on a given feature and does not achieve it, then that’s a failure. It’s likely not a technical failure, but a failure in the value stream itself.</p><p>Considering a change a failure for not achieving a specific conversion rate may some far fetched but thinking this way is possible. The definition of “failure” may adapt over time as the value stream matures. Applying a continuous improvement philosophy encourages the organization to identify increasingly faint failure signals then work to guard against them.</p><p>Failure signals are not confined to technical details. The business process can (and often does) fail as well. A culture of continuous learning treats the missed conversion rate as a learning opportunity. Perhaps the idea was not properly A/B tested before committing to a full implementation. Perhaps the design wasn’t aligned with existing expectations. Perhaps the price was too high. The answer to this is irrelevant in this scenario. The relevant question is why did it happen and what can be done in the future to prevent it? This philosophy keeps businesses ahead. Or as Peter Senge puts it:</p><blockquote>The only sustainable competitive advantage is an organization’s ability to learn faster than the competition.</blockquote><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>The principles of flow, feedback, and learning provide a philosophical framework for understanding the technology value stream. The power in these principles is not confined to software development.</p><p>Mik Kersten’s “<a href="https://projecttoproduct.org/" rel="noopener">Project to Product</a>” introduces the Flow Framework.

<p>Some critics think the curl project shouldn’t use GitHub. The reasons for being against GitHub hosting tend to be one or more of:</p>



<ol><li>it is an evil proprietary platform</li><li>it is run by Microsoft and they are evil</li><li> GitHub is American thus evil</li></ol>



<p>Some have insisted on craziness like “we let GitHub hold our source code hostage”.</p>



<h2>Why GitHub?</h2>



<p>The curl project <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2010/03/23/curl-goes-git/">switched to GitHub</a> (from Sourceforge) almost eleven years ago and it’s been a smooth ride ever since.</p>



<p>We’re on GitHub not only because it provides a myriad of practical features and is a stable and snappy service for hosting and managing source code. GitHub is also a developer hub for millions of developers who already have accounts and are familiar with the GitHub style of developing, the terms and the tools. By being on GitHub, we reduce friction from the contribution process and we maximize the ability for others to join in and help. We lower the bar. This is good for us.</p>



<p>I like GitHub.</p>



<h2>Self-hosting is not better</h2>



<p>Providing even close to the same uptime and snappy response times with a self-hosted service is a challenge, and it would take someone time and energy to volunteer that work – time and energy we now instead can spend of developing the project instead. As a small independent open source project, we don’t have any “infrastructure department” that would do it for us. And trust me: we already have enough infrastructure management to deal with without having to add to that pile.</p>



<p>… and by running our own hosted version, we would lose the “network effect” and convenience for people that already are on and know the platform. We would also lose the easy integration with cool services like the many different CI and code analyzer jobs we run.</p>



<h2>Proprietary is not the issue</h2>



<p>While git is open source, GitHub is a proprietary system. But the thing is that even if we would go with a competitor and get our code hosting done elsewhere, our code would still be stored on a machine somewhere in a remote server park we cannot physically access – ever. It doesn’t matter if that hosting company uses open source or proprietary code. If they decide to switch off the servers one day, or even just selectively block our project, there’s nothing we can do to get our stuff back out from there.</p>



<p>We have to work so that we minimize the risk for it and the effects from it if it still happens.</p>



<p>A proprietary software platform holds our code just as much hostage as any free or open source software platform would, simply by the fact that we let someone else host it. They run the servers our code is stored on.</p>



<h2>If GitHub takes the ball and goes home</h2>



<p>No matter which service we use, there’s always a risk that they will turn off the light one day and not come back – or just change the rules or licensing terms that would prevent us from staying there. We cannot avoid that risk. But we can make sure that we’re smart about it, have a contingency plan or at least an idea of what to do when that day comes.</p>



<p>If GitHub shuts down immediately and we get zero warning to rescue anything at all from them, what would be the result for the curl project?</p>



<p><strong>Code.</strong> We would still have the entire git repository with all code, all source history and all existing branches up until that point. We’re hundreds of developers who pull that repository frequently, and many automatically, so there’s a very distributed backup all over the world.</p>



<p><strong>CI</strong>. Most of our CI setup is done with yaml config files in the source repo. If we transition to another hosting platform, we could reuse them.</p>



<p><strong>Issues</strong>. Bug reports and pull requests are stored on GitHub and a sudden exit would definitely make us lose some of them. We do daily “extractions” of all issues and pull-requests so a lot of meta-data could still be saved and preserved. I don’t think this would be a terribly hard blow either: we move long-standing bugs and ideas over to documents in the repository, so the currently open ones are likely possible to get resubmitted again within the nearest future.</p>



<p>There’s no doubt that it would be a significant speed bump for the project, but it would not be worse than that. We could bounce back on a new platform and development would go on <em>within days</em>.</p>



<h2>Low risk</h2>



<p>It’s a rare thing, that a service just suddenly with no warning and no heads up would just go black and leave projects completely stranded. In most cases, we get alerts, notifications and get a chance to transition cleanly and orderly.</p>



<h2>There are alternatives</h2>



<p>Sure there are alternatives. Both pure GitHub alternatives that look similar and provide similar services, and projects that would allow us to run similar things ourselves and host locally. There are many options.</p>



<p><strong>I’m not looking for alternatives. I’m not planning to switch hosting anytime soon!</strong> As mentioned above, I think GitHub is a net positive for the curl project.</p>



<h2>Nothing lasts forever</h2>



<p>We’ve switched services several times before and I’m expecting that we will change again in the future, for all sorts of hosting and related project offerings that we provide to the work and to the developers and participators within the project. Nothing lasts forever.</p>



<p>When  a service we use goes down or just turns sour, we will figure out the best possible replacement and take the jump. Then we patch up all the cracks the jump may have caused and continue the race into the future. Onward and upward. The way we know and the way we’ve done for over twenty years already. </p>

<h2>Updates</h2>



<p>After this blog post went live, some users remarked than I’m “<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/bfxd28">disingenuous</a>” in the list of reasons at the top, that people have presented to me.  This, because I don’t mention the moral issues staying on GitHub present – like for example previously reported workplace conflicts and their association with hideous American immigration authorities.</p>



<p>This is rather the opposite of  disingenuous. This is the truth. Not a single person have <em>ever</em> asked me to leave GitHub for those reasons. Not me personally, and nobody has asked it out to the wider project either.</p>



<p>These are good reasons to discuss and consider if a service should be used. Have there been violations of “decency” significant enough that should make us leave? Have we crossed that line in the sand? I’m leaning to “no” now, but I’m always listening to what curl users and developers say. Where do you think the line is drawn?</p>

I am often asked what I mean when I say that developers spend most of their time figuring the system out. Let’s unpack the statement.
</p>
<p>
The oldest reference on the topic I know of dates back to 1979 in a book by Zelkowitz, Shaw, and Gannon entitled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Principles-software-engineering-design-Prentice-Hall/dp/013710202X">Principles of software engineering and design</a>. It said that most of the development time was spent on maintenance (67%).
</p>

</figure>

<p>
Granted, the book does not specify how the figure was obtained. Still, it was deemed an important enough problem to attract significant research attention since then.
</p>
<p>
So, how far are we now, more than 4 decades later?
</p>
<p>
Let’s look at a recent paper by Xia, Bao, Lo, Xing, Hassan, &amp; Li entitled <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318811113_Measuring_Program_Comprehension_A_Large-Scale_Field_Study_with_Professionals">Measuring Program Comprehension: A Large-Scale Field Study with Professionals</a> and published in IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 44, 951-976, 2018. This paper is quite interesting in that it describes in great details how the figures are obtained. And it says that Comprehension took on average ~58%.
</p>
<p>
Now, take a closer look at the results table.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/pictures/2018-costs.png" alt="Software development costs (2018)">
	<figcaption>Software development costs (2018)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
In particular, take a look at the third column in the table: it says Navigation accounts for 24% of the effort, and that is considered separately from the Comprehension effort!
</p>
<p>
So, after 4 decades, we can observe that not much has changed beside learning how to measure the “figuring out” time.
</p>
<p>
So what?
</p>
<p>
Well, that is the single largest expense we have. If we want to optimize anything in our discipline we should look at this part first. We talk often about how we build systems, but how often do you talk about how you spend the “figuring out" time? If we do not talk about it, it’s not explicit. If it’s not explicit, it does not get optimized.
</p>
<p>
If we do talk about how the “figuring out the system” time is spent, we notice that people spend it reading. In fact, as the above paper also shows, comprehension is essentially measured as reading! The two are considered as mostly synonymous.
</p>
<p>
So, how should we talk about how we figure the system out?
</p>
<p>
Given that not much happened for 4 decades, we should entertain the idea that maybe we should frame the problem differently. 
</p>
<p>
Please, bear with me. This is where it gets interesting. So, why do developers read code? Because they want to figure the situation enough to know what to do next. The intent is important. This is decision making.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/pictures/decision-making.png" alt="The figuring out time is a decision making time">
	<figcaption>The figuring out time is a decision making time</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
From this perspective, reading is just the means through which information is gathered from data. It also happens to be the most manual possible way to do that, so this lends itself to an important opportunity for optimization.
</p>
<p>
Before you can do something significant about anything, you have to name it. Otherwise it's like with Voldemort. <a href="http://humane-assessment.com/">Many winters ago</a>, I called the effort of “figuring the system out to know what to do next" assessment. And I claimed we should optimize development around it.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/pictures/assessment.png" alt="Assessment is the process of understanding a situation around a system enough to make a decision">
	<figcaption>Assessment is the process of understanding a situation around a system enough to make a decision</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
For a whole decade my colleagues and I explored this idea. And it led us to what we now call moldable development.
</p>
<p>
What’s that?
</p>
<p>
Reading is the most manual way to extract information out of data. It does not scale and leads to incomplete information &amp; uncertainty.
</p>
<p>
Software is hard enough. Not knowing what the current system is like should not be an acceptable variable in the equation. A hand drawn picture about the current system is a belief. Decisions should never be based on beliefs. Not in engineering.
</p>
<p>
Once we accept that systems are data, it becomes obvious we should approach it like data, too. Data science tells us that you first start from the problem and then reason through a tool that matches the context.
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="https://blog.feenk.com/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-figuri-7aj1ocjhe765vvlln8qqbuhto/pictures/molding.png" alt="Tools should match the context">
	<figcaption>Tools should match the context</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
 As software is highly contextual we cannot predict specific problems. We can only predict classes of problems. To handle this, the key idea of moldable development is that the tool should be moldable after knowing the problem. In this way it can deal with what's important in context, and because of it, it can take care of the boring part of reading. Of course, for this to be practical, the cost of creating custom tools must be small.
</p>
<p>
I see the flow of constructing custom tools during development, and, ideally, for every single development problem, as the next major leap in software development.
</p>
<p>
In a decade from now, we should not be measuring the "figuring the system out” in terms of reading. We should occupy our energy with solving actual problems. To get there we should start by talking about how not to read code. We cannot afford not to.
</p>
<p>
We created <a href="https://gtoolkit.com/">Glamorous Toolkit</a> to provide a concrete start for the "how not to read code" conversation. Glamorous Toolkit is a moldable development environment that makes it possible to create custom tools about software systems inexpensively.
</p>
<p>
So, go to <a href="https://gtoolkit.com/">gtoolkit.com</a>. Play with it. Feel #MoldableDevelopment.
</p>
<p>
And do engage with us: <a href="https://discord.gg/FTJr9gP">discord.gg/FTJr9gP</a>.
</p>
<p>
Let’s make that conversation happen.

<p>Using two jars of capacities 5 gallons and 3 gallons, measure out 4 gallons exactly.<br>
-- Die Hard (basically)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I could list out the whole script of the movie in this instance, which most of the websites listed on the first page of google will do, so I am not going to do that here. Instead of giving you a solution to the immediate problem, i.e. producing 4 gallons of water using jars of sizes 5 gallons and 3 gallons, I will instead take you through a journey that will teach you to determine why, how and when this is possible. In short, we're going to learn how to fish today.</p>
<h2 id="solving-the-puzzle.">Solving the puzzle. <a href="#solving-the-puzzle.">#</a></h2>
<p>Let's see. We have jars, of capacities 5 gallons and 3 gallons respectively. We need to measure out exactly 4 gallons of water. We can pour water in and out of the jars and between them, but we have no way of measuring nor leveling the amount of water in the two jars against each other. How would one do it?</p>
<p>If you are like most people (and me), you will get stuck like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Step 1: Pour water into the 5 gallon jar</li>
<li>Step 2: Pour 3 gallons from the 5 gallon jar into the 3 gallon jar.</li>
<li>Step 3: Empty the 3 gallon jar. Now you have 2 gallons of water in the 5 gallon jar.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wait what? We wanted 4 gallons of water, not 2. Now don't go about saying that you can repeat this process to get 4 gallons of water. Bruce Willis did not have that privilege and neither do you. Fret not, let's begin thinking in the opposite direction. This way we'll reach the solution this time.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Step 1: Pour water into the 3 gallon jar</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step 2: Empty out the 3 gallon jar into the 5 gallon jar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step 3: Re-fill the 3 gallon jar. Empty it into the 5 gallon jar until the 5 gallon jar becomes full.</p>
<p>If you are with me until this point, we now have 1 gallon of water in the 3 gallon jar, and the 5 gallon jar is full</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step 4: Empty out the 5 gallon jar, and pour the 1 gallon water from the 3 gallon jar into the 5 gallon jar. Now fill the 3 gallon jar and again empty it into the 5 gallon jar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step 5: Now the 5 gallon jar contains 4 gallons of water.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you had come here for a quick fix, to find a solution to this problem, then you may leave now. There's some maths ahead, as we will try to explore how we can determine the feasibility of the die-hard-ness of any two water jars. Let's begin!</p>
<h2 id="formulating-the-word-problem-in-terms-of-mathematics%3A">Formulating the Word Problem in terms of Mathematics: <a href="#formulating-the-word-problem-in-terms-of-mathematics%3A">#</a></h2>
<p>I'm going to formulate this problem in teerms of maths in a quite unconventional way. But bear with me. Let's start by taking the final amount of water that we need.</p>
<p>$4$</p>
<p>This can be decomposed.</p>
<p>$= 1 + 3$</p>
<p>We have 3 already, but we need a 1 now.</p>
<p>$ = 3 - 2 + 3 $</p>
<p>Hmm, this is getting interesting. Now, I can replace the 2 with the difference between the original jar volumes.</p>
<p>$ = 3 - (5 - 3) + 3$</p>
<p>$ = 3 \times 3 - 5 $</p>
<p>There are a couple of reasons that I am expressing the problem in this way. We can notice a couple of things through this solution:</p>
<ol>
<li>We obtained all values of volumes, right from 1 upto 5 gallons using this method. As we can obtain 2 gallons and 3 gallons, we can go all the way up to 8 gallons, i.e. the obtainable values of the volumes of water range from 1 to 8 gallons.</li>
<li>The final equation shows 3x3 and -1x5. If you look at the solution closely, the jar with volume 3 has been filled exactly 3 times and the jar with volume 5 has been emptied exactly once! This is not a coincidence. In fact, each volume that is obtainable from the two jars is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_combination#:~:text=From%20Wikipedia%2C%20the%20free%20encyclopedia,a%20and%20b%20are%20constants">linear combination</a> of their respective volumes, like 2 can be obtained as (5 - 3) and 1 can be obtained as (3 - (5 - 3)).</li>
</ol>
<p>Let us consider a and b denote the volumes of the first and second jars respectively. For obtaining any volume c from the two jars, the volume c must be a linear combination of the capacity-volumes of the two jars, i.e.</p>
<p>$$ a \times x + b \times y = c$$</p>
<p>Where x and y are two integers. If x and y are not integers, then we won't be able to measure out the volume c accurately. Also, c should be a positive integer ( What is negative volume anyways? )</p>
<h2 id="star-of-the-show%3A-linear-diophantine-equations%3A">Star of the Show: Linear Diophantine Equations: <a href="#star-of-the-show%3A-linear-diophantine-equations%3A">#</a></h2>
<p>I am no professor, but I will give you a linear equation and you are going to tell me the solution.</p>
<p>$$ x + y = 2 $$</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>One might rant, "Oh but Sandesh! Don't you know that you need as many equations as variables to solve a system of linear equations?" Ah yes. But we are not talking about a system of linear equations. We are just talking about <strong>an</strong> equation.</p>
<p>"The solution is simple then!", one might exclaim. One of the solutions is $x = 1$ and $y = 1$. Another one can be $x = 3$ and $y = -1$. In fact, plotting the equation gives us a straight line, all points on which, satisfy the given equation and are its solutions.</p>
<p>We are particularly interested in <strong>Integer</strong> solutions of a given linear equation.</p>
<p>That's where the Linear Diophantine Equation comes into play!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The  simplest linear Diophantine equation takes the form <em>ax</em> + <em>by</em> = <em>c</em>, where <em>a</em>, <em>b</em> and <em>c</em> are given integers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_equation#Linear_Diophantine_equations">Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>For a diophantine equation to be solvable, the HCF (or GCD) of the coefficients, $a$ and $b$ should evenly divide (divide without a remainder) the constant term $c$. This can be seen from the properties of a integer.</p>
<p>Say, $h$ be the GCD of $x$ and $y$, so it divides $x$ and $y$ evenly. Then $h$ divides every multiple of $y$ evenly also and every multiple of $x$ too. That means $ax$ and $by$ are divisible by $h$ and so their sum $ax + by$ is also evenly divisible by $h$. For the equation $c$ should also be evenly divisble by $h$ as $ax + by$ gives us a integer, and being RHS, $c$ should be evenly divisble by $h$ as well for us to get an integer.</p>
<p>In order to check if it is possible to obtain $v$ volume with jars of capacities $a$ and $b$, it's very simple.</p>
<pre><code>import math

def check_possibility(a, b, v):
  return v % math.gcd(a, b) == 0 and v &lt;= (a+b)
</code></pre>

<p>With this much of knowledge, you will be able to solve a <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/die-hard-3/problem">hackerrank problem</a> relating the same. The question asks if it is indeed possible to measure out exactly 'v' volume given jars of volumes 'a' and 'b'. But if you want to know the exact number of times the jars need to be filled and emptied, then feel free to stick around.</p>
<p>Moving forward, I expect you already know about Euclid's algorithm to find out the GCD between two numbers. If not, then brace yourselves, a post is coming soon! In the meantime, feel free to check out wikipedia for the algorithm.</p>
<p>We are going to reverse the Algorithm for our own purposes. I will demonstrate with an example here so that it will be clearer. Let's start with an equation</p>
<p>$$ 5x + 3y = 4 $$</p>
<p>The GCD of $5$ and $3$ is $1$, which we need to show as the linear combination of the two. Let's start by first deriving the GCD using Euclid's algorithm:<br>
$$ 5 = 3 \times 1 + 2 \ ... (1)$$<br>
$$ 3 = 2 \times 1 + 1 \ ... (2)$$<br>
$$ 2 = 1 \times 2 + 0 \ ... (3) $$</p>
<p>With these, the algorithm terminates, and the last remaining quotient, i.e. 1 is the GCD. Let's reverse this method to find the linear combination. Let's start by writing the remainders on the LHS of the equations</p>
<p>$$<br>
2 = 5 - 3\times1 \ ... (4)<br>
$$ $$<br>
1 = 3 - 2\times 1\ ... (5)<br>
$$ $$<br>
0 = 2 - 1 \times 2\ ... (6)<br>
$$<br>
Now let's express our GCD in terms of our initial values, $5$ and $3$<br>
$$<br>
1 = 3 - (5-3) \times 1 \ ... (using \ 5, \ 4)<br>
$$ $$<br>
1 = 3\times 2 - 5<br>
$$<br>
Simple as that! Now to express our constant, i.e. $4$ in terms of $5$ and $3$,  we can do a simple multiplication, i.e. $1\times4$. So our final equation values become<br>
$$<br>
5x + 3y = 4<br>
$$ $$<br>
\implies 5 x + 3y = 4 \times 1<br>
$$ $$<br>
\implies 5x + 3y = 4 \times (3\times 2 - 5)<br>
$$$$<br>
\implies 5x + 3y = -4\times 5 +3\times 8<br>
$$<br>
Indeed, the maths checks out. Using these values of coefficients, it is possible to derive every combination of volume from $min(a, b)$ to $sum(a, b)$.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is really easy to solve simple equations like these with hand, but in order to obtain results for large values of $a$ and $b$ we need a computer.</p>
<p>Let's begin with our original equation:</p>
<p>$$ ax + by = c $$</p>
<p>Using long form division and assuming $ a&gt; b$, one can safely say that</p>
<p>$$ a = b \times q + r $$</p>
<p>Assuming $q$ as the quotient and $r$ as the remainder.</p>
<p>$$ ( b \times q + r) x + by = c  $$</p>
<p>$$ \implies bqx + rx + by = c $$</p>
<p>$$ \implies b(qx + y) + rx = c $$</p>
<p>Now in this equation, we have smaller coefficients. Let's substitute the values for unknowns with symbols as:</p>
<p>$$ v = x \ and \ u = (qx + y) $$</p>
<p>$$ also,\ u = (qv + y)\ [Using \ preceding \ equation] $$</p>
<p>So finally, the equation has reduced to<br>
$$<br>
bu + rv = c<br>
$$<br>
Which is equivalent to our original equation but has smaller coefficients. Also, the value of $r$ keeps on converging until it reaches $0$. That will be our base case as we will try to solve this problem using recursion.</p>
<h2 id="let's-code-it-up!">Let's Code it up! <a href="#let's-code-it-up!">#</a></h2>
<p>Phew! We have finally arrived at the final part of this tutorial. Let's write a simple program to find out the coefficients, i.e. number of times to empty and fill the jars. Please keep in mind that this program solves the original equation, i.e. $ ax + by = c$.</p>
<pre><code>
def getCoefficients(a, b, c):
	# a, b are the volumes of the jars and c is the target volume
  quotient, remainder = divmod(a, b)
  if remainder == 0:
    return [0, c/b]
  solvable = getCoefficients(b, r, c)
  v = solvable[1]
  u = solvable[0]
  return [v, u - quotient * v ]
  
</code></pre>
<p>Running the program for inputs <code>5, 3, 4</code> yields output <code>-4, 8</code> which are the values required. Substituting in original equation:</p>
<p>$$ 5x + 3y = 4$$</p>
<p>$$ 5 \times -4 + 3 \times 8 = 4 $$</p>
<p>Reducing $4$ from both sides,</p>
<p>$$ 5 \times -1 + 3 \times 2 = 1 $$</p>
<p>Hence, the we need to empty the 5 gallon jar 1 time and 3 gallon jar 2 times!</p>

<p>Recently this post making rounds on some of the dev community groups which I’m a part of on Facebook.</p>
<p>These are the rules of a banking website when we are to create a new account or change our passwords. And this is the most weirdest set of password rules that I have ever seen, and this is not a photoshopped image, but 100% real.</p>

<p>It’s ironic that no matter how good the password is the only thing that separates an attacker from making a bad transaction is just a phishing page, because the bank does not use two factor authentication.</p>
<p>Even though the password policy does suggest that your password should be at least 8 characters long, other rules such as inability to special characters make the password weak not strong.</p>
<p>As a developer, I can’t understand the reason for putting this list of rules for a password because a database should be able to hold a hashed password.</p>
<p>So go ahead and suggest me a password</p>

<p>As an operating system GNU/Linux has become a mess because of the fragmented nature of the project, the bloatware in the kernel, and because of the manipulation by corporate interests. There exist <a href="https://unixsheikh.com/articles/technical-reasons-to-choose-freebsd-over-linux.html">several technical reasons</a> for when a migration from GNU/Linux to BSD make sense, but this article isn't about that, it's an opinionated rant, more than anything else.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In the past I have always been a favorite of choosing operating system and tools based upon technical merit. However, in today's world of companies like Microsoft, Apple, Google, and many others, compromising user privacy, and conducting controversial activities, I don't believe that to be the right cause of action.</p>
<p>Proprietary operating systems like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10#Privacy_and_data_collection">Microsoft Windows 10</a>, <a href="https://gist.github.com/iosecure/357e724811fe04167332ef54e736670d">Apple MacOS</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_%28operating_system%29#Security_and_privacy">Google Android</a> have become famous for their ill conduct, and even companies like Lenovo is using UEFI boot to inject custom Windows components, so that the system can phone home to Lenovo.</p>
<p>As a result of all this I have been a proponent for the open source alternatives, like GNU/Linux and BSD, for a very long time. Not only that, I also believe that the open source alternatives are much better in many technical areas.</p>
<p>I have also always been very much against <a href="https://www.unixsheikh.com/articles/the-typical-discussions-about-bsd-vs-linux.html">The typical discussions about BSD vs Linux</a>, and as I wrote in my article back then, I have always believed that the different open source projects can help each other and cooperate, and that end-users should only debate such issues from a technical stand point rather than personal preference.</p>
<p>Whenever it has been possible, I have proposed people, both private and in the industry, to change the operating systems they use to open source alternatives, and when people have been receptive to my advocacy I have helped them migrate from Microsoft Windows on their workstations to BSD or Linux. And likewise on the server side. This has been a truly successful endeavor and I have honestly never experienced a dissatisfied person or company.</p>
<p>However, things are beginning to change in the GNU/Linux world as more and more corporations want to control the direction of the Linux communities. Due to the structure and organization of GNU/Linux as an operating system, it is unfortunately susceptible to these influences, and while it is still open source, and still not anywhere near the bad things that is going on with the proprietary alternatives, some opt-out features have slowly been introduced into both the kernel and systemd.</p>
<p>You can still choose to opt-out of these features and go your merry way, but as an open source enthusiast and proponent, and as a privacy concerned individual, perhaps the better approach is to migrate systems to something where you don't have to concern yourself with "creepware".</p>
<p>As a system administrator I don't want to worry about whether I am going to be surprised the next time I upgrade a system, and I don't want to keep a list of spyware I have to remember to opt-out of whenever I run one of these systems.</p>
<p>Several Linux distributions have decided (not only because of privacy opt-out issues, but other issues as well) to implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Linux_distributions_without_systemd">other init solutions than systemd</a>, but with the situation going on in the kernel development, and with many third party applications becoming more and dependent upon systemd, the problems are spreading to other parts of the operating system and I believe this is becoming an uphill battle.</p>
<p>I don't believe the future of GNU/Linux looks as bright as it used to, and as a possible alternative solution I suggest migrating everything (when possible) to something a bit more sane, like the BSD projects.</p>

<h2 id="fragmented">Linux is fragmented</h2>
<p>In 1983 Richard Stallman announced his intent to start coding the GNU Project in a Usenet message. By June 1987, the project had accumulated and developed free and open source software for an assembler, an almost finished portable optimizing C compiler (GCC), an editor (GNU Emacs), and various Unix utilities, such as ls, grep, awk, make and ld.</p>
<p>In 1991, the Linux kernel appeared, developed outside the GNU project by Linus Torvalds, and in December 1992 it was made available under version 2 of the GNU General Public License. Combined with the operating system utilities already developed by the GNU project, it became the GNU/Linux operating system, better known as just "Linux".</p>
<p>Then came the Linux distributions. Different projects took the Linux kernel, the GNU tools and libraries, additional third party software, documentation, the X Window System, a window manager, and a desktop environment, and combined those components into the distributions. Different distributions focused on different goals, some put focus on the desktop while others put their main focus on servers, and again others tried to provide a multi-purpose operating system.</p>
<p>In the past all these different components and projects where developed by open source enthusiasts and communities and the passion for programming and open source was the driving force.</p>
<p>This is no longer the case! Please see <a href="https://unixsheikh.com/articles/the-real-motivation-behind-systemd.html">The real motivation behind systemd</a>.</p>

<p>Linus Torvalds has many times made it very clear that he doesn't care about what goes on in the "Linux world", all he cares about is the kernel development, and on January 6, 2020 in the "Moderated Discussions" forum at <a href="https://www.realworldtech.com/forum/?threadid=189711&amp;curpostid=189841">realworldtech.com</a>, Linus Torvalds answered a user's question, with an absolute jaw-dropping comment, about a year-old kernel maintenance controversy that heavily impacted the ZFS on Linux project.</p>
<p>After answering the user's actual question, Torvalds went on to make very wrong and damaging claims about the ZFS filesystem. Torvalds said:</p>
<blockquote>
It (ZFS) was always more of a buzzword than anything else.
</blockquote>
<p>By that statements Linus Torvalds has just reduced more that 15 years of development of one of the most robust and popular filesystems in the world into a "buzzword"!</p>
<p>ZFS is described as "The last word in filesystems". It is a combined filesystem and logical volume manager originally designed by Sun Microsystems. ZFS is a stable, fast, secure, and future-proof filesystem. It is scalable, and includes extensive protection against data corruption, support for high storage capacities, a maximum 16 Exabyte file size, and a maximum 256 Quadrillion Zettabytes storage with no limit on number of filesystems (datasets) or files, efficient data compression, snapshots and copy-on-write clones, continuous integrity checking and automatic repair, RAID-Z, native NFSv4 ACLs, and can be very precisely configured.</p>
<p>The two main implementations, by Oracle and by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenZFS">OpenZFS</a> project, are extremely similar, making ZFS widely available within Unix-like systems.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the Wikipedia article, OpenZFS is an umbrella project aimed at bringing together individuals and companies that use the ZFS file system and work on its improvements, aiming as well at making ZFS more widely used and developed in an open-source manner. OpenZFS brings together developers from the illumos, Linux, FreeBSD, and macOS platforms, and a wide range of companies. High-level goals of the project include raising awareness of the quality, utility and availability of open-source implementations of ZFS, encouraging open communication about ongoing efforts toward improving open-source variants of ZFS, and ensuring consistent reliability, functionality and performance of all distributions of ZFS.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/commits/master">OpenZFS on Linux</a>, which is the Linux part of the project, has currently 345 active contributors with more that 5.600 commits, and commits are being made on an almost daily basis!</p>
<p>Some of the worlds biggest CDN and data storage services runs ZFS on either FreeBSD or Linux!</p>
<p>In another situation Linus Torvalds gave an interview on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mysM-V5h9z8">TFiR: open source and Emerging Tech YouTube channel</a> about Linux on the desktop in which he makes another amazing statement saying that Linux still isn't ready for the desktop and that perhaps <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrome_OS">Chrome OS</a> is the solution to that problem.</p>
<p>These and many other statements by Linus Torvalds shows that Torvalds should avoid authoritative statements about projects he's unfamiliar with, but more importantly they also show that Linux as an operating system has no real direction and no clear management because the kernel development is performed in isolation from the rest of the Linux world.</p>
<p>Linus Torvalds is generally also very open to the rapid influence by corporate interests and his perspective on security is also worrying.</p>
<p>In 2009 Linus Torvalds admitted that the kernel development is getting out of control.</p>
<blockquote>
We're getting bloated and huge. Yes, it's a problem ... Uh, I'd love to say we have a plan ... I mean, sometimes it's a bit sad that we are definitely not the streamlined, small, hyper-efficient kernel that I envisioned 15 years ago ... The kernel is huge and bloated, and our icache footprint is scary. I mean, there is no question about that. And whenever we add a new feature, it only gets worse.
</blockquote>
<p>At LinuxCon 2014, he said that he thinks the bloat situation is better because modern PCs are a lot faster!</p>
<blockquote>
We've been bloating the kernel over the last 20 years, but hardware has grown faster.
</blockquote>
<p>This is a very problematic attitude.</p>
<p>When software gets bloated it not only becomes more insecure and more error prone, but it also becomes much slower. Thinking that the problem goes away because hardware becomes faster is an immature attitude. In this day and age we need to optimize software so that less power is required, we need to save power and limit pollution.</p>
<p>In a 2007 interview "Why I quit": kernel developer Con Kolivas he stated:</p>
<blockquote>
If there is any one big problem with kernel development and Linux it is the complete disconnection of the development process from normal users. You know, the ones who constitute 99.9% of the Linux user base. The Linux kernel …</blockquote></article></div>

Hedge funds are in competition with each other, it is a stretch to think that another fund didn’t notice an overload of shorts but some disorganized memeing redditors did</p><p>3) It’s by extension even more improbable to think that the memeing redditors were able to coordinate and act quickly enough without tipping off hedge funds / hfts</p><p>4) A lot of the technicals being spread around about the situation are plain false, which reveals a lot of people are just parroting instead of knowing what their actually doing</p><p>5) As the situation grows more mainstream, more people buy in due to meme / FOMO / being enchanted by the narrative.</p><p>6) WSB consensus seems split between “sell high after friday spike”, and “hold long, gamestock is viable”. The former is just gambling, hoping their sell order goes through at the right price, the later is just disillusion. </p><p>7) The later you bought the stocks, the more you have to lose. That means mainstream &gt; influencers &gt; internet savy / twitter &gt; reddit &gt; early investors / wall street in terms of risk. Each tier depends on the next to not want to miss out and buy the stocks.</p><p>8) Going back to 6), what is the exit strategy of most of the r/WSB crowd? What is preventing a race to the bottom where everyone thinks “let me sell before the crash?”. Selling high is hard, especially in pure speculation.</p><p>—</p><p>If you made money, I am happy for you, but please try to cash out at least some of the earnings before the crash. I know the comradeship of “diamond hands” is romantic, but try to protect yourself before you get burned. Don’t think that group support will last when things go sour.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today I want to talk about an idea that I don’t think has much purchase in real-world politics but seems to loom large both on the internet and in academic circles — the idea that new real estate development activity actually <em>causes gentrification</em> through some kind of induced demand phenomenon. </p><p>Nathan Robinson in his <a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2021/01/the-only-thing-worse-than-a-nimby-is-a-yimby">anti-YIMBY screed</a> explores a scenario in which replacing smaller buildings with larger ones increases housing scarcity even while adding units because “we're luring rich people from elsewhere to our city.” He’s doing a thought-experiment, but clearly one he thinks is plausible, while <a href="https://shelterforce.org/2018/11/05/heres-what-we-actually-know-about-market-rate-housing-development-and-displacement/">Amee Chew</a> in a 2018 Shelterforce article states that “numerous studies show that market-rate housing development has price ripple effects on surrounding neighborhoods, driving up rents and increasing the burden on lower-income households.”</p><p>Chew’s studies don’t really say that (more on this later) but the studies do say what I also know from personal experience which is that people living through a gentrification process often <em>say</em> this is what’s going on. This is all exacerbated by the fact that many people, as in this recent Washington Post article about Mt Pleasant, <em>define</em> gentrification as the presence of new-built condos with chain store retail on the ground floor. And it is definitely true that if what you mean by “gentrification” is “new buildings and chain stores” then blocking new buildings and chain stores will block gentrification.</p><p>But the argument here is supposed to be about prices, displacement, and ultimately people’s living standards. </p><p>And the induced demand objection fails on four scores:</p><ul><li><p>It is empirically false, at least most of the time. </p></li><li><p>Accepting its logic would counsel against <em>all</em> efforts to improve quality of life.</p></li><li><p>If it were true, it still wouldn’t follow that new construction is bad.</p></li><li><p>It misconstrues what the YIMBY proposal is in the first place.</p></li></ul><p>As I say, I don’t really believe that people believing in the induced demand argument explains any of the proximate barriers to housing reform. But it does come up a lot online, so I’d like to have a resource for explaining to people what’s wrong with it.</p><h4>The induced demand intuition</h4><p>The WMATA Green Line was extended to Columbia Heights in 1999, which meant that by 2003 a young person such as myself looking for a cheap place to live in a walkable neighborhood with good access to mass transit might pick it blindly off Google Maps and Craigslist as a good place to rent a basement apartment. </p><p>It was actually a fairly dismal neighborhood at the time, largely because the immediate vicinity of the metro station was a bunch of unsightly vacant lots and construction sites. But if you went to the no-longer-extant Columbia Heights Coffee Shop, all the talk among the gentrifiers was “there’s going to be a Target soon.” And, indeed, a few years later the construction sites were transformed into apartment buildings and retail, so if you go today, the immediate environs of the Metro station feature a Giant, a Target, a Best Buy, a Wawa, a Starbucks, and a bunch of other national chains along with some locally owned businesses. Then the slightly less proximate commercial areas either north on 14th Street or over on 11th Street are thriving ecologies of local businesses.     </p><p>There is clearly some kind of flywheel effect whereby the new retail amenities make the neighborhood a better place to live, which attracts more (and more affluent) residents, which in turn makes it a more attractive place to locate your business. </p><p>Now I think it’s obvious that the start of the Columbia Heights flywheel was the opening of the Green Line, especially given the largest context of falling urban crime during this period. The reason you could find white people in a coffee shop talking about how they were looking forward to the Target opening is that the gentrification cycle was already underway. Neighborhoods normally experience an initial hipster phase of gentrification (typified by dive bars, yoga studios, and independent coffee shops) <em>before</em> the major real estate developments and national chains arrive. </p><p>But we can argue intuitions all day — the real question is research.</p><h4>Empirically, more supply lowers prices</h4><p>Back when I wrote <em>The Rent Is Too Damn High</em>, I said that the impact of new development on hyper-local prices was theoretically ambiguous and the important thing was to look at city-wide effects that are not. </p><p>Fortunately, the past few years have seen a good amount of empirical work on this question. And it turns out that in most cases studied, new units reduce prices even on a very local scale. </p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/oplls6utgf7z6ih/Pennington_JMP.pdf?dl=0">Kate Pennington</a>’s recent study of San Francisco is very precise: “I find that rents fall by 2% for parcels within 100m of new construction. Renters’ risk of being displaced to a lower-income neighborhood falls by 17%. Both effects decay linearly to zero within 1.5km.”</p></li><li><p><a href="https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/7fc2bf_ee1737c3c9d4468881bf1434814a6f8f.pdf">Xiaodi Li</a> looked at New York: “For every 10% increase in the housing stock, rents decrease 1% and sales prices also decrease within 500 feet.”</p></li><li><p><a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/the-left-nimby-canon">Brian Asquith, Evan Mast, and Davin Reed</a> look specifically at new market-rate housing in low-income neighborhoods in eleven cities and find: “New buildings decrease nearby rents by 5 to 7 percent relative to locations slightly farther away or developed later, and they increase in-migration from low-income areas.”</p></li></ul><p>There are some more studies along these lines, but I don’t want to inundate you with them because I do agree that the impact is theoretically ambiguous and someday, someone, somewhere will find the opposite result. </p><p>It is striking, though, that induced demand theory doesn’t yet have its Card &amp; Kruger paper that changed the game on the minimum wage. There is no Arin Dube of induced demand theory who’s published a series of rigorous empirical papers demonstrating that there’s something weird in this market. Instead you get this from Chew:</p><blockquote><p>Studies show that market-rate housing development is linked to the mass displacement of neighboring low-income residents (Davidson and Lees&nbsp;<a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1068/a3739">2005</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.clarku.edu/mdavidson/files/2012/02/Davidson-Lees-2010-New-Build-Gentrification.pdf">2010</a>; Pearsall&nbsp;<a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1068/c08126">2010</a>). Such displacement occurs even when low-income housing is not directly demolished and destroyed to make way for new development—because it operates through indirect and exclusionary means, such as “price shadowing” (Davidson and Lees&nbsp;<a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1068/a3739">2005</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.clarku.edu/mdavidson/files/2012/02/Davidson-Lees-2010-New-Build-Gentrification.pdf">2010</a>). Market-rate housing production causes significant price impacts in surrounding neighborhoods, raising area rents and real estate taxes (Oliva&nbsp;<a href="https://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/handle/1903/4205/umi-umd-4016.pdf;sequence=1">2006</a>; Pearsall&nbsp;<a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1068/c08126">2010</a>; Zuk and Chapple&nbsp;<a href="http://www.urbandisplacement.org/sites/default/files/images/udp_research_brief_052316.pdf">2016</a>).&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>So I checked the links.</p><p>The two Davidson and Lees papers are concerned with a definitional question in urban geography. According to them, the traditional meaning of gentrification in the literature is something like “rich people move into old homes and renovate them.” They argue that we should extend the definition to include things like new mixed-use housing and retail developments in underused industrial spaces. They <em>assert</em> but do not demonstrate that “price shadowing” occurs in these cases, and then argue that this sort of phenomenon ought to count as gentrification.</p><p><a href="https://www.urbandisplacement.org/sites/default/files/images/udp_research_brief_052316.pdf">Zuk and Chapple</a> actually say: “At the regional level, both market-rate and subsidized housing reduce displacement pressures, but subsidized housing has over double the impact of market-rate units.”</p><p>Pearsall says that cleaning up brownfields raises prices in nearby Census tracts, which is interesting and raises the question of whether “make people live near toxic waste” is really the affordable housing strategy we want. </p><p>Last we get to Oliva, who at last actually finds induced demand. He looks at the Inner Harbor project in Baltimore which transformed a largely derelict stretch of waterfront into a tourist attraction featuring a convention center, an amazing aquarium, a cool park, and a bunch of hotels and restaurants. Note that in this case promoting economic development was the intended goal of the initiative (Baltimore is poor) and the point of his study is that it was a limited success story — home values did rise, but “this impact has been far more pronounced on the prices of properties located within a short distance from the water even decades after the initial projects on the waterfront were started.”</p><p>This is all good empirical work. But note that I don’t think anyone has ever argued that building an aquarium will reduce housing cost burdens. The Inner Harbor is (by design) a tourist attraction. A couple of weeks ago, I took my kid to the Maryland Zoo in Baltimore, then we drove down to the Inner Harbor, got some takeout from Shake Shack, walked around waterfront, and bought a couple of bottles of water somewhere. This is what a successful tourist attraction is supposed to accomplish — you bring in retail dollars and tax revenue. We’ll come back post-pandemic and see the aquarium. It’s a nice place to visit. And Oliva shows that if you build a nice place to visit in the middle of a city, then the immediately adjacent homes become more desirable. Similarly, per Pearsall, if you clean up a brownfield the adjacent homes become more desirable.</p><p>New infill housing appears to empirically neutralize the induced demand by simultaneously inducing supply. But conceptually there’s a question here — is it bad to make neighborhoods better places to live? </p><h4>Better neighborhoods are better</h4><p>Here’s the problem. Consider the following argument:</p><ol><li><p>Constructing new buildings will bring new retail amenities to the neighborhood.</p></li><li><p>New amenities will make the neighborhood a more attractive place to live.</p></li><li><p>Because the neighborhood is now more attractive, prices will rise.</p></li><li><p>Rising prices will displace some existing residents.</p></li><li><p>Therefore we shouldn’t allow new buildings to be constructed.</p></li></ol><p>In place of (1) you could put all kinds of things:</p><ul><li><p>Constructing a new park</p></li><li><p>Reducing the crime rate</p></li><li><p>Renovating the local high school</p></li><li><p>Improving bus service to downtown</p></li><li><p>Fixing the potholes</p></li></ul><p>In other words, you could imagine this kind of logic becoming an infinite cycle of bad urban policy. Defund police will lead to more murders? Well, that’s good for housing affordability. …</p></div></div>

<p>Since January 2007 it is required to take DNA of unidentified human remains or of unidentified human body parts, before they are buried. The police therefore started the project DNA database. The purpose of this project is to dig up all unidentified human remains or unidentified human body parts, that were buried in the Netherlands before 2007, and to identify these human remains or human body parts. The DNA material comes in the DNA-database for Missing Persons (managed by the police).</p>

			<p>I have never used WhatsApp, and never will. Despite this, I still feel the need to write an article about WhatsApp since it’s the perfect case study to help understand a class of businesses models I call “user domestication”. The domestication of users is high on my list of problems plaguing the human race, and is worth a detailed explanation.</p>
<p>With the meta-explanation out of the way, let us begin.</p>
<h2 id="whatsapps-rise">WhatsApp’s rise</h2>
<p>For those unfamiliar, WhatsApp is a tool that makes it convenient and easy to help Facebook further its core mission: the optimization and auctioning of human behavior (colloquially known as “targeted advertising”). It originally persuaded people to consent to this by allowing them to send text to each other over the Internet, something that was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_instant_messaging_protocols">already possible</a>, and combining an easy-to-learn UI with successful marketing. It then expanded to include features such as free voice and video calls. Free calls helped it grow to become the de-facto communication platform in many other countries.</p>
<p>Having its own proprietary chat system incompatible with other clients allowed WhatsApp to build a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect">network effect</a>: WhatsApp’s existing users were held captive by the fact that leaving WhatsApp meant losing the ability to communicate with WhatsApp users. People switching from WhatsApp must convince all their friends to switch, too; this includes less technically inclined friends who had a hard time learning WhatsApp in the first place.</p>
<p>In a WhatsApp world, people who want to keep in touch must abide by the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone can only use the proprietary WhatsApp client to send messages; developing alternative clients isn’t supported.</li>
<li>Everyone’s mobile device must run an operating system supported by said client. Since WhatsApp developers will only write a client for popular operating systems, the Android and iOS duopoly strengthens.</li>
<li>Users fully depend on WhatsApp developers. If WhatsApp developers decide to include user-hostile features in the app, users must go with it. They can’t switch to a different server or client without switching away from WhatsApp and losing the ability to communicate with all their WhatsApp contacts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="user-domestication">User domestication</h2>
<p>WhatsApp rose by trapping previously-free beings in their corral and changing their habits to create dependence on masters. Over time, this made it difficult or impossible to return to their previous lifestyle. That process should sound familiar: it’s eerily similar to the domestication of animals. I call this type of vendor lock-in <strong>user domestication:</strong> the removal of user autonomy to trap users into serving vendors.</p>
<p>I chose this metaphor because animal domestication is a gradual process that isn’t always deliberate, and typically revolves around one group becoming dependent upon another. For example: there’s evidence that domestication of dogs began with socialization, resulting in not-entirely-artificial selection promoting genes that resulted in more friendliness with and dependence upon humans.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Whether it happens on purpose or by accident, user domestication almost always follows the same three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>A high level of dependence given from users to a software vendor</li>
<li>An inability for users to control their software, through at least one of the following methods:
<ol>
<li>Preventing modification of the software</li>
<li>Preventing migration onto a different platform</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The exploitation of now-captive users who are unable to resist</li>
</ol>
<p>The completion of the first two steps left WhatsApp users vulnerable to user domestication. With investors to answer to, they had every incentive to implement user-hostile features without consequence.</p>
<p>So, of course, they did.</p>
<h2 id="whatsapps-descent">WhatsApp’s descent</h2>
<p>Domestication has a purpose: it enables a master species to exploit the domesticated species for its own gain.</p>
<p>Recently, WhatsApp updated its privacy policy to allow sharing data with its parent, Facebook. Users who agreed to use WhatsApp under its previous privacy policy had two options: agree to the new policy or be unable to use WhatsApp again. The WhatsApp privacy policy update is a classic bait-and-switch: WhatsApp lured users in with a sleek interface and the impression of privacy, domesticated them to remove their autonomy to migrate, and then backtracked on its previous commitment to privacy with minimal consequence. Each step in this process enabled the next; had user domestication not taken place, it would be easy for most users to switch away with minimal friction.</p>
<p>Those of us who were sounding the alarm a few years ago experienced a brief moment of sadistic bliss when our titles were upgraded from “annoying and paranoid conspiracy theorists” to just “annoying”.</p>
<h3 id="an-attempt-at-damage-control">An attempt at damage control</h3>
<p>The bait-and-switch operation incurred backlash significant enough for a noticeable minority of users to actually migrate; this number turned out to be slightly more than the rounding error WhatsApp was likely expecting. In response, WhatsApp delayed the change and published the following ad:</p>
<picture>
	<source srcset="https://seirdy.one/p/whatsapp_ad_dark.3e9ad6a0c2c8c377c4583cf92bddcd47.avif" type="image/avif" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)">

	<source srcset="https://seirdy.one/p/whatsapp_ad_dark.8792c2187d444ebc32bf8c386ea0cda9.png" type="image/png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)">
	<source srcset="https://seirdy.one/p/whatsapp_ad.94ed78578e240dfd57f833807f8167ed.avif" type="image/avif">
	<source srcset="https://seirdy.one/p/whatsapp_ad.9efe174613a8b02274fa62feff7b8374.webp" type="image/webp">

	<img width="600" src="https://seirdy.one/p/whatsapp_ad.png" alt="WhatsApp ad describing data not collected">
</picture>

<p>The ad lists various data that WhatsApp doesn’t collect or share. Allaying data collection concerns by listing data <em>not</em> collected is misleading. WhatsApp doesn’t collect hair samples or retinal scans either; not collecting that information doesn’t mean it respects privacy because it doesn’t change the information WhatsApp <em>does</em> collect.</p>
<p>The ad denies “keep[ing] logs of who everyone is messaging or calling”. Collecting data is not the same as “keeping logs”; it’s possible for metadata to be fed into an algorithm before being discarded. A model can thus learn that two users call each other frequently without keeping logs of the metadata for each call. The fact that they specifically chose to phrase this line around logging implies that WhatsApp either already collects this class of data or has deliberately left the door open to collecting it in the future.</p>
<p>A stroll through WhatsApp’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210124061525/https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/privacy-policy/?lang=en">actual privacy policy</a> at the time reveals that they do collect considerable metadata used for marketing through Facebook.</p>
<h2 id="software-freedom">Software freedom</h2>
<p>With user domestication, providing useful software to users is a means to the end of exploiting them. The alternative is simple: make serving users the end in and of itself.</p>
<p>To prevent being controlled by software, users must be in control. Software that allows users to be in control is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">free software</a>. The word “free” in this context refers to freedom rather than price. Software freedom is similar to the concept of open-source, but the latter is focused on practical benefits rather than ethics. A less ambiguous term that neutrally refers to both free and open-source software is <strong><abbr title="free and open-source software">FOSS</abbr></strong>.</p>
<p>Others have <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">explained</a> the concepts underpinning free software better than I can, so I won’t go into detail. It comes down to four essential freedoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose</li>
<li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish</li>
<li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others</li>
<li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="making-money-with-foss">Making money with FOSS</h3>
<p>The most common objection I hear is that FOSS makes it harder to make money.</p>
<p>The key to making money with FOSS is to make software a <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Complement">commoditized complement</a> of other, more profitable services. Examples of such services include selling support, customization, consulting, training, managed hosting, hardware, and certifications. Plenty of companies use this approach instead of building proprietary software: Red Hat, Collabora, System76, Purism, Canonical, SUSE, Hashicorp, Databricks, and Gradle are some names that come to mind.</p>
<p>Managed hosting isn’t a basket worth all your eggs if giants like AWS can do the same at a lower price. Being the developer can give an edge in areas like customization, support, and training; it doesn’t offer as obvious an advantage when it comes to hosting.</p>
<h2 id="foss-isnt-always-enough">FOSS isn’t always enough</h2>
<p>Free software is a necessary but sometimes insufficient requirement to build domestication immunity. Two more measures include <strong>simplicity</strong> and <strong>open platforms.</strong></p>
<h3 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h3>
<p>When software grows too complex, it needs to be maintained by a large team. Users who disagree with a vendor can’t easily fork and maintain a multi-million-line codebase, especially if the software in question potentially contains security vulnerabilities. Dependence on the vendor can grow quite problematic when complexity causes development costs to skyrocket; the vendor might resort to implementing user-hostile features to stay afloat.</p>
<p>Complex software that can’t be developed by a different group of people creates dependence, step one of user domestication. That alone is enough to open the door to problematic developments.</p>
<h4 id="case-study-mozilla-and-the-web">Case study: Mozilla and the Web</h4>
<p>Mozilla was a ray of hope in the browser wars, a space dominated by adtech, surveillance, and vendor lock-in. Unfortunately, developing a browser engine is a monumental task difficult enough for Opera and Microsoft to give up and re-skin Chromium. Browsers are more than the document readers they were meant to be: they’ve evolved into application runtimes with their own stacks for GPU acceleration, Bluetooth, permissions, device enumeration, bundled media codecs, <abbr title="digital rights management">DRM</abbr><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, extension APIs, developer tools…the list goes on. It takes billions of dollars a year to respond to vulnerabilities in such a massive attack surface and keep up with a standard that grows at such a worrying rate. Those billions have to come from somewhere.</p>
<p>Mozilla ended up having to make major compromises to stay afloat. It cut search deals with blatantly user-hostile companies, and bundled the browser with <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/advancingcontent/2014/02/11/publisher-transformation-with-users-at-the-center/">ads</a> and bloatware such as a partially ad-funded proprietary bookmarking SaaS called <a href="https://dustri.org/b/firefox-youre-supposed-to-be-in-my-pocket-not-the-other-way-around.html">Pocket</a>. Since acquiring Pocket (to diversify its sources of income), Mozilla hasn’t yet delivered on its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/27/mozilla-pockets-pocket-in-first-acquisition/">earlier statements</a> saying it would open-source its code: while the clients have been open-sourced, the server code remains proprietary. Open-sourcing this and re-writing portions if necessary …</p></section></article></div></div>

<p>Earlier this year, Apple removed RadickRadio from its App Store. It looked&nbsp;like a music app, like Spotify, and streamed a range of genres and artists. But once users with an Iranian IP address opened it, the true face of RadickRadio revealed itself — as Snapp, Iran’s first ride-hailing app.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The “RadickRadio” cover story was one of many subterfuges that Snapp has had to use to survive, as Iran has been isolated by the world economically and politically over the past four years. Citing U.S. sanctions, Apple blocked the country’s access to the App Store in 2018, forcing Snapp to maneuver through marketplaces channels in covert ways.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the force of those sanctions, Snapp has thrived. Launched in 2014 as “Taxi Yaab,” Snapp is now twice the size of Careem, the Dubai-based ride-hailing app with operations in 15 countries in the Middle East and South Asia, which was acquired by Uber in March 2019 for $3.1 billion. After three years of explosive growth, Snapp’s service in Iran, the core of its business model, has greater than&nbsp;85% market share and operates in 34 cities with 1.5 million drivers. It facilitates more than 2 million taxi rides a day.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>How did Taxi Yaab become Snapp?</strong></h3>



<p>When Taxi Yaab first launched in 2014, it didn’t take off. Dr. Mahmoud Fouz, the company’s Syrian German co-founder, told <em>Rest of World</em> that this was a consequence of “entering the market too early.” While 3G networks had already been introduced in Iran, coverage was limited, and packages were expensive; it took time for people to adopt it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike other countries in the region, such as <a href="https://www.drivearabia.com/news/2020/06/23/saudi-arabia-to-set-maximum-limit-on-car-ownership/">Saudi Arabia</a>, where there is an average of 1.38 cars per household, Taxi Yaab did not face the challenge of selling taxi culture to its customers. Iranians were used to hopping into unofficial, unlicensed taxis. Where the app failed was in incorporating a staple of the daily Iranian commute into its product: haggling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Taxi Yaab’s first iteration offered an estimated price range for a route. Its customers preferred the analog custom of bargaining with drivers in person to determine their fare. Recognizing this, the team developed the product further and <a href="https://snapp.ir/about">relaunched it as<em> </em>Snapp in 2015</a>. Its only major competitor is <a href="https://tapsi.ir/">Tap30</a>, which holds the other 15% of the market and launched in 2016. (While Snapp and Tap30 are similar, the latter also offers its app in Azeri, in addition to Persian and English, for Turkish speakers in the country’s north.)</p>



<p>Snapp’s relaunch also catered to its widening ambitions. The company knew that it wanted to expand beyond ride hailing. Removing “taxi” from its name made business sense.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fouz and his cofounder, Eyad Al Kasser, saw an opportunity to introduce and integrate other basic services into Snapp, such as food delivery. Iran, a country of 80 million where international competition is minimal, was a gold mine. MTN — the South African telecommunications giant with a knack for investing in the region’s most precarious countries, including Yemen, Afghanistan, and Syria — backed their ambitions. Today, Snapp is considered a “super app,” a Swiss-army app with many core functions; its more than 20 services include flight and hotel bookings, food delivery, and telemedicine. Today, MTN owns 43% of it and is Snapp’s largest international investor.</p>

<h3><strong>How was Snapp affected by U.S. sanctions?</strong></h3>



<p>On the eve of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Fouz was betting on a victory for Hillary Clinton. The election arrived mere months after the Iran nuclear deal, when sanctions on the country were lifted by the U.S., and E.U. foreign investors were able to retrieve $100 billion in frozen assets overseas, oil trading resumed, and interest in Iran, the second-biggest market in the Middle East, was rekindled. The promise that Iran would be welcomed back into the global economy energized its nascent tech scene.</p>



<p>“With the nuclear deal on the table, there was excitement from international players from Europe to China to enter the market,” Fouz told <em>Rest of World</em>. “That completely died out when Trump was elected.” Although Iranians are hopeful that President-elect Joe Biden will reignite confidence in the country, the country remains an uncertain terrain for foreign investors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Trump moved to apply “<a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/iransource/five-reasons-why-us-maximum-pressure-on-iran-has-backfired/">maximum</a> <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/07/02/iran-united-states-maximum-pressure/">pressure</a>” to the Iranian regime, Apple and Google pulled Snapp from their app stores in late 2017. Across the country, Snapp cabs stopped street side as the app’s navigation system, reliant on Google Maps, crashed without warning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response, Snapp adapted its product and distribution to circumvent American tech giants like Apple, Google, and Amazon altogether.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prior to May 2018, when fresh sanctions were imposed on Iran, MTN was able to repatriate more than $1 billion, though it still has approximately $170 million trapped in the country, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-08/mtn-considers-sale-of-stake-in-iran-ride-hailing-app-snapp?sref=QYWxDQ1o">its second-largest subscriber market.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Did Snapp fight back?</strong></h3>



<p>It did — as with its fake RadickRadio app.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There’s a lot of discussion on the policies that Apple has and how they’re monopolizing the system,” Fouz said. “We experienced it firsthand, before anyone else: the power that one company is wielding and how it can be turned against any other company at any time.”</p>



<p>After Apple and Google Play removed Iranian apps, Snapp shifted to a “progressive web app” format. Now, clicking on it opens a page in a web browser that closely simulates the experience of the original. While this format has drawbacks — no push notifications, limited offline presence — it was one of the only solutions available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Snapp’s isolation from the international tech market was not a choice, but it pushed it to become almost entirely self-sufficient. After Google began pulling its services from Iran in late 2017, Snapp decided to build a new navigation system in-house, to break its dependence on Google Maps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Its newfound independence was put to the test in November 2019, when the Iranian government pulled the plug on the internet amid nationwide anti-government protests, cutting the connection to the outside world for the longest period in the country’s history.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In November, when they shut down the internet, there was no need for Snapp to use the international internet, as the local intranet network was working,” Amir Rashidi, a researcher at the Center for Human Rights in Iran, told <em>Rest of World</em>. Two years earlier, when a similar internet shutdown occurred, Snapp had been unable to function.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, Snapp is independent of American hardware and software services. Instead of Amazon’s cloud computing servers, Snapp stores all its data locally in centers in Iran — which also opens it to the risk of surveillance by the Iranian government.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>What is the future of Snapp?</strong></h3>



<p>In 2017, MTN injected a further $22 million into the Iran Internet Group, Snapp’s parent company. This allowed it to invest in growing its other businesses: Bamilo, an online shopping platform; ZoodFood, a food delivery platform; and Pintapin, for hotel reservations. All three were rebranded and incorporated into Snapp’s platform in 2018: Bamilo is now Snapp! Market, ZoodFood is Snapp! Food, and Pintapin is Snapp! Trip.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although Snapp exists in a political bubble, it considers itself to be in the same league as Indonesia’s Gojek and Singapore’s Grab; both are so-called <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-06/indonesia-s-go-jek-joins-decacorn-ranks-with-10b-valuation?sref=QYWxDQ1o">decacorns</a>, private companies valued at more than $10 billion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those Asian companies, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/df06226e-152c-4c80-ac99-274481cfa291">rumored to be merging</a>, have secured additional funding by the promise of becoming super apps. “They are not just positioning themselves as ride-hailing companies but are evolving as a fintech company and service company,” Fouz said. “That’s the development that we also see for ourselves.”</p>



<p>Iran was one of the first countries to be hit severely with Covid-19, and it remains among the most affected nations in the region, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-iran/iran-reports-covid-19-death-every-five-minutes-hospitals-struggle-idUSKBN27B12N">with more than</a> 30,000 deaths. While ride hailing still constitutes the core of Snapp’s business, sales on its grocery and food-delivery services doubled and tripled respectively, which helped make up for the drop in transit activity as national lockdowns kept people indoors for months. Meanwhile, regional competitors like Careem saw declines of more than 80% in their business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The future of this group will no longer be primarily as a ride-hailing company but to our other services ” Fouz said. The company is shifting gears toward the other 20 services available on the platform, including e-commerce, flights and hotels, telemedicine, and even its own trading platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In August, it was revealed that MTN would be exiting the Middle East, starting with the sale of its <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/mtn-group-results-idUSL8N2F813B">75% stake in MTN Syria to TeleInvest</a>. However, MTN has confirmed that, as of August 10, there were no “<a href="https://www.mtn.com/mtn-group-and-mtn-irancell-confirm-that-there-are-no-plans-for-an-imminent-exit-by-the-group/">immediate plans</a>” to exit Iran.</p>

With at least half of developers against it, while the other half are for it.</p><h2>Lack Of Separation Of Concerns - The Most Common Objection To TailwindCSS</h2><p>The main difference between the two reactions, is that on one side, the developers who like Tailwind typically see the value of its unique style of writing CSS (within HTML), while developers who are against believe in the separation of concerns.</p><p>A few weeks ago, I had a great exchange on Hacker News about Tailwind, when its Founder Adam Wathan shared the recent success of his TailwindUI Kit sales. <a target="_blank" title="https://adamwathan.me/tailwindcss-from-side-project-byproduct-to-multi-mullion-dollar-business/" href="https://adamwathan.me/tailwindcss-from-side-project-byproduct-to-multi-mullion-dollar-business/">Over $2m in revenue.</a></p><p>It was an insightful exchange with a user about what TailwindCSS really is, which many found helpful.</p><p>If you’ve ever, upon hearing about TailwindCSS, sat down and wondered what all the hype was about, what it is, and why you would want to use it. This exchange might help lend some insight.</p><p>Below, I’ll summarize the exchange, and explain a little more about what TailwindCSS is and what its benefits to you as a developer might be.</p><p><strong>Here is the initial comment:</strong></p><p><a target="_blank" title="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24034453" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24034453">“I don't understand tailwind. The entire point of CSS is to separate style from structure. How does applying composable utility classes to all of your HTML elements differ from the old days of using HTML attributes for styling?”</a></p><p>It's a complaint i’ve heard often, and is a very fair one that, before I actually used Tailwind myself, I would have agreed with.</p><p><strong>Here was my reply:</strong></p><p><a target="_blank" title="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24034619" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24034619">“It really is one of those "you gotta try it" things.</a></p><p><a target="_blank" title="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24034619" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24034619">Once you get over the small learning curve, it gets to be VERY productive. Think of it as writing CSS at a slightly higher level of abstraction. That abstraction being in not having to edit two separate files or areas of your HTML document (unless you want to abstract further with @apply).</a></p><p><a target="_blank" title="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24034619" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24034619">Not having to go through the 'define identifier in element, then define in StyleSheet' workflow. With Tailwind you get the most commonly used style definitions pre-defined. But not so high level that it LOOKS pre-defined. Giving you room to customize greatly.</a></p><p><a target="_blank" title="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24034619" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24034619">How could it not be faster?</a></p><p><a target="_blank" title="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24034619" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24034619">I recently completed a theme in Tailwind, mostly to get the hang of it: https://planflow.dev/free-themes/. And managed to go from idea to finished theme in about 4-5 days. That's the fastest I've ever done it.”</a></p><p>Separating content from style was more of a necessity when the styles that classes or ID's referred to <a target="_blank" title="https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/" href="https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/">lacked consistency</a>.</p><p>If you know exactly what styles a class or ID is referring to within your HTML, in other words it's 'modularized', then separation of concerns is less of a need.</p><p>In the same way that developers initially reacted negatively to the use of JSX, which mixed HTML and JavaScript in React, I believe Tailwind’s unique and very productive style of mixing HTML with predefined style preset classes will eventually win most developers over.</p><h3>The Best Way To See The Benefit Is To Just Try It</h3><p>With many developers who have an aversion to Tailwind, it is very often the case that they have simply not used it, or used it enough to see the immense productivity benefits that it has.</p><p>The best advice I can give to any developer wanting to know more about it is to simply try it and see for yourself. </p><p>To start you off here, and wet your feet a bit, let’s dive into what tailwind actually is a bit deeper and see how we can get set up with it.</p><h4>So what is TailwindCSS?</h4><p>Tailwind is effectively a set of pre-defined CSS classes that are defined at a level of detail abstract enough that it makes them reusable within a multitude of contexts.</p><h4>How do I get set up with it?</h4><p><strong>Tailwind can be set up in three different ways:</strong></p><p>-	<a target="_blank" title="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#using-tailwind-via-cdn" href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#using-tailwind-via-cdn">By including a Tailwind CDN link</a></p><p>-	<a target="_blank" title="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#installing-tailwind-css-as-a-post-css-plugin" href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#installing-tailwind-css-as-a-post-css-plugin">https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#inst</a>alling-tailwind-css-as-a-post-css-plugin</p><p>-	<a target="_blank" title="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#using-tailwind-without-post-css" href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#using-tailwind-without-post-css">By installing via npm (without PostCSS)</a></p><p>You can click on any one of these links to get in depth instructions on how to complete these installations.</p><p>To use Tailwind once installed, simply include the classes you’d like to use within the relevant HTML elements. In the same way that you’d include your normal CSS classes, had you built them yourself.</p><h4>How will it benefit me?</h4><p>The primary benefit of using Tailwind, and why it leads to such a massive increase in productivity is that it allows you as a developer to operate at a higher level of abstraction when it comes to writing CSS. </p><p>Because Tailwind classes are not very specific, they give you enough flexibility to customize to a high degree (unlike Twitter Bootstrap classes), while at the same time, saving you a lot of time in having to write out tedious CSS styles yourself.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			<!-- Article Start -->
			
<p>In May 2020, former president Donald Trump wrote on Twitter and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/01/facebook-staff-angry--zuckerberg.html">Facebook</a>, “When the looting starts, the shooting starts,” encouraging the use of lethal force against Black Lives Matter protesters. Mark Zuckerberg, in communicating with his staff about why he decided not to take down the post, compared it with a statement the company removed from its platform earlier that year in India.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kapil Mishra, a Delhi politician from the governing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, had given the Delhi police <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/kapil-mishra-delhi-police-caa-protests-jaffrabad-6282870/">an ultimatum</a> a few months earlier on Twitter and Facebook. If the police didn’t clear the streets of protesters demanding a withdrawal of a discriminatory citizenship law, read the now deleted post, Mishra and his supporters would get out there and do it themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And he wasn’t alone. Other members of India’s Parliament, such as junior finance minister Anurag Thakur, were <a href="https://fb.watch/3975ctWeM7/">caught</a> on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDQYanaVApE">tape</a> at an election rally in Delhi, urging their supporters to “pump bullets” into “traitors.” When questioned by the media, Thakur suggested that they merely reflected the mood of the public in Delhi.</p>



<p>In the days after Mishra’s statements, mobs of BJP supporters carrying firearms, iron rods, and petrol bombs began attacking Muslim neighbourhoods, killing <a href="https://thewire.in/communalism/delhi-riots-kapil-mishra-minority-commission-report">53 people</a> and injuring another 250 in the heart of India’s capital. The Delhi government’s <a href="https://ia801906.us.archive.org/11/items/dmc-delhi-riot-fact-report-2020/-Delhi-riots-Fact-Finding-2020.pdf">fact-finding commission</a>, headed by an advocate of the Supreme Court, couldn’t have been clearer about what happened: “An incendiary public speech by BJP leader and former MLA Kapil Mishra on 23 February 2020 clearly incited violence in words and intent,” the report read.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet politicians like Kapil Mishra, <a href="https://twitter.com/ianuragthakur?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Anurag Thakur</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/p_sahibsingh?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Parvesh Verma </a>— all implicated in the government’s report — still have their Facebook and Twitter accounts, where they can spread their anti-Muslim message to their combined hundreds of thousands of followers. One post was removed, but their accounts remain. The social media platforms did nothing to block or limit their ability to make similar violent threats in the future or publicize policies that subscribe to Hindutva, an explicitly Hindu-supremacist ideology, despite India’s secular constitution. If these companies can silence a sitting United States President — the world’s most powerful official — why can’t they curb politicians with far less power, like Kapil Mishra?</p>



<p>There’s an obviously cynical conclusion to make: Donald Trump has lost his political power, while Kapil Mishra is only gaining his. The way that Facebook and Twitter have treated these two politicians highlights the fact that the platforms exist to protect the powerful and their own profits over everything else.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Populists don’t gain power in a vacuum. They build it using all the advantages that social media gives those who are not constrained by facts and are willing to make open calls for violence. The problem is not freedom of speech— that is sacrosanct. The problem is that, in the pursuit of profit, social media giants will amplify incendiary voices, giving them the freedom to reach more followers. It’s a systemic risk that governments need to tackle with emerging legislation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Social media algorithms are the automated editors that decide what you see in your feeds. They are built on massive volumes of data that platforms extract by surveilling everything their users do online. These algorithms are built to maximize our attention and keep us clicking and scrolling so that people can be shown more ads. This addictive design has not been programmed to discern what is true or what is false, what is harmful or what is not.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>While the most stringent regulations are currently in places like California and the European Union, the worst harm is happening far away from the West.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>My organization, <a href="https://www.reset.tech/">Reset</a>, was built to tackle these flaws at the heart of how social media is built. We advocate for stronger enforcement of rules and standards that can severely curtail the amplification of disinformation and hate. And we want to ensure that voices from the “rest of the world” are not lost in regulatory discussions of systemic risk. While the most stringent regulations are currently in places like California and the European Union, the worst harm is happening far away from the West.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In India, staff at Facebook can’t and don’t want to challenge political power that produces industrial quantities of hate and disinformation on their platform. In 2019, I was very surprised to find Facebook’s team in India asleep at the wheel ahead of a major “citizenship” counting exercise that <a href="https://www.fidh.org/en/region/asia/india/assam-the-biggest-mass-disenfranchisement-of-the-21stcentury">could disenfranchise</a> hundreds of thousands of genuine Indian citizens in the eastern state of Assam.</p>



<p>The government, with the help of the media, painted Muslim Bengalis in Assam as immigrants from Bangladesh. India’s home minister called them “<a href="https://www.thehindu.com/elections/lok-sabha-2019/infiltrators-are-termites-will-throw-them-out-amit-shah/article26805646.ece">termites</a>” and threatened to throw them out of the country. Despite <a href="https://avaazpress.s3.amazonaws.com/FINAL-Facebook%20in%20Assam_Megaphone%20for%20hate%20-%20Compressed%20(1).pdf">strong parallels</a> to how Rohingya Muslims were disenfranchised in Myanmar and Facebook’s disastrous role in fanning the flames of genocidal violence there, the company hadn’t seemed to have learned any lessons. It had no plan in place to tackle the huge spike in hate speech and lies that accompanied the citizenship exercise, because they had barely any content moderators who could read and write in the Assamese language.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/07/facebook-does-not-benefit-from-hate/">Public statements</a> by Facebook claimed that what people say and do on its site is merely a mirror of society. If Donald Trump incites a whole movement of white supremacists, it is because white supremacy exists in American society, or Hindu supremacy exists in Indian society, as demonstrated by members of India’s own democratically elected parliament. There is, of course, some truth to that, and traditional media has also helped fan the flames of hatred.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the “passive mirror” defense lodged by major social media companies is one of their greatest lies. Facebook’s own research in Germany showed that 64% of people who joined an extremist group did so because of Facebook’s recommendation tools (the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/facebook-group-recommendations-election/">later paused the feature</a>).&nbsp;In 2014, a former Facebook product manager <a href="http://andrewledvina.com/blog/2014-07-04-10-ways-facebook-is-the-devil/">wrote</a> that Facebook carries out experiments on users all the time — to make them click the like button, click on more ads, and spend more time on the site.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The violent events in Washington on January 6 played out under the full glare of the global press, forcing platforms to enforce their own policies on inciting violence. But in the U.S. as well as around the world, social media is still enabling the rise of more Donald Trumps, like Kapil Mishra or Anurag Thakur in India. It won’t stop unless we hit “reset” on Big Tech.</p>

        <p>Rust functions are surprisingly diverse, sitting at the intersection of multiple
language features which may take time to understand. In this post, we’ll walk through
those features and explain how they appear in function signatures, so you can be
well-equipped to understand functions you see in the wild, or identify the best way
to write the functions you need in your own code.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="table-of-contents">Table of Contents</h2>



<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

<div id="info-1">
    
    <div>
        <div>
            
<h3 id="describing-not-recommending">Describing, not Recommending</h3>

<p>This is a survey of what function signatures <em>can</em> look like in Rust, not a commentary
on what they <em>should</em> look like. Any one of the patterns shown here may be seen in the wild,
and learning to read other people’s code in any language is a valuable skill.</p>

<h3 id="part-of-a-series">Part of a Series</h3>

<p>This is the first of a pair of posts describing how to read Rust function signatures. Part 2,
tackling generic functions, is currently in the works.</p>

        </div>
    </div>
</div>


<h2 id="signatures">Signatures</h2>

<p>First things first, we need a function signature. Let’s start with something basic.</p>

<figure id="code-1">
    <a href="#skip-code-1">Skip this content.</a>
    
<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>example_1</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>i32</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>i32</span><span>;</span>
<span>//           ↑  ↑    ↑  ↑       ↑</span>
<span>//           |  |    |  |       |</span>
<span>//           | type  | type    type</span>
<span>//         pattern  pattern</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

    <figcaption><span>Code 1</span> <p>A simple function signature example.</p> <a href="#code-1"><span>↺</span></a></figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>This is a function that takes in two 32-bit integers (the <code>i32</code> type), and
returns a 32-bit integer as well. The arrow (<code>-&gt;</code>) indicates the return type.</p>

<p>Note that the types are all explicit. Rust <em>does</em> support type inference, but not for
function signatures. All parameter and return types must be specified.</p>



<p>We can also see that the pattern comes before the type, separated by a colon. This
<code>&lt;pattern&gt;: &lt;type&gt;</code> syntax matches Rust’s general syntax for
<dfn id="def-type-ascription">type ascription</dfn>, which is the Rust term for
specifying types explicitly.</p>

<h2 id="destructuring">Destructuring</h2>

<p>Notice too that I keep saying “pattern” instead of “variable name.” That’s because Rust
parameters are <dfn id="def-pattern" title="pattern">patterns</dfn>, meaning you can
destructure and bind against the internal structure of the types.</p>

<figure id="code-2">
    <a href="#skip-code-2">Skip this content.</a>
    
<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>IpV4Address</span><span>(</span><span>u8</span><span>,</span> <span>u8</span><span>,</span> <span>u8</span><span>,</span> <span>u8</span><span>);</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>print_ipv4addr</span><span>(</span><span>IpV4Address</span><span>(</span><span>o1</span><span>,</span> <span>o2</span><span>,</span> <span>o3</span><span>,</span> <span>o4</span><span>):</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>IpV4Address</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}.{}.{}.{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>o1</span><span>,</span> <span>o2</span><span>,</span> <span>o3</span><span>,</span> <span>o4</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>addr</span> <span>=</span> <span>IpV4Address</span><span>(</span><span>127</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>
    <span>print_ipv4addr</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>addr</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

    <figcaption><span>Code 2</span> <p>An example of a function with destructuring in its parameter list.</p> <a href="#code-2"><span>↺</span></a></figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>In this example, the <code>IpV4Address</code> type is destructured in the function signature, binding four
variables (<code>o1</code>, <code>o2</code>, <code>o3</code>, and <code>o4</code>) to the respective items in the tuple struct. These
variables are then used in the function body to print the address.</p>

<h3 id="refutability">Refutability</h3>

<p>One restriction of pattern matching in function signatures is that you can only use
<dfn id="dfn-irrefutable">irrefutable</dfn> patterns, meaning <em>patterns that always match</em>.
By contrast, <dfn id="dfn-refutable">refutable</dfn> patterns may sometimes fail to match,
perhaps because they specify only a single variant of an <code>enum</code> with multiple variants.
Refutable patterns can be used in a <code>match</code> expression or equivalent construct, where the
collection of patterns is checked for exhaustiveness (meaning all values are guaranteed to
match at least pattern), but patterns in function signatures are all alone, so they must
be irrefutable.</p>



<p>Here’s a table to help explain:</p>

<figure id="table-1">
    <a href="#skip-table-1">Skip this content.</a>
    <figcaption><span>Table 1</span> <p>A survey of pattern refutability.</p> <a href="#table-1"><span>↺</span></a></figcaption>
    
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Pattern</th>
      <th>Refutability</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>a</code></td>
      <td>Irrefutable</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>_</code></td>
      <td>Irrefutable</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>MyStruct { f1: x, f2: y }</code></td>
      <td>Irrefutable</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Some(b)</code></td>
      <td>Refutable</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Err(MyError::Foo)</code></td>
      <td>Refutable</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


    
</figure>

<p>The first three patterns could be found in a function signature. The last two could not.</p>

<h3 id="renaming">Renaming</h3>

<p>Another feature of declaring and assigning to new variables in a function
signature pattern is that you can create a variable with a name different from the
name of the field in the relevant type.</p>

<p>This can be useful when you want to locally use a different name than the name of
the field, and do so in a single line rather than binding to a local variable
with a new name in the body of the function.</p>

<h2 id="bindings">Bindings</h2>

<p>As we use patterns to bind, we can also set the kind of binding, which may be the
default (with no specifier) <code>mut</code>, <code>ref</code>, or <code>ref mut</code>. Collectively, the binding
options are as follows:</p>

<p>The <dfn id="dfn-binding">binding</dfn> pattern specifies how a binding should occur; should it be
by-value (meaning in Rust that it either takes ownership of the bound value, or makes a copy of it,
depending on whether the type of that value implements the <code>Copy</code> trait), by-reference, or
by-mutable-reference?</p>

<h3 id="owning-binding">Owning Binding</h3>

<p>An owning binding may display one of two behaviors, depending on the type involved in the binding.
If the type implements the <code>Copy</code> trait, then it will be copied to the new owner at the binding site.
If the type <em>does not</em> implement <code>Copy</code>, then it will be moved from the prior owner to the new owner
at the binding site.</p>



<p>To understand this, let’s talk about <code>Copy</code>. <code>Copy</code> is a trait indicating a type is “trivially copyable,”
meaning it can be copied with only a call to <code>memcpy</code>, so all the data contained in the structure
is contiguous; there are no pointers to chase. <code>Copy</code> tells us that copying a piece of data is fast.</p>

<p>At the same time, it improves ergonomics for certain types which may otherwise be tedious to use under
Rust’s ownership semantics. Imagine if number types (which all implement <code>Copy</code>) were moved any time
they were assigned. Something as simple as <code>x = y</code> would invalidate <code>y</code>, and thus make mathematical code
much more frustrating to write.</p>

<p>So, <code>Copy</code> pulls double-duty. It tells us something is cheap to copy, and it permits that copying to be
done implicitly.</p>

<p>In contexts where a type doesn’t implement <code>Copy</code> but <em>does</em> implement the <code>Clone</code> trait, you can instead
call <code>.clone()</code> on it explicitly to create a duplicate which will be moved into the new owner, without
invalidating the prior owner.</p>

<p>Now, what does this look like in the context of a binding?</p>

<figure id="code-3">
    <a href="#skip-code-3">Skip this content.</a>
    
<div><div><pre><code><span>#[derive(Clone,</span> <span>Debug)]</span>

    <span>let</span> <span>t</span> <span>=</span> <span>Thing</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// This moves `t` into the `takes_ownership` function.</span>
    <span>// `t` no longer owns any data, and thus is invalid</span>
    <span>// to use again.</span>

    <span>// `x` is the owner of whatever `Thing` is passed</span>
    <span>// into the `takes_ownership` function, and when</span>
    <span>// `x` goes out of scope at the end of the function,</span>
    <span>// any necessary cleanup of the data will be</span>
    <span>// performed (only relevant if the type in question</span>
    <span>// implements `Drop`).</span>
<span>}</span>

<p>Sometimes this kind of binding is exactly what you want. For example, you may have a need for a
“consuming builder,” one of two forms the Builder Pattern can take in Rust. In a consuming builder,
the builder type passes ownership of some data to the type that it’s building, because that type
will need ownership of the data to operate.</p>

<p>If you take ownership of a piece of data with an owning binding and want to return ownership to the
calling context, you can return it from the function. For example, the popular <code>once_cell</code> crate features
a type which can only be written to once. If you try to write to it again, it returns ownership of the
value you attempted to set.</p>

<h3 id="mutable-owning-binding">Mutable Owning Binding</h3>

<p>Sometimes, in addition to taking ownership of a piece of data, you’d like for that data to be mutable
from the start as well. In that case, you can use a mutable owning binding.</p>

    <span>// Then shadows it with a new (mutable)</span>
    <span>// binding of the same name.</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span>

    <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>Number</span><span>(</span><span>11</span><span>);</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

    <figcaption><span>Code 5</span> <p>Examples of mutable owning bindings.</p> <a href="#code-5"><span>↺</span></a></figcaption>
    
</figure>



<p>The use of a mutable owning binding can always be replaced with an immutable owning binding followed by
a mutable rebinding to a variable of the same name in the body of the function (shadowing the parameter
from that line onward). The choice is one of taste.</p>

<h3 id="reference-binding">Reference Binding</h3>

<p>Reference bindings inside function signatures in Rust can seem a little unusual, but they are permitted.
The idea is that the binding performed is a reference to the type of the value. If the value was passed
in by value, then it’s either moved or copied as discussed in the owning binding section, and in the body
of the function the value is of a reference to the post-move data (if the type is <code>Copy</code>, the difference
doesn’t amount to much). This is different from an owning binding of a reference type both for the caller
of the function, and inside the function itself (<code>x: &amp;Number</code> is <em>not</em> the same as <code>ref x: Number</code>).</p>

Well, from <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore">their website</a>:</p><blockquote>Cloud Firestore is a flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and server development...</blockquote><p>Let's break that down! First, Firestore is a <em>database</em> - that means it's a good place to store data, and retrieve it later. If you're into ML/data science, and have been building dashboards with Streamlit, the data you work with probably looks like Pandas tables, Numpy arrays, CSV files. These tend to be fairly <em>static</em>. You'll rarely need to create new entries or update them, let alone make your data accessible from apps all over the world. But many web apps need to be <em>dynamic,</em> allowing lots of edits to the data and creation of new data — and databases excel at this! Every consumer web app you can think of (Gmail, Youtube, Slack, Airbnb) have databases that manage the things that their users create (emails, videos, chat messages, and listings).</p><p>Unlike other databases, Firestore is <em>flexible</em>. In technical terms, we call it a "NoSQL" database, which means that you don't have to design a fixed schema for how your data will be structured before you begin. This is great for quick prototyping! Oftentimes, when I'm making a web app, I don't exactly know what it will look like or do, much less how I should store my data.</p><figure><img src="https://geekandpoke.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341d3df553ef0148c80ac6ef970c-pi" alt=""><figcaption>Source: https://geekandpoke.typepad.com/geekandpoke/2011/01/nosql.html</figcaption></figure><p>As an analogy, let's say I wanted to bake a bunch of desserts. A SQL database is a bit like having to write out a pie recipe beforehand, and then always following it line-by-line. I can efficiently bake lots of pies, which will be tasty if my original recipe was good. But the NoSQL approach is more like: let me start with something vaguely pie-like, but maybe it'll become a tart, or drift towards more of a cupcake... I can experiment until I land on something that really hits the spot.</p><p>Finally, Firestore is hosted on the <em>cloud</em>. This means that it's a service, very much like <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> or our very own <a href="http://streamlit.io/sharing">Streamlit Sharing</a>, where you don't have to worry about maintaining your own servers. You don't need to worry about scaling, uptime, or a bunch of other issues that can get in the way of building out your idea.</p><h3 id="what-are-some-downsides-of-firestore">What are some downsides of Firestore?</h3><p>First, as a hosted service, Firestore can cost you money. They do have a generous free tier to start out with — no credit card needed! And if your app exceeds the free limits, they'll inform you and stop new writes. Even if you hit the paid tier, Firestore is pretty cheap; I run a <a href="https://oneword.games/">side project</a> with hundreds of daily users and thousands of daily writes, and Firestore only costs me ~$1/month.</p><p>Second, other databases may perform better on complicated queries, or when you get to e.g. millions of daily users. For pure speed of setup, Firestore is great, but if you already know that scaling will be an issue, you may want to consider other options like <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html">SQLite</a>, <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a>, or <a href="https://cloud.google.com/spanner">Cloud Spanner</a>.</p><p>And finally, most Firestore users use JavaScript, so there are fewer Python code snippets and Stack Overflow answers to find. For this tutorial, we'll use <a href="https://googleapis.dev/python/firestore/latest/index.html">Firestore's Python library</a>, which is very pleasant to work with. Here's a snippet from their Python API for inspiration:</p><pre><code>from google.cloud import firestore

# Add a new user to the database
db = firestore.Client()
doc_ref = db.collection('users').document('alovelace')
doc_ref.set({
    'first': 'Ada',
    'last': 'Lovelace',
    'born': 1815
})

# Then query to list all users
users_ref = db.collection('users')

for doc in users_ref.stream():
    print('{} =&gt; {}'.format(doc.id, doc.to_dict()))
</code></pre><p>Pretty easy to read, right?</p><h2 id="part-1-a-simple-streamlit-sharing-app">Part 1: A simple Streamlit Sharing app</h2><p>Okay! If you're sold on the awesomeness of Firestore, I'm now going to show you how to bake in that awesomeness into a Streamlit app. Let's cook up a simple version of the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/">Reddit home page</a>, from scratch! (Okay, that was the last cooking analogy, I promise.)</p><p>Once again, <a href="https://www.streamlit.io/">Streamlit</a> is the fastest way to build web apps in Python. <a href="https://blog.streamlit.io/introducing-streamlit-sharing/">Streamlit Sharing</a> is the fastest way to put your app online, so you can share it with the world.

Name it whatever you like! (I'm calling mine <code>streamlit-reddit</code>). Make sure it's public, though, so we can host it on Streamlit Sharing later.</p><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vpwzgFv.png" alt="https://i.imgur.com/vpwzgFv.png"><figcaption>New GitHub repo</figcaption></figure><p>Next, you'll want to download (aka "clone") this repo on your own computer. (<a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">You'll need to have Git installed</a>.) Open up a local shell, and run the following commands, replacing <code>{username}</code> with your own GitHub username:</p><pre><code># Creates a copy of this repo on your computer
$ git clone https://github.com/{username}/streamlit-reddit.git

# Enters the repo, which is currently empty
$ cd streamlit-reddit
</code></pre><h3 id="running-streamlit-on-your-own-computer">Running Streamlit on your own computer</h3><p>With our Git repo set up, let's add in the two main files every Streamlit Sharing app needs:</p><p><code>requirements.txt</code> — A list of the Python libraries we use, so Streamlit Sharing will know to install them.</p><p>For this tutorial, we'll only be using two libraries: Streamlit itself, and the <a href="https://googleapis.dev/python/firestore/latest/index.html">Python client for Firestore</a>. So this is all you need inside your <code>requirements.txt</code> file:</p><pre><code>streamlit
google-cloud-firestore
</code></pre><p><code>streamlit_app.py</code> — Where our app code will go! Let's start with just a few lines:</p><pre><code>import streamlit as st

st.header('Hello 🌎!')
if st.button('Balloons?'):
    st.balloons()
</code></pre><p>This app imports the Streamlit library, and then shows some text and a button. When you click on the button, a bunch of balloons will float up from the bottom of the screen!</p><p>Now, we're going to use <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/">Pip</a> to install the Streamlit and the Firestore libraries onto your own computer. (If you prefer <a href="https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basics.html">pipenv</a> or <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">poetry</a> or <a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/">conda</a>, any of those are fine too!)</p><pre><code># Install all the libraries mentioned in requirements.txt

You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.

  Local URL: http://localhost:8501
  Network URL: http://192.168.1.3:8501

Well, obviously, for the same reasons that apply to other technology fields as well: </span></p><ul><li id="viewer-2unmb"><p>A <em>taxonomy</em> provides a common set of definitions and language to describe the technology. Terms are defined to mean the same thing when used accordingly. </p></li><li id="viewer-1vbml"><p><em>Standards</em> extend definitions and language to technical implementations and enable performance and safety minimums. In the course of progressing maturity of a technology, a standard is typically approved through expert consensus by a recognized standardization body. It provides for repeated and common use, rules, guidelines, or characteristics for products or related processes and production methods, with which compliance is not mandatory. Standards enable interoperability. </p></li><li id="viewer-9bscs"><p><em>Legislation</em> and <em>regulations</em> are issued by governments and define product characteristics or their related processes or production methods, including the applicable administrative provisions, with which compliance is mandatory. Regulations often make use of standards. Laws and regulations enable operability. </p></li></ul><p id="viewer-drkop"><span><span><strong>We have visualized the content of this article in a graphic.

<p>It would be cool to interface an ESP32 to my favourite programming language Pharo! Pharo is an immersive object-oriented live programming environment. &nbsp;What I love about it is the very tight code-compile-run-debug cycle that keeps you agile and in the flow while prototyping. &nbsp;This&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOuZyOKa91o">video[7min]</a> by a Pharo newcomer gives a quick taste of the environment.</p>
<p>Now so that I don’t end up out in the wilderness on my own (since this Pharo/ESP combination is new) this post seeks to inspire you to explore how Pharo and microcontrollers like the ESP32 can work together. As such, this post is targetted at newcomers to either domain.</p>
<p>[If you don’t have a ESP32 in hand, skim through and you may see enough to inspire you to order one and give it a go. &nbsp;Microcontroller to PC interfacing is a growing market and you never know what opportunities may arise from expanded skills in this area.]</p>
<h2>ESP32 first steps</h2>
<p>Best to start with the standard tools to verify everything works.</p>
<ol>
<li>Follow&nbsp;<a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/esp32-thing-hookup-guide">Sparkfun’s ESP32 hookup guide</a>. I used the portable version of the Arduino IDE since on Windows I operate with a non-admin account.</li>
<li>Connect USB to the ESP32 and download your first program to verify comms. I used “File &gt; Examples &gt; 0.1Basics &gt; Blink” which toggles the Onboard-LED using delays. You can play with the numbers to confirm changing blink patterns have an effect. </li>
<li>Add text output. &nbsp;I mixed in the code from the from the&nbsp;<a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/esp32-thing-hookup-guide">hookup guide</a> serial comms example to produce <em>BlinkHello.ino</em>. &nbsp;After downloading this to the ESP32, open <br>Tools &gt; Serial Monitor from the Arduino IDE.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>// BlinkHello.ino - friendly introduction to the ESP32
int counter = 0;
void setup() {
    pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
    Serial.begin(9600);
}
void loop() {
    Serial.print("Hello, world!  ");
    Serial.println(counter);
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
    delay(500);
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
    delay(2000);
}</code></pre>
<h2>Pharo first steps</h2>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://pharo.org/download">Download Pharo 6</a>, unzip it and run `pharo` (its portable, you don’t need to install it). &nbsp;You are presented with a “Welcome” window on an empty background called the “World”. &nbsp;The world holds the UI objects we interact with.</li>
<li>Left-click on the World background and from the menu select Help &gt; Pharo Tutorials. Working through the “Pharo Syntax Tutorial” should provide enough to follow the rest of this post. &nbsp;When you have more time, I encourage you to check out:<br>* <a href="http://mooc.pharo.org/">The Pharo MOOC </a>(the audio is French, but the English subtitles are good)<br>* <a href="http://books.pharo.org/">Pharo By Example</a> </li>
<li>Left-click the world and open a Playground.</li>
</ol>
<p>Taking hints from <a href="http://forum.world.st/How-to-use-the-serial-port-on-MacOS-X-td4938298.html">How-to-use-the-serial-port-on-MacOS-X</a> (I’m using Windows 10), <br>in the Playground evaluate the following snippet (i.e. select and DoIt)…</p>
<pre><code>baudRate := 9600.
comPortNumber := 6. "COM6 for me, taken from my Arduino IDE config"
myPort :=
    SerialPort new
        baudRate: baudRate;
        dataBits: 8;
        stopBitsType: 1;
        parityType: 0;
        yourself.
(myPort openPort: comPortNumber) isNil ifFalse: [ myPort inspect ].
</code></pre>
<p>If a windows pops up titled “Inspector on a SerialPort…” that is great! You’ve successfully opened the serial port. If you get “Error: Cannot open 6”, just close the window and check your Arduino IDE Serial Monitor is closed then try again. &nbsp;If the error persists, confirm the port works from a terminal program (e.g. HyperTerminal or minicom) and seek help from pharo-user mail list.</p>
<p>If a window appears at the bottom showing “OpenComm failed…”, scroll through it to read how to close it (clicking first in the World before pressing F2.)</p>
<h2>A common exception – improper port</h2>
<p>Lets force an error to see what that looks like! Evaluate that snippet again with a port you don’t have (e.g. comPortNumber := 9 for me). &nbsp;I got an expected “Error: Cannot open 9”.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.openinworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/CannotOpen9.png"><img title="CannotOpen9" src="http://blog.openinworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/CannotOpen9.png" alt="Error cannot open port 9" width="875" height="166" srcset="https://blog.openinworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/CannotOpen9.png 875w, https://blog.openinworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/CannotOpen9-150x28.png 150w, https://blog.openinworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/CannotOpen9-400x75.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 875px) 100vw, 875px"></a></p>
<p>Note that objects don’t disappear when code evaluation completes.  They stay live within the system for you to interact. &nbsp;Only when all references to them are dropped are they automatically garbage collected. &nbsp;But perhaps you’ve closed the inspector and also lost the playground’s reference to that first serial port object when the “myPort” variable had a new object assigned into it.  No worries, you can find it using Pharo’s introspection tools by evaluating…</p>
<pre><code>SerialPort allInstances inspect</code></pre>
<p>which displays an inspector on an Array of two SerialPort objects – one for the first port you opened (#6 for me) and a closed one since port #9 did not exist.  Clicking on a SerialPort displays its internals on the right.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.openinworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/InspectorOnTwoSerialPortsB3.png"></a><a href="http://blog.openinworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/InspectorOnTwoSerialPortsB4.png"></a><a href="http://blog.openinworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/InspectorOnTwoSerialPortsB6.png"><img title="InspectorOnTwoSerialPortsB" src="http://blog.openinworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/InspectorOnTwoSerialPortsB6.png" alt="Inspector on two serial ports" width="866" height="452" srcset="https://blog.openinworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/InspectorOnTwoSerialPortsB6.png 866w, https://blog.openinworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/InspectorOnTwoSerialPortsB6-150x78.png 150w, https://blog.openinworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/InspectorOnTwoSerialPortsB6-400x208.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 866px) 100vw, 866px"></a></p>
<h2>Another common exception – port already open</h2>
<p>Restoring the code snippet to original port (e.g. for me comPortNumber := 6) and again evaluating it now gives “Error: Cannot open 6.”</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.openinworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/CannotOpen6.png"><img title="CannotOpen6" src="http://blog.openinworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/CannotOpen6.png" alt="Cannot open port" width="862" height="165" srcset="https://blog.openinworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/CannotOpen6.png 862w, https://blog.openinworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/CannotOpen6-150x28.png 150w, https://blog.openinworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/CannotOpen6-400x76.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 862px) 100vw, 862px"></a></p>
<p>This worked before! Why doesn’t it work now? &nbsp;Remember that objects remain live for us to interact with. The port is still held by the first SerialPort object we created. Indeed three objects are shown when this is evaluated again…</p>
<pre><code>SerialPort allInstances inspect</code></pre>
<p>If you’ve lost all other references to an object in your program, you can still close the port from the inspector by selecting the open (e.g. #6) SerialPort, and under its [Raw] tab in the bottom pane evaluate “<strong>self close</strong>“, and then click the Refresh icon to see the change.  Now evaluating that playground snippet works to open the port.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.openinworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/InspectorOnThreeSerialPorts1.png"><img title="InspectorOnThreeSerialPorts" src="http://blog.openinworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/InspectorOnThreeSerialPorts1.png" alt="Inspector on three serial ports" width="863" height="473" srcset="https://blog.openinworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/InspectorOnThreeSerialPorts1.png 863w, https://blog.openinworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/InspectorOnThreeSerialPorts1-150x82.png 150w, https://blog.openinworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/InspectorOnThreeSerialPorts1-400x219.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 863px) 100vw, 863px"></a></p>
<h2>Cleaning up</h2>
<p>Garbage collection happens automatically in the background.  Mostly you don’t need to think about it, but sometimes an object hangs around longer than you expect due to a bug in your program, or you lost track of some inspector or playground with a reference to it. &nbsp;To force all SerialPorts to close and be garbage collected, &nbsp;evaluate the following…</p>
<pre><code>Smalltalk inform: 'Before=' , SerialPort allInstances size printString.
SerialPort allInstancesDo: [:port| port close].
GTPlayground allInstancesDo: [ :playground | playground resetBindings ].
SystemWindow allSubInstances
&nbsp;   select: [ :window | window title beginsWith: 'Inspector' ]
&nbsp;   thenDo: [ :window | window delete ].
Smalltalk garbageCollect.
Smalltalk inform: 'After=' , SerialPort allInstances size printString.
</code></pre>
<p>As final backup, if it the system reports there are zero SerialPort instances and the port still won’t open, close and reopen Pharo (Save-and-Quit, then reopen it) since stopping the VM drops all resources.</p>
<h2>Reading the serial port</h2>
<p>Find the inspector that has the serial open, then under its [Raw] tab in the bottom pane, evaluate this snippet…</p>
<pre><code>Transcript open.
bytesRead := 0.
buffer := String new: 1000.
d := Delay forMilliseconds: 300.
timeout := 5000. "milliseconds"
started := Time millisecondClockValue.
[ Time millisecondClockValue - started &lt; timeout ]
    whileTrue:
	[   nRead := self readInto: buffer startingAt: bytesRead + 1.
        nRead isZero
            ifTrue: [ d wait ]
            ifFalse: [bytesRead := bytesRead + nRead].
    ].
Transcript crShow: (buffer trimRight: [ :c | c = Character null]).
</code></pre>
<p><a href="http://blog.openinworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ReadingSerialPortFromInspector.png"><img title="ReadingSerialPortFromInspector" src="http://blog.openinworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ReadingSerialPortFromInspector.png" alt="Reading serial port from an inspector" width="752" height="679" srcset="https://blog.openinworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ReadingSerialPortFromInspector.png 752w, https://blog.openinworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ReadingSerialPortFromInspector-150x135.png 150w, https://blog.openinworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ReadingSerialPortFromInspector-400x361.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 752px) 100vw, 752px"></a></p>
<p>After five seconds a friendly window pops up to greet us.   The reason for the delay is that the code is evaluated within the thread of the UI event loop.  We will improve that shortly.  For now, just wait a short time, then evaluate that snippet again.  Notice that the counter is contiguous.  A buffer somewhere between Pharo and the board accumlates transmitted data until we asked for it.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.openinworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Transcript1b.png"><img title="Transcript1b" src="http://blog.openinworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Transcript1b.png" alt="Transcript" width="447" height="226" srcset="https://blog.openinworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Transcript1b.png 447w, https://blog.openinworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Transcript1b-150x75.png 150w, https://blog.openinworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Transcript1b-400x202.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 447px) 100vw, 447px"></a></p>
<p>Now we don’t want the IDE or our application to pause five seconds every time we read the serial port. We need to move its execution away from the Playground. &nbsp;The Playground is great for experimenting, but then the time comes to graduate to application coding so that programs can be more interactive. &nbsp;So we are going to create a class to model interaction with the ESP32. From the world menu open the System Browser and in the bottom pane enter and accept the following class definition…</p>
<pre><code>Model subclass: #ESP32
      instanceVariableNames: 'pollTime'
      classVariableNames: ''
      package: 'ESP32Stuff'
</code></pre>
<p>There you go, you’ve just created your first class in Pharo!</p>
<h2>Diversion – under the covers</h2>
<p>Now be aware that in a significant deviation from most languages where classes are defined by dead text, in Pharo this new class in already alive. &nbsp; Every class definition instantiates a factory object for producing instances of the class. &nbsp;The factory object is globally identified by the name of the class and you directly interact with it like any other object. &nbsp;Normally you wouldn’t do the following, but just by way of demonstration, try…</p>
<pre><code>ESP32 inspect. "Inspects the ESP32 factory object."</code></pre>
<p>What your looking at is the internals of how the Pharo system works. &nbsp; You can see this factory knows its class name and its superclass. There are currently no subclasses and no methods. &nbsp;I didn’t expect instanceVariables to be nil, but …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <div>
    <div>

      

      <article role="main">
        <p>It all started with a meme tweet:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.acepace.net/images/xlatb/meme.jpg" alt="twitter meme describing waves to extract values from an array in x64"></p>

<p>Laugh, scroll past, then I started wondering, “what are the chances this obscure opcode is faster than optimized loads?” and I realized I had just been <a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">nerd sniped</a>. So I decided to dig up my half-remembered memories of how to benchmark opcodes and get to the bottom of this meme.</p>

<p>For those of us who do not recall every opcode that Intel dreamed up, the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developer-instruction-set-reference-manual-325383.pdf">Intel reference manual</a> is a useful reference and says the following:</p>

<p>XLAT/XLATB - <em>Locates a byte entry in a table in memory, using the contents of the AL register as a table index, then copies the contents of the table entry back into the AL register. The index in the AL register is treated as an unsigned integer. The XLAT and XLATB instructions get the base address of the table in memory from either the DS:EBX or the DS:BX registers</em></p>

<p>In other words, the instruction performs</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nasm"><span>MOV</span> <span>AL</span><span>,[</span><span>EBX</span><span>+</span><span>AL</span><span>]</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>EBX is the array base and AL is the offset.</p>

<p>Which is exactly the core line of the last snippet in the meme.</p>

<p>My guess was <strong>the equivalent load opcode version would outperform xlatb</strong>. How I tested this simple question is worth writing up, if only to have a reference for micro benchmarking from end to end.</p>

<h3 id="technical-background">Technical background</h3>

<p><em>Feel free to skip this if you’re familiar with benchmarking, CISC vs RISC and why I guessed what I guessed</em></p>

<h4 id="benchmarking">Benchmarking</h4>

<p>What I did to test my guess is called micro benchmarking. The difference from regular benchmarking is in the focus and minimization of context. It helps in answering very small questions such as “What is the fastest way to sort an array of numbers in C”, and ignoring memory pressure, design and other considerations that are important in the real world of benchmarking.</p>

<p>The challenge in micro benchmarking is that there is a lot of noise in the process. Compilers, operating systems, CPU temperature and frequency changes can all serve to create large shifts in the performance of the benched code snippet.</p>

<p>Therefore, the goal is to define the problem as accurately as possible. For example</p>

<ul>
  <li>Minimize hardware considerations. This means removing frequency scaling, branching, any chance of the data being evicted from the cache.</li>
  <li>No interaction with the system. This means no system calls, but also no memory allocations and hopefully remove the role the runtime plays (for example if we’re benchmarking .NET code)</li>
</ul>

<p>These typically lead micro benchmarks to being written in assembly code and measuring runtime using the <a href="https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/X86-assembly/Instructions/rdtsc">rdtsc</a> opcode.</p>

<p>To understand this at a basic level, I really recommend the book <a href="https://nostarch.com/insidemachine.htm">Inside the Machine</a> (Jon Stokes), another option is <a href="http://www.lighterra.com/papers/modernmicroprocessors/">Modern Microprocessors in 90 minutes</a> but for more than that, the relatively up to date reference is <a href="https://www.realworldtech.com/cpu/">Real World Technologies</a> articles on CPU architecture.</p>

<p>The reference for nearly everything relating to opcode latency for Intel and AMD CPUs is <a href="https://www.agner.org/optimize/">Agners guides</a> and <a href="https://uops.info/table.html">uops.info</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to measure these latencies and what exactly a CPU is doing when executing an opcode, you need to read the Performance Measurement Counters embedded in the hardware. This gives us precisely numbers for (example) how many L1 cache hits and misses happened in a code block, how many branch mispredictions happened and so forth.</p>

<h4 id="xlat-and-cisc">XLAT and CISC</h4>

<p>Now, what the heck is XLAT and why does it exist?</p>

<p>The basic idea behind the XLAT instruction is the idea behind Complex Instruction Set Computers (CISC), that states hardware should implement common instruction sequences with dedicated instructions that perform the same task but faster. This is the idea behind many of the weird x86 instructions (or other CPUs).</p>

<p>However, since that time, all modern CPUs have turned RISC-like, by internally using a reduced instruction set and translating the ISA opcodes into internal commands, some implemented using CPU microcode. This also allows for different optimizations such as micro opcode fusion. Another note, CPU designers spend a lot of time optimizing the commonly use instructions, which makes them very fast (for example xor rax,rax is free) This leaves very little room for opcodes like xlatb to shine.</p>

<p>While we’re dunking on CISC, I came across the following great snippet on the difference between the good parts of CISC and the bad parts.</p>

<p><em>We should distinguish the “Complex” instructions of CISC CPUs - complicated, rarely used, and universally low performance, from the “Featureful” instructions common to both CISC and RISC CPUs, which combine a small sequence of operations, are commonly used, and high performance. - <a href="https://gist.github.com/erincandescent/8a10eeeea1918ee4f9d9982f7618ef68">erincandescent</a></em></p>

<h3 id="the-experiments">The experiments</h3>

<p>What I ended up doing was running the different code snippets in the Andreas Abel’s micro benchmarking harness, available on <a href="https://github.com/andreas-abel/nanoBench">GitHub</a>. The machine used for execution was a VM running on a Broadwell i7-5500U, Debian 9.9, kernel version 4.9 with the host CPU frequency governor set to disabled (max clock speed all the time).</p>

<p>The executed code snippets were as described in the table below.</p>

<p>In order to remove as much variance as possible, it’s best to make sure all accesses are kept inside the L1 cache (code and data). For this reason, the following initializations are required</p>

<ul>
  <li>Aim RBX at RSP, making sure the array accessed is inside the L1 data cache</li>
  <li>Set RAX to 0</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, this opcode sequence is small enough to be in the same L1 code cache line so no effort was required there (manually verified).</p>

<p>For this experiment, what matters is the number of cycles required to execute (which is a close approximation of time) and the cycles elapsed (wall time). In addition, I’ll also measure how many loads happened while executing this snippet, by tracking the <a href="https://download.01.org/perfmon/index/haswell.html">MEM_LOAD_UOPS_RETIRED.L1_HIT PMC</a>.</p>

<p>The command line I used when executing the benchmarks was</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">./nanoBench.sh <span>-avg</span> <span>-n_measurements</span> 500 <span>-asm_init</span> <span>"mov rbx, rsp;xor rax,rax;"</span> <span>-asm</span> SNIPPET_HERE <span>-config</span> configs/cfg_Broadwell_common.txt</code></pre></figure>

<p>There are a few things that stand out.</p>

<p>Foremost, xlatb is slower than the equivalent optimized x64 code.</p>

<p>Second, as is generally known, memory loads are the most expensive part of any algorithm, but once the data is in L1, the difference in number of loads doesn’t seem to matter. The xlatb sequence has only one data load yet is slower than the optimized x64 version.</p>

<p>Second, the core cycle count for the xlatb instruction precisely matches the <a href="https://www.agner.org/optimize/instruction_tables.pdf">Agner table</a> (page 229). Good to know our measurements line up with others :)</p>

<p>Last, note that reducing the amount of instructions used does not decrease time required linearly. Why? The number of instructions is not linearly correlated to the actions performed by the processor. A classic example is xor rcx,rcx. This opcode never actually executes. Instead, the CPU just updates a pointer in the register renaming file.</p>

<p>To examine these type of questions, another tool is required - the Intel Architecture Code Analyzer (<a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-architecture-code-analyzer">IACA</a> - unfortunately now deprecated). This tool will look at the machine code and tell you how different Intel CPUs will execute them. Let’s look at one case in particular to see why removing instructions doesn’t always linearly save time. Attached are only the relevant parts of the output, which are the micro-op count.</p>

<p>* - instruction micro-ops not bound to a port</p>

<p>^ - Micro Fusion occurred</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Number of Uops</th>
      <th>opcodes</th>
      <th>Number of Uops</th>
      <th>opcodes</th>

      <td>push rcx</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1*</td>
      <td>xor rcx,rcx</td>
      <td>1*</td>
      <td>movzx rcx,al</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>mov cl,al</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>add rcx, rbx</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>add rcx,rbx</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>mov al, byte ptr [rcx]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>mov al, byte ptr [rcx]</td>
      <td>2^#</td>
      <td>pop [rcx]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2^#</td>
      <td>pop rcx</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The important bit is noting that in snippet 0, the opcodes xor rcx,rcx; mov cl,al takes up one execution unit (xor rcx rcx is not bound to an execution port).</p>

<p>In snippet 1, the opcode movzx rcx,al doesn’t take up an execution port at all.</p>

<p>You can also play around with llvm-mca which does something similar, and see the same results, by using Compiler Explorer (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/6SjY_d">snippet link</a>).</p>

<h4 id="side-note-on-actually-running-the-experiments">Side note on actually running the experiments</h4>

<p>All my machines are Windows machines, where accessing the PMCs is not as fun or easy as it is on Linux. The proper reaction should be “so run it inside a VM”, but apparently Hyper-V doesn’t expose PMCs to guests by default and I couldn’t find a way to do it easily.</p>

<p>I ran into every possible frustration while searching for a cheap bare metal cloud machine, including Oracle gating the bare metal instances behind a request form that requires a human being to look at.</p>

<p>In the end, VMWare Workstation exposes PMCs to guests so a friend with power to spare gave me a VM to test.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>The meme is wrong, no surprise. An optimized sequence of x64 instructions beats out a single complex instruction. This isn’t always true (POPCNT as a counter example) but some instructions are legacy for a reason. If LLVM doesn’t output the opcode, it’s probably for the best.</p>

<p>Also this was an opportunity to rediscover micro benchmarking. It’s quite likely I made some measurement mistakes, so if you found any, feel free to contact me.</p>

<p>And again to Andreas Abel for saving me a lot of time with his micro benchmarking harness available on <a href="https://github.com/andreas-abel/nanoBench">GitHub</a></p>
