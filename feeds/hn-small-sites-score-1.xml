<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>This white paper gives an overview of NTS and a detailed description of the authentication process that ensures you receive time information from a trusted source. This includes the step-by-step details of the key establishment and time stamping process. We also provide a summary of the elements that enable NTS to scale and to secure NTP against a range of attack vectors.</p><div><h2>This is a preview of Netnod's NTS white paper. To read&nbsp;the full white paper, see link below.
</h2><p>Introduction
</p><p>Many of the important security tools that keep us safe online depend on accurate time. But until recently there was no way to ensure that the time you received over the Internet was correct. There was simply no way to tell if you were being fed time from a malicious or trusted source.</p>
<p>This is largely because the current standard for receiving time over the Internet, the Network Time Protocol (NTP), was created in 1985. In those more innocent times, the need to secure NTP, the type of security needed, and how to provide it were less understood.</p>
<p>Over the last 35 years, a range of security flaws and some high-profile attacks have shown that NTP needed significantly improved security. The new Network Time Security (NTS) standard has been designed to fix that.</p>
<p><span><strong>NTP security issues&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>Unsecured NTP is vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks where a malicious actor sits between you and the NTP server, listens in on the conversation, forges&nbsp; messages and lies to you about time. As a lot of processes are dependent on accurate time, the consequences here can be very serious and can include:</p>
<ul><li>Incorrect timestamps on logs and transactions which can support fraudulent activities or help disguise other criminal action&nbsp;</li>
<li>Authentication problems, attacks and issues with authentication security measures&nbsp;</li>
<li>Issues with cryptographic signatures and establishing encrypted sessions such as Transport Layer Security (TLS)&nbsp;</li>
<li>DNS Security (DNSSEC) failing to work if the client doesn’t have accurate time</li>
</ul><p><span><strong>Previous attempts at NTP security&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>There have been some previous attempts to add security to NTP. Commonly referred to as NTP-AUTH, these attempts did not provide all necessary aspects of security (confidentiality, authentication and integrity including protection against replay attacks).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, the underlying security mechanism for NTP-AUTH (MD5 or SHA-1) could be considered weak at best. NTP-AUTH is based on secret keys but the key agreement is not standardized. This means that any NTP service provider wanting to use NTP-AUTH has to find their own way to exchange keys with the client out-of-band.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This often requires a potential client to send a letter or fax to get the secret key. The need for a server to store uniquesecret keys for all clients creates scalability problems: as the number of users grows, the storage requirements and especially the ability to rapidly look up a given key makes the service hard to scale.</p>
<p>Given all these issues, it has long been apparent that a new security mechanism for NTP is needed; one based on modern security mechanisms that could also allow the service to scale to potentially millions of clients.</p>
<h2><strong>The NTS standard</strong></h2>
<p>NTS has been developed within the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). In March 2015, the first Internet-Draft of the NTS standard was published. Over the next five years, the draft went through 28 further iterations until the Internet Draft ‘Network Time Security for the Network Time Protocol’ was published as a Proposed Standard (RFC8915) in September 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NTS uses modern cryptography to add an important layer of security to NTP. It prevents spoofing and MITM attacks by using authenticated packets. Amplification attacks are prevented by ensuring that request and response packets are always the same size.</p>
<p>NTS is really two protocols: a key establishment protocol, and NTP with some new Extension Fields. The reason for using two protocols is separation of concerns:</p>
<p>1. The seldom used key establishment on top of standard Transport Layer Security (TLS), and</p>
<p>2. The (already existing) low latency UDP-based time synchronisation path.</p>
<p>This means that the existing NTP functionality is the same as before, but the time data can now be authenticated.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>The NTS authentication process</strong></h2>
<p>The authentication process consists of a key establishment and a timestamp request. The key exchange server typically runs on an ordinary computer, but the slim NTS-enabled NTP server is UDP-based and stateless. It can be served from anycast addresses and can be implemented at the hardware level. The NTP server’s state about each client is kept in the cookie provided by the client itself with each request. As there can potentially be hundreds of millions of clients, this is crucial for the smooth operation of a large-scale NTS service.</p>
<p>Since the cryptographic operations in the NTS path are symmetric it is both easier to implement them in hardware and to make them use constant time. This increases the accuracy of the time synchronisation and keeps the slower key exchange outside of the time synchronisation path.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NTS uses Authenticated Encryption using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), more specifically what is known as Synthetic Initialization Vector (RFC 5297). This is a block cipher mode of operation providing nonce-based,&nbsp;misuse-resistant authenticated encryption. Using AES-SIV enables the encryption processes described below to add integrity and origin authentication. The consequences for this at a hardware level will be discussed in an upcoming&nbsp;white paper.</p>
<p><span><strong>The key establishment</strong></span></p>
<p>The key establishment process works as follows: first, a client initiates a key establishment using the NTS-KE protocol embedded in TLS (see figure 1.)</p>

December 1, 2020 | https://javascript.christmas/2020/1 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://javascript.christmas/2020/1">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><strong>JavaScript:</strong> <em>Do you know addition?</em></p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> <em>Of course! I learned mathematics when I was seven, addition is fairly easy!</em></p>
<p><strong>JavaScript:</strong> <em>Do you really know addition? Please solve this equation</em></p>
<pre><code>true + [] = ?
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> <em>Eh?</em></p>
<p><strong>JavaScript:</strong> <em>Welcome to JavaScript addition!</em></p>
</section><article><section><p>If you have been working with JavaScript, you have probably seen a lot of usage with the <code>+</code> operator and discovered that the output is not necessarily what you expected.</p>
<p>The language supports using the <code>+</code> operator between (almost) all of the different data types - the results might therefore be confusing. In JavaScript, there is no compiler to hold your hand on your “addition journey”.</p>
<p><strong><em>The addition operator either performs string concatenation or numeric addition.</em></strong></p>
<p>With the rule above you should be able to understand all additions in JavaScript, but some of us need to see examples and explanations to fully understand the different scenarios.</p>
<p>First of all, remember that JavaScript performs the addition from left to right - evaluating parentheses first. This should be familiar with what you have learned in middle-grade mathematics.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>Step<span>-</span>by<span>-</span>step example
<span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>2</span> <span>+</span> <span>(</span><span>3</span> <span>+</span> <span>4</span><span>)</span>
<span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>2</span> <span>+</span> <span>7</span>
<span>3</span> <span>+</span> <span>7</span>
<span>10</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As the rule states - with two numeric elements, the output is a numeric value:</p>
<p><code>1 + 1 = 2</code></p>
<p>String concatenation is well known between different programming languages and is a  reasonable usage of the <code>+</code> operator:</p>
<p><code>"Santa" + " " + "Claus" = "Santa Claus"</code></p>
<p>So far, so good!</p>
<h2>The most important “rules” with <em>addition</em> in JavaScript</h2>
<ol>
<li>Adding a non-numeric value to a numeric value will try to convert the non-numeric value to a numeric value, if possible. If not, both are converted to strings.</li>
<li>Adding a non-numeric value to some value will convert both values to strings before adding them.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, what does that actually mean?</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>"2"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"12"</span>
<span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>"2"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"22"</span>
<span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>"1"</span> <span>+</span> <span>"2"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"112"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Confused? At least I am…</p>
<p>In the first line, a numeric and non-numeric value is added. Both are converted to strings before they are added</p>
<p><code>"1" + "2" = "12"</code></p>
<p>In the second line, there are both numeric addition and string concatenation. Remember, addition goes from left to right. </p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
<span>2</span> <span>+</span> <span>"2"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"2"</span> <span>+</span> <span>"2"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"22"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The third line only contains string concatenation.</p>
<p><code>"1" + "1" + "2" =&gt; "112"</code></p>
<p>Unfortunately, it doesn’t end here. Some other data types in JavaScript behave in a rather non-typical way when used for addition.</p>
<h2>Boolean</h2>
<p>What happens when you add something with a boolean value?</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>true</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
<span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>false</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
<span>true</span> <span>+</span> <span>true</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
<span>false</span> <span>+</span> <span>false</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
<span>"1"</span> <span>+</span> <span>true</span> <span>=</span> <span>"1true"</span>
<span>"1"</span> <span>+</span> <span>false</span> <span>=</span> <span>"1false"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Boolean values can be converted to numeric values in JavaScript, and the result of the conversion is either 1 or 0.</p>

<p>Combining a boolean and a string value converts <code>true</code> to “true” and <code>false</code> to “false”.</p>
<h2>Objects, arrays and functions</h2>
<p>When one of the values in an addition is an object, array or function it will try to convert it to a primitive value.</p>
<ol>
<li>Execute the <code>valueOf()</code>-function and use that value if it is a primitive</li>
<li>Execute the <code>toString()</code>-function</li>
</ol>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> me <span>=</span> <span>{</span> name<span>:</span> <span>"Charlie"</span><span>,</span> age<span>:</span> <span>34</span> <span>}</span>
me <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>=</span> <span>"[object Object]1"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The default <code>valueOf()</code>-implementation is an empty object <code>{}</code> - which is not a primitive and it will try to convert it using <code>toString()</code>. The default <code>toString()</code>-value for an object is <code>"[object Object]"</code> - not very useful for addition. Unfortunately, I have seen this output many times during my time as a developer - it usually happens when I forget to specify the property of the object that should be part of the addition.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it might be handy to override the <code>valueOf()</code> or <code>toString()</code>-function and make it return something useful.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> me <span>=</span> <span>{</span> name<span>:</span> <span>"Charlie"</span><span>,</span> age<span>:</span> <span>34</span> <span>}</span>
me<span>.</span><span>valueOf</span> <span>=</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>age <span>}</span>
me <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>=</span> <span>35</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The return type is now a numeric value and it will add 34 with 1 - which is 35.</p>
<p>The same can be done for a function or a class - for both <code>valueOf</code> and <code>toString</code>.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>BekkEmployee</span><span>(</span><span>name<span>,</span> age</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>this</span><span>.</span>name <span>=</span> name<span>;</span>
  <span>this</span><span>.</span>age <span>=</span> age<span>;</span>
  <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>toString</span> <span>=</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span><span>`</span><span><span>${</span><span>this</span><span>.</span>name<span>}</span></span><span> is </span><span><span>${</span><span>this</span><span>.</span>age<span>}</span></span><span> years old</span><span>`</span></span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>new</span> <span>BekkEmployee</span><span>(</span><span>"Charlie"</span><span>,</span> <span>34</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>100</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Charlie is 34 years old100"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For arrays, <code>valueOf</code> returns the array - which is not a primitive value. The output of its <code>toString()</code> is the content joined with a comma. An empty array is the same as an empty string.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>[</span><span>]</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>=</span> <span>"1"</span>
<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>]</span> <span>+</span> <span>[</span><span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"1,2,3"</span> <span>+</span> <span>"3,4,5"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"1,2,34,5,6"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Since you have been reading all along - here is a quiz for you:</p>
<p>PS: try to solve it before you check the browser console</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> me <span>=</span> <span>{</span> name<span>:</span> <span>"Charlie"</span><span>,</span> age<span>:</span> <span>34</span> <span>}</span>
me<span>.</span><span>toString</span> <span>=</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>age <span>}</span>

<span>true</span> <span>+</span> me <span>+</span> <span>65</span> <span>+</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span> <span>+</span> <span>false</span> <span>+</span> me <span>+</span> <span>"merry christmas"</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Date</h2>
<p>All rules have some exceptions...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All native ECMAScript objects except Date objects handle the absence of a hint as if the hint Number were given; Date objects handle the absence of a hint as if the hint String were given.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>Date.valueOf</code> returns a numeric type, but a date will be transformed into a string type when using the <code>+</code> operator.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>new</span> <span>Date</span><span>(</span><span>2020</span><span>,</span> <span>11</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>12345</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Tue Dec 01 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0100 (Central European Standard Time)12345"</span>
<span>new</span> <span>Date</span><span>(</span><span>2020</span><span>,</span> <span>11</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>"12345"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Tue Dec 01 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0100 (Central European Standard Time)12345"</span>

<span>new</span> <span>Date</span><span>(</span><span>2020</span><span>,</span> <span>11</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>toString</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Tue Dec 01 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0100 (Central European Standard Time)"</span>
<span>new</span> <span>Date</span><span>(</span><span>2020</span><span>,</span> <span>11</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>valueOf</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>1606777200000</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Weirdos</h2>
<p>Now that you know the important rules of addition, there are some data types you also should be aware of:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>undefined</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>=</span> <span>NaN</span> 
<span>undefined</span> <span>+</span> <span>"1"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"undefined1"</span>
<span>null</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span> 
<span>null</span> <span>+</span> <span>"1"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"null1"</span>
<span>NaN</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>=</span> <span>NaN</span>
<span>NaN</span> <span>+</span> <span>"1"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"NaN1"</span>
<span>Symbol</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> 
<span>BigInt</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> 
<span>BigInt</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>"2"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"12"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you have read, addition is not as easy as we know from mathematics. However, if you remember some of the conversion rules above you might save yourself from some headaches in the future!</p></section></article></div>]]>

                    <p>Now that you understand what I mean when I talk about research-as-a-service (RaaS), I'll explain why I think they're a solid alternative for developers who want to build small lifestyle businesses.</p><h4><span>Quick to get started</span></h4><p>It is possible to build a minimal SaaS proof of concept or even start selling without building anything at all, but for most developers, it's super tempting to jump right into the code and get stuck in a cycle of adding features before getting anything in front of potential customers.</p><p>That's less of a risk when building content products as there's only so much coding you can justify when the core of your product is data. NomadList, for example, started out as a Google Sheet. You can quickly test out RaaS concepts using spreadsheets, Tweets, videos etc.</p><p>You're probably already researching something at the moment. Just compile the results of that research onto a Google Doc/Sheet and share it with people who might find it useful.</p><h4><span>Uptime matters less</span><br></h4><p>If you are fortunate enough to ship a SaaS that gets traction, keeping it up and running will be important, especially if customers are relying on it for business critical tasks.</p><p>If you build some sort of content product that becomes popular, it's way easier to keep it online and even if it does go down for a couple of hours, it's probably not a big issue.</p><h4>Some marketing is built into the product</h4><p>When people search for cities with fast internet, NomadList is in the results. If they search for which credit card is best for self employed people, NerdWallet is in the results. People looking for Apple's org chart will come across The Org. You get the point.</p><p>These types of products have some built-in marketing, whereas with most SaaS companies, you need to work on the product as well as on marketing.</p><h4>Developers can flex their skills and creativity</h4><p>As developers, it's way easier for you to build more creative forms of content then it is for less technical people using off-the-shelf tools like Wordpress.</p><p>This can be helpful for generating content (scraping, for example), creating better experiences (better ways to sort/filter, video players with niche specific features, etc) as well as for marketing/growth.</p><p>For example, it would be fairly trivial for you to for you to use your data to automatically generate a bunch of useful pages that would expand your long-tail search footprint.</p><p>If your&nbsp;site was for helping people decide which laptop to buy, you could use the same data set to generate pages for: <i>"best laptops for video editing, best laptops for browsing, best laptops for photoshop, cheapest laptops for photoshop, x laptop vs y laptop, alternative to y laptop, how big is x laptop etc etc."</i></p><h4>Compounding</h4><p>Content products compound over time. The more relevant research content you add, the more valuable it becomes and the harder it is for people to compete with you.</p>
                
            </div><div id="developer-content-businesses-section-31">
                
                
                    <p>There are, of course, some areas where SaaS really shines, but I'm trying to make the point that developers who are interested in starting a businesses should consider RaaS as a solid option and should keep an eye out for RaaS opportunities.</p><p>When you find yourself opening a billion tabs while spending days trying to research something, there's likely an opportunity to make that research process easier for others.</p><p>Personally, I'm putting my money where my mouth is and will be focussing on building, launching, and growing RaaS products for the foreseeable.&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div><p>I’ve been part of the internet startup scene for a while. There are so many different camps: the bootstrappers, the VC-backed tech-bros, the crypto “investors”, the people marketing their courses on marketing courses, the newsletter gurus, the micro-saas homeboys. The list goes on.</p>
<p>Each of these groups have their own, unique views on building companies and products. Some are moonshots, others are sustainable “grow-slowly” types, and each has its own subset of hard-core, flame-war inducing followers. Ah, the internet is a beautiful, terrible, magical, ghastly, colourful place.</p>
<p>I’ve been associated with, and in some cases, been a part of a few of these various subcultures. After working at a VC backed startup, I went the bootstrapped route (popularised by the IndieHackers movement) with my own product. It was an interesting ride, but was still rife with the Marketing Course Joes who just made $3000 last week with their “How to market no-code apps” course, as well as the Hustle Boys with their Twitter feeds full of “Work like no-one works today, so you can live like no-one lives tomorrow. #entrepreneur”. Neither of these resonated with me.</p>
<p>I have found my own analogy/ideology. My product is my garden.</p>
<p>During the early days of lockdown, my girlfriend got deep into gardening. She would spend hours nurturing her tomato plants, weeding, watering, puttering about. She would spend afternoons reading articles on permaculture, figuring out which plants grew well alongside other plants. Lavender with tomatoes kept the pests away, slight shade for the granadilla vine, some water, but not too much for the root vegetables. It was lovely to watch her coax tasty and nutritious food individually out of the ground. I can’t imagine full-scale farming being nearly as enjoyable.</p>
<p>That’s what I want from my products. I want to putter about, feel connected to the process, and have fun doing so. I want to make things that don’t scale. To see people tuck into them and enjoy them as people, not as stats. I’ve done this fairly successfully with <a href="https://justsketch.me/">JustSketchMe</a>. We have a small, diverse, and amazing community of artists and illustrators making awesome things. I’m trying to build a similar product with <a href="https://bearblog.dev/">Bear Blog</a>. Something niche but valuable. Something I can spend time on because I want to.</p>
<p>Being able to talk to, and interact with the people using my tools is fulfilling. Spending time meticulously improving subtle aspects of the product is enjoyable.</p>
<p>Obviously, to do this a product has to reach a basic threshold of profitability. This will differ depending on where you are. I live in Cape Town, South Africa where the cost of living is low (compared to the US and EU). I reached basic profitability, matching an average developer salary here, about 10 months ago, and since then I’ve been improving my projects. Not to grow at all cost, but to ensure that people using the tool have an ever-improving experience.</p>
<p>This is my garden, and I intend to putter.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Now that it’s December, it’s time for two of my favorite traditions from the tech world: the <a href="https://raku-advent.blog/">Raku Advent Calendar</a> and <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/about">Advent of Code</a>.  These two holiday traditions have a fair amount in common – they both run from December 1 through Christmas, and both involve releasing something new every day during the event.  Specifically, the Raku Advent Calendar releases a new blog post about the <a href="https://www.raku.org/">Raku programming language</a>, while Advent of Code releases a new programming challenge – which can be solved in any language.</p>
<p>(In this post, I’ll be referring to Advent of Code as “AoC” – not to be confused with the American politician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez">AOC</a> who, to the best of my knowledge, does not program in Raku.)</p>
<p>For me, Raku and AoC are the chocolate and peanut butter of tech Advent season: each is great on its own, but they’re even better in combination.  If your only goal is to solve AoC challenges, Raku is a great language to use; on the other hand, if your only goal is to learn Raku, then solving AoC challenges is a great way to do so.  This post will explain how Raku and AoC are such a good fit and then provide some resources to help us all get started solving AoC challenges.</p>

<p>Since Raku is a relatively new programming language, at least some of you may not be familiar with it or why it’s worth learning.  Raku is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rakulang/comments/ixo408/how_would_you_describe_raku_in_one_sentence/">notoriously hard</a> to pin down in a single sentence, but here’s my attempt:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Raku</strong> A concise, expressive, aggressively multiparadigm language with strongly inferred types, built-in concurrency, rich metaprogramming, and best-in-class string processing and pattern matching.</p></blockquote>
<p>What this means in practice is that I find myself reaching for Raku increasingly often.  When faced with pretty much any problem, I keep concluding that Raku is the language that will let me solve it in the clearest, fastest, and most elegant way possible.  (The one exception is if solving my problem demands the raw speed or low resource use of a compiled language.  But even in that relatively rare case, I’d probably write the performance-critical sections of my code in Rust and the rest in Raku, taking advantage of how <a href="https://raku-advent.blog/2019/12/13/day-4-a-little-rr/">well the two languages play together</a>.)</p>
<p>That’s not to say that Raku is a language that tries to be all things to all people.  In fact, Raku has a rare, laser-like focus on individual productivity and is willing to trade off some standard enterprise/large group features to achieve that goal, as I’ve previously discussed at length (<a href="https://www.codesections.com/blog/raku-manifesto/">part 1</a>, <a href="https://www.codesections.com/blog/raku-manifesto-2/">part 2</a>, <a href="https://www.codesections.com/blog/raku-manifesto-3/">part 3</a>).  But, even setting those big-picture ideas aside, Raku is a language that’s full of interesting ideas.  If those ideas are even half as good as I believe them to be, then Raku is a language you’ll want in your toolbelt.</p>

<p>I believe that Raku is a good fit for solving many different problems, but it’s definitely an <em>excellent</em> fit for Advent of Code challenges.  To explain why, I’ll walk through what we’d want out of an ideal AoC language.  Then I’ll present a Raku solution to last year’s first AoC challenge and compare it to our ideal.  (Spoiler: they’re really similar!)</p>
<p>When thinking about the ideal AoC language, the first feature of AoC that comes to mind is that it’s a series of small, largely self-contained puzzles rather than one large project.  This suggests that the ideal language would be <strong>concise and low-boilerplate</strong>.  It’s annoying but bearable to deal with many lines of boilerplate when setting up a large project, but it’d be far worse to do so repeatedly on each day of AoC.  And, since we’ll be sharing our code, keeping it concise will help others see our logic without being distracted by housekeeping details.</p>
<p>We can be a bit more specific: the AoC challenges typically provide textual input and look for textual output; they also usually provide several test cases that can help to craft a working solution.  Thus, in addition to being concise in general, our ideal language should offer low-boilerplate solutions for <strong>scripting and testing</strong>.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most notable (and certainly most fun!) feature of AoC is that it’s community driven and educational: thousands of programmers are all solving the same puzzles on more or less the same schedule, and are then posting their solutions to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/">Advent of Code subreddit</a>.  It’s very common to learn as much or more from reading other solutions – including ones in different languages – as you do from solving the challenge yourself.  This means that our ideal language should be <strong>readable and elegant</strong>, even for people without much experience in the language.</p>
<p>Of course, while it’s great to be able to write code that people unfamiliar with the language can appreciate, much of our teaching and learning will come from comparing our solutions to other solutions in the same language.  After all, different solutions in the same language will often show approaches that make different tradeoffs and can help expand our programming toolset.  Or at least that happens if different solutions in our language are, well, <em>different</em>: if our language pushes everyone towards a single, obvious solution, then there will be much less room for that sort of learning.  So our ideal language should offer <strong>more than one way</strong> to solve any particular challenge.</p>
<p>I’m sure I could go on, but it seems like we have a pretty good list.  To sum up, we’re looking for a language that’s concise and low-boilerplate, especially for scripting and testing, and that allows for multiple different readable and elegant solutions to each challenge.  (Note that this list is about finding the best language for learning from and enjoying AoC.  If your goal is to place highly on the AoC leaderboard, then Raku’s excellent string processing features would still make it a <a href="https://blog.vero.site/post/advent-leaderboard#get-comfortable-with-your-language-standard-library-and-editor">good fit</a>.  But, realistically, if that’s your goal, you should pick whatever language you know best.)</p>
<p>Now that we know what we’d want in an ideal language, let’s take a look at a Raku solution to last year’s first challenge.</p>
<h3>AoC 2019 day 1 in Raku</h3>
<p>You can read the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/1">full problem description</a> for all the details, but the short version is that this challenge asks us to make a few different calculations about the fuel required to launch a spaceship based on its mass.  Specifically, in Part 1 we are told:</p>
<blockquote><p>to find the fuel required for a module, take its mass, divide by three, round down, and subtract 2.</p></blockquote>
<p>Because Raku has an <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#index-entry-Integer_division_operator">integer division operator</a>, this is almost trivially easy:</p>
<pre id="advent-code-df24120f-e53b-43d4-ae09-2cf83537f27d"><table>

<tbody>

<tr>

<td id="file-df24120f-e53b-43d4-ae09-2cf83537f27d-p6-L1"></td>


<td id="file-df24120f-e53b-43d4-ae09-2cf83537f27d-p6-LC1"><span>sub</span> fuel($mass) { <span>+</span>$mass <span>div</span> <span>3</span> <span>-</span> <span>2</span> }</td>

</tr>

</tbody>

</table>
</pre>
<p>Part 2 asks us to perform a similar calculation, but this time to take into account the extra mass added by the fuel we’re adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fuel itself requires fuel just like a module – take its mass, divide by three, round down, and subtract 2. However, that fuel also requires fuel, and that fuel requires fuel, and so on.</p></blockquote>
<p>To solve this part, we can use our <code>fuel</code> function from Part 1 to calculate how much fuel we need, and then add our initial result to the amount of fuel we need for the new mass.</p>
<pre id="advent-code-624b81de-c473-4ed9-bf9e-ac9f982a564d"><table>
































<tbody>































<tr>
































<td id="file-624b81de-c473-4ed9-bf9e-ac9f982a564d-p6-L1"></td>
































































<td id="file-624b81de-c473-4ed9-bf9e-ac9f982a564d-p6-LC1"><span>multi</span> total-fuel($mass) { fuel($mass)<span>.</span>&amp;{<span>$_</span> <span>+</span> <span>.</span>&amp;total-fuel} }</td>
































</tr>
































</tbody>































</table>
</pre>
<p>Part 2 also tells us:</p>
<blockquote><p>Any mass that would require negative fuel should instead be treated as if it requires zero fuel.</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, Raku offers a powerful feature that makes this simple: in this case, the powerful feature is Raku’s ability to pattern match against run-time values in <a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Signature#index-entry-where_clause">function signatures</a>.</p>
<pre id="advent-code-b3191b98-d3f9-4dae-a6da-56dc04d34ec7"><table>
































<tbody>































<tr>
































<td id="file-b3191b98-d3f9-4dae-a6da-56dc04d34ec7-p6-L1"></td>
































































<td id="file-b3191b98-d3f9-4dae-a6da-56dc04d34ec7-p6-LC1"><span>multi</span> total-fuel($mass <span>where</span> fuel($mass) ≤ <span>0</span>) { <span>0</span> }</td>
































</tr>
































</tbody>































</table>
</pre>
<p>With those three lines, we’ve essentially solved the challenge.  Of course, we want to be able to perform this calculation not just on single numbers but on our entire input (which, for this challenge, takes the form of a text file with a different number on each line).  We also want our script to be executable and to expose a CLI with a user-friendly description and <code>--help</code> text.  This CLI should allow the user to select whether our script solves Part 1 or Part 2 of the challenge.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Raku lets us add all of these niceties with a grand total of three additional lines of code and a shebang comment.  This gets our full solution so far to the following:</p>

<p>(The comments embedded in lines 2 and 3 produce the <code>--help</code> documentation.)</p>
<p>The challenge also provides 7 test cases that we should probably include.  When working on a larger Raku project, the <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/testing">standard approach</a> would be to split our tests out into a separate file.  But we’re <a href="https://www.perl.com/pub/2007/12/06/soto-11.html/">going scripting</a> and it would be a shame to give up our single-file simplicity.  So, instead of using a separate file, we’ll use a technique that I <a href="https://www.codesections.com/blog/raku-unit-testing-with-conditional-compilation/">previously blogged about</a> to use Raku’s conditional compilation to include our tests in a single file without executing them every time we run our script.</p>
<p>Using that technique, here’s what we get for our final code, including tests:</p>

    <p>As technology advances, we are distracted by more things than ever, and it is getting harder to draw a strict line between work and free time. There are several time management techniques offering help to make ourselves more effective while working. One of the most acknowledged among them is the Pomodoro technique. The best approach is to download a Pomodoro timer app, so we help you below to navigate the solution landscape.</p>

<p>As I take a look around my desk, while writing this article, I see at least a dozen physical and virtual elements that distract me. Working from home office during the quarantine did even amplify my inner voices saying: “Chat with your friends instead.”, “That email could be extremely important!”, “Aren’t you hungry?”</p>
<p>Time management issues are among the hottest topics when it comes to organizing work. The above distractions cost the global economy billions of dollars as, according to a recent study, almost 80% of an average workday is spent on activities with low value. Distractions, poor prioritization, procrastination lead to in-effective days and longer-than-needed workdays.</p>
<p><strong>The Pomodoro technique</strong> is a method with a single goal in mind: giving a valid, realistic timeframe in which you can focus, while also allowing you to have regular, yet controlled breaks. Pomodoro is a time management method invented by Italian gentleman Francesco Cirillo in the 1980s. It was named after a tomato-shaped timer used in the kitchen working with 25-minute time intervals, the predecessor of today’s Pomodoro timer app solutions. The essence of the Pomodoro technique is to do only one task intensively and focused for 25 minutes and then take a 5-minute break. Then work again for 25 minutes and break again for 5 minutes. After every fourth Pomodoro-interval, take a longer break of 20-30 minutes.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that you can’t sip a cup of coffee during a 25-minute long Pomodoro, rather be prepared with that coffee beforehand, so that you wouldn’t need to get up your chair and with it fall out from the rhythm and paste you were just picking up.</p>
<h2>What makes this technique so powerful?</h2>
<div>
<div>
    <h3>Pomodoro is designed to be easy to start with</h3>
    <p>You do not need to populate page-long matrixes, nor estimate all the work for the whole week. It cannot be simpler! There are Pomodoro timer app solutions that don’t even require registration, making it super-easy to kick-off.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>It helps to avoid multitasking</h3>
    <p>Continuous task-switching, regardless of how good you are in multitasking, heavily affects performance. A study by researcher Laura Bowman at Central Connecticut State University sheds light on what happens during a nowadays standard example of task-switching. Students who used Facebook Messenger while reading a textbook took 25% longer to read the same part (excluding time spent on chatting) than students who only used their time reading. The results clearly showed that the quality of performance deteriorates when concentrating on multiple tasks “simultaneously”.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>It helps battling procrastination</h3>
    <p>Studies show that breaking down tasks to the smallest possible parts helps the brain to see them as easy-to-solve tasks, which eventually will hold back procrastination tendencies.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>It also helps your body</h3>
    <p>Just use part of the 5-min long pauses to move and flex your back, hip, arms, and legs. Changing the focus distance of your eyes once in a while, aka not looking at your monitor constantly, also helps to keep them healthier. </p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Making good use of the Pomodoro technique</h2>
<p>Here are a few tips on how to nurture this technique to achieve your best self.</p>
<div>
<div>
    <h3>Use to-do lists</h3>
    <p>Pomodoro is not simply about pushing a timer or using an app: the number one rule to this technique is to have well-prepared tasks at hand. If you have larger projects, break them down into the smallest parts that you can do. An example: writing an article is a complex project with a lot of research and creative penning. Putting simply “writing an article” on the to-do list is ineffective because it is hard to know how much time and what resources are needed. If you break it down into smaller elements like researching the topic, finding statistics, writing a catchy intro, etc. - that helps your brain to see the big picture and prioritize correctly.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Organize your tasks into pomodoros (tomatoes)</h3>
    <p>These little tomato timeframes should include as many tasks you can handle in a 25-minute long round. The experience will make you better at estimating the right amounts, however, you can do an educated guess if you have done the project breakdown correctly.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Focus, focus, and focus</h3>
    <p>Your 25-minute long Pomodoros should be done with only one thing in mind: finishing your tasks. This might sound too strict at first, but these timeframes are designed in the exact length of an average worker’s/student’s concentration capacity in mind. No emails, no Messenger, and other chats, only your favorite music and the tasks you prepared for yourself.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Applications and websites that support you along the journey</h2>
<p>After the theory, let’s see how the above can be put into practice. While Francesco Cirillo had fewer distractions back in his day, he did not have a Pomodoro technique app to help him focus. Today’s solutions are much more than simple timers. Let’s see what apps out there you can leverage.</p>
<h3>1. <a href="https://www.forestapp.cc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forest app</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/Forest-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/Forest-logo.png" alt="Forest logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> iOS, Android</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> This application helps you to stay focused and introduces a gamified approach of planting and growing trees. If you start working and use your phone in a non-related way (eg. open Messenger), you get a waring. If you keep switching back from your tasks to less important distractions, your tree will stop growing and will eventually dry out. You are free to set the time frame for how long you want to focus between 10 and 120 minutes. After each period is completed, you receive coins in proportion to how long you have not used your phone. (From which you can buy beautiful trees that are just waiting to be grown.)</p>
<p>Moreover, if you are persistent enough, you can plant a real tree in a designated place, which can be a real motivating force. You can listen to the background noise of a Parisian café or a sandy beach to help to focus.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with Pomodoro:</strong> Setting up 25-minute long intervals in Forest will just do the trick. However, measuring quick breaks and long pauses are not yet available. Still, if you are looking for a great Pomodoro timer app, that helps you focus and forces you - in a gamified way - to do so, Forest is a wonderful choice.</p>
<h3>2. <a href="https://www.flatpomodoro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flat Tomato</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/FlatTomato-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/FlatTomato-logo.png" alt="FlatTomato logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> iOs, macOS</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> This Mac- and iOS-only application is crafted to fulfill every need of a Pomodoro-er. Wonderful design with easy-to-use interfaces supports you along your day of study and work. You can set tasks, start timers for the different intervals and you can also listen to ambient music and background noises, such as ocean waves, to support your focus. And what makes it a top-ranked, best Pomodoro app? It offers smart reports and analytics to understand what you have done, which, to be honest, gives quite the satisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with Pomodoro:</strong> The app’s core is the Pomodoro technique, and all its features are designed with that in mind.</p>
<h3>3. <a href="https://www.focustodo.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Focus To-do</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/FocusToDo-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/FocusToDo-logo.png" alt="FocusToDo logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> iOS, Android, macOS, Windows</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> At first, Focus To-Do seems similar to Flat Tomato and at its core, they both are to help you nurture the Pomodoro technique. However, Focus To-Do offers a complete platform to set up different tasks with categorization, prioritization capabilities. By standard Pomodoro and task management can be done via two different solutions using integrations, Focus To-Do offers them under one umbrella.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with Pomodoro:</strong> You will be able to break down your tasks into small pomodoros and organize them throughout your day. This is by far the best Pomodoro technique app if you are looking for an all-in-one solution.</p>
<h3>4. <a href="https://www.focusboosterapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Focus Booster</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/FocusBooster-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/FocusBooster-logo.png" alt="FocusBooster logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> web, iOS, Android, macOS, Windows</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> This solution is close to its competitor, Flat Tomato, but is available on all platforms, including on the web via a browser. Its features are centered on the Pomodoro technique. You can set timers, do the intervals and breaks, and review your data after your session on a minimalist, yet beautiful user interface.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with Pomodoro:</strong> One of the best solutions to utilize the Pomodoro technique as it is easy-to-setup and affordable.</p>
<h3>5. <a href="https://pomofocus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pomofocus</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/Pomofocus-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique/Pomofocus-logo.png" alt="Pomofocus logo"></picture> <strong>Platform:</strong> web</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> The most straightforward and minimalistic approach to measure your intervals. You can make the best out of it even as a guest, but then you won't be able to see your results in well-organized charts. If you need to quickly set up your Pomodoro infrastructure, this is the best solution.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with Pomodoro:</strong> Stripped down to its very core is by far the most intuitive Pomodoro solution. No app, no install - use it simply by accessing their website and allowing your browser to notify you.</p>
<h2>What makes a Pomodoro application and website effective?</h2>
<div>
<div>
    <h3>Easy-to-use</h3>
    <p>Any apps should be intuitive to be picked up by users, but it especially stands for solutions meant to make our lives easier. Imagine a software that takes away your time to make you able to get a better performer.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Integrations</h3>
    <p>Managing complex projects nowadays require several software solutions to use and the best way to utilize them is via integrations. Data shared between these apps makes your life so much easier.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Reporting</h3>
    <p>Analytics is key not just for your boss to see your performance, but to show results for yourself. It provides satisfaction to see all the tasks you’ve accomplished.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>The self organizing tree (SOT) is a type of artificial neural network based on the self organizing map (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing_map">SOM</a>). It uses an unsupervised, competitive learning algorithm to store representations of the input space. Unlike the conventional SOM, where a data point is given to every node of the SOM, in SOTs a forward propagation requires to compute a competition between only $log(N)$ nodes, where $N$ is the number of nodes the model has. This makes the SOT computationally significantly more efficient than a conventional SOM. The neighbourhood of a SOT is also differently defined than in a SOM. While in a 2D SOM, nodes are organized in a grid like fashion, the SOT’s nodes are organized in the form of a binary tree. The binary tree structure allows SOTs to find a best matching unit with fewer steps, however, its computational efficiency comes with a cost. While in the SOM, $N$ nodes can become best matching units, in the SOT only $N/2$ of the nodes can potentially become best matching units. In this short blog post, I’ll only explain the fundamentals of how a SOT works. Why it’s useful and how it can be used, I’ll explain in Part 2.</p>

<h2 id="introduction---self-organizing-map">Introduction - Self Organizing Map</h2>
<p>The self organizing map (SOM), also known as the Kohonen map, differs quite a lot from today’s backpropagation-based artificial neural networks. While backpropagation-based neural nets correct their weights by computing gradients according to a cost function, nodes in SOMs update their weights through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_learning">competitive learning</a>. In competitive learning, nodes in a network compete for the right to activate for a certain input. As a result, each node specializes overtime to fire only when a specific input is given. This specialization of nodes caused by competition, can also be viewed as a variant of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebbian_learning">Hebbian learning</a>.</p>

<p>To prevent confusion, when learning about SOMs, it’s best to forget anything you know about neural networks. There are no activation functions, no backpropagation, no dot product between inputs and weights. The architecture of a (2D) SOM simply consists of a grid of neurons (also known as units, or nodes). Each node of the SOM is fully connected to the input layer, as shown in figure 1.</p>

<p>
  <img width="300" height="300" src="https://lums.blog/assets/images/posts/2020/som1.png">
  <em><br>Figure 1. Illustration of a SOM architecture.</em>
</p>

<p>As SOMs are trained in an unsupervised way, no targets are necessary to train it. After the weights of the model are initialized, competitive learning is used during training. The steps of the learning algorithm are straightforward:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Compute the Euclidean distance of the input vector and the weight vectors of the SOM.</li>
  <li>Find the node with the smallest distance. This node is also called the <strong>best matching unit</strong> (BMU).</li>
  <li>The BMU neighbourhood radius is calculated. The neighbourhood radius usually starts as a large value and gradually decreases with every time step (Note: There are SOM variants where the neighbourhood radius does not decrease according to the time step, allowing for online learning without a pre-defined number of iterations).</li>
  <li>The weight vector of every node inside this neighbourhood radius is adjusted to become more similar to the input vector. The further away a node is from the BMU, the less its weights are updated.</li>
  <li>Repeat all steps for N iterations.</li>
</ul>

<p>

  <em><br>Figure 2. Illustration of the SOM's neighbourhood radius changing with every iteration.</em>
</p>

<p>Because of the competitive learning algorithm, SOMs are able to preserve the topological properties of the input space, allowing for nice visualizations. SOMs in fact are rarely used for anything else these days, but as we will see in future posts, the core ideas of SOMs can be quite useful. A nice SOM implementation in PyTorch can be found <a href="https://github.com/giannisnik/som">here</a>. If you want to know more about the SOM implementation, <a href="http://www.ai-junkie.com/ann/som/som1.html">AI-Junkie’s</a> blog post goes in great depth.</p>

<h2 id="self-organizing-tree">Self Organizing Tree</h2>
<p>In a SOM, we have to calculate the Euclidean distances between the input vector and all the weight vectors. For large SOMs, this can be computationally demanding. In the SOT on the other hand, we have to calculate only $2 * log(N)$ Euclidean distances, where $N$ is the number of nodes in the SOT. That is because the SOT’s architecture - it is structured as a binary tree (see figure 3).</p>

<p>
  <img width="650" height="650" src="https://lums.blog/assets/images/posts/2020/sot1.png">
  <em><br>Figure 3. The architecture of a self organizing tree. Every node contains a weight vector.</em>
</p>

<p>Before going into how the learning algorithm of the SOT works, let’s first have a closer look at the architecture. In figure 3, I have labeled every node with an index. The indices serve just for clarification. The node with the zero index represents our input vector, or our <strong>input node</strong>. Every other node in the tree contains a weight vector that has the same size as the input vector. The nodes of the tree that do not have any children, are also known as <strong>leaf nodes</strong>. In contrast to SOMs, where every node can potentially become the BMU for an input, in the SOT only leaf nodes can become BMUs. The intermediate nodes in the tree, i.e. the ones that have children, are known as <strong>Non-leaf nodes</strong>, or simply as <strong>parent nodes</strong>. The number of layers per tree is also known as the tree <strong>depth</strong> (denoted as $D$). A tree with 16 leaf nodes for example, will have a depth of 4.</p>

<p>
  <img width="650" height="650" src="https://lums.blog/assets/images/posts/2020/sot2.png">
  <em><br>Figure 4. An input vector propagating through the self organizing tree. The nodes inside the blue line, represent the nodes that won the layer-wise competitions.</em>
</p>

<p>When training a SOT, instead of feeding the input vector to every single node in the tree, we simply feed it to the children of the input layer (nodes $1$ and $2$). We then compute the Euclidean distance for the two nodes. The node that wins the competition, i.e. the node with the smallest distance, feeds the input vector to its children. The competition repeats until two leaf nodes are reached (see figure 4). As we can see, in the SOT, only two nodes compete with one another per layer. After $D$ iterations, the input vector will have passed through the tree and will have reached two leaf nodes, where the last competition is calculated. The winning leaf node represents the BMU.</p>

<p>

  <em><br>Figure 5. An illustration showing how nodes in a tree are updated in clusters. The BMU (node 20) is updated the most. Its parent node and its other branch get updated slightly less. The parent node of the parent node, and its other branch get updated even less, and so on. The learning rate diminishes the further away we get from the BMU in the tree.</em>
</p>

<p>After finding the BMU for a given input vector, the weight vector of every node is adjusted to become more similar to the input vector (see figure 5). The learning rates for the updates are “tree-depth-dependent”. We will have $D$ learning rates, ordered in decreasing order. The BMU is updated with the largest learning rate, adjusting it closer to the input vector. When we go one level up the tree (to the BMU’s parent node), the parent node and its other branch will be updated with the second learning rate, which is slightly smaller than the BMU’s learning rate. The higher we go up the tree, the less every branch and parent gets updated. An implementation of the self organizing tree can be found in this <a href="https://github.com/LumRamabaja/Self-Organizing-Tree/blob/main/SOT.py">Github repository</a>.</p>

<p>After some iterations, the nodes of the SOT will specialize to fire to specific inputs. The code below is an example of how to train a simple SOT with 32 leaf nodes on the <a href="https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist">fashion-mnist</a> dataset.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After a few iterations, patterns will start to emerge in the weight vectors of the SOT (see figure 6).
SOTs have an interesting attribute: The further away we go from the leaf nodes, i.e. the closer we get to the input node, the less meaningful the weights get (see figure 7). The first two nodes of the SOT are basically just blobs. The deeper we get in the tree however, the more specialized the nodes will be.</p>

<p>
  <img width="1000" height="1000" src="https://lums.blog/assets/images/posts/2020/sot_filters.png">
  <em><br>Figure 6. The weight vectors of three leaf nodes taken from from the SOT that was trained on the fashion-mnist dataset. Darker regions represent weight values close to zero, whereas lighter regions represent weight values closer to one. Leaf nodes are the most specialized nodes in the SOT.</em>

  <em><br>Figure 7. The weight vectors of the first two nodes of the SOT. Darker regions represent weight values close to zero, whereas lighter regions represent weight values closer to one. The first nodes are the least specialized nodes in the SOT.</em>
</p>

<p>The necessary lack of specialization of the non-leaf nodes that are close to the input node, can be problematic when performing a forward pass. If for some reason a wrong turn is taken during propagation, the input vectors can end up landing at the wrong leaf node and mess up the state of the already specialized nodes. Logically, the more possible states an input vector can have, the more likely it gets for an input vector to make a mistake during propagation, compared to a case where we have less possible states. To better understand the problem, Lets take an example (see figure 8 as a reference): Lets say a certain input vector, $X_a$, usually gets mapped at node $29$, or at a leaf node close to $29$. This region of the tree is specialized to fire whenever it sees $X_a$. Now lets say another input $X_b$ propagates through the tree and lands at leaf node …</p></div></div>

Made in Japan in 2005</figcaption></figure>
<p>Today, I would like to show something different, than usual reverse-engineering, that appears on my blog usually. I needed to prepare a Linux distro for myself to be able to run it on my PC. But not the ordinary operating system that we download from webpage, then use fancy graphical installer to select, what we want and where. My goals were very specific. First was to have it custom-compiled. With that in mind there aren’t many choices left (maybe Gentoo?). Second was to not cross 16 MiB boundary. Why exactly that? That’s simple. I have old (15 years old to be precise) SD/MMC card made for Canon of exactly that size. Quick check showed me that this is possible. I tried buildroot and it failed to fulfill second requirement and I decided not to continue, despite the obvious optimizations on kernel modules, I could do. It’s simply too complex for such a simple task. If not buildroot, then let’s go and see how to do such thing from scratch!</p>

<p>Basically the plan is to have custom Linux distro compiled from scratch. It may sound like something incredibly complex and hard to do. But it’s not. There are just few problems one must learn on how to overcome. The most problematic constraint in my case is, obviously, 16 MiB limit. To not exceed it, I have to use busybox as my userspace. This by the way simplifies distro development significantly. Busybox works the way, that, if linked statically, requires only one, single binary to be able to work correctly. So, to sum up, on software side, we need Linux and busybox. You may wonder, how do I want to boot that system, then? Well. I said I need Linux 🙂 Maybe some people know, some does not, that Linux is itself a boot loader of some kind. At least, when using UEFI and this is what I want to use, it can be loaded directly by UEFI firmware. But that’s another thing to note – I will describe a way to prepare a distro for UEFI – it won’t be as simple as that, for legacy BIOS.</p>
<p>The whole plan will look as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get compiler</li>
<li>Compile Linux kernel</li>
<li>Compile busybox (statically and stripped!)</li>
<li>Prepare initramfs with whole userspace</li>
<li>Format drive as EFI System Partition</li>
<li>Combine kernel and initramfs into single binary</li>
<li>Optionally sign the binary, in case we want Secure Boot to be enabled</li>
<li>Add entry to embedded UEFI boot manager</li>
</ol>
<p>In the meantime, I am going to show few ways to debug the system, in case of any problems.<span id="more-1624"></span></p>

<p>This is maybe not so obvious, but you need new compiler. Most likely, you could use the one that your distro provides, aliased as simply gcc. But this way, you will by the way use glibc as your standard library. For a lightweight system, glibc does not fit well, as this is most heavyweight libc, we have available. Therefore, I will use uClibc. And for that, we need a compiler. Or, to be precise, a toolchain. A toolchain, consisting of kernel headers, uClibc and gcc. Here, I could show, how to build such thing from scratch. But it’s not a tutorial about building a toolchain. This requires knowledge that can fill another tutorial. Instead, I will use the toolchain prepared by my latest project – <a href="https://github.com/v3l0c1r4pt0r/cc-factory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cc-factory</a>. For those, who did not read <a href="https://re-ws.pl/2020/10/meet-cc-factory-a-factory-for-cross-compilers/">my previous post</a>, it is toolchain factory running in Docker container, that provides a recipe for a toolchain that just works. If you tried compiling a toolchain from scratch in the past, then you know that this can fail, even if you use crosstool-ng. With cc-factory, it works as long as Docker can start a service and has Docker Hub working. But enough of that. In cc-factory, I am experimenting with releasing binary distributions of my toolchain. And <a href="https://github.com/v3l0c1r4pt0r/cc-factory/releases/tag/x86_64-gcc10.2.0-linux5.9.13-uclibc1.0.36-1">newest one</a> is special-made for this job. You can simply download it to you disk with:</p>
<pre>wget <span>'</span><span>https://github.com/v3l0c1r4pt0r/cc-factory/releases/download/x86_64-gcc10.2.0-linux5.9.13-uclibc1.0.36-1/x86_64-gcc10.2.0-linux5.9.13-uclibc1.0.36-1.tar.gz</span><span>'</span>
</pre>
<p>After that, you have to install it to your <code>/opt</code> directory with:</p>
<pre>tar <span>-xvf</span> x86_64-gcc10.<span>2</span>.0-linux5.<span>9</span>.13-uclibc1.<span>0</span>.36-1.tar.gz <span>-C</span> /
</pre>
<p>If you prefer another installation path, then head onto cc-factory project to see, how to build one from source. Then, you can choose whatever path, you like for this SDK.</p>
<p>Next step is to export SDK’s bin directory to you PATH for convenience:</p>
<pre><span>export</span> <span>PATH</span>=<span>"</span><span>$PATH</span><span>:/opt/x86_64-linux-uclibc/bin</span><span>"</span>
</pre>
<p>Now, it’s nice to check, if toolchain works. Let’s write one-liner C hello world program to your temp directory, compile and run:</p>
<pre><span>echo</span><span> -e </span><span>'</span><span>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\nint main() {printf("Hello, World!\\n");}</span><span>'</span> <span>&gt;</span>/tmp/main.c
x86_64-linux-uclibc-gcc <span>-static</span> <span>-o</span> /tmp/main /tmp/main.c
/tmp/main
</pre>
<p>And you should see the familiar text on your screen. You are ready to go!</p>

<p>That is, in my opinion, the easiest part. First, we have to download kernel image, that we want to use. For that purpose, we need to go to <a href="https://www.kernel.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kernel Archives</a> and download latest stable tarball. Optionally, we can download PGP signature and verify its correctness. But this is outside the scope of this tutorial. Another option to get kernel is to clone its stable repo with:</p>
<pre>git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git
</pre>
<p>This is the path, I chose, because I don’t like leaving multiple copies of kernel sources on my hard drive, so I prefer to have one, central clone of repo and use for any project, I need it to.</p>
<p>In case of tarball, it now has to be unpacked with usual:</p>
<pre>tar <span>-xvf</span> linux-*.tar.gz
</pre>
<p>Then, in case of tarball, you got directory with name dependent on you kernel version, in case of git repo, it is simply linux. So we can cd into it, in any of the above cases:</p>
<pre><span>cd</span> linux*
</pre>
<p>In theory at this point, we could set the compiler, we prepared to be run by kernel buildsystem. But this is optional, as we target <code>x86_64</code> platform, that we run our host on, so default compiler should be as good as uClibc variant. I case, you want to use custom one, you have to export the following:</p>
<pre><span>export</span> <span>CROSS_COMPILE</span>=x86_64-linux-uclibc-
</pre>
<p>Now, we have to configure our kernel.</p>
<p>First step is to choose defconfig. Possible values can be listed in case of x86 with:</p>
<pre><span>ls</span> arch/x86/configs/
</pre>
<p>At the time of writing this returned the following options:</p>
<pre>i386_defconfig tiny.config x86_64_defconfig xen.config
</pre>
<p>As you can see, there are only a few. So, we do:</p>
<pre>make x86_64_defconfig
</pre>
<p>At this point, we are ready to compile. In case, you want to do some modifications, you could do:</p>
<pre>make menuconfig
</pre>
<p>And select (or deselect) some options there. If you think, you are ready, you can type:</p>
<pre>make <span>-j</span>
</pre>
<p>And wait couple of minutes (up to half an hour), depending on speed of your PC. Afterwards, you should see that <code>bzImage</code> has been made and is available at <code>arch/x86/boot/bzImage</code>. We can copy it somewhere in order to not accidentally start its recompilation:</p>
<pre>cp arch/x86/boot/bzImage ../
</pre>
<h2>Testing on hardware</h2>
<p>At this point, it is possible to run the kernel on our system. If you don’t have Secure Boot enabled, then you can try to copy the kernel to you EFI System Partition (wherever it is, I will call this path <code>ESP</code> from now on). But first create new directory for your distro:</p>
<pre><span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> ESP/EFI/linux
cp arch/x86/boot/bzImage ESP/EFI/linux/linuxx64.efi
</pre>
<p>I am changing the name in the meantime, as I heard that some systems does not like binaries without <code>.efi</code> extension. Now, we can try to boot.There is more than one way to do it. The one that works always is to utilize EFI firmware directly. But this one differs significantly between manufacturers, so if you prefer that one, please refer to his support pages. The other is to use one of existing tools. For sure KeyTool, that manages Secure Boot keys, is able to start any executable from ESP by browsing the filesystem. But the way I would like to show is, by using so called EFI shell. Why? Because EFI shell allows us to experiment with kernel parameters, by simply typing them, as we would start new user program. And, in fact, from EFI perspective, we simply start a new program.</p>
<p>There are many shells in the wild. I tried EDK2, that is available on Arch as <code>edk2-shell</code> package. It is then available at <code>/usr/share/edk2-shell/x64/Shell.efi</code> You can simply copy it to <code>ESP</code>, just like with kernel, then you have to add it to your EFI boot manager, or use boot manager that is able to autodetect it. You can find a bunch of resources on how to do it, even from inside Linux. But, please do not add the kernel, you copied in such way, to boot manager, as we will play with it a bit, later. Now, in EFI shell, you will be presented with a list of partitions, that the shell has detected. This might be not so obvious at first, but, somehow, you have to identify the one, that is you EFI partition. You should see a similar numbering to the one you see in Linux console, when you list with e.g. <code>lsblk</code>. You can try guessing it by typing its name, in similar way as in Windows, e.g.:</p>
<pre>FS0:
</pre>
<p>to switch to <code>FS0</code> partition. Then you can simply type ls to list its content. Once, you found the right one, it’s worth to remember it, as you might need it couple of times. How many, depends on how many problems, you would have.</p>
<p>Then go to the directory, where you copied your kernel:</p>
<pre><span>cd</span> EFI\linux
</pre>
<p>And ls to make sure, it is there. Now, we are ready to call it:</p>
<pre>linuxx64.efi
</pre>
<p>Yes. It’s as simple as that. But this will fail. We did not provide any root filesystem for our kernel, so it will gonna panic. But don’t worry, as long as reason of the panic is like that:</p>
<pre>not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)
</pre>
<p>then it was expected. In case of any other error, act accordingly, as this may be hardware dependent. So, probably, something has to be reconfigured in menuconfig.</p>
<h2>Testing in qemu</h2>
<p>It’s quite a nice option to be able to test your work on real hardware. However, in my opinion, it is much easier to do it in virtualized environment, that you can quickly reset at any time and where you would have latest binaries for testing, all the time, without wasting time for flashing them somewhere. Therefore I recommend to prepare qemu as such environment.</p>
<p>For that, you will need …</p></div></article></div>

Every day until December 24th you will get an article, video or other functional programming related content that hopefully will make the waiting feel a bit shorter! 😄</p>
</section><article><section><p>As previous years the articles will span a large range of topics and complexity. If you are looking for something beginner friendly, or more advanced topics, there should be something for everyone these next 23 days.</p>
<p>Let’s start this advent of with a look at the basics: what is functional programming (FP)? This question has been answered many times before, in many different ways. <a href="https://functional.christmas/2019/1">We took our own stab at it last year</a>. Even though there are no single definition for FP and many different ways to approach it, there are some things that are shared throughout the related communities.</p>

<p>Today I want to use the words and pictures of Russ Olsen and highlight his talk from GOTO 2018. Russ is a great communicator and I love the down to earth and practical perspective he brings in this talk. He explains functional programming in an understandable way and shows why people prefer FP. I hope you enjoy! </p>

November 30, 2020 | https://blog.jonstodle.com/in-which-i-claim-rich-hickey-is-wrong/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.jonstodle.com/in-which-i-claim-rich-hickey-is-wrong/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>I recently watched a talk named <em><a href="https://blog.jonstodle.com/in-which-i-claim-rich-hickey-is-wrong/%5Bhttps://youtu.be/YR5WdGrpoug%5D(https://youtu.be/YR5WdGrpoug?t=464)">Maybe Not</a></em> by Rich HIckey, the creator of Clojure. I can't claim to be on his level when it comes to language design, but I will postulate that his arguments at the <a href="https://blog.jonstodle.com/in-which-i-claim-rich-hickey-is-wrong/%5Bhttps://youtu.be/YR5WdGrpoug?t=464%5D(https://youtu.be/YR5WdGrpoug?t=464)">7:45 minute mark</a> and about 2.5 minutes of watching, is wrong.</p>
<p>The subject he's covering is explicit "null" checks in languages that have an explicit type representing a missing value.</p>
<p>Languages like Haskell, F# and Rust express this through a type which may contain a value, or may not. You are then required to explicitly check whether the value is present before being able to use it. This is in contrast to languages like Java or C# which don't require you to do null checks, which might lead to null reference, or null pointer exceptions, respectively.</p>
<p>Back to Rich Hickey. He argues that changing an argument to a function from being explicitly non-null, to being possibly-null should not be a breaking change:</p>
<pre><span>// From this
</span><span>fn </span><span>do_something</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>: string) {}

</span><span>// To this
</span><span>fn </span><span>do_something</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>: Option&lt;string&gt;) {}
</span></pre>
<p>He argues that you are easing up on the requirements, and this shouldn't break existing callers: they are technically still passing valid values. He also argues the same for tightening the possible values for a return value:</p>
<pre><span>// From this
</span><span>fn </span><span>return_something</span><span>() -&gt; Option&lt;string&gt; {}

</span><span>// To this
</span><span>fn </span><span>return_something</span><span>() -&gt; string {}
</span></pre>
<p>Callers of this function might do a superfluous check for a value, but their code would still work.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.jonstodle.com/in-which-i-claim-rich-hickey-is-wrong/%5Bhttps://youtu.be/YR5WdGrpoug?t=464%5D(https://youtu.be/YR5WdGrpoug?t=464)">Watch the 2.5 minutes for a better explanation</a>.</p>

<p>Rich Hickey argues that these are not breaking changes, and should not require the callers to change their code - just because the internal implementation of the function became a little better.</p>
<p>This is missing part of the point. <strong>Why did the internals of the function change?</strong></p>
<p>Was it just because of an extra null check, or a new default fallback value? Has it become significant that you can pass a null value now? Is it significant that the operation now always seems to succeed, by never returning a null value?</p>
<p>You've changed the meaning of these values, and callers of this function should adapt to this new reality. Continuing to pass in the same values, or handle the same return values, in the same way as before should not be considered safe.</p>
<p>If there wasn't a change in behavior, why are you changing the contract?</p>
<p>You are changing the behavior of the function. <strong>That is a breaking change.</strong></p>

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          The QEMU Advent Calendar 2020 features a QEMU disk image each day of
          December until the 24th. Each day a new package becomes available
          for download.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every download contains a little 'run' shell script that starts the
          QEMU emulator with the recommended parameters for the disk image.
          Disk images are either contained directly in the download or are
          downloaded by the 'run' script (you need to have installed 'curl' or
          'wget' in that case).
        </p>
        <p>
          The disk images contain interesting operating systems and software
          that run under the QEMU emulator. Some of them are well-known or
          not-so-well-known operating systems, old and new, others are custom
          demos and neat algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 'run' scripts (and disk images if included in the download)
          were created by volunteers from the QEMU community to showcase cool
          software that QEMU can run.

  </figure><p>To set up your work environment for success, you need to reduce distractions.</p><ul><li><strong>Close Apps you are not using.</strong> I use an app called <a href="https://marco.org/apps" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Quitter</a> by Marco Arment. It lets you set up rules to close your apps after a set amount of time of it being inactive.</li><li><strong>Organize your files and folders.</strong> It’s a good idea to try to keep projects isolated to their own folder so they are easier to find. <em>I plan to write more about this one in a later article</em>.</li><li><strong>Tweak your notifications.</strong> If you can get away with turning on Do Not Disturb on your computer, this will be the most effective. But if you are expected to be prompt to slack messages and emails this may be a bit more tricky.</li><li><strong>Block distracting websites.</strong> Taking a 5-minute break on reddit can lead to you looking at cats that like loafs of bread an hour later. For Mac, there is a great app called <a href="https://selfcontrolapp.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Self Control</a> that lets you block certain websites for a set amount of time. The best part is that it’s very hard to get around this filer.</li><li><strong>Buy a good pair of noise-canceling headphones</strong> and find some music that helps you get into a flow state. I have a pair of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HVLUR86/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ATH-M50x</a> that have been my loyal choice for over 5 years (Not Sponsored <em>yet</em>). Music is one of the most underrated tools for programmers.</li></ul><h2 id="organize-your-tasks">Organize your tasks!</h2><p>For organizing tasks, it's useful to stick to analog. Yes, analog. I bet you thought this was going to be about cool apps huh? Nope, let me introduce you to this cool little thing called Bullet Journaling.</p><h3 id="bullet-journaling">Bullet Journaling</h3><p>At first, I was skeptical of this system but the more I have used it, the more I have fallen in love with it.</p><p>The best approach for bullet journaling is using <em>good ‘ol pencil and paper</em>.

  </figure><p>All you need to get started is:</p><ul><li>A blank or dotted journal 📓</li><li>A pen 🖋</li><li>A passion to get things done. ✍️</li></ul><p>It all starts with an index page. This page will keep your journal organized. Then you create a Future Log, A monthly log, and a daily log. The reason why this system works so well for developers with ADHD is that it's easy to tweak. If you want to have a page for your doodles of Triforces, go for it. If you want to create an elaborate health and fitness tracker, you can do it.</p><p>If you need inspiration, there is no shortage of creative posts on Pintrest and Instagram.</p><p>For more info on Bullet Journaling, I recommend reading the <a href="https://bulletjournal.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">official website</a>.</p><p>I also recommend watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkZEEQG6IVE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">How To ADHD’s video</a> on bullet journaling.</p><h2 id="exercise">Exercise</h2><p>Exercise has proven time and time again to be an excellent tool for just about everything.</p><p>On the mornings where I am not hitting the snooze button until the last moment, I try to get at least 30 minutes of exercise. I notice improvements in my mood and the ability to solve problems quicker.</p><p>It doesn’t need to be intense if you are starting your fitness journey, A walk around the park can do a lot for the mind. Proper exercise <a href="https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/adult-adhd-and-exercise#1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">is shown</a> to reduce most symptoms of ADHD.</p><h2 id="time-management">Time Management</h2><h3 id="pomodoro-timers">Pomodoro Timers</h3><p>Pomodora timer is a system to make sure you stay focused on a task followed by a short break.</p><p>This is an easy way to ensure that you are giving your mind time to relax and not hyper-focus for too long. Every 25 minutes or so, you take a 5-minute break. Then after 3 “Pomodoras”, you take a 15-minute break. This system forces you to stick to a task with a promised reward of time you can do whatever you want without feeling guilty. That’s the beauty of this system. I’m using one right now while I write this.</p><figure>

      One day in the mid-1920s, a Moscow newspaper reporter named
      Solomon Shereshevsky entered the laboratory of the psychologist
      Alexander Luria. Shereshevsky's boss at the newspaper had
      noticed that Shereshevsky never needed to take any notes, but
      somehow still remembered all he was told, and had suggested he
      get his memory checked by an expert.
    </p>

    <p>
      Luria began testing Shereshevsky's memory. He began with simple
      tests, short strings of words and of numbers. Shereshevsky
      remembered these with ease, and so Luria gradually increased the
      length of the strings. But no matter how long they got,
      Shereshevsky could recite them back.  Fascinated, Luria went on
      to study Shereshevsky's memory for the next 30 years.  In a book
      summing up his research*<span>* Alexander
      Luria, “The Mind of a Mnemonist”, Harvard University
      Press (1968).</span>, Luria reported that:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      [I]t appeared that there was no limit either to
      the <em>capacity</em> of S.'s memory or to the <em>durability of
      the traces he retained</em>. Experiments indicated that he had
      no difficulty reproducing any lengthy series of words whatever,
      even though these had originally been presented to him a week, a
      month, a year, or even many years earlier. In fact, some of
      these experiments designed to test his retention were performed
      (without his being given any warning) fifteen or sixteen years
      after the session in which he had originally recalled the
      words. Yet invariably they were successful.
    </blockquote>
      
    <p>
      Such stories are fascinating. Memory is fundamental to our
      thinking, and the notion of having a perfect memory is
      seductive.  At the same time, many people feel ambivalent about
      their own memory. I've often heard people say “I don't
      have a very good memory”, sometimes sheepishly, sometimes
      apologetically, sometimes even defiantly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Given how central memory is to our thinking, it's natural to ask
      whether computers can be used as tools to help improve our
      memory. This question turns out to be highly generative of good
      ideas, and pursuing it has led to many of the most important
      vision documents in the history of computing. One early example
      was Vannevar Bush's 1945 proposal*<span>*
      Vannevar
      Bush, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">As
      We May Think</a>, The Atlantic (1945).</span> for a mechanical
      memory extender, the memex. Bush wrote:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      A memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books,
      records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it
      may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an
      enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The memex vision inspired many later computer pioneers,
      including Douglas Engelbart's ideas about the augmentation of
      human intelligence, Ted Nelson's ideas about hypertext, and,
      indirectly, Tim Berners-Lee's conception of the world wide
      web*<span>* See, for example: Douglas
      Engelbart, <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Engelbart1962.pdf">Augmenting Human
      Intellect</a> (1962); Ted
      Nelson, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=806036">Complex
      information processing: a file structure for the complex, the
      changing and the indeterminate</a> (1965); and Tim
      Berners-Lee, <a href="https://w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html">Information
      Management: a Proposal</a> (1989).</span>. In his proposal for
      the web, Berners-Lee describes the need for his employer (the
      particle physics organization CERN) to develop a collective
      institutional memory,
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      a pool of information to develop which could grow and evolve
      with the organization and the projects it describes.
    </blockquote>


    <p>
      These are just a few of the many attempts to use computers to
      augment human memory. From the memex to the web to wikis to
      <a href="https://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a>
      to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu">Project
      Xanadu</a> to attempts
      to <a href="https://users.speakeasy.net/~lion/nb/book.pdf">make
      a map of every thought a person thinks</a>: the augmentation of
      memory has been an extremely generative vision for computing.

      <p>
	In this essay we investigate personal memory systems, that is,
	systems designed to improve the long-term memory of a single
	person. In the first part of the essay I describe my personal
	experience using such a system, named Anki. As we'll see, Anki
	can be used to remember almost anything. That is, Anki makes
	memory a <em>choice</em>, rather than a haphazard event, to be
	left to chance. I'll discuss how to use Anki to understand
	research papers, books, and much else. And I'll describe
	numerous patterns and anti-patterns for Anki use. While Anki
	is an extremely simple program, it's possible to develop
	virtuoso skill using Anki, a skill aimed at understanding
	complex material in depth, not just memorizing simple facts.
      </p>

      <p>
	The second part of the essay discusses personal memory systems
	in general. Many people treat memory ambivalently or even
	disparagingly as a cognitive skill: for instance, people often
	talk of “rote memory” as though it's inferior to
	more advanced kinds of understanding. I'll argue against this
	point of view, and make a case that memory is central to
	problem solving and creativity. Also in this second part,
	we'll discuss the role of cognitive science in building
	personal memory systems and, more generally, in building
	systems to augment human cognition.  In a future
	essay, <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/taylip.html">Toward a Young Lady's Illustrated
	Primer</a>, I will describe more ideas for personal memory
	systems.
      </p>

      <p>
	The essay is unusual in style. It's not a conventional
	cognitive science paper, i.e., a study of human memory and how
	it works. Nor is it a computer systems design paper, though
	prototyping systems is my own main interest. Rather, the essay
	is a distillation of informal, <em>ad hoc</em> observations
	and rules of thumb about how personal memory systems work. I
	wanted to understand those as preparation for building systems
	of my own. As I collected these observations it seemed they
	may be of interest to others. You can reasonably think of the
	essay as a how-to guide aimed at helping develop virtuoso
	skills with personal memory systems. But since writing such a
	guide wasn't my primary purpose, it may come across as a
	more-than-you-ever-wanted-to-know guide.
      </p>

      <p>
	To conclude this introduction, a few words on what the essay
	won't cover. I will only briefly discuss visualization
	techniques such as memory palaces and the method of loci.  And
	the essay won't describe the use of pharmaceuticals to improve
	memory, nor possible future brain-computer interfaces to
	augment memory. Those all need a separate treatment. But, as
	we shall see, there are already powerful ideas about personal
	memory systems based solely on the structuring and
	presentation of information.
      </p>

      <h2>Part I: How to remember almost anything: the Anki
      system</h2>

    <p>
      I'll begin with an account of my own experience with the
      personal memory
      system <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>*<span>*
      I've no affiliation at all with Anki. Other similar systems
      include <a href="https://mnemosyne-proj.org/">Mnemosyne</a>
      and <a href="https://supermemo.com/">SuperMemo</a>. My limited
      use suggests Mnemosyne is very similar to Anki.  SuperMemo runs
      only on Windows, and I haven't had an opportunity to use it,
      though I have been influenced by essays on
      the <a href="https://supermemo.com/">SuperMemo
      website</a>.<p>I won't try to hide my enthusiasm for Anki
      behind a respectable facade of impartiality: it's a significant
      part of my life. Still, it has many limitations, and I'll
      mention some of them through the essay. </p></span>. The material
      is, as mentioned above, quite personal, a collection of my own
      observations and informal rules of thumb.  Those rules of thumb
      may not apply to others; indeed, I may be mistaken about how
      well they apply to me. It's certainly not a properly controlled
      study of Anki usage!  Still, I believe there is value in
      collecting such personal experiences, even if they are anecdotal
      and impressionistic. I am not an expert on the cognitive science
      of memory, and I'd appreciate corrections to any errors or
      misconceptions.
    </p>

    <!--
      <p>
	Before we begin, a warning. Systems such as Anki are, in my
	opinion, powerful, and the early parts of the essay sound like
	a sales pitch.  It's certainly true that Anki has become an
	important part of my life. But it's also required a great deal
	of work to learn to use well. As we'll discuss, it required
	several failed attempts to make it worth using. So it's not a
	panacea; later, we'll discuss some shortcomings and possible
	improvements. That said, I do believe the underlying
	principles are powerful and important and deserve serious
	consideration.
      </p>
      -->
    
      <p>
	At first glance, Anki seems nothing more than a computerized
      flashcard program. You enter a question:
    </p>

   <p><img src="http://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Anki_question.png"></p><p>
      And a corresponding answer:
    </p>

    <p><img src="http://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Anki_answer.png"></p><p>
      Later you'll be asked to review the card: that is, shown the
      question, and asked whether you know the answer or not.
    </p>

    <p>
      What makes Anki better than conventional flashcards is that it
      manages the review schedule. If you can answer a question
      correctly, the time interval between reviews gradually
      expands. So a one-day gap between reviews becomes two days, then
      six days, then a fortnight, and so on. The idea is that the
      information is becoming more firmly embedded in your memory, and
      so requires less frequent review. But if you ever miss an
      answer, the schedule resets, and you again have to build up the
      time interval between reviews.
    </p>

    <p>
      While it's obviously useful that the computer manages the
      interval between reviews, it perhaps doesn't seem like that big
      a deal.  The punchline is that this turns out to be a far more
      efficient way to remember information.
    </p>

    <p>
      How much more efficient?
    </p>

    <p>
      To answer that question, let's do some rough time estimates.  On
      average, it takes me about 8 seconds to review a card. Suppose I
      was using conventional flashcards, and reviewing them (say) once
      a week. If I wanted to remember something for the next 20 years,
      I'd need 20 years times 52 weeks per year times 8 seconds per
      card. That works out to a total review time of just over 2 hours
      for each card.
    </p>

    <p>
      By contrast, Anki's ever-expanding review intervals quickly rise
      past a month and then out past a year. Indeed, for my personal
      set of Anki cards the average interval …</p></div></div>

<p>Kubernetes is one of the most important pieces of software produced in the last decade and one of the most influential open source projects ever. Kubernetes has completely revolutionized how applications are developed and how infrastructure is deployed and managed.</p>
<p>With Kubernetes’ explosive rise, more and more physical hardware is being managed by Kubernetes. This trend has coincided with an explosion in the popularity of deep learning, an extremely computation-demanding technology that can result in a single data scientist occupying dozens of GPUs for weeks at a time. This has led to an obvious development:</p>
<p>
Tools that allow data scientists to train models using hardware that is managed by Kubernetes.
</p>
<p>This seems great! Give data scientists access to more hardware. The problem is that a bunch of tools out there are actually:</p>
<p>
Tools that require data scientists to use Kubernetes to train models.
</p>
<p>This may sound like the same thing but it’s not — making hardware more accessible is great, but not if you force data scientists to understand Kubernetes first. <strong>Kubernetes was built by software engineers, for software engineers.</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://determined.ai/assets/images/blogs/kubernetes-bad/kubeflow-unicorns.png" alt="Most data scientists are not software engineers, and most software engineers are not data scientists."></p>
<p>If you happen to be a Unicorn, congratulations! Use your magic to wield Kubernetes and Deep Learning together and build something beautiful. For everyone else (most of us!), you’ll instead be pretty annoyed that you need to deep dive into computer systems before you can make progress developing new ML models. The crazy thing is, this hassle is completely avoidable! We just need to start developing <strong>ML tools built for data scientists, not software engineers.</strong></p>

<p>Let’s take a quick look at <a href="https://www.kubeflow.org/">Kubeflow</a> to understand what I mean about data science tools that are built for software engineers. Kubeflow started as an adaptation of how Google was running TensorFlow internally, as a tool that allowed <em>TensorFlow to run on Kubernetes</em>. This technology was <em>very</em> impactful, creating a much simpler way to use hardware managed by Kubernetes to do deep learning.</p>
<p>That initial version of Kubeflow is now the Kubeflow component called <a href="https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/training/tftraining/">TFJob</a>. Without TFJob, running TensorFlow on Kubernetes would be miserable — you would need to specify a complex topology of containers, networking, and storage before you could even start writing your ML code. With TFJob, this is simplified, but, crucially, <em>it is not nearly simple enough</em>. To use TFJob, you need to:</p>
<p><strong><em>Wrap your ML code up neatly in a container</em></strong>. This will be a clunky experience that will require you to package your code and upload it if you want to make changes. Docker is great, but this will slow down your development cycle significantly.</p>
<p><strong><em>Write a Kubernetes TFJob manifest.</em></strong> This might not sound that intimidating, but for a data scientist not fluent in Kubernetes it can be a daunting task. To do this well, you’ll need to learn <em>a lot</em> about Kubernetes — a far cry from the Python that these scientists are used to. Let’s look at the <em>most simple version of this, from the Kubeflow docs:</em></p>
<div><div><pre><code>apiVersion: kubeflow.org/v1
kind: TFJob
metadata:
  generateName: tfjob
  namespace: your-user-namespace
spec:
  tfReplicaSpecs:
    PS:
      replicas: 1
      restartPolicy: OnFailure
      template:
        metadata:
          annotations:
            sidecar.istio.io/inject: "false"
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: tensorflow
            image: gcr.io/your-project/your-image
            command:
              - python
              - -m
              - trainer.task
              - --batch_size=32
              - --training_steps=1000
    Worker:
      replicas: 3
      restartPolicy: OnFailure
      template:
        metadata:
          annotations:
            sidecar.istio.io/inject: "false"
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: tensorflow
            image: gcr.io/your-project/your-image
            command:
              - python
              - -m
              - trainer.task
              - --batch_size=32
              - --training_steps=1000
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This configuration file is <strong>full</strong> of concepts that are foreign to most data scientists. Pods, replicas, sidecars, restart policies, Kubernetes APIs — all of this is confusing, complex, and detracts from our ability to focus on data science.</p>
<p><strong><em>Learn the Kubernetes CLI.</em></strong> This is minor, but again navigating Kubernetes is not a trivial thing to figure out. Submitting jobs may be relatively straightforward, but seeing results, artifacts, and logs of experiments is unintuitive and clunky.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let’s revisit where this all came from: an adaptation of the technology that <strong>Google used to train DL models</strong>. Google (unlike most of the rest of the world) is filled with unicorns — running Deep Learning on Kubernetes is not a big deal! What is best for Google isn’t always best for the rest of the world though, and in this case I’ve personally seen a lot of <em>very skilled data scientists</em> bounce off of Kubeflow because Kubernetes was too far outside of their comfort zone.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you look at some of the other components of Kubeflow, you’ll find similar philosophies: <strong>MPIJob, PyTorchJob, and Katib</strong> all expect data scientists to work with Kubernetes concepts and APIs. All of them suffer from the exact same usability issues — most data scientists don’t want to dive into the weeds of how Kubernetes is orchestrating the hardware, they just want an easier way to train their models. They want tools that abstract away foreign concepts and let them communicate ML concepts succinctly.</p>
<p>One fascinating thing about Kubeflow is that some of the components of Kubeflow have clearly figured this out! The best example is <strong>Kubeflow Pipelines</strong> — the core underlying technology of Kubeflow Pipelines is <strong><a href="https://github.com/argoproj/argo">Argo Workflows</a></strong> which are very similar to TFJob, providing a way to declare workflows in Kubernetes. <strong>Kubeflow Pipelines</strong> goes the crucial extra step of providing a Domain Specific Language that allows data scientists to write pipelines <em>in Python!</em> The builders of KFP realized that building containers and writing Kubernetes manifests wasn’t how data scientists wanted to interact with their work, so they <strong><em>abstracted away the k8s</em></strong> and made a tool that data scientists love.</p>
<p>Even parts of Kubeflow have realized that <strong>we can do better!</strong></p>

<p>Machine learning is exploding in popularity, and as it does ML tooling is frantically trying to keep up. Tools for everything you can imagine in ML are popping up: data versioning tools, experiment tracking tools, model serving tools, and yes even tools to help ML run on Kubernetes. However, the space is still young; although some projects are more popular than others there are no clear winners yet and nobody has yet to establish the perfect set of software to enable and accelerate ML.</p>
<p><em>What will the winners look like?</em> Some thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>ML tools should allow data scientists to <strong>accomplish more with less work</strong>. The number one opportunity for this is to separate the engineering work that data scientists are currently overwhelmed with from the science that they love.</li>
<li>We need <strong>abstractions</strong> that make it possible to perform high-performance data science on complex, modern infrastructure without needing to be a systems expert. Designing the right abstractions is not easy but it is crucially important to making modern ML more accessible, more convenient, and more cost-effective.</li>
<li><strong>Most data scientists aren’t unicorns</strong>. As such, avoid thinking about data scientists as software engineers and build tools that allow ML people to build, train, and deploy ML models without needing to become devops experts too. There are great tools out there that enable production grade ML without pushing that burden onto data scientists.</li>
</ul>
<p>These tenets are a long way of saying something we all know at this point, <strong>the best software has the best UX</strong>. The only additional advice is to make sure you actually <em>understand</em> the possible users of your software! Know what data scientists like and dislike about their current workflows, <em>enhance what they like and slice out what they don’t like!</em></p>
<h2 id="an-obvious-shill-for-determined">An Obvious Shill for Determined</h2>
<p>At Determined, we’ve worked with plenty of real-world deep learning scientists to understand their pain points and how they work today. Determined accomplishes many of the same goals as a tool like Kubeflow — allowing scientists to build and train deep learning models on Kubernetes (or any hardware, really), but without expecting data scientists to master countless new technologies along the way.</p>
<p>Compare a Determined configuration file to the TFJob configuration above:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>description: cifar10_pytorch
hyperparameters:
  learning_rate: 1e-4
  learning_rate_decay: 1e-6
  layer1_dropout: 0.25
  layer2_dropout: 0.25
  layer3_dropout: 0.5
  global_batch_size: 32
records_per_epoch: 50000
searcher:
  name: single
  metric: validation_error
  max_length:
    epochs: 32
entrypoint: model_def:CIFARTrial
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This configuration accomplishes essentially the same goal — describing an ML training workflow. The big difference is that this configuration is <em>written in the language of data scientists</em>, with complicated infrastructure concepts abstracted away. We speak to users in terms they are comfortable with: hyperparameters, epochs, metrics, etc.</p>
<p>This means that our users can do more with less. Instead of having to learn Kubernetes or configure a cluster of machines to work with Horovod, they simply need to install Determined and describe experiments with their own terms. Determined unlocks incredibly powerful tools like <a href="https://determined.ai/blog/faster-nlp-with-deep-learning-distributed-training/">distributed training</a>, <a href="https://determined.ai/blog/why-does-no-one-use-advanced-hp-tuning/">hyperparameter search</a>, and experiment tracking, without placing extra burden on the user to understand what is happening behind the scenes. Determined has carefully built <a href="https://determined.ai/blog/standardized-models-with-determined/">powerful abstractions that allow data scientists to focus on science</a>, and not engineering, systems, and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Determined understands data scientists and enables them to accomplish more with less work. To see it in action, <a href="https://docs.determined.ai/latest/tutorials/quick-start.html">start with our quick start guide!</a> Determined is open source, so you can see how we do it in our <a href="https://github.com/determined-ai/determined">GitHub repository.</a></p>

In fact, they're often happier with the snappy, vertically integrated experience of closed app ecosystems. </p><p>My goal here is to make it more palpable how everyday apps, searches and tools get worse when we let big centralized companies take over the web, and explore some paths for reversing it.</p><h2>What is the open web?</h2><p>Most definitions of the "open web" I've seen are either too technical to be accessible or too abstract to be usable and getting gridlocked in this debate often means watching from the sidelines while actual user welfare slowly diminishes.</p><p>Three characteristics that proponents of the open web will agree to in roughly descending order are:</p><ul><li><strong>Ease of publishing</strong>: anyone can publish to it freely or at least very cheaply, and is on the same footing with a globally accessible URL</li><li><strong>Ease of consuming</strong>: Net neutrality — ISP's dont cut deals with corporations to make some websites load faster or cheaper than others.</li><li><strong>Ease of remixing</strong>. You can see the source code. Content licenses and tools are permissive for derived works.</li></ul><h2>Detour: A framework to break down how people use the web</h2><p>I want to focus on the user experience point of view. To do this, I'm going to introduce a framework that divides up all our internet usage into two categories.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/xscGdbWOOPkGjdER.png" alt="Frame 1.png"></p><h3><strong>Unfamiliar problems</strong></h3><p>You have an unfamiliar problem and to solve it you either need to learn something new, or purchase goods or services to solve it</p><ul><li>e.g. taking out a mortgage, a health problem in the family, where to go to college, what skill to acquire next.</li><li>Unfamiliar problems are solved in large part with acquiring new knowledge, not just products or services.</li><li>These user journeys start with search engines — Google predominantly and **a lot of the time solving them is spent on web pages**.</li><li>When people are looking to solve unfamiliar problems, **revenue is typically higher-margin**, because users can't price the products and services as well.</li><li>These ultimately transition to being familiar problems.</li></ul><h3><strong>Familiar problems</strong></h3><ul><li>e.g. being entertained, keeping the dog food in stock,</li><li>These are best solved with apps like Email, Netflix, Twitter, DTC subscription boxes, etc.</li><li>Solving these needs has a very well defined user interaction journey. You open the app you're familiar with and follow its standard flow.</li><li>Revenue from people solving familiar problems is typically lower-margin and there's more competing products.
</li></ul><h3>How we're spending our time on familiar vs. unfamiliar problems</h3><p>Using time spent in apps vs mobile web on mobile is a way to proxy how we divide up our time.<strong> We spend most of our time on familiar problems but have a constant trickle of unfamiliar problems</strong>.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/cPuXkKFELALeIAkI.png" alt="Untitled (1).png"></p><h2>Unfamiliar problems are better solved with the open web</h2><p>Think about the last time you did some research, e.g. choosing a phone plan. You asked your friends, compared on forums, looked at the official sites, scribbled some notes and made a decision. Even if this journey was quick, you likely traversed a dozen services and products to do this.</p><p>Unfamiliar problems have less constraints, require creativity to solve, and thus are better suited to open solutions. Some other things that work for the open web here</p><ul><li>comparing alternatives is easier.</li><li>changing modalities (e.g. from reading to video) is easier.</li></ul><h2>Familiar problems stand to benefit more from tight vertical integration</h2><p>Take Spotify for example. It solves the very familiar problem of listening to music. Spotify just works better as an app because</p><ul><li>Controlling the user experience end to end makes for smoother flows.</li><li>Having all the user data kept with Spotify allows for better recommendation algorithms.</li><li>Spotify can easily hand off between devices.</li><li>It can run in the background</li></ul><p>Sure, the web can do a bunch of these things, but they're simply not first-class considerations in the open-read-close workflow that the browser was designed for.</p><h2>But the open web can be better for familiar problems too, especially for breaking monopolies</h2><p>Let's look at Amazon. Initially you start buying there because of their "always low prices" and the convenience of 2 day shipping. Over the years you keep shopping there, until you've forgotten that </p><ol><li>free 2 day shipping is now near universal</li><li>amazon isn't often the cheapest place</li></ol><p>On the Amazon app, you see the story around the product that best serves Amazon, not the buyer. Meanwhile, over on Insight you can use the web version and do all these things the app can't.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/ZEblynrLvBsutnlQ.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-11-17 at 5.42.21 PM.png"></p><p>... and not just that

</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_uSsTzKptQlxlvUvQ/assets/JVZoTRazmYPZXBQQ.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-11-17 at 5.59.22 PM.png"></p><h2><strong>How solving unfamiliar problems gets harder too</strong></h2><p>Unfamiliar problems are solved in large part with acquiring new knowledge, not just products or services. The incentives to freely create knowledge that solves unfamiliar problems is lost as the web closes down.</p><ul><li>Google increasingly takes a larger percent of ad revenue as they <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/less-than-half-of-google-searches-now-result-in-a-click/">start extracting answers from pages and showing them on their search result pages.</a><a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/less-than-half-of-google-searches-now-result-in-a-click/"></a></li><li><a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/less-than-half-of-google-searches-now-result-in-a-click/"></a>Publishers have to either a) paywall their content (e.g. NYTimes) or b) subtly sell products (everyone standing a Wirecutter alternative), or c) ask for donations in order to survive.</li><li>Only a few big name publishers survive. Google and Facebook start sending them more of the traffic that's left, and since domain rank plays a big part in Google's ranking, those that survived assimilate more power and rank better.</li><li>and search engines seem more littered with SEO junk and less actually useful information year over year.</li></ul><h2>In conclusion, and where we fit in.</h2><p>And that's how your user experience slowly degrades, and that's why we stand to suffer as users if we give up the ability to remix software that the web brought us and closed apps are now taking away. </p><p>Our goal with Insight is to give the web (in particular on mobile) a fighting chance by exhibiting how it can be more powerful than a closed ecosystem and give more control to the end-user. We do this by showcasing the web's infinite extensibility and customizability for common use cases like <a href="http://insightbrowser.com/collections/search">search</a>, <a href="https://insightbrowser.com/collections/shopping">shopping</a>, <a href="https://insightbrowser.com/collections/reading">reading</a> and <a href="https://insightbrowser.com/collections/cooking">cooking</a>.</p><p>Insight's advanced features will soon only be available to Pro subscription users but for a limited time we're opening up <strong>lifetime free beta access if you download it via TestFlight below.</strong></p><h3>Coming up in part 2</h3><ul><li>What parts of the open web probably should die off?</li><li>A pragmatic path for what's left of the open web to thrive again.</li></ul><p>We'd love to hear from you, feel free to tweet at or DM us at @<a href="https://twitter.com/insightbrowser">insightbrowser</a>, and my personal Twitter is <a href="https://twitter.com/abhinavsharma">@abhinavsharma</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

It was also circulated to students directly.</p>  <p>"I am extremely disappointed to tell you that there were over 100 cases of cheating," said the note, a screenshot of which was posted to the UBC Reddit&nbsp;thread.</p>  <p>"If confirmed, the students involved will receive a 0% for the course (not just the midterm) and I will recommend their expulsion from UBC."</p>  <p>The note is signed "Mike." The CBC has not been able to verify the UBC professor's identity. However,&nbsp;the university has said it's investigating allegations of widespread cheating&nbsp;in one section of the math department involving entry-level math students.</p>    <p>There are more than 1,500 students currently enrolled in Math 100 at UBC, split up into classes of about 250.&nbsp;The class is being held&nbsp;entirely online this semester, due to the pandemic. Midterms&nbsp;are&nbsp;run online as well.</p>  <p>Matthew Ramsey, director of university affairs, confirmed the university is investigating allegations of widespread cheating. He said it&nbsp;is&nbsp;too early to be able to provide details on how the students might have been cheating or how they were caught.</p>  <p>"Those details, I'm sure, will come clear in the investigative process," he said by phone on Tuesday.</p>  <p>Ramsey said the professor's note was first sent to students, then posted online.</p>  <h2>Test monitoring tools</h2>  <p>Many schools across the country, including UBC, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/exam-surveillance-software-university-ottawa-1.5633134" target="_blank">have been using online software extensions</a>&nbsp;to help detect and discourage cheating since classes went virtual.&nbsp;One test-proctoring tool, called&nbsp;Proctorio, monitors students for suspicious behaviour while they're writing a virtual exam.</p>  <p>UBC faculty can&nbsp;offer an alternative, like a final project, to replace exams if they are overly concerned about cheating, but exams can't always be replaced.</p>  <p>"In&nbsp;some instances, it is necessary to use ...&nbsp;software like Proctorio to ensure academic integrity," Ramsey said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"Incidents of academic misconduct themselves are very uncommon, very rare at the university," added Ramsey, who has been with the school since 2014.&nbsp;"I have not seen allegations of this nature in my time at UBC&nbsp;but, again, they are, at this point, allegations."</p>    <p>Investigations into academic misconduct&nbsp;begin&nbsp;with a professor reporting their concerns to the dean's office. That office can either dismiss&nbsp;complaints, give students a warning or pass the case along to the&nbsp;President's Advisory Committee on Student Discipline for potential punishment.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Penalties can range from a formal warning to being expelled from the university.</p>  <p>Since investigations are complex and take time, Ramsey said, it's&nbsp;too soon to gauge&nbsp;whether there has been an overall increase in cheating since classes and exams began moving fully&nbsp;online in the spring.</p>  <p>"If the students are disciplined, we will get a sense as to those numbers in the coming months. At this point, it's just too early to say," he said.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>A couple of years ago, at another job, I hired this guy for a data entry position. He seemed like a decently smart guy who could type fairly quickly, even if maybe he was a bit of a bro. He was at the company for well over a year, I'm pretty sure, but my memory is pretty shoddy. He'd earned "Employee of the Month" twice in one year, which was something we debated about and wasn't just a random pick!</p>
<p>Then one morning, he didn't show up to work. No call, no email, nothing. The next day, he still wasn't there. I'm pretty sure it was this day, or the next, I called his emergency contact: his girlfriend; just to make sure he was okay! I wasn't trying to be a nosey up-your-ass manager or anything, it was unusual for him to just no show... plus we needed to know if we needed to hire someone else...</p>
<p>His girlfriend answered the phone. I told her who I was, her boyfriend's manager, and that we hadn't heard from him in two or three days and we're just checking in to make sure he's okay? She said, "Uhh, hold on a second," and hung up the phone. When I called her back (maybe we'd gotten disconnected?) it went to voicemail.</p>
<p>At this point it seemed pretty clear that he wasn't going to come back to work, so we set about looking for his replacement. Pretty lame that he did that, but who knows why people do the things they do? A week or two later, the company got the paperwork from the unemployment office for him. He's trying to get money from the EDD!</p>
<p>The company explains to EDD: No, he no-called, no-showed, he probably shouldn't get unemployment. And then the guy tells EDD: I was actually secretly fired by my manager on the morning of <em>insert date here</em>. But <em>I</em> was his manager! And I didn't do that. I don't know if he elected for it or if it just automatically happened, but a hearing in front of a judge was scheduled for a week later. Normally the company wouldn't have gone to such great lengths to deny someone unemployment, but he just flaked out. Very uncool.</p>
<p>The first absurd thing about the story is that he was a <em>good</em> employee. I had been a manager long enough to know that it's a pain in the ass to hire people, and it sucks when they're not good employees because it's such a waste of time and energy. The last thing I'd want to do is willingly get rid of a good employee. And we had proof he was a good employee: emails I'd sent to others about him; emails I'd sent <em>to</em> him directly, praising him; and the aforementioned two time Employee of the Month receipts.</p>
<p>I also had a bit of an ace up my sleeve: we had security cameras everywhere. He knew this, because he used them sometimes as part of his training. So, trying to be well prepared for the 'hearing' or whatever it would be, I sat down and I exhaustively recorded my whereabouts on the day in question. I noted down every time I left my desk, where I went, how long I was gone, and who was in the rooms with me where I was. I was almost never alone, and always on camera. I'm pretty sure I also prepared a statement, in addition to the email 'evidence packet', just to be thorough.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the truth about this guy is that while he was a good employee, he wasn't a happy one. He had bigger aspirations. When getting to know him, I'd asked him what he most wanted to do, for work, with his life, or whatever. He said he wanted to be an entrepreneur. An entrepreneur of what? I asked. He didn't have an answer, it didn't matter, he just wanted to be <em>an entrepreneur</em>.</p>
<p>He wasn't happy that he was a 'lowly' data entry person. We'd tried to get him involved in the inventory security program we had, but looking at camera footage bored him. He asked at one point if the company would pay him while he learned how to grow marijuana, so he could become a sales person and make more money. The company said no, we won't pay you to learn to grow, but we'll give you access to our training program documents so you can learn on your own. Disappointed, he declined the offer. Unfortunately for him, there just weren't any open positions in the company he'd be a good fit for, so he was stuck doing data entry.</p>
<p>This is mostly just making fun of him, but I'll allow it: one day a nearby company put out a pallet of 3M foam earplugs, boxes within boxes, a couple hundred earplugs a piece. We all took a couple boxes. He came to work the next day saying he was going to sell the earplugs online, with photos of Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump glued to them, as a novelty gift, with statements like, "the holidays might get loud this year!" or something. This idea never actually got off the ground.</p>
<p>The day of the hearing, I arrived with the HR assistant and we sat at a long table. My former data-entry clerk was sitting directly across the table from us. Some judge sat down at the end of the table taking notes. I honestly don't remember who spoke first, but the story was pretty simple: He alleged that, sometime on the morning in question, I walked upstairs to where he was working, walked him down through the building, through the back offices, out to the back of building by the street, and told him we'd no longer be needing his services, and he immediately walked down to the bus stop and left.</p>
<p>So I asked him, what time did this happen? And I don't remember what time he said, but it didn't matter, I responded: Well, I have this chart here I made of where I was, and who I was with, for every moment of the day, and at no point was he anywhere to be seen. I submitted that shit into evidence, which wasn't as dramatic as it sounds when you say it that way, all I did was hand it to the judge. The judge asked him if he had any objection to it, and he said of course, and explained that I was in charge of security cameras--true--so I could fake the whole thing or just make up a list. The judge didn't find that very convincing.</p>
<p>I also shared the fact that we knew he wasn't happy, but that otherwise he was a good employee as evidenced by the internal emails, emails to him, and the Employee of the Month awards. He said that we gave out Employee of the Month awards just to quiet down unhappy employees, which is only true sometimes, and may have been why he received it twice in one year without us noticing...</p>
<p>I also asked him some of the more obvious questions: who else witnessed me walk through the building with you? Why didn't you go back upstairs to grab your huge bag of pistachios and other snacks, or to say bye to any of your co-workers? And when I called two days later, and your girlfriend answered, why didn't you talk to me or call me back?</p>
<p>The judge really jumped on that last one, saying: yeah, if this guy fired you, and then called your girlfriend 'pretending' you no-showed, wouldn't you wanna cuss him out or something? Give him a piece of your mind? He didn't have great answers to any of these questions, beyond that he was upset and confused about what happened, so he didn't want to talk to me or anyone.</p>
<p>At the end of the hearing the judge said, I'm pretty sure this is verbatim, "This is a peculiar situation. Two people who have entirely, completely different stories. But you both seem credible. He seems credible, and he seems credible. Very interesting."</p>
<p>Obviously, we received word the judge ruled in our favor a short time later, and rejected his claim for unemployment. He then appealed, this time with a new story. If I remember correctly, he suggested that one of his former managers (before me) didn't like him, and that they were using me to fire him because of it. None of that came up in the hearing, though, and after review of the case by another judge his appeal was rejected.</p>
<p>I don't manage people anymore, and I'm kind of very glad that I don't. I might have had a worse than average experience, because the company wanted to pay people the bare minimum amount needed to hire someone, <em>anyone</em>, and I ended up with employees who were often lazy, dishonest, and manipulative. You'd think being dishonest would take so much effort it'd be better to just do the job you're meant to do, but no.</p>
<p>Prior to this guy, I was used to employees telling bald-faced lies directly to my face, usually ones I couldn't quite prove. But this was the first time that those lies directly involved me, saying I went and did things that I definitely didn't. Luckily, I was sitting in front of an impartial judge, and at absolutely no personal risk whatsoever, so if I failed to prove that fact it wasn't that big of a deal.</p>
<p>But, in different circumstances (like if I worked for a larger company), he could have written a Medium post, or talked to a reporter, and voiced his fabricated mistreatment to the world at large. I could just imagine how the article would account, in detail, his alleged mistreatment ("they wouldn't pay me to learn...") and the day I led him outside and fired him, maliciously, leaving him destitute and dependent on his girlfriend.</p>
<p>And then there'd be a single sentence at the end of the article: "The company denies these allegations." That'd be all the defense I'd get, that the company would be legally allowed to give itself. I mean, I probably wouldn't be named, but I and anyone else working there would know he was talking about me, which could hurt me. Luckily, I'm awesome, and that wouldn't hurt my feelings too much. But there's other people out there, less awesome, and more susceptible to hurt feelings.</p>
<p>The point is: when it comes down to it, sometimes people can be dishonest about work. That can be work they did in the past for other people, or work they're doing right now, for you. People who seem to have a relatively normal level of dysfunctional habits can suddenly, one day, just do something completely unexpected when there's money on the line. It's important to be aware of this, and not just blindly trust everyone who cries mistreatment at the hands of a company. <em>Sometimes</em>, not always, they're just a grifter, looking for sympathy and a handout.</p></div></div></div>]]>

            <svg id="dvdscreen" width="100%"></svg>



<p>The year 2020 was many things, but for me it was a year of learning. In my day job as an Actuary I've done a lot of dabbling in programming but true full stack development is something new to me. Through many, many hours of YouTube &amp; Coursera videos with lots of trial and error I've managed to hack this site together and upload a few projects that I'm proud of. I thought December would be a good time to look back on what I learned, and provide a starting list for those who want to accomplish the same.</p>

<p>First, let me start with a few caveats.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When I say "learned", I mean going from next-to-no knowledge of a concept to somewhat competent with the basics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I say "from scratch", my goal was to learn tools that real web developers use in their day jobs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I say "website", I mean the barely-Wordpress-template jumble of pages you're reading this post on.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Git &amp; Github </h2>
<h5>What It Is</h5>
<p>Git is a version control system that allows you to track your projects in 'repositories'. GitHub is a Microsoft owned service that hosts your repositories in the cloud.</p>
<h5>What I Used It For</h5>
<p>Learning git let me rest easy that my work was safely backed up. GitHub provides a place for me to host and share my code or find Open Source code to add to my projects.</p>
<h5>What I Struggled With</h5>
<p>Becoming comfortable with the command line was difficult. The first dozen or so times I pushed my projects, I had to Google and re-Google the exact commands, and constantly feard that a command I ran would overwrite everything.</p>
<p>I had a huge revelation the first time I ran <code>checkout</code> on an experimental branch and realized that a bunch of files I had been editing on my local machine had disapeared. After a few moments of panic, I checked out the <code>master</code> branch of my repo again and those files reappeared. That scenario helped me better understand that git &amp; GitHub ensure I have a single version of the entire project at any point, cutting down on clutter and keeping all my changes safe in the cloud.</p>
<h5>What the Reward Was</h5>
<p>If I had to choose the single biggest development in my programming skills this year, it would be learning git. Previously, my projects were disparate collections of files and experimenting with new features meant overwriting production code.  Pushing to a staging remote lets me see the result online before overwriting my actual website.</p>
<p>The second advantage is being able to interact with other projects on GitHub. When I see a cool plugin online I can run a <code>git clone</code> to pull it down to my machine and dig into how it works. Eventually I hope to be brave enough to actually submit a pull request to something!</p>

<h2>VS Code &amp; Live Server Plugin </h2>
<h5>What It Is</h5>
<p>VS Code is a code editor made by Microsoft. Live Server is a VS Code plugin that lets you render your HTML &amp; CSS in-browser immediately as you make changes.</p>
<h5>What I Used It For</h5>
<p>All my JavaScript, HTML and CSS related code was done in VS Code. When testing a section of code, I'd open a Live Server instance with Chrome debugger attached to see the changes in real time.</p>
<h5>What I Struggled With</h5>
<p>Learning a new code editor comes with a large upfront cost of figuring out all the settings and integrations you need to optimize your work. I struggled with getting my environment setup so that my HTML files would see my CSS files in VS Code, amplified by the fact that I was still fumbling around in git and the command line at this point.</p>
<p>At the start I didn't take advantage of many features in VS Code simply because they were over my head. The <code>.vscode</code> file that kept popping up in my directory with seemingly jibberish files like <code>tasks.json</code> went largely ignored, until later when I was figuring out how <code>gulp</code> worked and it started to click.</p>
<h5>What the Reward Was</h5>
<p>Having the Live Server plugin open on a second screen and seeing how my <code>d3.js</code> graphics or BootStrap layout changed sped up my development at least ten fold. Uploading to GitHub is a breeze using the GUI, or I can open a terminal up right in the same screen. Also the dark theme with text highlighting is pretty cool.</p>
<p>VS Code is also where I'm writing this blog post, as it has great Markdown support that I can compile instantly into html using those pesky <code>gulp</code> tasks mentioned above. There are still many buttons within VS Code whose function I haven't figured out but I will continue to stay curious.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.rjwilkins.com/static/blog/posts/learned_in_2020/img/npm.67a5ec2092e8.png" alt="VSCode Logo"></p>
<h2>npm </h2>
<h5>What It Is</h5>
<p>Node Package Manager, or npm, is a package manager for JavaScript.</p>
<h5>What I Used It For</h5>
<p>Keeping the third party JavaScript packages in my site organized, up to date and consistent.</p>
<h5>What I Struggled With</h5>
<p>Much like git, I had a vague idea of what npm was, but the fact that it involved the command line and created scary looking files like <code>package.json</code> made me avoid it at first. When I eventually got to installing it, it also involved a lot of learning about <code>brew</code> on MacOS and configuring my PATH variables to get my Terminal to work as expected.</p>
<h5>What the Reward Was</h5>
<p>Embarrassingly I avoided learning npm until a few months into my development and completely regret that now. I eventually watched a Coursera video on setting up Node &amp; npm which made everything click, and I rushed to reformat all my projects to include a <code>package.json</code> file and <code>node_modules</code> folder.</p>
<p>npm makes integrating my outside work into my Django templates much easier, and once uploaded to Heroku it automatically runs a <code>npm build</code> &amp; <code>django collectstatic</code>. Previously I was fussing around with CDN links on individual pages which was just a mess to keep track of.</p>

<h2>HTML, CSS </h2>
<h5>What It Is</h5>
<p>HTML is the language of webpages. CSS makes your website look pretty.</p>
<h5>What I Used It For</h5>
<p>Creating the actual pages on my website, and making each section look and behave how I want.</p>
<h5>What I Struggled With</h5>
<p>Before this year the extent of HTML knowledge I had was limited to the Neopets guild I made when I was 10. My CSS knowledge was limited to memes on /r/programminghumor about blocks not being positioned correctly. There was a lot of learning from first principles including <code>id</code> versus <code>class</code> and <code>margin</code> versus <code>padding</code>.</p>
<p>A lot of what I learned is thanks to snooping around other websites in the Chrome debugger tool. Pressing the little phone icon helped me understand <code>@media</code> tags (see <a href="#bootstrap-section">Bootstrap</a> section). I selected individual elements on the CNN website to figure out how grouping and nesting elements in CSS worked.</p>
<h5>What the Reward Was</h5>
<p>I have a much better appreciation for the websites that I see on a daily basis. When I see something cool, I now open the inspector to try to figure out how it works. Consequently, if there is something on my website that I want to move, change the color of or make disappear on mobile I can do that with a few lines of CSS.</p>
<h2>JavaScript </h2>
<h5>What It Is</h5>
<p>JavaScript is the programming language of the web. Most components of websites past the general structure and coloring likely involve JavaScript.</p>
<h5>What I Used It For</h5>
<p>DOM manipulation for creating graphics (see <a href="#d3-section">d3.js</a> section), interacting with user input for my projects.</p>
<h5>What I Struggled With</h5>
<p>Coming from a Python heavy background, I was expecting JavaScript to 'just work' as Python does. I found out how wrong I was from the first <code>import *</code>  statement I tried to write. What is a module? ECMA what? I had to do a lot of ground work before I actually got to writing code.</p>
<p>It was also difficult at first to figure out how everything fit together. What helped was realizing why I have to import the JQuery script before Bootstrap - the concept of splitting files into separate modules is really to make it human readable, the browser is happy to pull everything into a single script. Thus, because Bootstrap uses JQuery functionality, if you pulled BootStrap in first, it can't find the JQuery functions!</p>
<h5>What the Reward Was</h5>
<p>Most of the 'cool' parts of my projects involve writing JavaScript. I've become decently comfortable with it, and with each new package I learn about I'm excited about the new functionality I can implement. Despite learning that some circles despise JavaScript for the way it's bogged down the web, much of what it can do seems magical to me.</p>
<p>Going from a static to responsive website is a huge leap in complexity. I've spent many hours on tiny, frustrating errors that bring my whole website to a halt, but the end reward of having a <a href="https://www.rjwilkins.com/project/reinsexp">totally customized d3.js graphic</a> that users can play around with is super cool.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.rjwilkins.com/static/blog/posts/learned_in_2020/img/bootstrap.6a62d2b8f0d0.png" alt="VSCode Logo"></p>
<h2>BootStrap </h2>
<h5>What It Is</h5>
<p>BoostStrap is a CSS framework originally developed at Twitter used to make responsive websites.</p>
<h5>What I Used It For</h5>
<p>The framework of this website was created using BootStrap. It did much of heavy lifting for me to make it mobile compatible.</p>
<h5>What I Struggled With</h5>
<p>I jumped into building things way too quickly. I spent an enormous amount of time building these pages that looked fancy on my laptop screen, neglecting one of the basic principles of Bootstrap. Mobile first! The first time I opened the developer tools in Chrome and clicked on the “mobile view” icon I was horrified to see my beautiful website become a twisted and distorted mess.</p>
<p>This is especially important seeing the metrics on my first couple of successful posts. I had about 2,000 page views on my Exposure Rating Calculator, with 65% of them on mobile. Unfortunately, to this day that project is not nearly as nice on mobile as it is on desktop. Since I’ve become more aware of this problem I’ve focused on developing my graphic and pages in multiple browsers and multiple sizes to make sure my users get the experience I want.</p>
<h5>What the Reward Was</h5>
<p>Many sites I go to now I notice the Bootstrap roots. I often open up the developer tools to pick out exactly how the developer got a graphic to resize so smoothly, or why their modals look so cool. The responsive design built into Bootstrap is a huge time saver and easy to implement once the basics are learned.</p>
<p>There is a huge support community behind BootStrap due to its popularity. When I'm trying to design something and hit a roadblock, all I have to do is Google 'BootStrap navbar stack …</p></div></div></div>

<p>4G is the past. 5G is rapidly becoming the present. 6G communication is the future. But what will it bring? Allow me to share my take.</p>



<p>November 6th 2020 saw what has become a routine successful rocket launch to space <span id="easy-footnote-1-117"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-117" title="<a href=&quot;https://www.space.com/china-long-march-6-rocket-launches-13-satellites&quot;>https://www.space.com/china-long-march-6-rocket-launches-13-satellites</a>"><sup>1</sup></a></span>, delivering yet another bunch of 13 satellites into orbit. One of them is called Tianyan-5: dubbed to be <em>the first 6G testing satellite.</em></p>

<p>Disclaimer: I am not an expert, just an excited enthusiast.</p>



<p>So wait just a minute. Aren’t we just figuring out 5G? Well, yes.. but we are figuring out its rollout. The standard itself is done. Work on 6G started earlier than you think: March 24, 2019 already saw a summit on 6G <span id="easy-footnote-2-117"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-117" title="<a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/2019/03/21/6g-research-starting-before-5g&quot;>https://venturebeat.com/2019/03/21/6g-research-starting-before-5g</a>"><sup>2</sup></a></span>. So 6G is not science fiction. It’s just proof that science and progress waits for no man.</p>



<h2>Recap</h2>



<h3>4G</h3>



<p>Let’s do a quick recap. 4G LTE has wavelengths of 10-40cm, with frequencies of up to 2Ghz. In layman’ terms: we can cram 10 or 20Mbps and the signal propagates quite well. It can reach 10km or further, and doesn’t mind obstacles that much.</p>



<h3>5G</h3>



<p>5G must utilize multiple frequencies. The high range (30-300Ghz) is fantastic but its 1-10mm short waves degrade quite quickly and struggle to penetrate objects. A so called ‘mid band’ 5G (&lt;6Ghz) is required to improve coverage (with less bandwidth). An an even lower band, 600-700Mhz to cover many square miles but only somewhat faster than 4G.  So once more, in layman’s terms: the ‘best option’ will travel just a few hundred meters and would need <em>a lot of towers</em>. It <em>can</em> be very fast, but you are likelier to receive the lower bands. If you wish to read more about 5G, there’s an excellent white paper by Nokia <span id="easy-footnote-3-117"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-117" title="<a href=&quot;https://www.rrt.lt/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Nokia_5G_Deployment_below_6GHz_White_Paper_EN.pdf&quot;>https://www.rrt.lt/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Nokia_5G_Deployment_below_6GHz_White_Paper_EN.pdf</a>"><sup>3</sup></a></span> or a nice article at VB <span id="easy-footnote-4-117"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-117" title="<a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/2019/12/10/the-definitive-guide-to-5g-low-mid-and-high-band-speeds&quot;>https://venturebeat.com/2019/12/10/the-definitive-guide-to-5g-low-mid-and-high-band-speeds</a>"><sup>4</sup></a></span> for further reading.</p>

<h2>Why even 6G?</h2>



<p>6G? What is the point of further development? More speed? Well, sure, that’s always great. Some predict it to be able to reach into the terabits per second! But our planet is transitioning to a smart connected world of the internet-of-things (IOT). Our society is moving to be always-connected. In my humble opinion, the main benefit of <strong>5G </strong>is <strong>not </strong>‘the speed improvement’ but the fact that each tower can successfully serve thousands of connected devices. Thus we can move forward to making our cities smarter, more convenient and more efficient. While 5G should help us embrace IOT, 6G should elevate it to completely new, science-fiction-like level, In fact, the term connected <em>things</em> should make way for connected <em>intelligence</em> .</p>

<h2>Key Research Areas</h2>



<p>I want to briefly highlight several important research areas where a lot of time and effort will have to be spent.</p>



<h4>Latency</h4>



<p>When we talk about machine-to-machine communication, it is <em>fast</em>! Forget human scale. <em>Latency </em>(how long a signal takes to reach its destination) becomes very important. It is therefore one of the main pillars of research for 6G. 5G claims to cut latency times down to 1-10 milliseconds. This is somewhere between great and negligible for <em>today</em>. It will eventually become too slow when <em>everything</em> is connected. Imagine your message needs to travel through hundreds, thousands of ‘connected things’. Multiply your 10 milliseconds many times over, and you start to see the problem.</p>



<h4>Reliability</h4>



<p>This naturally leads to the next research pillar: reliability. If we <em>truly</em> connect everything up: rely on machines running our homes, our transportation, our cities, we don’t want a network fault to bring down half the town. Only an utterly reliable solution is considerable.</p>



<h4>Efficiency</h4>



<p>The third key area of research I personally want to highlight is <em>efficiency</em>. Higher frequency waves need more energy. We want to produce more and more connected things. All of it needs power, and it must come from somewhere. I am really excited to live through the start of the green revolution. But what would happen if we drastically increased our electricity usage before catching up with the transition to green energy? Environmental impact is absolutely critical.</p>



<h2>6G alone is not enough</h2>



<p>Samsung has published a whitepaper <span id="easy-footnote-5-117"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-5-117" title="<a href=&quot;https://cdn.codeground.org/nsr/downloads/researchareas/6G%20Vision.pdf&quot;>https://cdn.codeground.org/nsr/downloads/researchareas/6G%20Vision.pdf</a>"><sup>5</sup></a></span> on their vision of the 6G communication era: hyper-connected experience in every corner of the world. A long, interesting paper that even I did not manage to read fully (happily there’s a summary in their newsroom <span id="easy-footnote-6-117"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-6-117" title="<a href=&quot;https://news.samsung.com/global/samsungs-6g-white-paper-lays-out-the-companys-vision-for-the-next-generation-of-communications-technology&quot;>https://news.samsung.com/global/samsungs-6g-white-paper-lays-out-the-companys-vision-for-the-next-generation-of-communications-technology</a>"><sup>6</sup></a></span>), Many interesting topics are discussed, one of which I would also like to bring up.</p>



<blockquote><p>There will be new advanced services in 6G era, which require a tremendous amount of real-time data processing, a hyper-fast data rate, and extremely low latency,</p></blockquote>

<p>I am talking about mobile VR/AR, holographic displays, real-time in-depth health monitoring for an individual, a kind of cyber-realworld fusion that can often be found in science fiction. We <strong>will</strong> find ways to provide ultra low latency and ultra high network throughput. But if we lag behind in mobile computational capability? Or if don’t have a <em>true revolution</em> in battery technology? We would not be able to fully utilize 6G. How long would your IPhone 23 6G last with the lithium-ion battery of today? </p>



<h2>6G communication In Space</h2>



<p>Now, I don’t know if you’ve heard, but Nokia has been granted $14.1m by NASA to build 4G <em><span>on the moon</span></em> <span id="easy-footnote-7-117"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-7-117" title="<a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/19/nasa-is-launching-a-4g-mobile-network-on-the-moon.html&quot;>https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/19/nasa-is-launching-a-4g-mobile-network-on-the-moon.html</a>"><sup>7</sup></a></span>. It will eventually be expanded to 5G. So, VOIP on the moon. I think it’s a tipping point in our commitment to space. But why did China launch a 6G communication satellite into space <span id="easy-footnote-8-117"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-8-117" title="<a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-asia-china-54852131&quot;>https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-asia-china-54852131</a>"><sup>8</sup></a></span>? Well, it provides us with some special, favorable conditions to test things in. So why not test it there first? Honestly I don’t actually know! Maybe some of you can tell me more, or send me a link?</p>



<h2>But then is 6G viable?</h2>



<p>6G is expected to move into the terahertz frequency band. The wavelength is tiny. The challenges are enormous. A direct line of sight of a very narrow beam is a must. Forget obstacles. I mean research is looking into signal degradation due to water vapor absorption at 10 meter distance <span id="easy-footnote-9-117"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-9-117" title="<a href=&quot;https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/12/4/676&quot;>https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/12/4/676</a>"><sup>9</sup></a></span>.</p>



<p>Fear not! Worldwide research is already ongoing how to solve these seemingly impossible challenges <span id="easy-footnote-10-117"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-10-117" title="<a href=&quot;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/searchresult.jsp?newsearch=true&amp;amp;queryText=6g%20communication&quot;>https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/searchresult.jsp?newsearch=true&amp;amp;queryText=6g%20communication</a>"><sup>10</sup></a></span>. Just don’t start saving up for that IPhone 23. 6G is not realistically expected to be commercially viable and available until 2030’s. We don’t even know what it will be, 3GPP <span id="easy-footnote-11-117"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-11-117" title="<a href=&quot;https://www.3gpp.org/about-3gpp&quot;>https://www.3gpp.org/about-3gpp</a>"><sup>11</sup></a></span> will decide that.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <div><p>We’ve all been there. Whether we’re waiting for a bus that is stuck in traffic, or eagerly anticipating the release of a new book, film or album, there are times when we need to be patient. Learning to suppress the impulse for instant gratification is often vital for future success, but how patience is regulated in the brain remains poorly understood.</p>

<p>Now, in a study on mice conducted by the <a href="https://groups.oist.jp/ncu" target="_blank">Neural Computation Unit</a> at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST), the co-authors, Dr. Katsuhiko Miyazaki and Dr. Kayoko Miyazaki, pinpoint specific areas of the brain that individually promote patience through the action of serotonin. Their findings were published 27th November in <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abc7246" target="_blank"><em>Science Advances</em></a>.</p>

<p>“Serotonin is one of the most famous neuromodulators of behavior, helping to regulate mood, sleep-wake cycles and appetite,” said Dr. Katsuhiko Miyazaki. “Our research shows that release of this chemical messenger also plays a crucial role in promoting patience, increasing the time that mice are willing to wait for a food reward.”</p>

<p>Their most recent work draws heavily on previous research, where the unit used a powerful technique called optogenetics – using light to stimulate specific neurons in the brain – to establish a causal link between serotonin and patience.</p>

<p>The scientists bred genetically engineered mice which had serotonin-releasing neurons that expressed a light-sensitive protein. This meant that the researchers could stimulate these neurons to release serotonin at precise times by shining light, using an optical fiber implanted in the brain.</p>

<p>The researchers found that stimulating these neurons while the mice were waiting for food increased their waiting time, with the maximum effect seen when the probability of receiving a reward was high but when the timing of the reward was uncertain.</p>

<p>“In other words, for the serotonin to promote patience, the mice had to be confident that a reward would come but uncertain about when it would arrive,” said Dr. Miyazaki.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.oist.jp/news-center/press-releases/wait-it-serotonin-and-confidence-root-patience-new-study" target="_blank">In the previous study</a>, the scientists focused on an area of the brain called the dorsal raphe nucleus – the central hub of serotonin-releasing neurons. Neurons from the dorsal raphe nucleus reach out into other areas of the forebrain and in their most recent study, the scientists explored specifically which of these other brain areas contributed to regulating patience.</p>

<p>The team focused on three brain areas that had been shown to increase impulsive behaviors when they were damaged – a deep brain structure called the nucleus accumbens, and two parts of the frontal lobe called the orbitofrontal cortex and the medial prefrontal cortex.</p>

          <p>Serotonin-releasing neurons (green arrows) from the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) penetrate many other areas of the brain, including the nucleus accumbens (NAc), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC).</p>

          </div>
  </div>
  

<p>“Impulse behaviors are intrinsically linked to patience – the more impulsive an individual is, the less patient – so these brain areas were prime candidates,” explained Dr. Miyazaki.</p>

<p><strong>Good things come to those who wait (or not...)</strong></p>

<p>In the study, the scientists implanted optical fibers into the dorsal raphe nucleus and also one of either the nucleus accumbens, the orbitofrontal cortex, or the medial prefrontal cortex.</p>

<p>The researchers trained mice to perform a waiting task where the mice held with their nose inside a hole, called a “nose poke”, until a food pellet was delivered. The scientists rewarded the mice in 75% of trials. In some test conditions, the timing of the reward was fixed at six or ten seconds after the mice started the nose poke and in other test conditions, the timing of the reward varied.</p>

<p>In the remaining 25% of trials, called the omission trials, the scientists did not provide a food reward to the mice. They measured how long the mice continued performing the nose poke during omission trials – in other words, how patient they were – when serotonin-releasing neurons were and were not stimulated.</p>

<p>When the researchers stimulated serotonin-releasing neural fibers that reached into the nucleus accumbens, they found no increase in waiting time, suggesting that serotonin in this area of the brain has no role in regulating patience.</p>

<p>But when the scientists stimulated serotonin release in the orbitofrontal cortex and the medial prefrontal cortex while the mice were holding the nose poke, they found the mice waited longer, with a few crucial differences.</p>

<p>In the orbitofrontal cortex, release of serotonin promoted patience as effectively as serotonin activation in the dorsal raphe nucleus; both when reward timing was fixed and when reward timing was uncertain, with stronger effects in the latter.</p>

<p>But in the medial prefrontal cortex, the scientists only saw an increase in patience when the timing of the reward was varied, with no effect observed when the timing was fixed.</p>

</ul><div id="node-photo-node-embed-group-photo-caption--2"><div>
    <div>
          <p>The scientists studied the effect of stimulating serotonin-releasing neurons (black arrows) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) on waiting time, under variable time trials (e.g. food delivered after 2,6 or 10 seconds) and under fixed time trials (e.g. food delivered after 6 seconds). No effect was seen when neurons in the NAc were stimulated. A weak effect led to a small increase in waiting time when neurons in the mPFC were stimulated in variable time trials. A strong effect was seen when neurons in the OFC were stimulated in variable time trials and a weak effect was seen in fixed time trials. The thickness of the dashed arrows indicate the strength of the effect.</p>

<p>“The differences seen in how each area of the brain responded to serotonin suggests that each brain area contributes to the overall waiting behavior of the mice in separate ways,” said Dr. Miyazaki.</p>

<p><strong>Modelling patience</strong></p>

<p>To investigate this further, the scientists constructed a computational model to explain the waiting behavior of the mice.</p>

<p>The model assumes that the mice have a predictive model of the timing of reward delivery and estimate the probability that a reward will be delivered. While they keep waiting without receiving a food pellet, the estimated probability for the trial to be a reward trial gradually goes down, and the mice accordingly decide whether or not to keep waiting. The model also assumes that the orbitofrontal cortex and the medial prefrontal cortex use different predictive models of reward timing to calculate reward probabilities individually, with the latter being more sensitive to variations in timing.</p>

<p>The researchers found that the model best fitted the experimental data of waiting time by increasing the initially expected reward probability from 75% to 94% under serotonin stimulation. Put more simply, serotonin increased the mice’s belief that they were in a reward trial, and so they waited longer.</p>

<p>Importantly, the model assumed that stimulation of the orbital frontal cortex and the medial prefrontal cortex separately increased the initial reward probability from 75% to 94% only in that particular area, whereas stimulation of the dorsal raphe nucleus increased the probability in both areas. Only under these assumptions was the model able to successfully reproduce all the behavioral data.</p>

<p>“This confirmed the idea that these two brain areas are calculating the probability of a reward independently from each other, and that these independent calculations are then combined to ultimately determine how long the mice will wait,” explained Dr. Miyazaki. “This sort of complementary system allows animals to behave more flexibly to changing environments.”</p>

<p>Ultimately, increasing our knowledge of how different areas of the brain are more or less affected by serotonin could have vital implications in future development of drugs. For example, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are drugs that boost levels of serotonin in the brain and are used to treat depression.</p>

<p>“This is an area we are keen to explore in the future, by using depression models of mice,” said Dr. Miyazaki. “We may find under certain genetic or environmental conditions that some of these identified brain areas have altered functions. By pinning down these regions, this could open avenues to provide more targeted treatments that act on specific areas of the brain, rather than the whole brain.”</p>

            <section>

                    <p>Yesterday, my cofounder wrote a <a href="https://blog.nillium.com/its-time-to-remove-news-from-facebook-and-google/">controversial post on this blog</a>, presenting a case for news publishers to limit -- or remove -- their reporting from Facebook and Google. &nbsp;The responses were immediate and plentiful, but fascinatingly different depending on the audience.</p><p>On Hacker News, a tech- and startup-focused forum, the link rose to the top of the list before being “flagged” and removed from the front page. &nbsp;The<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25249414"> comments there</a> took a more pragmatic, technical approach to the problem, from “<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25249553">The technical capability already exists in the form of robots.txt and the referer header,</a>” to constant reminders that news organizations <em>need</em> this traffic.</p><p>On the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/k3kmg9/its_time_to_remove_news_from_facebook_and_google/">r/journalism subreddit</a>, we were hit from the other side. &nbsp;Why not just “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/k3kmg9/its_time_to_remove_news_from_facebook_and_google/ge3zqq2/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">nationalize the press so we can quit with the hand-wringing</a>?” suggested one commenter, while another lamented that “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/k3kmg9/its_time_to_remove_news_from_facebook_and_google/ge51kko/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">this idea disenfranchises young journalists who don’t have any name credibility and recognition and need an established platforms [sic] gravitas to help establish them</a>.”</p><p>If ever there was a good illustration of the disconnect we face in trying to make journalism sustainable again, this is it. &nbsp;The tech side that constantly proclaims “information wants to be free,” and sees pay-for-journalism as a solved problem through Substack, and the jaded newsroom audience who sees another tech platform trying to come in and get them financially hooked.</p><p>The problem, of course, is that it is not a problem equally felt across these camps. &nbsp;The Hacker News crowd is absolutely correct when they say that news organizations need the traffic coming from social media and aggregators -- they do! -- but that is a sign of addiction, not a healthy ecosystem. &nbsp;And the journalist demographic has every reason to assume the worst, because they have been hurt before.</p><p>The economics of this are simple. &nbsp;</p><p>A few decades ago, people subscribed to newspapers, written on paper, that were delivered every morning. &nbsp;The subscription fee never fully covered the cost of running a newspaper; ads appeared between articles, and that subscription base guaranteed an audience for the sponsors. &nbsp;These publications naively started putting their articles online for free -- if advertising could buoy their business up until this point, why would the web be any different? &nbsp;As the ad market matured, CPMs increased, and slowly, internet advertising started to represent real money.</p><p>But then things went viral. &nbsp;Lots of things. &nbsp;People started sharing news articles they read (or <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/06/16/six-in-10-of-you-will-share-this-link-without-reading-it-according-to-a-new-and-depressing-study/%20Show%20less">didn’t read</a>) on social media. &nbsp;Tech companies tweaked their sorting algorithms to get content to eyeballs -- and did so incredibly successfully. But, this created our first problem.</p><h3 id="problem-1-hard-news-doesn-t-trend">Problem 1: Hard news doesn't trend</h3><p>Admittedly, this is only a problem depending on what side of the fence you sit.</p><p>If your goal -- like that of any number of tech companies -- is to get content in front of your users that they will engage with -- then this has been an unmitigated success. &nbsp;However, if you are reporting out a story for a specific audience, not being able to reach them is problematic. &nbsp;</p><p>At this point, the tech side may wonder why if your articles are so great, the audience isn’t seeking it out. &nbsp;The answer, I suspect, is that the audience does not know it is there.</p><p>Virtually any digital editor will tell you that most traffic bypasses the homepage. &nbsp;Users rarely think &nbsp;“I wonder what is happening today?” and seek out the news site; rather, they are told what is happening by the sorting algorithms and walk away feeling like they are updated. &nbsp;That works to a degree, except that hard news -- especially local news -- does not trend.</p><p>No one shares the summary of last night’s city council meeting. &nbsp;Even the most damning investigative report will only get so far if it is focused on a small area; users outside the area just won’t amplify it.</p><h3 id="problem-2-fake-news">Problem 2: Fake News</h3><p>What <em>does</em> trend? &nbsp;The outrageous, crazy things that you want to share with the world. &nbsp;Of course, that’s not to say all viral headlines are fake, but at this point it seems pretty well accepted that many are.</p><p>Because anyone can write and post anything, these wholly fabricated, or hyper-partisan stories are usually placed in the same regard as those that are rigorously reported and fact-checked. They are then forced to compete against each other for attention.</p><p>Worse yet, these posts can be so malignant that it impugns the reputation of “the media” -- because now you cannot believe what you read.<br></p><h3 id="problem-3-clickbait">Problem 3: Clickbait</h3><p>How do you compete then? &nbsp;By stooping lower. &nbsp;It means publishers resort to writing clickbait headlines to grab a second or two of user attention, and then covering the article page in more clickbait links to keep them there. &nbsp;</p><p>It can even creep into the editorial decisions: Knowing what people are searching for or clicking on can shape what reporters are assigned. <br></p><h3 id="problem-4-all-the-ads">Problem 4: All the ads</h3><p>Why do drivers in your area need to know about that new law? &nbsp;What celebrity finally “broke [their] silence?” &nbsp;I <em>know</em> I won’t believe what happens next. &nbsp;</p><p>These ads are annoying. These ads are detrimental to the user experience that any publication wants. &nbsp;But these ads are needed -- they are a symptom of the addiction. &nbsp;When the flow of users becomes constricted, these organizations have no other choice but to exploit their traffic for as much as it is worth; it’s survival.</p><p>Those ads in between articles in the print newspaper? &nbsp;They still exist, but they are now sold by Facebook, Twitter, and Google. &nbsp;Money is still being made off of the reader, it just is not going to the people doing the reporting. &nbsp;And partnerships between newsrooms and tech giants are generally for big, national outlets, leaving the local newsroom to suffer.</p><h3 id="problem-5-brain-drain">Problem 5: Brain drain</h3><p>As awful as this all is for the casual news consumer, it is worse for the people working on it all day everyday. &nbsp;No one wants assignment-by-SEO. No one wants the ads all over the place. And most of all, no one wants the layoffs. &nbsp;So those that can are fleeing to Substack, or creating their own publications.</p><p>That is great for them, and I wish them all the best. &nbsp;But as that Reddit commenter pointed out, that only works for reporters who have made a name for themselves. &nbsp;It is much more common to follow someone because you like their ideas than someone who you think reports out a story well. &nbsp;</p><p>What about all of those wide eyed, young, idealistic reporters <em>looking </em>to make a name for themselves? &nbsp;What about all of the important stories <em>they</em> are covering? &nbsp;Will now fewer people go to the legacy publications once the big names jump ship?<br></p><h3 id="what-we-re-doing">What we're doing</h3><p>This is why Xana wrote what she did, and made the case firms should pay up. &nbsp;First, it got your attention enough to rise above the noise (a requirement, as discussed above). And it also presented this point: The traffic coming from big tech, while needed for local news’ survival, is also killing it. The answer cannot be found in robots.txt -- it comes from rethinking the model of how we find our users, and how we interact with them.</p><p>Forth is our answer. &nbsp; </p><p>We want to take what is appealing about discovering news on social, and replicate it, but with reporters we know and trust. &nbsp;We want to help them build personal brands because we know younger generations tend to trust real people over companies or institutions (think: influencers). &nbsp;We want to rev-share, not because we think it is a selling point, but to align our incentives with those of the newsrooms; we both succeed together.</p><p>We will be launching soon in markets where we feel we have enough reporters to make using our app worthwhile. &nbsp;If you are a reporter or represent a newsroom, we would love to hear from you at <a href="mailto:hello@nillium.com">hello@nillium.com</a>. &nbsp;If you want to read what our partners are writing, please sign up for the <a href="https://www.forthapp.com/list.html">waiting list</a> -- we will let you know as soon as we are live in your area.</p>

    Current Stable Release
</h3><p>
The current stable release of the sudo 1.9 branch is version
<a href="https://www.sudo.ws/dist/sudo-1.9.4.tar.gz">1.9.4</a>.
For the sudo 1.8 branch, see <a href="https://www.sudo.ws/legacy.html">legacy releases</a>.
</p><p>

</p><hr><h3>
    <img src="https://www.sudo.ws/images/spacer.gif" width="1" height="5" alt="">
    Major changes between version 1.9.4 and 1.9.3p1:
</h3>
<ul>
<li>	The sudoers parser will now detect when an upper-case reserved
	word is used when declaring an alias. Now instead of <em>syntax
	error, unexpected CHROOT, expecting ALIAS</em> the message will be
	<em>syntax error, reserved word CHROOT used as an alias name</em>.
	<a href="http://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=941">Bug #941</a>.
</li><li>	Better handling of sudoers files without a final newline.
	The parser now adds a newline at end-of-file automatically which
	removes the need for special cases in the parser.
</li><li>	Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.9.1 in the sssd back-end
	where an uninitialized pointer could be freed on an error path.
	<a href="https://github.com/sudo-project/sudo/issues/67">GitHub Issue #67</a>.
</li><li>	The core logging code is now shared between <tt>sudo_logsrvd</tt> and
	the <tt>sudoers</tt> plugin.
</li><li>	JSON log entries sent to syslog now use <em>minimal</em> JSON which
	skips all non-essential whitespace.
</li><li>	The sudoers plugin can now produce JSON-formatted logs. The
	<em>log_format</em> sudoers option can be used to select sudo or json
	format logs. The default is sudo format logs.
</li><li>	The sudoers plugin and visudo now display the column number in
	syntax error messages in addition to the line number.
	<a href="http://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=841">Bug #841</a>.
</li><li>	If I/O logging is not enabled but <em>log_servers</em> is set, the
	sudoers plugin will now log accept events to sudo_logsrvd.
	Previously, the accept event was only sent when I/O logging was
	enabled. The sudoers plugin now sends reject and alert events too.
</li><li>	The sudo logsrv protocol has been extended to allow an
	<em>AlertMessage</em> to contain an optional array of
	<em>InfoMessage</em>, as <em>AcceptMessage</em> and
	<em>RejectMessage</em> already do.
</li><li>	Fixed a bug in sudo_logsrvd where receipt of <tt>SIGHUP</tt> would
	result in duplicate entries in the debug log when debugging was enabled.
</li><li>	The visudo utility now supports <tt>EDITOR</tt> environment variables
	that use single or double quotes in the command arguments.
	<a href="http://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=942">Bug #942</a>.
</li><li>	The PAM session modules now run when sudo is set-user-ID root,
	which allows a module to determine the original user-ID.
	<a href="http://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=944">Bug #944</a>.
</li><li>	Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.8.24 in the LDAP back-end
	where sudoNotBefore and sudoNotAfter were applied even when the
	<tt>SUDOERS_TIMED</tt> setting was not present in <tt>ldap.conf</tt>.
	<a href="http://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=945">Bug #945</a>.
</li><li>	Sudo packages for macOS 11 now contain universal binaries that
	support both Intel and Apple Silicon CPUs.
</li><li>    For sudo_logsrvd, an empty value for the <em>pid_file</em> setting in
	sudo_logsrvd.con will now disable the process ID file.
</li></ul>
<hr><h3>
    <img src="https://www.sudo.ws/images/spacer.gif" width="1" height="5" alt="">
    Major changes between version 1.9.3p1 and 1.9.3:
</h3>
<ul>
<li>	Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.9.3 where the configure
        script would not detect the <tt>crypt</tt> function if it
        was present in the C library, not an additional library.
</li><li>	Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.8.23 with shadow passwd
	file authentication on OpenBSD. BSD authentication was not
	affected.
</li><li>	Sudo now logs when a user-specified command-line option is
	rejected by a sudoers rule. Previously, these conditions were
	written to the audit log, but the default sudo log file. Affected
        command line arguments include <tt>-C</tt> (<tt>--close-from</tt>),
        <tt>-D </tt>(<tt>--chdir)</tt>, <tt>-R</tt> (<tt>--chroot</tt>),
        <tt>-g</tt> (<tt>--group</tt>) and <tt>-u</tt> (<tt>--user</tt>).
</li></ul>
<hr><h3>
    <img src="https://www.sudo.ws/images/spacer.gif" width="1" height="5" alt="">
    Major changes between version 1.9.3 and 1.9.2:
</h3>
<ul>
<li>    <tt>sudoedit</tt> will now prompt the user before overwriting
	an existing file with one that is zero-length after editing.
	<a href="https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=922">Bug #922</a>.
</li><li>	Fixed building the Python plugin on systems with a compiler that
	doesn't support symbol hiding.
</li><li>	Sudo now uses a linker script to hide symbols even when the
	compiler has native symbol hiding support. This should make it
	easier to detect omissions in the symbol exports file, regardless
	of the platform.
</li><li>	Fixed the libssl dependency in Debian packages for older releases
	that use <tt>libssl1.0.0</tt>.
</li><li>    <tt>sudo</tt> and <tt>visudo</tt> now provide more detailed
        messages when a syntax error is detected in <tt>sudoers</tt>.
        The offending line and token are now displayed. If the
        parser was generated by GNU bison, additional information
        about what token was expected is also displayed.
	<a href="https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=841">Bug #841</a>.
</li><li>	Sudoers rules must now end in either a newline or the end-of-file.
	Previously, it was possible to have multiple rules on a single
	line, separated by white space. The use of an end-of-line
	terminator makes it possible to display accurate error messages.
</li><li>	Sudo no longer refuses to run if a syntax error in the sudoers
	file is encountered. The entry with the syntax error will be
	discarded and sudo will continue to parse the file. This makes
	recovery from a syntax error less painful on systems where sudo
	is the primary method of superuser access. The historic behavior
	can be restored by add <tt>error_recovery=false</tt> to the sudoers
	plugin's optional arguments in <tt>sudo.conf</tt>.
	<a href="https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=618">Bug #618</a>.
</li><li>	Fixed the <em>sample_approval</em> plugin's symbol exports file for
	systems where the compiler doesn't support symbol hiding.
</li><li>	Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.9.1 where arguments to
        the <em>sudoers_policy</em> plugin in <tt>sudo.conf</tt>
        were not being applied. The sudoers file is now parsed by
        the <em>sudoers_audit</em> plugin, which is loaded implicitly
        when <em>sudoers_policy</em> is listed in <tt>sudo.conf</tt>.
        Starting with sudo 1.9.3, if there are plugin arguments for
        <tt>sudoers_policy</tt> but <tt>sudoers_audit</tt> is not
        listed, those arguments will be applied to <tt>sudoers_audit</tt>
        instead.
</li><li>	The user's resource limits are now passed to sudo plugins in
	the <tt>user_info[]</tt> list. A plugin cannot determine the limits
	itself because sudo changes the limits while it runs to prevent
	resource starvation.
</li><li>	It is now possible to set the working directory or change the
        root directory on a per-command basis using the <tt>CWD</tt>
        and <tt>CHROOT</tt> options. There are also new Defaults
        settings, <em>runchroot</em> and <em>runcwd</em>, that can
        be used to set the working directory or root directory on
        a more global basis.
</li><li>    New <tt>-D</tt> (<tt>--chdir</tt>) and <tt>-R</tt>
        (<tt>--chroot</tt>) command line options can be used to set
        the working directory or root directory if the sudoers file
        allows it. This functionality is not enabled by default
        and must be explicitly enabled in the sudoers file.
</li></ul>
<hr><h3>
    <img src="https://www.sudo.ws/images/spacer.gif" width="1" height="5" alt="">
    Major changes between version 1.9.2 and 1.9.1:
</h3>
<ul>
<li>	Fixed package builds on RedHat Enterprise Linux 8.
</li><li>	The configure script now uses pkg-config to find the openssl
	cflags and libs where possible.
</li><li>	The contents of the log.json I/O log file is now documented in
	the sudoers manual.
</li><li>	The sudoers plugin now properly exports the sudoers_audit symbol
	on systems where the compiler lacks symbol visibility controls.
	This caused a regression in 1.9.1 where a successful sudo command
	was not logged due to the missing audit plugin.
	<a href="https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=931">Bug #931</a>.
</li><li>	Fixed a regression introduced in 1.9.1 that can result in crash
	when there is a syntax error in the sudoers file.
	<a href="https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=934">Bug #934</a>.
</li></ul>
<hr><h3>
    <img src="https://www.sudo.ws/images/spacer.gif" width="1" height="5" alt="">
    Major changes between version 1.9.1 and 1.9.0:
</h3>
<ul>
<li>	Fixed an AIX-specific problem when I/O logging was enabled.
	The terminal device was not being properly set to raw mode.
	<a href="https://bugzilla.sudo.ws/show_bug.cgi?id=927">Bug #927</a>.
</li><li>	Corrected handling of <tt>sudo_logsrvd</tt> connections without
        associated I/O log data. This fixes support for RejectMessage
        as well as AcceptMessage when the expect_iobufs flag is not
        set.
</li><li>    Added an <em>iolog_path</em> entry to the JSON-format event
        log produced by <tt>sudo_logsrvd</tt>. Previously, it was
        only possible to determine the I/O log file an event belonged
        to using sudo-format logs.
</li><li>	Fixed the bundle IDs for <tt>sudo-logsrvd</tt> and <tt>sudo-python</tt>
	macOS packages.
</li><li>	I/O log files produced by the sudoers plugin now clear the write
	bits on the I/O log timing file when the log is complete. This
	is consistent with how <tt>sudo_logsrvd</tt> indicates that a log is
	complete.
</li><li>	The <tt>sudoreplay</tt> utility has a new <strong>-F</strong>
        (follow) command line option to allow replaying a session
        that is still in progress, similar to <tt>tail -f</tt>.
</li><li>    The <tt>@include</tt> and <tt>@includedir</tt> directives
        can be used in sudoers instead of <tt>#include</tt> and
        <tt>#includedir</tt>. In addition, include paths may now
        have embedded white space by either using a double-quoted
        string or escaping the space characters with a backslash.
</li><li>	Fixed some Solaris 11.4 compilation errors.
</li><li>	When running a command in a pty, sudo will no longer try to
	suspend itself if the user's tty has been revoked (for instance
	when the parent ssh daemon is killed). This fixes a bug where
	sudo would continuously suspend the command (which would succeed),
	then suspend itself (which would fail due to the missing tty)
	and then resume the command.
</li><li>    If sudo's event loop fails due to the tty being revoked,
        remove the user's tty events and restart the event loop
        (once). This fixes a problem when running <tt>sudo reboot</tt>
        in a pty on some systems. When the event loop exited
        unexpectedly, sudo would kill the command running in the
        pty, which in the case of <tt>reboot</tt>, could lead to
        the system being in a half-rebooted state.
</li><li>	Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.8.23 in the LDAP and
        SSSD back-ends where a missing <tt>sudoHost</tt> attribute
        was treated as an <tt>ALL</tt> wildcard value. A
        <tt>sudoRole</tt> with no <tt>sudoHost</tt> attribute is
        now ignored as it was prior to version 1.8.23.
</li><li>	The audit plugin API has been changed slightly. The sudo front-end
	now audits an accept event itself after all approval plugins are
	run and the I/O logging plugins (if any) are opened. This makes
	it possible for an audit plugin to only log a single overall
	accept event if desired.
</li><li>	The sudoers plugin can now be loaded as an audit plugin. Logging
	of successful commands is now performed in the audit plugin's
	accept function. As a result, commands are now only logged if
	allowed by sudoers and all approval plugins. Commands rejected
	by an approval …</li></ul></div></div></div>

    <p>The regex literals optimization avoids running the regex engine on parts of the input text that cannot possibly ever match the regex.</p>

<p>An example of a regex this can be applied to is <code>\w+@\w+\.\w+</code>, where the algorithm <em>quickly</em> finds the first <code>@</code>, then matches <code>\w+</code> backwards to find the start of the match, and then matches <code>\w+\.\w+</code> forward to find the end of the match. It then finds the second <code>@</code>, starting from the end of the previous match, and so on. This is a fairly naive (and incorrect) implementation, but it gives the idea of how it works.</p>

<p>I’ve recently implemented it in my pet project <a href="https://github.com/nitely/nim-regex/pull/68">nim-regex</a>, an NFA based regex engine that runs in (super)linear time. The results show it’s around ~100x faster than before in some benchmarks. It’s up to ~60x faster than PCRE when the optimization kicks in. The tests are based on <a href="https://github.com/mariomka/regex-benchmark">mariomka/regex-benchmark</a>.</p>

<p>This is not to be confused with <em>Chivers’ String Prefix Optimization</em>.</p>

<h2 id="literals-optimization">Literals Optimization</h2>

<p>Since nim-regex has to guarantee linear time, I’ll describe optimizations that are guaranteed to take linear time. We must also ensure the matches are not overlapped.</p>

<p>I think the best way to understand how this optimization works is by example. However, here’s a high-level description of the algorithm:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We pick a literal that is <code>memchr</code>‘ed to skip parts of the text.</li>
  <li>The prefix is the regex part before the literal; none of the
characters or symbols within the prefix must match the literal.</li>
  <li>The prefix is ran backwards to find the start of the match.</li>
  <li>A full scan is ran from the start of the match
until a character that cannot be matched is found (safe break point)
or the end is reached. The scan tries to start the match at every character (NFAs can do this in linear time).</li>
  <li>Go to step one and repeat from the last scanned char. Make the prefix
match until the previous last scanned char.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are two important constraints to picking a literal:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>“none of the characters or symbols within the prefix must match the literal”</em>, why? consider the regex: <code>\d\w+x</code>, and the input text: <code>xxxxxxxxxxx</code>; this would take quadratic time, as the prefix will match until the start of the string every time. What about the limit? while the limit does avoid the excessive matching, sometimes we’d need to match past the limit, ex: regex: <code>\d\w+x</code>, and text: <code>1xxx</code>. If we add this constraint, the literal becomes a delimeter, and these cases are solved.</li>
  <li>The literal cannot be part of a repetition, nor it can be part of an alternation. For example: <code>(abc)*def</code> the first literal candidate is <code>d</code>, since <code>(abc)*</code> may or may not be part of the match. Same thing for alternations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s the main algorithm in <a href="https://nim-lang.org/">Nim</a>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nim"><span>func</span> <span>findAll</span><span>(</span>
  <span>matches</span><span>:</span> <span>var</span> <span>Matches</span><span>,</span>

    <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>matchPrefix</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>,</span> <span>regex</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>limit</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>i</span> <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>:</span>
      <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>litIdx</span><span>+</span><span>1</span>
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
      <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>findSome</span><span>(</span><span>matches</span><span>,</span> <span>text</span><span>,</span> <span>regex</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>)</span>
      <span>if</span> <span>i</span> <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>
      <span>if</span> <span>matches</span><span>.</span><span>len</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>i</span>  <span># this is used as "start" to resume the matching</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>A given character may be consumed only twice, once by the backward prefix match, and a second time by the forward scan. Hence the algorithm runs in linear time.</p>

<p>I may describe how <code>matchPrefix</code> and <code>findSome</code> work, how to construct the reversed NFA in the right order, and how to pick the literal in a future article. The nim-regex code contains descriptions of the algorithms, though.</p>

<h2 id="benchmarks">Benchmarks</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/nitely/nim-regex/tree/master/bench">benchmarks</a> regexes are based on <a href="https://github.com/mariomka/regex-benchmark">mariomka/regex-benchmark</a>. The only difference is the regexes are pre-compiled, so just the matching is tested. The results show nim-regex is ~63x faster than PCRE in the email test, and ~2x faster in the URI and IP tests.</p>

<p>Why is nim-regex so fast in the email case? The regex engine doesn’t run as often. There are orders of magnitud more IP/URI candidates than email candidates (<code>@</code> chars within the text) to match. In the former case the time is dominated by the regex engine, while in the latter case it’s dominated by searching the char literal.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note Nim’s PCRE is at the top of the mariomka/regex-benchmark. I ran those benchmarks, and IIRC nim-regex was just a bit faster, mainly because the non-macro regex engine is slower (see the above results), and the regex compilation is also tested.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="other-optimizations">Other optimizations</h2>

<p>Here are other possible optimizations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Picking a literal —even if the prefix matches it— should take linear time as long as the prefix is bounded (i.e: does not contain repetitions), ex: <code>\d\wx</code>.</li>
  <li>Picking a literal within a “one or more” repetition/repetition group should be possible, since <code>(abc)+</code> matches the same as <code>abc(abc)*</code>.</li>
  <li>It’s better to pick the last literal within the first literal sequence, since that way we always try to match as many literals as possible early on, and potentially fail early. We want to keep the prefix regex as short as possible, so the picking a literal in the first sequence is best.</li>
  <li>Alternations can be optimized this very same way in some cases, ex: <code>bar|baz</code>, since both alternations have <code>ba</code> in common, <code>a</code> can be picked as the literal.</li>
  <li>Alternations can be optimized in other cases. PCRE seems to use <code>memchr</code> or similar for up to two alternation terms. A DFA could be used to quickly match candidates instead of <code>memchr</code>, as that’s a more general solution.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Literals optimization is not a general optimization as it does not work on every regex, but when it does, it can greatly improve the matching speed.</p>

<p>Can a backtracker like PCRE implement this? PCRE in particular already has some sort of similar optimization, but it’s not as good/fast as this one. Backtrackers usually guarantee constant space, so they cannot implement this as described here exactly, but they can do something similar that requires backtracking. If they either provide a resumable <code>find</code> function, or relax this constraint, then probably yes.</p>

<p>Hopefully, more regex engines will implement these sort of optimizations, so they are more compelling alternatives to backtrackers such as PCRE.</p>

<h2><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></h2>



<p>In the publication entitled “Detection of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by real-time RT-PCR” (Eurosurveillance 25(8) 2020) the authors present a diagnostic workflow and RT-qPCR protocol for detection and diagnostics of 2019-nCoV (now known as SARS-CoV-2), which they claim to be validated, as well as being a robust diagnostic methodology for use in public-health laboratory settings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In light of all the consequences resulting from this very publication for societies worldwide, a group of independent researchers performed a point-by-point review of the aforesaid publication in which 1) all components of the presented test design were cross checked, 2) the RT-qPCR protocol-recommendations were assessed w.r.t. good laboratory practice, and 3) parameters examined against relevant scientific literature covering the field.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>The published RT-qPCR protocol for detection and diagnostics of 2019-nCoV and the manuscript suffer from numerous technical and scientific errors, including insufficient primer design, a problematic and insufficient RT-qPCR protocol, and the absence of an accurate test validation. Neither the presented test nor the manuscript itself fulfils the requirements for an acceptable scientific publication. Further, serious conflicts of interest of the authors are not mentioned. Finally, the very short timescale between submission and acceptance of the publication (24 hours) signifies that a systematic peer review process was either not performed here, or of problematic poor quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;We provide compelling evidence of several scientific inadequacies, errors and flaws. </p><p>Considering the scientific and methodological blemishes presented here, we are confident that the editorial board of Eurosurveillance has no other choice but to retract the publication.</p></div>







<h2><strong>CONCISE REVIEW REPORT</strong></h2>



<div><p>This paper will show numerous serious flaws in the Corman-Drosten paper, the significance of which has led to worldwide misdiagnosis of infections attributed to SARS-CoV-2 and associated with the disease COVID-19. We are confronted with stringent lockdowns which have destroyed many people’s lives and livelihoods, limited access to education and these imposed restrictions by governments around the world are a direct attack on people’s basic rights and their personal freedoms, resulting in collateral damage for entire economies on a global scale.</p><p><strong>There are ten fatal problems with the Corman-Drosten paper which we will outline and explain in greater detail in the following sections.</strong></p></div>



<p>The first and major issue is that the novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (in the publication named 2019-nCoV and in February 2020 named SARS-CoV-2 by an international consortium of virus experts) is based on in silico (theoretical) sequences, supplied by a laboratory in China [1], because at the time neither control material of infectious (“live”) or inactivated SARS-CoV-2 nor isolated genomic RNA of the virus was available to the authors. To date no validation has been performed by the authorship based on isolated SARS-CoV-2 viruses or full length RNA thereof. According to Corman et al.:</p>



<blockquote><p><strong><em>“We aimed to develop and deploy robust diagnostic methodology for use in public health laboratory settings without having virus material available.”</em> [1]</strong></p></blockquote>



<p>The focus here should be placed upon the two stated aims: a) <em>development</em> and b) <em>deployment of a diagnostic test for use in public health laboratory settings</em>. These aims are not achievable without having any actual virus material available (e.g. for determining the infectious viral load). In any case, only a protocol with maximal accuracy can be the mandatory and primary goal in any scenario-outcome of this magnitude. Critical viral load determination is mandatory information, and it is in Christian Drosten’s group responsibility to perform these experiments and provide the crucial data.</p>



<div><p>Nevertheless these in silico sequences were used to develop a RT-PCR test methodology to identify the aforesaid virus. This model was based on the assumption that the novel virus is very similar to SARS-CoV from 2003 as both are beta-coronaviruses.</p><p>The PCR test was therefore designed using the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV as a control material for the Sarbeco component; we know this from our personal email-communication with [2] one of the co-authors of the Corman-Drosten paper. This method to model SARS-CoV-2 was described in the Corman-Drosten paper as follows:</p></div>



<blockquote><p><em>“<strong>the establishment and validation of a diagnostic workflow for 2019-nCoV</strong> <strong>screening and specific confirmation, designed in absence of available virus isolates or original patient specimens. Design and validation were enabled by the close genetic relatedness to the 2003 SARS-CoV, and aided by the use of synthetic nucleic acid technology.”</strong></em></p></blockquote>



<p>The Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is an important biomolecular technology to rapidly detect rare RNA fragments, which are known in advance. In the first step, RNA molecules present in the sample are reverse transcribed to yield cDNA. The cDNA is then amplified in the polymerase chain reaction using a specific primer pair and a thermostable DNA polymerase enzyme. The technology is highly sensitive and its detection limit is theoretically 1 molecule of cDNA. The specificity of the PCR is highly influenced by biomolecular design errors.</p>



<h3><strong>What is important when designing an RT-PCR Test and the quantitative RT-qPCR test described in the Corman-Drosten publication?</strong></h3>



<h5><strong>1. The primers and probes:</strong></h5>



<p>a) the concentration of primers and probes must be of optimal range <br>(100-200 nM)<br>b) must be specific to the target-gene you want to amplify<br>c) must have an optimal percentage of GC content relative to the total nitrogenous bases (minimum 40%, maximum 60%)<br>d) for virus diagnostics at least 3 primer pairs must detect 3 viral genes (preferably as far apart as possible in the viral genome)</p>



<h5><strong>2. The temperature at which all reactions take place:</strong></h5>



<p>a) DNA melting temperature (&gt;92°)<br>b) DNA amplification temperature (TaqPol specific)<br>c) Tm; the annealing temperature (the temperature at which the primers and probes reach the target binding/detachment, not to exceed 2 ̊C per primer pair). Tm heavily depends on GC content of the primers</p>



<h5><strong>3. The number of amplification cycles (less than 35; preferably 25-30 cycles);</strong></h5>



<p>In case of virus detection, &gt;35 cycles only detects signals which do not correlate with infectious virus as determined by isolation in cell culture [reviewed in 2]; if someone is tested by PCR as positive when a threshold of 35 cycles or higher is used (as is the case in most laboratories in Europe &amp; the US), the probability that said person is actually infected is less than 3%, the probability that said result is a false positive is 97% [reviewed in 3]</p>



<h5><strong>4. Molecular biological validations; amplified PCR products must be validated either by running the products in a gel with a DNA ruler, or by direct DNA sequencing</strong></h5>



<h5><strong>5. Positive and negative controls should be specified to confirm/refute specific virus detection</strong></h5>



<h5><strong>6. There should be a Standard Operational Procedure (SOP) available</strong></h5>



<p>SOP unequivocally specifies the above parameters, so that all laboratories are able to set up the exact same test conditions. To have a validated universal SOP is essential, because it enables the comparison of data within and between countries.</p>



<h3><strong>MINOR CONCERNS WITH THE CORMAN-DROSTEN PAPER</strong></h3>



<p>1. In Table 1 of the Corman-Drosten paper, different abbreviations are stated – “nM” is specified, “nm” isn’t. Further in regards to correct nomenclature, nm means “nanometer” therefore nm should read nM here.</p>



<p>2. It is the general consensus to write genetic sequences always in the 5’-3’ direction, including the reverse primers. It is highly unusual to do alignment with reverse complementary writing of the primer sequence as the authors did in figure 2 of the Corman-Drosten paper. Here, in addition, a wobble base is marked as “y” without description of the bases the Y stands for.</p>



<p>3. Two misleading pitfalls in the Corman-Drosten paper are that their Table 1 does not include Tm-values (annealing-temperature values), neither does it show GC-values (number of G and C in the sequences as %-value of total bases).</p>



<h3><strong>MAJOR CONCERNS WITH THE CORMAN-DROSTEN PAPER</strong></h3>



<h4>A) BACKGROUND</h4>



<div><p>The authors introduce the background for their scientific work as: “The ongoing outbreak of the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) poses a challenge for public health laboratories as virus isolates are unavailable while there is growing evidence that the outbreak is more widespread than initially thought, and international spread through travelers does already occur”.</p><p>According to BBC News [4] and Google Statistics [5] there were 6 deaths world-wide on January 21st 2020 – the day when the manuscript was submitted. Why did the authors assume a challenge for public health laboratories while there was no substantial …</p></div></article></div>

                Most people find the film (even in its surviving truncated versions) 
                rather brilliant, but Wells didn't like it much, perhaps because 
                he believes it was 'plagiarized' from his "When The Sleeper 
                Wakes."</p></span></i></p>
<p>I have recently seen the silliest film.  </p>
<p>I do not believe it
would be possible to make one sillier.  </p>
<p>And as this film sets out to display the
way the world is going,  </p>
<p>I think [my book] The Way the World is Going may very
well concern itself with this film.  </p>
<p>It is called Metropolis, it comes from the
great Ufa studios in Germany, and the public is given to understand that it has
been produced at enormous cost.  </p>
<p>It gives in one eddying concentration almost
every possible foolishness, cliché, platitude, and muddlement about mechanical
progress and progress in general served up with a sauce of sentimentality that
is all its own.</p>
<p><img src="https://erkelzaar.tsudao.com/reviews/metro163.jpg" width="485" height="745"></p>
<p>It is a
German film and there have been some amazingly good German films, before they
began to cultivate bad work under cover of a protective quota. And this film has
been adapted to the Anglo-Saxon taste, and quite possibly it has suffered in the
process, but even when every allowance has been made for that, there remains
enough to convince the intelligent observer that most of its silliness must be
fundamental.  </p>
<p>Possibly I dislike this soupy whirlpool none the less because I
find decaying fragments of my own juvenile work of thirty years ago, The Sleeper
Awakes, floating about in it. </p>
<p>Capek's Robots have been lifted without apology,
and that soulless mechanical monster of Mary Shelley's, who has fathered so many
German inventions, breeds once more in this confusion.  </p>
<p>Originality there is
none. Independent thought, none.  </p>
<p>Where nobody has imagined for them the authors
have simply fallen back on contemporary things.  </p>
<p>The aeroplanes that wander about above the great city show no 
advance on contemporary types, though all that stuff could have been livened up 
immensely with a few helicopters and vertical or unexpected movements. </p>
<p>The motor cars are 1926 models or earlier. I do not think there 
is a single new idea, a single instance of artistic creation or even intelligent 
anticipation, from first to last in the whole pretentious stew; I may have 
missed some point of novelty, but I doubt it; and this, though it must bore the 
intelligent man in the audience, makes the film all the more convenient as a 
gauge of the circle of ideas, the mentality, from which it has proceeded.</p>
<p>The word Metropolis, says the advertisement in English, 'is
in itself symbolic of greatness'- which only shows us how wise it is to consult
a dictionary before making assertions about the meaning of words.  </p>
<p>Probably it
was the adapter who made that shot. The German 'Neubabelsburg' was better, and
could have been rendered 'New Babel'. It is a city, we are told, of 'about one
hundred years hence.' It is represented as being enormously high; and all the
air and happiness are above and the workers live, as the servile toilers in the
blue uniform in The Sleeper Awakes lived, down, down, down below.</p>
<p>Now far away in the dear old 1897 it may have been excusable
to symbolize social relations in this way, but that was thirty years ago, and a
lot of thinking and some experience intervene.  </p>
<p>That vertical city of the future
we know now is, to put it mildly, highly improbable. Even in New York and
Chicago, where the pressure on the central sites is exceptionally great, it is
only the central office and entertainment region that soars and excavates. And
the same centripetal pressure that leads to the utmost exploitation of site
values at the centre leads also to the driving out of industrialism and labour
from the population center to cheaper areas, and of residential life to more
open and airy surroundings. That was all discussed and written about before
1900. Somewhere about 1930 the geniuses of Ufa studios will come up to a book of
Anticipations which was written more than a quarter of a century ago. The
British census returns of 1901 proved clearly that city populations were
becoming centrifugal, and that every increase in horizontal traffic facilities
produced a further distribution. This vertical social stratification is stale
old stuff. So far from being 'a hundred years hence,' Metropolis, in its forms
and shapes, is already, as a possibility, a third of a century out of date.</p>
<p>But its form is the least part of its staleness. This great
city is supposed to be evoked by a single dominating personality. The English
version calls him John Masterman, so that there may be no mistake about his
quality. Very unwisely he has called his son Eric, instead of sticking to good
hard John, and so relaxed the strain. He works with an inventor, one Rotwang,
and they make machines. There are a certain number of other people, and the
'sons of the rich' are seen disporting themselves, with underclad ladies in a
sort of joy conservatory, rather like the 'winter garden' of an enterprising
1890 hotel during an orgy. The rest of the population is in a state of abject
slavery, working in 'shifts' of ten hours in some mysteriously divided
twenty-four hours, and with no money to spend or property or freedom. The
machines make wealth. How, is not stated. We are shown rows of motor cars all
exactly alike; but the workers cannot own these, and no 'sons of the rich'
would. Even the middle classes nowadays want a car with personality. Probably
Masterman makes these cars in endless series to amuse himself.</p>
              <p><span face="Times New Roman"><img src="https://erkelzaar.tsudao.com/reviews/metro50.jpg" width="254" height="430"></span>One 
                is asked to believe that these machines are engaged quite furiously 
                in the mass production of nothing that is ever used, and that 
                Masterman grows richer and richer in the process. This is the 
                essential nonsense of it all. Unless the mass of the population 
                has the spending power there is no possibility of wealth in a 
                mechanical civilization. A vast, penniless slave population may 
                be necessary for wealth where there are no mass production machines, 
                but it is preposterous with mass production machines. You find 
                such a real proletariat in China still; it existed in the great 
                cities of the ancient world; but you do not find it in America, 
                which has gone furtherest in the direction of mechanical industry, 
                and there is no grain of reason in supposing it will exist in 
                the future. Masterman's watchword is 'Efficiency,' and you are 
                given to understand it is a very dreadful word, and the contrivers 
                of this idiotic spectacle are so hopelessly ignorant of all the 
                work that has been done upon industrial efficiency that they represent 
                him as working his machine-minders to the point of exhaustion, 
                so that they faint and machines explode and people are scalded 
                to death. You get machine-minders in torment turning levers in 
                response to signals - work that could be done far more effectively 
                by automata. Much stress is laid on the fact that the workers 
                are spiritless, hopeless drudges, working reluctantly and mechanically. 
                But a mechanical civilization has no use for mere drudges; the 
                more efficient its machinery the less need there is for the quasi-mechanical 
                minder. It is the inefficient factory that needs slaves; the ill-organized 
                mine that kills men. The hopeless drudge stage of human labour 
                lies behind us. With a sort of malignant stupidity this film contradicts 
                these facts.</p>
<p>The current tendency of economic life is to oust the mere
drudge altogether, to replace much highly skilled manual work by exquisite
machinery in skilled hands, and to increase the relative proportion of
semi-skilled, moderately versatile and fairly comfortable workers. It may indeed
create temporary masses of unemployed, and in The Sleeper Awakes there was a
mass of unemployed people under the hatches. That was written in 1897, when the
possibility of restraining the growth of large masses of population had scarcely
dawned on the world. It was reasonable then to anticipate an embarrassing
underworld of under-productive people. We did not know what to do with the
abyss. But there is no excuse for that today. And what this film anticipates is
not unemployment, but drudge employment, which is precisely what is passing
away. Its fabricators have not even realized that the machine ousts the drudge.</p>
<p>'Efficiency' means large-scale productions, machinery as
fully developed as possible, and <i>high</i> <i>wages</i>. The British
Government delegation sent to study success in America has reported unanimously
to that effect. The increasingly efficient industrialism of America has so
little need of drudges that it has set up the severest barriers against the
flooding of the United States by drudge immigration. 'Ufa' knows nothing of such
facts.</p>
<p>A young woman appears from nowhere in particular to 'help'
these drudges; she impinges upon Masterman's son Eric, and they go to the
'Catacombs,' which, in spite of the gas mains, steam mains, cables, and
drainage, have somehow contrived to get over from Rome, skeletons and all, and
burrow under this city of Metropolis. She conducts a sort of Christian worship
in these unaccountable caverns, and the drudges love and trust her. With a nice
sense of fitness she lights herself about the Catacombs with a torch instead of
the electric lamps that are now so common.</p>
<p>That reversion to torches is quite typical …</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></div></div>

November 30, 2020 | https://filipnikolovski.com/posts/ebpf/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://filipnikolovski.com/posts/ebpf/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was doing some research at work for tracing and observability for microservices, when I came across <a href="https://pixielabs.ai/">Pixielabs</a>. This tool advertises that you can instantly troubleshoot applications without any instrumentation or special code inside the apps, which sounded ✨magical✨ to me. So naturally I wanted to know a little more about what enables this technology to work, and after scrolling through the site, under the “No Instrumentation” section was this acronym <strong>eBPF</strong>.</p><p>After some further digging on the internet, reading the <a href="https://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.pdf">design papers</a> and watching several videos, it was safe to say this technology caught my attention, so I wanted to write some notes on it and I hope this post will spark some further interest in you as well.</p><h2 id="so-what-is-ebpf-exactly">So what is eBPF exactly?</h2><p>The TL;DR version is that this technology enables sandboxed user space applications to run in the Linux kernel itself. In a way it makes the kernel <em>programmable</em> which unlocks tremendous possibilities.</p><p>You can pick <strong>any function</strong> from the kernel and execute the program every time that function runs. Running a program that “attaches” to network sockets, tracepoints and perf events can be extremely useful. Developers can debug the kernel without having to re-compile it. There are plenty of use cases such as:</p><ul><li>Application performance &amp; troubleshooting</li><li>Networking &amp; security</li><li>Runtime security</li><li>Application tracing</li><li>Observability</li></ul><p>That’s what enables tools like Pixie to do blackbox analysis, without requiring any tinkering inside the applications that we’re trying to debug.</p><p>Originally BPF was <a href="https://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.pdf">designed</a> for capturing and filtering network packets that matched specific rules, discarding any unwanted packets. That’s why it was called the “Berkeley Packet Filter”. If you’ve ever used <strong>tcpdump</strong> you’ve probably already used it. Nowadays eBPF can be used for many different things and not just packet filtering but the name stuck for some reason.</p><p>This architecture of network monitoring was vastly superior to the current existing packet capture technologies in terms of performance, mainly because the filtering was done in the kernel instead of copying all of the packets in user space and doing
the calculations there. But with the advancement of processors it didn’t hold up so well with it’s initial design. That’s why the <strong>extended BPF</strong> (eBPF) design was introduced, to take advantage of the modern processing power.</p><p>Initially eBPF was to be also used as a network packet filtering solution, but the ability to run user-space programs inside the kernel proved to be very powerful. The new design extended what the BPF virtual machine could do, which was to allow it to run on all kinds of events, not just packets, and also do certain actions instead of just the ability to filter things.</p><h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2><p>An eBPF program is just a sequence of 64-bit instructions. The virtual machine’s instruction set is fairly limited and it has two goals in mind:</p><ol><li>The code needs to be executed as fast as possible.</li><li>All BPF instructions must be verifiable at load time to ensure the safety of the kernel.</li></ol><p>Okay so, eBPF code is run in a safe virtual machine inside the kernel. Writing these programs is done with the help of some frameworks (like <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc">bcc</a> and <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace">bpftrace</a>) and the program bytecode is then loaded via the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bpf.2.html"><code>bpf</code></a> system call.</p><p>To nullify the security and stability risks when running a user space program inside the kernel, several checks are performed
to ensure that the code we run is safe and that it terminates so our computer won’t freeze up.</p><p>Firstly, to even be able to run a user program which loads eBPF code, it needs root privileges to do so, unless unprivileged eBPF is enabled, in which case the process can load a program with a reduced functionality. Secondly, there’s the eBPF verifier which all eBPF programs must go through before they can be executed.</p><p>The verifier runs several checks on the code that safeguards the kernel. The first check ensures that any unbounded
loops which could freeze up the kernel are prohibited. The second check, which is more extensive, simulates the execution of the code making sure that all paths of the code run to completion, no out of bounds memory is accessed and overall the state of the virtual machine is valid.</p><p>The last step of the verification process involves restricting the eBPF program abilities, which kernel functions are callable and which data it can access. The verifier knows how to apply those restrictions because of the <strong>program type</strong>. The program type is determined when we associate the program with a certain event.</p><p>After the verification process is done, the BPF bytecode is then interpreted, or compiled by a JIT compiler, into native instructions that run efficiently whenever an event happens in the kernel.</p><h2 id="kprobes--uprobes">kprobes &amp; uprobes</h2><p>We can create and insert kernel probes or kprobes for short to virtually any function in the kernel, and attach an eBPF program so that it executes each time that function is invoked.</p><p>Here’s a simple hello world example from the <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/tree/master/examples">bcc</a> repository:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> bcc <span>import</span> BPF
<span>from</span> bcc.utils <span>import</span> printb
<span># define BPF program</span>

</code></pre></div><p>The eBPF program is written in a pseudo-C code and it’s placed in the variable <code>prog</code> as a string. The bcc framework does all the heavy lifting of generating the bytecode, loading the programs and all that stuff, which makes writing these programs a bit easier.</p><p>In this example, the hello function invokes a bpf helper function called <code>bpf_trace_printk</code> which outputs a “Hello, World!” trace. Then we load the program and we attach a kernel probe for the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html"><code>clone</code></a> event, basically saying that we want to call the <code>hello</code> program each time <code>clone</code> is called.</p><p>After that the script waits for new traces to arrive, fetches the fields and prints the values to the screen.</p><p>Let’s try running it:</p><pre><code>$ sudo python3 hello-ebpf.py
TIME(s)            COMM             PID    MESSAGE
</code></pre><p>The script has successfully loaded the program and now we wait for the traces to arrive. The next thing to do is to try and invoke the <code>clone</code> syscall. We can run any command on the terminal, such as <code>ls</code> and a child process will be created. Since I had firefox running, it created some child processes in the meantime and traces started to show up:</p><pre><code>611.247475000      firefox          5378   Hello, World!
</code></pre><p>As we can see, the message “Hello, World!” is printed on the screen along with the other trace fields. Super cool!</p><p>Besides attaching to kernel functions, we could also observe functions invoked in user space, such as <strong>malloc</strong> or <strong>strlen</strong>. This is possible via another Linux kernel feature - <strong>uprobes</strong>.</p><p>Here’s an interesting script that counts frequencies of strings by tracing strlen() and using a hash map to store the strings along with the count of their recurrence: <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/examples/tracing/strlen_count.py">https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/examples/tracing/strlen_count.py</a></p><h2 id="helper-functions">helper functions</h2><p>Since arbitrary kernel functions are prohibited to be called by ebpf programs, there are several helper functions which the kernel provides for us, such as the <code>bpf_trace_printk</code> function. We can use them to:</p><ul><li>Get the current time</li><li>Interact with eBPF maps</li><li>Manipulate network packets</li><li>Print debugging messages</li></ul><p>Note that each program can only use a subset of these helpers because of the different contexts the programs can run in. Here’s the extensive <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/bpf-helpers.7.html">list</a> of bpf helpers.</p><h2 id="map-storage">map storage</h2><p>To write more complicated programs you’ll need some type of data store, and that is where <strong>maps</strong> come in. They are an important part of the BPF internal system, which allows programs to store information that can be accessed from userspace.</p><p>BPF supports different <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/docs/reference_guide.md#maps">types</a> of data stores - you can use a hash map, an array, or even a stack or a queue, depending on the use case of course.</p><h2 id="conclusion">conclusion</h2><p>eBPF opens up all kinds of possibilities for observability. You can treat a system as a blackbox, without really knowing anything about it, and run all kinds of interesting analysis: count the most frequently called functions, trace network packets, do performance tracing and debugging, etc.</p><p>There are a myriad of tools that you can use to observe every component of the system: the CPU, memory, file system, networking, containers, applications…</p><figure><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b19abde4b1ccfe4ce140969c8bf44f39d1c2fe70/f9ed3/images/ebpf/bcc_tracing_tools_early2019.png" alt="ebpf-tracing-tools"><figcaption>BCC performance tools (courtesy of Brendan Gregg)</figcaption></figure><p>I’ve only scratched the surface on this subject and I can’t wait to learn more about it, as well as Linux performance in general.

<p>net.art is artwork that is made for the internet. It is handcrafted and the results <em>happen</em> in cyberspace, an ephemeral place between machines.</p>

<p>Gallery 404 collects and displays hyperlinks to prominent net.art artworks on the world wide web. These links point to a place where net.art <em>happened</em>. The links are displayed along side of more traditional media: written biographical information and images of the artwork’s current state.</p>
<p>The holdings of Gallery 404 no longer function as the artists originally intended.<span><label for="sn-0"></label><span>The exception being Jodi’s <a href="http://asdfg.jodi.org/"><em>ASDFG.JODI.ORG</em></a> on the front page of Gallery 404. Ironically, <em>ASDFG.JODI.ORG</em> <a href="https://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110711192514AApmy6v">seems to be broken</a> even when functioning properly.</span></span> Each artwork has yielded to the passing of time. But like all things computable, the passing of time happens faster in a computer. Some of these works are less than a decade old.</p>
<p>Gallery 404 is net.art today. Much of what was created by the first generation of digital natives is now broken. While some works of net.art have benefited from institutional preservation, even these are vulnerable to software updates, infrastructure changes, and negligence.<span><label for="sn-1"></label><span>The Whitney’s <a href="https://whitney.org/artport/douglas-davis">2013 restoration</a> of <em>The World’s First Collaborative Sentence</em> (Douglas Davis 1994) is probably the most salient example. As of 2020, it no longer functions properly.</span></span> As software eats the world, it also consumes itself.</p>

<p>net.art is a peculiar art form. Its growth paralleled the emergence of the commercial internet. The lack of a formal language or framing device made the work difficult to spot; “art” websites and “non-art” websites looked similar. There were few celebrity practitioners and virtually no exhibition spaces.</p>
<p>The movement liberated artists and audiences from Duchamp-style Modernism. This movement was crystallized when Marcel Duchamp submitted <em>Fountain</em>, a urinal bought at a hardware store in Manhattan, to the Society of Independent Artists exhibit in 1917.<span><label for="sn-2"></label><span><img src="https://schmud.de/img/2020-30-11-gallery-404/fountain-duchamp-1977.jpg" alt="Marcel Duchamp ‘Fountain’ (1917)"> Marcel Duchamp <em>Fountain</em> (1917), photograph by Alfred Stieglitz at 291 art gallery following the 1917 Society of Independent Artists exhibit, with entry tag visible via <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=74693078">Wikipedia</a>. <i></i></span></span> <em>Fountain</em> brought the power of art-signifying frames to the forefront: “this urinal is art because it is being exhibited as art.”</p>
<p>net.art lacked the equivalent to trendy exhibition spaces, deliberate lighting, and expensive picture frames. The blurred boundaries were reflected in pieces such as <a href="https://sites.rhizome.org/anthology/airworld.html">Airworld</a> and website awards like Alexei Shulgin’s <a href="http://www.easylife.org/award/">WWWART MEDAL</a>, which presented “non-art” websites awards for providing a “definite ‘art’ feeling.”<span><label for="sn-3"></label><span>Source: Kenta Murakami, “<a href="https://www.digitalamerica.org/the-demise-of-net-art-a-look-at-artifacts-past-kenta-murakami/">The Demise Of Net.Art: A Look At Artifacts Past</a>”, <em>Digital America</em>, 2013.</span></span></p>
<p>While much has been written on how the “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/25/magazine/25privacy-t2.html">internet never forgets</a>”, much of what has been made has disappeared from neglect or deliberate corporate purging. This includes countless websites, Flickr (2019), and Tumblr (2018) accounts, all of Google+ (2019), all of Geocities (2009), and 50 million songs by 14 million artists on MySpace (2003-2015).<span><label for="sn-4"></label><span>This is in spite of the best efforts of the <a href="http://archiveteam.org/">Archive Team</a>, the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a>, and similar initiatives around the world.

<p>net.art is a generation’s attempt to place a cultural stake in cyberspace. It is the reflection of what the internet was and could be. But the cultural artifacts of the first digital natives are quickly being lost to time. Gallery 404 presents this broken history in its unvarnished reality.</p>

<ul>
<li>30 August 1969: the ARPANET, an early <strong>military computer network</strong>, comes online in the United States. The network is used to coordinate information and share computing resources.</li>
<li>15 July 1980: Minitel, a popular <strong>public computer network</strong>, comes online in France. This network is used to provide online services to the <strong>general public</strong>.</li>
<li>1 January 1983: the ARPANET adopts TCP/IP, the fundamental protocol of today’s <strong>internet</strong>. The usage of the internet expands to fulfill many <strong>governmental and academic interests</strong>.</li>
<li>12 March 1989: Tim Berners-Lee proposes the <strong>world wide web</strong> (www) in <em>Information Management, a Proposal</em>.</li>
<li>6 August 1991: Tim Berners-Lee publishes the first <strong>website</strong> on the <strong>internet</strong>.</li>
<li>2 October 1992: the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/102nd-congress/senate-bill/1146">Scientific and Advanced-Technology Act</a> is passed, allowing the US taxpayer-funded internet backbone (NSFNET) to “be used substantially for additional purposes” <strong>beyond research and education</strong> (i.e.&nbsp;commercial use).</li>
<li>April 1995: the <strong>world wide web becomes the most popular service</strong> on the internet backbone (NSFNET).</li>
<li>30 April 1995: the public internet backbone (NSFNET) is officially decommissioned, marking the birth of today’s <strong>commercial internet</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>net.art arrives in the early 1990s, after the invention of the world wide web and the legislative move to open the internet up for “additional purposes.” Artists immediately created work that reflected the cultural milieu of the time. For example, the internet started to shift from interoperable public spaces to siloed corporate spaces by the turn of the millennium. Concerns about the corporatization of the internet are reflected in prominent net.art artworks like <a href="http://history.etoy.com/stories/entries/49/index.html">Toywar</a> (1999) and the aforementioned <a href="https://sites.rhizome.org/anthology/airworld.html">Airworld</a> (1999).</p>
<p>It can be difficult to see a technology’s implicit political bias decades removed from its use. Today’s centralized algorithms for search (Google) and social (Facebook) are fundamentally different than yesterday’s homespun <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring">webring</a>. Cultural artifacts are the best evidence of what kind of internet is not only possible, but just as plausible.</p>

<p>In the intensive care unit, patients receive treatment and therapies to prevent them from immediately dying. It’s not pleasant, but it’s true. You don’t want to come see us. </p>



<p>We see the signs and messages. “Thank you, Frontline Workers!” Honestly, it’s confusing. We aren’t your frontline. We are your last resort. And, after eight months, we are tired. Nurses are <a href="https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1513/AnnalsATS.201804-269PS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">burnt out</a>. Some organizations <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2516043520957565" target="_blank">did not take care of their employees</a> well when COVID hit. Many nurses are leaving their jobs. Most units are experiencing staffing crises. There just simply aren’t enough nurses to take care of all of you. You don’t want to visit the ICU during normal circumstances. You certainly don’t want to be a patient in one now.</p>



<p>ICU beds usually run at about 70-80% capacity. It’s a sweet spot where the unit can function from an operational standpoint while still having bed availability for emergencies or cyclical unit flow. With the first wave of COVID, some ICUs were operating at 200-300% capacity. The bed crisis in itself wasn’t a huge one. A bed is a bed is a bed. Organizations simply <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://sccm.org/Blog/March-2020/United-States-Resource-Availability-for-COVID-19" target="_blank">opened more ICUs</a> in other areas of the hospital. It wasn’t pretty or comfortable, but it worked.</p>



<p>The real crisis came with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/19/covid19-hospitals-in-half-the-states-facing-massive-staffing-shortage/" target="_blank">staff</a>. Who was going to take care of all of these extra patients? Organizations employed many strategies. Nurses managed ICU patients <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aacnjournals.org/ccnonline/article/40/4/25/31008/Answering-the-Call-Impact-of-Tele-ICU-Nurses" target="_blank">remotely,</a> sometimes from other states. Hospitals sought help from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://khn.org/news/highly-paid-traveling-nurses-fill-staffing-shortages-during-covid-pandemic/" target="_blank">staffing agencies</a> and per diem staff. Non-ICU nurses were quickly “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://rcni.com/nursing-standard/careers/career-advice/covid-19-what-to-expect-if-you-are-deployed-to-a-critical-care-setting-159646" target="_blank">upskilled</a>” to the critical care setting. In short, an already precarious situation just became even more dangerous.</p>



<p>Nurses new to the ICU setting usually go through an intense training program which includes classroom and clinical experience and ranges from three to six months in length. Upon completion of this program, they are still novice nurses and rely on their <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://healthresearchfunding.org/patricia-benner-novice-to-expert-nursing-theory-explained/" target="_blank">expert</a> colleagues for mentoring and guidance. As crucial as upskilled nurses are, they are still short on education, knowledge, and experience. In our current climate, nurses are working in unfamiliar environments, with a team they don’t know, with fewer resources, fewer experienced staff, and with higher staffing ratios. All of this can and will lead to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://psnet.ahrq.gov/primer/nursing-and-patient-safety" target="_blank">unfavorable outcomes</a>.</p>



<p>COVID has now been around long enough that we are somewhat in a clinical routine. The patient H&amp;P’s (history and physical) are eerily similar. “Patient attended a family birthday party.” “Patient attended weekly bowling league.” “Masks were not worn.” “Attendees did not appropriately socially distance.” By the time the patient gets to us, they are in bad shape. </p>



<p>They can not breathe without the help of a ventilator. Breathing on a ventilator is very uncomfortable and unnatural. Lung injury in COVID is so profound that patients usually require the most extreme settings, which require heavy sedation and paralytics. If the patient still isn’t ventilating adequately, we will <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjKpvGr4KntAhUo2FkKHR_-DwoQFjAAegQIAhAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fjamanetwork.com%2Fjournals%2Fjama%2Ffullarticle%2F2769872&amp;usg=AOvVaw2mk45rzzxRWxBCOd7Thav5" target="_blank">prone</a> them.

If their blood pressure goes too low, we will put them on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi-gJXp4KntAhUQjlkKHaSGCkcQFjABegQIBhAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov%2Fcritical-care%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw2cx171K92Nstkro2zgq9CE" target="_blank">continuous medication</a> to sustain life. If they spike an uncontrollable fever, we will put them on an ice blanket. We will bring iPads into the room and update families on the phone. The patient will be alone.</p>



<p>All of this will either work, or it won’t. The average ICU length of stay is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://journals.lww.com/healthcaremanagerjournal/Abstract/2014/04000/Reduction_of_Intensive_Care_Unit_Length_of_Stay_.5.aspx#:~:text=The%20average%20ICU%20length%20of%20stay%20%28LOS%29%20is,an%20additional%201.5%20days%20in%20a%20non-ICU%20bed" target="_blank">3.3 days</a>. The average ICU length of stay with COVID is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-020-01726-3" target="_blank">19 days</a>. Prior to COVID, over half of ICU patients experienced <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.posticu.org/" target="_blank">post intensive care syndrome (PICS)</a> after their discharge. This syndrome includes depression, anxiety, and cognitive deficits, sometimes limiting their ability to work or care for themselves. The after-effects of an ICU admission with COVID have not yet been studied. Those who don’t get better, will die. In high-surge states, their body will be moved to a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20201104/el-paso-gets-4th-mobile-morgue-as-deaths-surge" target="_blank">mobile morgue</a> because the hospital morgue has reached capacity. Families will be urged not to gather for a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-rites-insight-idUSKBN2161ZM" target="_blank">funeral</a>. </p>



<p>This grim reality is not your frontline. Your frontline is:</p>



<p>Staying home<br>Social distancing<br>Mask wearing<br>Hand washing</p>



<p>If not for you, for your neighbor.</p>



<p>Stop calling us frontline. We are your last resort.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Let's talk about objects in functional languages.</p>

<p>This could be a sticking point, so I'll get this out of the way up-front: I find arguments over whether such-and-such a thing is “really” functional or “really” imperative or “really” object-oriented to be for the most part frustrating and useless. A lot of these arguments boil down to value judgments in disguise (a thing I've touched on in the past when <a href="https://journal.infinitenegativeutility.com/proofs-and-programs-and-rhetoric" rel="nofollow">talking about the rhetorical emphasis placed on math in programming</a>) and many of the rest turn out to be based on informal definitions where 'functional' means 'like my favorite or first functional language'.<sup id="fnref:samp"><a href="#fn:samp" rel="nofollow">1</a></sup> I prefer to think about these concept less in terms of necessary criteria and hard lines, and more in terms of influence and approach and focus.</p>

<p>The paper <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~wcook/Drafts/2009/essay.pdf" rel="nofollow"><em>On Understanding Data Abstraction Revisited</em> by William Cook</a> (itself a paper that revisits <a href="http://lucacardelli.name/Papers/OnUnderstanding.A4.pdf" rel="nofollow"><em>On understanding data types, data abstraction, and polymorphism</em> by Luca Cardelli and Peter Wegner</a>) lays out simple definitions of the often-used concepts of “abstract data type” and “object”. His definition of “object” is, of course, not the only one, but I think it's a useful one. Importantly, Cook's definition is based on abstract criteria that can apply even when the language itself does not have an explicit concept of an “object”. To emphasize this, I'm going to use Haskell in this blog post to demonstrate a pure functional variation on “object-oriented programming”<sup id="fnref:lang"><a href="#fn:lang" rel="nofollow">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Beyond being a useful definition, Cook's formulation is also a valuable design pattern, one which has both advantages and disadvantages when designing programs. Consequently, the goal of this blog post is twofold: first, to show how “objects” can (under some definition) exist in a language like Haskell which has no built-in notion of “object-oriented programming”, and secondly, to show the advantages and disadvantages of code written in this style.</p>



<p>Cook's definition of an <em>abstract data type</em> is a type that</p>

<blockquote><p>[…] has a public name, a hidden representation, and operations to create, combine, and observe values of the abstraction.</p></blockquote>

<p>To use a simplified version of his example, here's a (not terribly efficient) way of defining a “set of integers” in Haskell as an abstract data type. In this case, we've got an <code>IntSet</code> type whose representation can be easily hidden, because the operations that a consumer of this library cares about about have been defined in terms of that abstract representation.</p>

<pre><code>-- we'll export `IntSet` but not the constructors
data IntSet
  = SetEmpty
  | SetInsert Int IntSet

empty :: IntSet
empty = SetEmpty

isEmpty :: IntSet -&gt; Bool
isEmpty SetEmpty = True
isEmpty _ = False

insert :: Int -&gt; IntSet -&gt; IntSet
insert x set
  | contains set x = set
  | otherwise = SetInsert x set

contains :: IntSet -&gt; Int -&gt; Bool
contains SetEmpty x = False
contains (SetInsert y rest) x
  | x == y = True
  | otherwise = contains rest x
</code></pre>

<p>This is probably not a terribly controversial definition or design: it's a pretty typical one for most functional languages! …well, it might be controversial to <em>use</em> since it's got awful algorithmic performance, but it's fairly unobjectionable as a teaching tool, at least.</p>

<p>What would a user see when looking at the documentation for this module? Since we're not exporting the constructors for <code>IntSet</code>, it'll look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>data IntSet
empty :: IntSet
isEmpty :: IntSet -&gt; Bool
insert :: Int -&gt; IntSet -&gt; IntSet
contains :: Int -&gt; IntSet -&gt; Bool
</code></pre>

<p>The ability to hide the definition of <code>IntSet</code> is the thing that makes this an abstract data type. A user of the library doesn't care—and ideally doesn't <em>need</em> to care—what constructors hide behind that <code>IntSet</code>.</p>



<p>Cook then goes on to describe “objects”. Here's another (equally inefficient) implementation of <code>IntSet</code>, which I'll define as <code>OIntSet</code> so I can easily refer to both:</p>

<pre><code>data OIntSet = OIntSet
  { oIsEmpty :: Bool
  , oContains :: Int -&gt; Bool
  }

oEmpty :: OIntSet
oEmpty = OIntSet
  { oIsEmpty = True
  , oContains = \_ -&gt; False
  }

oInsert :: Int -&gt; OIntSet -&gt; OIntSet
oInsert x set
  | oContains set x = set
  | otherwise = OIntSet
      { oIsEmpty = False
      , oContains = \i -&gt; i == x || oContains set i
      }
</code></pre>

<p>It's possible that we can choose our export list carefully so that this implementation of <code>OIntSet</code> reveals the exact same set of operations as the previous one. However, there's a major difference here: <code>OIntSet</code> is not actually hiding a specific type. Instead, it just bundles the relevant set of operations inside of a record of functions, which acts like an interface type. In both the ADT-based approach and the “object”-based approach, a user does not know about the internal representation of <code>OIntSet</code>, but in the ADT approach, this is because there exists a single representation which is non-public, while in the “object”-based approach, there may be multiple separate implementations that are indistinguishable.</p>



<p>An “object”-like representation allows for a vast amount of flexibility. Because a consumer of an <code>OIntSet</code> can use any value as long as the value has provided implementations of the relevant “methods”, we can easily and conveniently define new instances of <code>OIntSet</code> that have radically different internal representations. For example, we can define infinite sets that use simple numerical computations to define their <code>oContains</code> method, like this set of all even numbers:</p>

<pre><code>oEvenNumbers :: OIntSet
oEvenNumbers = OIntSet
  { oIsEmpty = False
  , oContains = \i -&gt; i `mod` 2 == 0
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Or we could construct <code>OIntSet</code> values that use a different data representation, such as a list, to store the members of the set:</p>

<pre><code>oFromList :: [Int] -&gt; OIntSet
oFromList list = OIntSet
  { oIsEmpty = null list
  , oContains = \i -&gt; i `elem` list
  }
</code></pre>

<p>But even though these <code>OIntSet</code> definitions use different underlying data representations, they expose the same interface, so we can use the same operations to manipulate them. For example, we can define an <code>oUnion</code> operation which computes the union of two <code>OIntSet</code> objects, since that operation is easily expressible in terms of <code>oIsEmpty</code> and <code>oContains</code>:</p>

<pre><code>oUnion :: OIntSet -&gt; OIntSet -&gt; OIntSet
oUnion set set' = OIntSet
  { oIsEmpty = oIsEmpty set &amp;&amp; oIsEmpty set'
  , oContains = \i -&gt; oContains set i || oContains set' i
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Our <code>oUnion</code> operation—indeed, any operation we define—can work on any two <code>OIntSet</code>s even if they have wildly different internal representations. We can even use this to combine all of our previously-defined <code>OIntSet</code> constructors into one expression, to create a set that uses a combination of Haskell lists, numeric predicates, and closures to represent a set:</p>

<pre><code>sample :: OIntSet
sample = oInsert 1 oEvenNumbers `oUnion` oFromList [10..20]
</code></pre>

<p>This is a very convenient way of building certain abstractions. By building around external interfaces, you can include varying data representations that easily work together.</p>

<p>This example is clearly a little bit contrived, so it's probably worth giving some other “real-world” examples where this design approach is useful. Object-oriented programming is generally cited as a good fit for a particular style of user interface programming, because it allows you to define classes of “widgets” that expose a common interface but have different internal representations. You could build a Haskell GUI library in this style by defining <code>Widgets</code> as “objects” with a common interface, something like this:</p>

<pre><code>data Widget = Widget
  { drawWidget :: Ctx -&gt; Position -&gt; IO ()
  , handleEvent :: Event -&gt; IO ()
  }
</code></pre>

<p>This is similar to the approach taken by the <a href="https://github.com/jtdaugherty/brick/" rel="nofollow">Brick TUI library</a>, which has <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/brick-0.54/docs/Brick-Types.html#t:Widget" rel="nofollow">its own <code>Widget</code> record</a>.</p>



<p>One major concern with this style of data representation is performance and optimization. Consider our original ADT representation for <code>IntSet</code>: it's inefficient, yes, but we can make it more efficient in a number of ways. For example, we could modify it so that, instead of always inserting new elements “at the front”, we can instead insert them in such a way that the internal representation of the set is always sorted lowest-to-highest. This means that we may no longer have to traverse the entire list to check for element membership. Even better, we might swap out the list-like representation for a binary tree representation, maybe doing some rebalancing in certain cases.</p>

<p>There is no way <em>in general</em> to apply these optimizations to the <code>OIntSet</code>-style program. You could define an <code>OIntSet</code> that sits in front of a balanced tree and therefore has faster lookup and insertion, but once it's sitting behind the interface, you no longer have access to those internals. You cannot, for example, write an <code>oUnion</code> operation that rebalances the binary trees behind the two sets it's operating on: it doesn't even know if both sets <em>are</em> backed by trees!</p>

<p>In effect, the major selling point of the “object”-style design here is also a major downside: you don't have guarantees about the specific representation of data, which means your programs can easily mix-and-match different representations, but it also means that your program can't make use of representation-specific knowledge in ways that are advantageous.</p>

<p>There's another major concern as well, and that's that the specific choice of “object” representation can make a big difference in terms of what operations you can and cannot support. Look back at <code>OIntSet</code>—I was able to define <code>oUnion</code>, but what about <code>oIntersection</code>? It turns out that it's not actually possible using the specific representation I've chosen<sup id="fnref:perf"><a href="#fn:perf" rel="nofollow">3</a></sup>:</p>

<pre><code>oIntersection :: OIntSet -&gt; OIntSet -&gt; OIntSet
oIntersection set set' = OIntSet
  { oIsEmpty = {- ??? -}
  , oIntersection = \i -&gt; oContains set i &amp;&amp; oContains set' i
  }
</code></pre>

<p>How do I implement <code>oIsEmpty</code>? I might naïvely try to write the inverse of <code>oUnion</code> and define it as <code>oIsEmpty set || oIsEmpty set'</code>, but that's not at all what I want: the intersection of the set of even numbers and the set of odd numbers is an empty set, but neither the even nor the odd numbers are empty, so this would incorrectly compute their …</p></div></div>

    </span></p><p>This article presents an implementation of the Raft consensus protocol in Scala using ZIO. More specifically, it covers
the architecture of the project, leader election, and log replication. It assumes some prior distributed systems knowledge, eg what RPC is.
Full Code: <a href="https://github.com/ariskk/zio-raft">https://github.com/ariskk/zio-raft</a> </p><h3>Raft</h3><p><a href="https://raft.github.io/">Raft</a> is a consensus protocol.
It is the kind of algorithm systems use when multiple servers need to agree on a single value.
It is a coordination primitive often used in databases and other distributed systems.</p><p>A Raft cluster's lifecycle can be split into two distinct phases:</p><ul><li><strong>Leader Election</strong>: The cluster needs a leader to coordinate all reads and writes to guarantee correctness.
If no leader is present, the system cannot make progress.
Consequently, if no leader exists, Raft peers <strong>vote</strong> and try to elect one. The leader's <strong>term</strong> lasts for as long as the leader is alive and can
reach a majority of peers.</li><li><strong>Log Replication</strong>: When the leader is elected, a Raft cluster can accept commands.
Those commands are replicated by the leader to a majority of peers before returning successfully to a client.
Once a command is replicated to a majority, peers proceed to apply it to their state machines.</li></ul><p>The whole protocol is based on two simple RPC calls; or 4 different types of messages:</p><ul><li><code>VoteRequest</code>: If no leader is present, <strong>candidates</strong> emerge and broadcast a <code>VoteRequest</code>.</li><li><code>VoteResponse</code>: Peers respond to vote requests based on a set of rules.</li><li><code>AppendEntries</code>: The leader uses this message to replicate new log entries to followers. It is also used as a heartbeat.</li><li><code>AppendEntriesResponse</code>: Followers confirm replication of entries based on a set of rules.</li></ul><p>The above process supports linearizable semantics. From <a href="https://jepsen.io/consistency/models/linearizable">Jepsen</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Linearizability is one of the strongest single-object consistency models, and implies that every operation appears to take place atomically,
in some order, consistent with the real-time ordering of those operations: e.g.,
if operation A completes before operation B begins, then B should logically take effect after A.</p></blockquote><p>This is a strong consistency model. Linearizable systems cannot be totally available in the face of network partitions.
Raft is thus suitable for systems where consistency is critical; those usually provide coordination services to other systems.
Some well known systems using it are <a href="https://etcd.io/">etcd</a> and <a href="https://www.consul.io/">Consul</a>. </p><p>Digging more into the <a href="https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf">paper</a> is definitely worth it. </p><p>This post covers the following aspects:</p><ol><li>Architecture</li><li>Leader Election</li><li>Log Replication</li></ol><p>The implementation is using Scala and the fantastic concurrent programming library <a href="https://zio.dev/">ZIO</a>.

If you have feedback, please do <a href="https://twitter.com/ariskkol">reach out on Twitter</a>; I am looking for inspiration regarding the next steps.</p><p>Without further ado..</p><h3>1. Architecture</h3><p>The architecture of the Raft Server implementation is summarised in the following diagram:</p><p><span>

  <img alt="Raft Server" title="Raft Server" src="https://ariskk.com/static/e332d369be6f66aae7e3da60c0e07eb1/18e3b/raft-arch-2.jpg" srcset="https://ariskk.com/static/e332d369be6f66aae7e3da60c0e07eb1/46946/raft-arch-2.jpg 240w,https://ariskk.com/static/e332d369be6f66aae7e3da60c0e07eb1/55489/raft-arch-2.jpg 480w,https://ariskk.com/static/e332d369be6f66aae7e3da60c0e07eb1/18e3b/raft-arch-2.jpg 960w,https://ariskk.com/static/e332d369be6f66aae7e3da60c0e07eb1/60e21/raft-arch-2.jpg 1440w,https://ariskk.com/static/e332d369be6f66aae7e3da60c0e07eb1/69b48/raft-arch-2.jpg 1920w,https://ariskk.com/static/e332d369be6f66aae7e3da60c0e07eb1/3fbc6/raft-arch-2.jpg 2618w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" loading="lazy">
    </span></p><p>It contains the following components:  </p><ul><li>1.1. <a href="https://github.com/ariskk/zio-raft/blob/0.0.0/core/src/main/scala/com.ariskk.raft/Raft.scala"><strong>Raft Consensus Module</strong></a>: This is the core module. This is where state is kept and the consensus algorithm is implemented.
The Raft Consensus Module can be further broken down into sub-components:  <ul><li>1.1.1 <a href="https://github.com/ariskk/zio-raft/blob/0.0.0/core/src/main/scala/com.ariskk.raft/storage/Storage.scala"><strong>Storage</strong></a>: <strong>Durable</strong> storage needed by Raft.
It consists of a <strong>Log</strong> containing state machine commands from clients,
the current <em>term</em>, and the last known <em>vote</em> (more on the last two later). Two implementations are provided: a) <a href="https://github.com/ariskk/zio-raft/blob/0.0.0/rocksdb/src/main/scala/com.ariskk.raft.rocksdb/RocksDBStorage.scala">In-memory</a> for testing purposes
b) <a href="https://github.com/ariskk/zio-raft/blob/0.0.0/rocksdb/src/main/scala/com.ariskk.raft.rocksdb/RocksDBStorage.scala">RocksDB</a>.</li><li>1.1.2 <a href="https://github.com/ariskk/zio-raft/blob/0.0.0/core/src/main/scala/com.ariskk.raft/volatile/VolatileState.scala"><strong>Volatile State</strong></a>: Ephemeral state the module needs to function (eg the set of peers).
Access to its fields must be thread-safe and is implemented using ZIO's <code>Ref</code>.</li><li>1.1.3 <strong>Input/Output Message Queues</strong>: The implementation is fully asynchronous and decoupled from any flavour of RPC.
To communicate with the outside world (ie its peers), it uses a number of message queues. Those are implemented using ZIO's asynchronous <code>ZQueue</code>.</li><li>1.1.4 <strong>State Machine</strong>: This is where client commands are applied and it contains the state for which strong consistency is critical.</li></ul></li><li>1.2. <strong>Internode RPC</strong>: Manages network connections with peers in a Raft cluster. Sends and receives messages.  </li><li>1.3. <strong>API</strong>: Interfaces with clients. If the node is the leader, it accepts write commands and submits them to the consensus module for replication.
It also executes read-only queries against the state machine. If the node is not the leader, it redirects.  </li></ul><p><a href="https://github.com/ariskk/zio-raft/blob/0.0.0/server/src/main/scala/com.ariskk.raft.server/RaftServer.scala"><code>RaftServer.scala</code></a> brings all those together using <code>zio-nio</code>
to implement a very simple network layer.</p><p>Let's now see how those can be used for the two fundamental Raft functions: Leader Election and Log Replication.</p><h3>2. Leader Election</h3><p>A Raft node can be in <em>three</em> different states:</p><ul><li><code>Follower</code>: Responds to <code>VoteRequest</code> and <code>AppendEntries</code> messages.</li><li><code>Candidate</code>: Runs for leader. Sends out <code>VoteRequest</code> messages and collects responses.</li><li><code>Leader</code>: Receives commands from clients and sends <code>AppendEntries</code> messages to all followers.</li></ul><p>Those three states and their transitions are summarised in the following graph:</p><p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="Leader Election" title="Leader Election" src="https://ariskk.com/static/33e2e32630a9544644c4b92ddaab344e/18e3b/leaderelection.jpg" srcset="https://ariskk.com/static/33e2e32630a9544644c4b92ddaab344e/46946/leaderelection.jpg 240w,https://ariskk.com/static/33e2e32630a9544644c4b92ddaab344e/55489/leaderelection.jpg 480w,https://ariskk.com/static/33e2e32630a9544644c4b92ddaab344e/18e3b/leaderelection.jpg 960w,https://ariskk.com/static/33e2e32630a9544644c4b92ddaab344e/60e21/leaderelection.jpg 1440w,https://ariskk.com/static/33e2e32630a9544644c4b92ddaab344e/2ecca/leaderelection.jpg 1847w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" loading="lazy">
    </span></p><p>A Raft node starts in <code>Follower</code> state. If it doesn't hear from a leader for <em>a period of time</em>, it does the following:</p><ul><li>Becomes a <code>Candidate</code>.</li><li>Increases the term.</li><li>Votes for itself.</li><li>Sends out a <code>VoteRequest</code> to all known peers.</li><li>Collects responses. If the majority of requests are <em>granted</em>, it becomes <code>Leader</code> and sends out empty <code>AppendEntries</code> (aka heartbeats) every 50 milliseconds.
Else it becomes <code>Follower</code> and waits to hear from a leader for <em>a period of time</em>. This is repeated until a <code>Leader</code> emerges.</li></ul><p>This process could lead to a deadlock <em>if</em> this <em>period of time</em> was constant. To resolve this, Raft employs a <strong>randomised timer</strong>:</p><pre><code><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>final</span><span> </span><span>case</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>ElectionTimeout</span><span>(</span><span>millis: </span><span>Int</span><span>) </span><span>extends</span><span> </span><span>AnyVal</span><span>

</span><span>      </span><span>ElectionTimeout</span><span>(base + </span><span>Random</span><span>.nextInt(range))
</span>  }
<!-- -->
</code></pre><p>When a Raft node starts, and every time it receives an <code>AppendEntries</code> message from the leader, it starts a randomised timer between 150 and 300 milliseconds<sup>**</sup>.
If it receives a new <code>AppendEntries</code> message, the timer is reset to a new random value. If not, it kicks off a leader election.</p><sup>**</sup> This is config and depends on network latencies and other factors. If Raft is used for cross datacenter replication this likely needs to be higher.<p>This follower logic can be encoded in Scala as <a href="https://github.com/ariskk/zio-raft/blob/0.0.0/core/src/main/scala/com.ariskk.raft/Raft.scala#L298">following</a>:</p><pre><code><span>

<p>Thanks to Covid-19,&nbsp;<a href="https://ieee-iedm.org/">IEDM</a>&nbsp;goes virtual this year, over the weeks of December 5 – 18<sup>th</sup>. After scanning through the&nbsp;<a href="https://ieee-iedm.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/20-ap-11-25.pdf">advance program</a>, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://ieee-iedm.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IEDM-2020-tipsheet-of-technical-highlights-FINAL.pdf">tipsheet</a>, a couple of papers from Intel caught my eye, one on complementary stacked nanoribbon transistors, and the other detailing embedded DRAM using anti-ferroelectric (AFE) capacitors.</p>



<p>Starting with the nanoribbon paper:</p>



<p><strong>20.6 3-D Self-aligned Stacked NMOS-on-PMOS Nanoribbon Transistors for Continued Moore’s Law Scaling,&nbsp;</strong>Cheng-Ying Huang, et al.</p>



<p>There has been speculation that Intel’s 5-nm process will be their introduction of nanosheet/nanoribbon technology, but very few conference papers on the topic that I have seen&nbsp;have been published by Intel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A year ago Jim Keller, formerly of Intel, gave a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnl7--MvNAM">talk on Machine Learning</a>, and presented this device&nbsp;evolution,&nbsp;&nbsp;and it seems likely that this is what we could see in upcoming generations:</p>

<p>Looking at this, it’s tempting to think that the 7-nm node will have a 24-nm fin pitch, and the 5-nm will be the nanosheet (rather than nanowire) introduction. Paper 20.6 looks ahead to the stacked-nanoribbon phase:</p>



<p>“We demonstrate 3-D self-aligned stacked NMOS-on-PMOS multiple Si-nanoribbon transistors with successful integration of vertically-stacked dual source/drain and dual-metal-gate processes. Both NMOS and PMOS show high performance and superior short-channel control. A functional CMOS inverter is demonstrated with well-balanced voltage-transfer-characteristics. This novel transistor architecture is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;promising to continue Moore’s law scaling.”</p>



<p>A vertically stacked dual source/drain epitaxial process is used, together with dual metal gates, allowing P- and N-nanoribbons and Vt adjustments for both. This gives excellent electrostatics – subthreshold slope of &lt;75 mV/decade, and DIBL of &lt;30 mV/V for gates&nbsp;≥30 nm.&nbsp;Below we have a schematic of the inverter on the left, and on the top right a TEM cross-section of the gate with the P-epi ribbon below, and a blob of N-epi above. Bottom right is a linear section of the gate&nbsp;showing the N- and P- ribbons embedded within it.&nbsp;Gate length is 40 nm, and we can see that nanoribbon&nbsp;width is 13 nm, and I guesstimate&nbsp;~5 nm thick.</p>

<p>Note that the lower PMOS ribbons are left intact, but the top NMOS ribbons are removed except within the gate stack, then the N-epi is grown on the stubs of the channel ribbons. The dual work-function materials (WFMs) used requires the deposition of P-WFM and tungsten (W) first, then W back-etch to below the N-ribbons, leaving W covering the P-ribbons. Then the N-WFM layer is formed, followed by the final W deposition and CMP. With gate lengths of&nbsp;≥30 nm, there should be no problems with W gate fill.</p>



<p>Ideally, we would expect the PMOS ribbons to be SiGe for better mobility, but that would complicate the initial epi stack and the subsequent ribbon release, so here we have the straightforward approach of Si PMOS devices. Intel has another paper on SiGe PMOS nanosheets (<em>2.2 Gate-All-Around Strained Si<sub>0.4</sub>Ge<sub>0.6</sub>&nbsp;Nanosheet PMOS on Strain Relaxed Buffer for High Performance Low Power Logic Application, Ashish Agrawal, et al.</em>), as does IBM (<em>2.3 Stacked Gate-All-Around Nanosheet pFET with Highly Compressive Strained Si<sub>1-x</sub>Ge<sub>x</sub>&nbsp;Channel, Shogo Mochizuki, et al.</em>),&nbsp;but these will not be in complementary stacks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We will have to wait until the conference to see the performance characteristics, but this is an interesting proof-of-concept paper, and illustrates that there are still some stages to go before silicon technology runs out.</p>



<p>Now let’s look at the e-DRAM paper:</p>



<p><strong>28.1&nbsp;<a>Anti-ferroelectric</a>&nbsp;Hf<sub>x</sub>Zr<sub>1-x</sub>O<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;Capacitors for High-density 3-D Embedded-DRAM</strong>, Sou-Chi Chang, et al., Intel Corporation&nbsp;</p>



<p>Again, quoting the abstract:</p>



<p>“3-D anti-ferroelectric&nbsp;<a>Hf<sub>x</sub>Zr<sub>1-x</sub>O<sub>2</sub></a>&nbsp;capacitors are demonstrated for eDRAM by showing (i) 10ns read/write operations, (ii) maximum operating voltage less than 1.8V, (iii) retention much longer 1ms, and (iv) endurance reaching 10<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;cycles at 80C. Mechanisms behind endurance fatigue are discussed, and a novel architecture toward ultra-high density eDRAM is presented.”</p>



<p>This is not the first time that Intel have developed e-DRAM&nbsp;[1, 2], though that was actually in a separate&nbsp;die introduced with the Haswell processor back in 2014. It was used as a 128 MB L4 cache, with a die size of ~79 sq. mm, co-packaged with the CPU. It featured a COB (cell over bitline) stack, with MIM capacitors in the metal-dielectric stack using cavities formed in the lower metal level dielectrics, and was (is?) fabbed in Intel’s 9-metal, 22-nm process.</p>

The capacitor itself is above the transistor, so while it might be trench-shaped it is not a conventional trench capacitor (in the substrate, as used by IBM down to the 14-nm node).</p>



<p>The tungsten plug in the center of the capacitor is likely connected to the common plate, though that is not shown here. The shape of the gate indicates it is a finFET transistor, but I cannot see any fin, so maybe this sample was taken in a field region; actually a useful way of looking at structures like gate and capacitor stacks.</p>



<p>In the 1T-4C stack shown below, it looks as though the common plate has been moved to the outside of the capacitor, and we have four horizontal levels (PL1 – PL4) surrounding the individual inner node plates. The schematic indicates that the capacitors are laid out like a DRAM, with two capacitors connected through a pair of wordlines to a shared bitline. The capacitors have been divided into rows by isolation trenches, and the common plates are contacted via a staircase structure much like a 3D NAND&nbsp;stack.</p>

<p>We don’t know any of the dimensions of the cells here, but the ability to stack common plates has to give a significant density advantage. If the memory characteristics are good, and the density can exceed the&nbsp;~1.6 MB/mm<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;of the existing eDRAM, then we could see this in the not-too-distant future.</p>



<p>As we said in the introduction, IEDM will be virtual this year, and the schedule is quite different.

Audacious and comprehensive, antiracism swept through institutions with avenging fervor. But was antiracism the answer? Or does modern antiracism risk deferring the dream further still? </p><p>The dream of Dr. King, Bayard Rustin, Ella Baker and John Lewis that “this nation would one day rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed” was born of the philosophy of nonviolence. That is the dream America must reclaim.</p><p><strong>I grew up in the multicultural middle-class suburb</strong> of Culver City, California. My classmates were White, Jewish, Asian, Latino, Middle Eastern and Black. Being mixed Black and White myself, I more or less fell in with everyone. From elementary school to high school, I generally had the impression that Dr. King’s prophetic vision of a promised land of racial harmony had been achieved. My family was integrated; so was my school. I had friends of all races in a country where, 50 years earlier, we would not have been able to eat together at the same lunch counter. My life was proof that the dream had been fulfilled.</p><p>And for me, it has been. Some people will be upset to hear me say this. But I have not experienced racism in any way that has had a lasting impact on me. Yet I also know that the work of the nonviolent movement is incomplete.</p><p>I see this in two ways. First, the experiences of many in Black America are far from my own; this is a country where deep racial problems remain. Second, the substance of King’s teachings have not been adequately taught to Americans. The rise of antiracism—and the excesses of the modern social-justice movement—are a reflection of both facts. </p><p><strong>Ibram X. Kendi is 38, four years older than I am. </strong>Like most of our generation, Kendi learned of King as the pre-eminent figure in the recent history of American, and Black, social progress. That is probably why the young Ibram Rogers (his birth name) chose to speak as if in King’s voice during an oratorical contest as a high-school senior.</p><p>Kendi, probably America’s foremost proponent of antiracism, recounts this occasion in the introduction to his bestselling book <em>How to Be an Antiracist</em>. Kendi imitated the cadence of King’s “I Have a Dream” speech to deliver an address that chastised Black Americans for falling short of their potential. It is a moment Kendi recalls with shame: “I was a dupe, a chump who saw the ongoing struggles of Black people on MLK Day 2000 and decided that Black people themselves were the problem.”</p><p>Kendi moved from a repudiation of this early flirtation with a superficial sort of Black conservatism to a repudiation of the narrative of American racial progress following the Civil Rights movement—in other words, the narrative that I would long embrace, and that I still partially hold to.</p><p>That narrative of American racial history tells us that the major victories against racism in this country were won with the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act. It is a story that says the struggles of the Black community following Dr. King’s death are largely of our communities’ making, and are our responsibility. It is a telling that seizes upon the election of Barack Obama, America’s first Black (and mixed race) president, as the symbolic culmination of King’s integrationist dream.</p><p>For Ibram Kendi, Alicia Garza, Nikole Hannah-Jones and the leaders of the antiracist movement, this narrative is dangerous, weaponized in the form of a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/08/23/ibram-kendi-being-not-racist-doesnt-cut-it-he-insists-that-we-he-be-antiracist/">color-blind ideology</a> that obliterates the reality of Black experience and White supremacy. Antiracists agree that race is fundamentally a social construct yet antiracism insists on our racial categories, so that the racism in society is not overlooked.</p><p>As the post-racial commentator Thomas Chatterton-Williams told me in a recent conversation, “I just don’t see how you can hyper-focus on racial differences, and also believe that you’ll ever transcend them.” </p><p>For all of my own post-racial views, I wonder if the antiracist consensus has a point. There are realities of the American past and present that conspire to make life more difficult for African-Americans, and this bleeds into our psychology. Can we name these realities without naming race?</p><p>But even so, this does not negate the patriotic idealism of a young Senator Barack Obama. Nor does is it nullify the racially transcendent exhortations of Martin Luther King. For the power of nonviolence stems from principles that are deeper than race—principles that are indispensable for the future of social justice. King enumerated these in <em>Stride Toward Freedom:</em></p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Nonviolence is </strong><em><strong>humanizing</strong></em><strong>.</strong> It “does not seek to defeat or humiliate the opponent, but to win his friendship and understanding.”</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Nonviolence is </strong><em><strong>forgiving</strong></em><strong>.</strong> It is aimed “against forces of evil rather than against persons who happen to be doing the evil.”</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Nonviolence is </strong><em><strong>suffering. </strong></em>It requires a willingness to endure the assaults of opponents without returning in kind. King quoted Gandhi as saying, “Suffering is infinitely more powerful than the law of the jungle for converting the opponent and opening his ears which are otherwise shut to the voice of reason.”</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Nonviolence is </strong><em><strong>loving</strong></em><strong>.</strong> “The nonviolent resister not only refuses to shoot his opponent but he also refuses to hate him. At the center of nonviolence stands the principle of love.”</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Nonviolence is </strong><em><strong>active</strong></em><strong>.</strong> The practitioner is one whose “mind and emotions are always active, constantly seeking to persuade his opponent that he is wrong.”</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Nonviolence is </strong><em><strong>hopeful</strong></em><strong>.</strong> It “is based on the conviction that the universe is on the side of justice. Consequently, the believer in nonviolence has deep faith in the future.”</p><p><strong>I work for <a href="https://braverangels.org/">Braver Angels</a>, </strong>a bipartisan organization that facilitates political and crosscultural dialogue, among many other projects. Since the surge of antiracist activism and the new popularity of diversity, equity and inclusion programming, I have received an avalanche of requests. There is tremendous interest across America in achieving equity for the African-American community, and making institutions more inclusive rather than settling for the tokenism of the past. There is a desire to embrace the ends of social justice, and many truly want solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement.</p><p>But, almost invariably, these are quiet calls of distress from parties who do not know how to deal with the excesses of this ideological movement. Government agencies and elected officials cannot start productive conversations between communities and law enforcement because a new generation of activists overwhelms older community representatives, preferring demonstration to negotiation. Departments of education and corporations cannot bridge divides because of disagreements over the implications of privilege. Different parties “standing to speak” often make White people (and others) feel marginalized and disrespected. And still, antiracist efforts leave people of color and members of the LGBTQ community feeling diminished and unheard.</p><p>A <a href="https://reason.com/2020/01/30/the-1619-project-depicts-an-america-tainted-by-original-sin/">criticism</a> of antiracism from the cultural commentator John McWhorter is that it is a perspective that roots all American reality in an evil for which there is no clear path to salvation. “Now, not only does the American individual harbor the original sin of being born privileged, but America itself is a product of a grand original sin, permeating the entire physical, sociological, and psychological fabric of the nation, to an extent no one could ever hope to undo, and for which any apology would be insufficient to the point of irrelevance.” </p><p>In my experience, the fundamental problem is that antiracism concerns itself chiefly with seizing and exploiting social and political power to remedy the imbalance of power in society. The art of building relationships despite differences, which can yield stable and enduring consensus, is undeveloped. Modern antiracism does not see beyond confrontational activism. To be clear, its leading proponents do not advocate violence. But their ideology fails to understand what the nonviolence movement intimately knows.</p><p><strong>Martin Luther King Jr. was concerned with power too</strong>, and came to focus the tools of nonviolence upon achieving power within society. But he had a more expansive understanding of power than Kendi. King wedded the persuasive and moral power of agape love—a divine form of loving charity for others—to the aim of political equality, using a formula that dignifies the humanity of both the seeker of justice and the opposition. </p><p>King maintained this ideal in the face of the hatred he endured, without ever retreating from the moral foundations of nonviolence. It is well that he didn’t. Achieving civil-rights reforms required a critical mass of diversified support that was only possible through the humanizing power of nonviolence. The breadth of this support stood in contrast to that of the more aggressively militant social movements that rivaled it.</p><p>And yet it is those movements that provide more of the ancestry of today’s social-justice activism. The strident echoes of “Black power!” ring loud in today’s activism. Malcolm X and Stokely Carmichael are upheld as role models in today’s Black freedom struggle. Angela Davis remains a patron saint of modern social-justice work. Antiracist activists even recast humanizing figures like James Baldwin and King himself as closer to traditional radicals in order to link them to today’s culture—without committing themselves to the substance of those men’s perspectives.</p><p>Malcolm X, along with all the other figures I mentioned above, are worth understanding, …</p></div></div>

    <p><a href="https://nns.ee/blog/2019/03/21/chroot-shenanigans.html">In my previous post</a>, I described running Arch on an OpenWRT router. Today, I’ll be taking it a step further and running Arch and a full LXDE installation natively on an Amazon Kindle, which can be interacted with directly using the touch screen. This is possible thanks to the Kindle’s operating system being Linux!
<!--description--></p>

<p>You can see the end result in action <a href="https://youtu.be/Bx386xpDqCY">here</a>. Apologies for the shaky video - it was shot using my phone and no tripod.</p>

<p>If you’re wanting to follow along, make sure you’ve <a href="https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/5_x_Jailbreak">rooted your Kindle</a> beforehand. This is essential – without it, it’s impossible to run custom scripts or binaries.</p>

<p>I’m testing this on an 8th generation Kindle (KT3) – it should, however, work for all recent Kindles given you’ve enough storage and are rooted. You also need to set up <a href="https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=225030">USBnetwork</a> for SSH access and optionally <a href="https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=203326">KUAL</a> if you want a simple way of launching the chroot.</p>

<p>First things first: We need to set up a filesystem and extract an Arch installation into it, which we can later chroot into. The filesystem will be a file which will be mounted as a loop device. The reason why we’re not extracting the Arch installation directly into a directory on the Kindle is because the Kindle’s storage filesystem is FAT32. FAT32 doesn’t support required features such as symbolic links, which would break the Arch installation. Please note that this also means that your chroot filesystem can be 4 gigabytes large, at maximum. This can be worked around by mounting the real root inside the chroot filesystem, which it’s still a hacky way to go about it. But I digress.</p>

<p>First, figure out how large your filesystem actually can be. SSH into your Kindle and see how much free space you have:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>ssh root@192.168.15.244
<span>
</span><span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>df</span> <span>-k</span> /mnt/base-us
<span>Filesystem   1K-blocks  Used    Available  Use%  Mounted on
/dev/loop/0  3188640    361856  2826784    11%   /mnt/base-us
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Seems like we have around 2800000K (around 2.8G) of space available. Let’s make our filesystem 2.6G – it’s enough to host our root filesystem and some extra applications, such as LXDE. Note that I’ll be running the following commands on my PC and transferring the filesystem over later. You can also do all of this on the Kindle, but it’s simply easier and faster this way.</p>

<p>Let’s create a blank file of the wanted size. I’m using <code>dd</code>, but you can also use <code>fallocate</code> for this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span><span>dd </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero <span>of</span><span>=</span>arch.img <span>bs</span><span>=</span>1024 <span>count</span><span>=</span>2600000
<span>2600000+0 records in
2600000+0 records out
2662400000 bytes (2.7 GB, 2.5 GiB) copied, 6.92058 s, 385 MB/s
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s create our filesystem on it. Since we’re doing this on the PC, we need make it 32bit and disable the <code>metadata_csum</code> and <code>huge_file</code> options on the filesystem, as the Kindle’s ext4 kernel doesn’t support them.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>mkfs.ext4 <span>-O</span> ^64bit,^metadata_csum,^huge_file arch.img
<span>mke2fs 1.45.0 (6-Mar-2019)
Discarding device blocks: done                            
Creating filesystem with 650000 4k blocks and 162560 inodes
Filesystem UUID: a4e72620-368a-44b4-81bb-9e66b2903523
Superblock backups stored on blocks: 
	32768, 98304, 163840, 229376, 294912

Allocating group tables: done                            
Writing inode tables: done                            
Creating journal (16384 blocks): done
Writing superblocks and filesystem accounting information: done 
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is optional, but I’ll also disable periodic filesystem checks on it:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>tune2fs <span>-c</span> 0 <span>-i</span> 0 arch.img                               
<span>tune2fs 1.45.0 (6-Mar-2019)         
Setting maximal mount count to -1
Setting interval between checks to 0 seconds
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next it’s time to mount the filesystem:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span><span>mkdir </span>rootfs
<span>$</span><span> </span><span>sudo </span>mount <span>-o</span> loop arch.img rootfs/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The Kindle I’m using has a Cortex-A9-based processor, so let’s download the ARMv7 version of Arch Linux ARM from <a href="http://os.archlinuxarm.org/os/ArchLinuxARM-armv7-latest.tar.gz">here</a>. You can download it and extract then, or simply download and extract at the same time:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>curl <span>-L</span> http://os.archlinuxarm.org/os/ArchLinuxARM-armv7-latest.tar.gz | <span>sudo tar </span>xz <span>-C</span> rootfs/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>sudo</code> is required to extract as it sets up a lot of files with root permissions. You can ignore the errors about <code>SCHILY.fflags</code>. Verify that the files extracted successfully with <code>ls -l rootfs/</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s prepare our Kindle for the filesystem. I opted for hosting the filesystem in <code>extensions/karch</code> as I want to use KUAL for easy launching:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>ssh root@192.168.15.244
<span>
</span><span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> /mnt/base-us/extensions/karch
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While we’re here, it’s also a good idea to stop the power daemon to prevent the Kindle from going into sleep mode while transferring the filesystem and interrupting our transfer:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>kindle#</span><span> </span>stop powerd
<span>powerd stop/waiting
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s transfer our filesystem:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>exit</span>
<span>Connection to 192.168.15.244 closed.

</span><span>$</span><span> </span>scp arch.img root@192.168.15.244:/mnt/base-us/extensions/karch/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This might take quite a bit of time, depending on your connection.</p>

<p>Once it’s done, let’s SSH in once again and set up our mountpoint:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>ssh root@192.168.15.244
<span>
</span><span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>cd</span> /mnt/base-us/extensions/karch/
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>mkdir </span>system
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I decided to set up my own loop device, so I can have it named, but you can ignore this and opt to use <code>/dev/loop/12</code> or similar instead. Just make sure it’s already not in use with <code>mount</code>.</p>

<p>Setting up a loop point and mounting the filesystem:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>mknod</span> <span>-m0660</span> /dev/loop/karch b 7 250
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span>mount <span>-o</span> <span>loop</span><span>=</span>/dev/loop/karch <span>-t</span> ext4 arch.img system/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We should also mount some system directories into it:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>kindle#</span><span> </span>mount <span>-o</span> <span>bind</span> /dev system/dev
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span>mount <span>-o</span> <span>bind</span> /dev/pts system/dev/pts
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span>mount <span>-o</span> <span>bind</span> /proc system/proc
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span>mount <span>-o</span> <span>bind</span> /sys system/sys
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span>mount <span>-o</span> <span>bind</span> /tmp system/tmp
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>cp</span> /etc/hosts system/etc/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s time to chroot into our new system and set it up for LXDE. You can also use this opportunity to set up whatever applications you need, such as an onscreen keyboard:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>chroot </span>system/ /bin/bash
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span><span>echo</span> <span>'en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8'</span> <span>&gt;</span> /etc/locale.gen 
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span>locale-gen
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span><span>rm</span> /etc/resolv.conf 
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span><span>echo</span> <span>'nameserver 8.8.8.8'</span> <span>&gt;</span> /etc/resolv.conf
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span>pacman-key <span>--init</span> <span># this will take a while</span>
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span>pacman-key <span>--populate</span>
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span>pacman <span>-Syu</span> <span>--noconfirm</span>
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span>pacman <span>-S</span> lxde xorg-server-xephyr <span>--noconfirm</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We use Xephyr because it’s the easiest way to get our LXDE session up and running. Since the Kindle uses X11 natively, we can try using that. It’s possible to stop the native window manager using <code>stop lab126_gui</code> outside the chroot, but then the Kindle will stop updating the screen with new data, leaving it blank – forcing you to use something like <code>eips</code> to refresh the screen. The X server still works, however, and you can confirm this by using something like <code>x11vnc</code> after running your own WM in it. Xephyr spawns a new X server inside the preexisting X server, which is not as efficient but a lot easier.</p>

<p>We can however stop everything else related to the native GUI, as we need the extra memory and we can’t use it while LXDE is running anyways:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>chroot#</span><span> </span><span>exit</span>
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>SERVICES</span><span>=</span><span>"framework pillow webreader kb contentpackd"</span>
<span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>for </span>service <span>in</span> <span>${</span><span>SERVICES</span><span>}</span><span>;</span> <span>do </span>stop <span>${</span><span>service</span><span>}</span><span>;</span> <span>done</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While we’re here, we need to get the screen size for later:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>kindle#</span><span> </span>eips <span>-i</span> | <span>grep</span> <span>'xres:'</span> | <span>awk</span> <span>'{print $2"x"$4}'</span>
<span>600x800
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s chroot back into the system and see if we can get LXDE to run. Be sure to replace the screen size parameter if needed:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>chroot </span>system/ /bin/bash
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span><span>export </span><span>DISPLAY</span><span>=</span>:0
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span>Xephyr :1 <span>-title</span> <span>"L:A_N:application_ID:xephyr"</span> <span>-screen</span> 600x800 <span>-cc</span> 4 <span>-nocursor</span> &amp;
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span><span>export </span><span>DISPLAY</span><span>=</span>:1
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span>lxsession &amp;
<span>chroot#</span><span> </span>xrandr <span>-o</span> right
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If everything goes well, you should have LXDE visible on your Kindle’s screen. Ta-da! Feel free to play around with it. I’ve found that the touch screen is suprisingly accurate, even though it is using an IR LED system to detect touches instead of a normal digitizer.</p>

<p>Once done in the chroot, Ctrl-C + Ctrl-D can be issued to exit the chroot. We can then restore the Kindle UI by doing:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>kindle#</span><span> </span><span>for </span>service <span>in</span> <span>${</span><span>SERVICES</span><span>}</span><span>;</span> <span>do </span>start <span>${</span><span>service</span><span>}</span><span>;</span> <span>done</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It might take a while for anything to display again.</p>

<p>I’ve mentioned setting up a KUAL extension to automate the entering and exiting of the chroot. You can find that <a href="https://github.com/neonsea/karch">here</a>. If you’re interested in using this, make sure you’ve set up your filesystem first and copied it over to the same directory as the extension, and that it’s named <code>arch.img</code>. Everything else is not mandatory - the extension will do it for you.</p>

<p>Despite the twilight, the floor remained lifelessly dark. Somewhere in the depths, there was a dim glow of electric light, hardly penetrating through old glass blocks.</p>
<p>Inside the floor was empty and black, but not completely.&nbsp;Inside burned several fluorescent lamps, spotlighting dozens of silhouettes of tall cabinets.</p>
<p>Some of them were covered with darkened translucent film.</p>
<p>The surface of the floor, tables and enclosures covered with black spots of soot, sometimes diluted with white stains of dried extinguishing mixture.</p>
<p>The air felt a persistent, but not strong smell of burning.&nbsp;The fire walked here a few years ago but did not touch the equipment.</p>
<p>Part of the cabinets were antique electronic computers. Others served to measure signals, and computers controlled this process. Dozens of terminals froze on the tables with extinct screens.</p>

<p>Suddenly it became clear that before them the legendary machine “Saratov-2”.&nbsp;The machine, which was massively placed on many enterprises of the Soviet Union in the 70s, but at the same time, not a single high-quality (I’m not talking about color) photos remained. Not on the Internet, not even in the museum of the enterprise developer.</p>

<p>This computer did not even have a traditional microprocessor. Domestic clone of the popular American PDP-8, Saratov-2 was produced in two versions.</p>
<p>Steel frame, like a chest of drawers, filled with drawers.&nbsp;Different boxes responded to various computer nodes — a twelve-bit computing unit, input-output device interfaces, and RAM.</p>
<p>The memory was ferromagnetic – two boxes of four cubes in each. Reading or writing programs occurred through punched tapes, and to display the results of calculations used electric typewriter CONSUL-260.</p>
<p>The monitor and keyboard in that era were not yet a much-needed</p>
<p>part of the computer. The necessary input of programs into the operative memory was carried out in binary codes, manually using a group of switches on the front panel. Bulbs controlled the correctness of the input.</p>

<p>The next generation of computers was Electronics 100/25. These machines were clones of American PDP-11.</p>
<p>They thought faster, had more memory, allowed them to work with magnetic tape drives and punched tapes, but the general principle remained the same.</p>
<p>It was possible to connect a monitor and a keyboard to this computer, while still having the ability to enter programs through the front switches.</p>

<p>Electronics-60 – the further development of Electronics 100/25. The same architecture, but bulky tape drives are a thing of the past.</p>
<p>They were replaced by flexible eight-inch floppy disks. The new chipset, allowed to fit the processor module, power supply and control devices, in a very compact size.</p>
<p>I note that all these computers were managers, that is, they worked with a bunch of external equipment. It could be machine tools, laboratory complexes, measuring devices.</p>

<p>15VM16-1 some early version of Electronics-60, having a control panel of light bulbs and switches. Assembled on the element base of the previous Electronics 100/25. I occupied a small nightstand built into the table on which the controlled equipment was placed.</p>

<p>DVK-2M or Interactive Computing Complex. Massive, stylish in appearance, the computer of the 80s, which could be considered a personal computer.</p>
<p>It consisted of two desktop blocks – processor and pairing. A set of interchangeable interface cards allowed connecting drives of various types, a monochrome monitor on an openwork leg, and a keyboard.</p>
<p>Back in 1993, when we were studying, one teaching DVK could distribute programs for a couple of dozen Spectrums through the network.</p>

<div>
<div><p><a href="https://www.pcjs.org/software/pcx86/app/other/visicalc/1981/"><img alt="VisiCalc" src="https://www.getgrist.com/themes/grist/assets/images/blog/visicalc.jpg"></a></p>

<p>
Spreadsheets attract people with a hacker mindset, since they reward a
little technical curiosity with a big jump in capability. Despite
that, while there are some open source spreadsheet projects, most of
the action is closed source (Excel, Airtable, Honeycode, etc). Grist is a solid,
modern, powerful spreadsheet that fits well into the open-source
ecology, and is as friendly to hacker-developers as it is to
hacker-users. Here are some reasons why.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><img alt="Linked sections" src="https://www.getgrist.com/themes/grist/assets/images/blog/links.webp"></p>
<p>
Grist borrows visually from classic spreadsheets and modern
dashboards, with every view backed by relational data, filtered and
linked with other views as needed. Grist takes care of the data, and keeping
it live, so custom views are easy to add if you need something new,
using <a href="https://support.getgrist.com/widget-custom/#minimal-example">standard HTML/JS/CSS</a>. For example, live-updating
<a href="https://support.getgrist.com/examples/2020-08-invoices/">invoices</a>,
<a href="https://support.getgrist.com/examples/2020-10-print-labels/">mailing labels</a>,
<a href="https://docs.getgrist.com/iqhzhQM66qg7/Pedigree-Example/m/fork/p/2#a1.s3.r11.c2">goat pedigrees</a>,
 <a href="https://public.getgrist.com/doc/exoplanets/m/fork">exoplanet birthday card</a>,
 or <a href="https://docs.getgrist.com/qctFijX9HUZu/Morse-Code/m/fork/p/2">morse code quizzer</a> that look just how you want them.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><img alt="datasette" src="https://www.getgrist.com/themes/grist/assets/images/blog/datasette.png"></p>
<p>
Grist is a <a href="https://support.getgrist.com/exports/#backing-up-an-entire-document">self-contained format</a>, based on SQLite. Grist tables
are literally SQLite tables, which opens up all sorts of possibilities.
For example, I can take a Grist
<a href="https://docs.getgrist.com/doc/investment-research">example investment spreadsheet</a>
and publish it using Simon Willison’s <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette">datasette</a>
as a <a href="https://candy-tourmaline-efraasia.glitch.me/data/Investments">Glitch remix</a>
without any conversion steps needed. This is a step up from exporting CSV.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><img alt="python formulas" src="https://www.getgrist.com/themes/grist/assets/images/blog/spots-left.png"></p>
<p>
Grist uses <a href="https://support.getgrist.com/functions/">python as its formula language</a>. Python has a good standard
library, nice syntax for working with lists, and is a favorite of data
scientists. Grist itself is written in TypeScript, with formula
evaluation isolated in a sandbox.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><img alt="data diff" src="https://www.getgrist.com/themes/grist/assets/images/blog/diff.png"></p>

<p>
The Grist format makes it easy to find the most recent common ancestor
of two versions of a document, facilitating three-way comparisons and
git-style revision control. When working on a Grist spreadsheet with someone,
you can use real-time collaborative editing -
or you may sometimes prefer to
<a href="https://support.getgrist.com/copying-docs/#trying-out-changes">“fork” your spreadsheet</a>,
make a set of changes,
<a href="https://docs.getgrist.com/syx4YUwXdDyP/NYC-Bridges?compare=syx4YUwXdDyPELJUEqShA9~o4CKdSVuVQfGbyHCXctpqV~4">compare them with the original</a>
and then land them back.  We’re excited to flesh this workflow
out, and I think any programmer can see where we’re going with it.

<p>
Grist code is available at <a href="https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core">github.com/gristlabs/grist-core</a>
under a standard free and open source licence (Apache 2.0).
Grist software is developed by Grist Labs, which offers <a href="https://www.getgrist.com/pricing">free and paid
hosting plans</a>. Whether you choose us to host your spreadsheets,
or to run Grist yourself, you have the comfort of knowing the developers have revenue
(so they won’t one day vanish in the morning sun like an elusive gleam of dew on a flower),
and you have the code and your data (ditto).

<p><a href="https://jsfiddle.net/ondras/hYfN3/"><img alt="spreadsheet jsfiddle" src="https://www.getgrist.com/themes/grist/assets/images/blog/fiddle.png"></a></p>
<p>
“Fiddle” sites are very handy for communicating and learning about a
technology. I know I learned a lot about javascript by playing
with this 30-line implemention of a spreadsheet:
<a href="https://jsfiddle.net/ondras/hYfN3/">https://jsfiddle.net/ondras/hYfN3/</a>. Grist supports fiddles almost by
accident, because you can <a href="https://docs.getgrist.com/">use Grist without logging in</a>,
and you can quickly edit a “fork” of a spreadsheet without changing your original.
Here, try <a href="https://docs.getgrist.com/doc/afterschool-program/m/fork">fiddling with one of our examples</a>. You won’t break it.
</p>
</div>

<p>Grist supports <a href="https://support.getgrist.com/col-types/#attachment-columns">attachments</a>, and those attachments can be downloaded as part of a
single Grist file format.
Grist has solid undo/redo support.
Hosted Grist makes <a href="https://support.getgrist.com/automatic-backups/">automatic backups</a> at hourly, daily, monthly, and yearly intervals.
Grist has <a href="https://support.getgrist.com/rest-api/">an API</a> and a <a href="https://zapier.com/apps/grist/integrations">Zapier integration</a>.
Grist supports real time collaboration.
Grist supports many <a href="https://support.getgrist.com/functions/">Excel functions</a>.
We publish a Grist docker image (see the <a href="https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core#grist">README</a>),
and have an unreleased standalone app for Windows/Mac/Linux that we’ll be bringing
up to date.

</div>

<p>
Spreadsheets have evolved a lot since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plimpton_322">Babylonian times</a>.
In open-source, <a href="http://www.gnumeric.org/">Gnumeric</a> and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreOffice_Calc">Calc</a> are venerable standalone
Excel replacements.
<a href="https://github.com/mengshukeji/Luckysheet">LuckySheet</a> is a shot at a clone of that standalone experience in the browser.
<a href="https://github.com/audreyt/ethercalc/">Ethercalc</a> is a real-time collaborative spreadsheet, developed by
Audrey Tang, now Taiwan’s Digital Minister, extending work they did with Dan Bricklin on SocialCalc.
Evolving further, hybrid spreadsheet-database models are growing in usefulness and
popularity. That's what Grist is, and we are pleased to bring it now
to the open-source community.
</p>
</div>

<p>Spreadsheets have a long tail of features that are “must haves” for someone out there.
We think a quality, open code base is a big help for realizing those features, and having
peace of mind in relying on them.
Just as Babylonian clay tablets were, we hope that Grist will prove a
sturdy data storage and presentation infrastructure that
can survive for years (if not centuries!) to come.

                    <p>In the world we live in, most products compete for the same market: <strong>our attention</strong>.</p>

<p>The usual suspects are facebook, twitter, pinterest, reddit on your phone, netflix, hulu &amp; friends on your other devices.</p>

<p>In the more tolerated category we have personal messaging: imessage, whatsapp &amp; messenger (hey again facebook), and co.</p>

<p>The competition has extended to “workplace productivity” which is sneaky way of saying “social media, but at work”: slack, teams, email.</p>

<p>Companies like slack internally define engagement as minutes spent on slack. Few people would argue that the more minutes they spend on slack, the more successful their day has been. Would you?</p>

<p>None of these companies taken in a vacuum is a big issue, however <strong>together they form a focus absorbing black hole</strong>, 5 minutes of your attention at a time.</p>

<p>These products have become so good at nipping away at our attention, one push notification or red bubble at a time, that there is very little room left for you to be your original self and achieve a state of focus for longer periods of time.</p>

<p>This is a sad state of affairs, but also can be seen as an opportunity! The internet and the tech boom has normalized us humans like nothing ever has. <strong>The new differentiator that matters most is focus</strong>.</p>

<p>How many of us can read a book for 1h or more without checking their phone?</p>

<p>How many of us can produce a deep, original thought?</p>

<p>How many of us can just sit there at a restaurant without whipping the phone out when we are left at a restaurant table alone?</p>

<p><em>A ridiculously small amount.</em></p>

<p>We should pay more attention to this (pardon the pun), and update our behavior.</p>

<p>What are some ways to get back to focus levels that we once achieved? This is a personal question and if you care, I invite you to think about what your answer is.</p>

      <h2>What is COVID Moonshot?</h2>
      <p>The COVID Moonshot is an ambitious crowdsourced initiative to accelerate the development of a COVID antiviral. We work in the open with no intellectual property constraints. This way, any scientist can view submitted drug designs and experimental data to inspire new design ideas. We use our cutting-edge machine learning tools and Folding@home's crowdsourced supercomputer to determine which drug designs to send to our partners to make and test in the lab. With each drug design tested, we get closer to our goal.</p>

November 30, 2020 | https://www.abar.tech/articles/dear-finance-this-is-why-cloud-costs-are-complex/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.abar.tech/articles/dear-finance-this-is-why-cloud-costs-are-complex/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>This scenario keeps repeating: Finance get an AWS bill, it’s over budget, rightfully they are surprised and come to the Engineering team asking why. After it has been resolved, they want to address the root cause: can we work together to set better budgets so we can all plan and be prepared. This blog sheds some light on why this is a complex task.</p>
<p><em>Side note: I have to write a blog about why Engineering should also know about Finance - did you know that there can be tax implications when you tag your cloud resources?</em></p>
<h2>Task: How much will it cost to store a 1 GB file in our AWS account?</h2>
<p>First we need to choose which cloud service we would like to use, AWS has “175 fully featured services”. Let’s assume we’d like to use AWS S3 for this use case. Next we need to choose which type of S3 product we’d like to use. There are 6 different types depending on how frequently you need to access the file; and depending on how much storage we already use, there are 14 different price points. The next question is where would you like the file to be hosted? There are 21 AWS regions to choose from (2 more for Government Cloud). So far, we have 14 prices x 21 regions = 294 different price points.</p>
<p>That’s probably enough to demonstrate the complexity of cloud pricing, but lets go a little deeper. Next, we have to think about how many times this file will be accessed; if it will be accessed from within the same region or outside the region; what about doing analysis tasks on the folder containing all the files, and finally what about replication of the data. The total number of price points comes to 2,721.</p>
<p>I have chosen a relatively simple example here. AWS EC2 has 1,716,582 price points, of which 1,611,573 prices are the actual compute instances.</p>
<p>So far, we’ve focused on the price points from AWS S3, but that’s rarely used by itself. It is common to use S3 with a compute service such as AWS Lambda, to process the data, and it’s common to use Lambda with an API Gateway that acts as a “front-door” for applications to access the compute service, CloudWatch for logging, and either RDS or DynamoDB for record keeping. You can see how, at best it’s very time consuming, and at worst pretty much impossible, to give an answer to the question by manually trying to calculate it.</p>
<p>Why do I know the exact pricing point numbers? Because we created price mappings to develop <a href="https://www.infracost.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Infracost.io</a>. Infracost takes Terraform files (Infrastructure as Code), and provides a cost estimate for developers so the cost is better understood <strong>before</strong> launching or changing infrastructure. We believe giving developers and DevOps easy access to pricing information will enable them to make better decisions at design time, ultimately reducing waste in cloud spend.</p>
<p>Infracost does all the complex cost calculations, and leaves a simple comment in your pull request with the cost implications:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div class="page">

<hr>
<p><img width="400px;" src="https://media1.tenor.com/images/5e4fff30948fe04f18f2a866ce0a2e87/tenor.gif?itemid=16902898" alt="pivot"></p>

<p>After nine months of running Made With ML, we’re redefining our focus to end the hype and <a href="https://madewithml.com/about/">deliver actual value</a>.
Which means <strong>no more</strong> overwhelming:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>❌</span> pointing to projects</li>
<li><span>❌</span> posting daily trends</li>
<li><span>❌</span> Topics page</li>
</ul>
<p>But instead, we will have more <strong>original content</strong> focused on:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>✅</span> applied ML in production</li>
<li><span>✅</span> sound software engineering</li>
<li><span>✅</span> delivering (actual) value with ML</li>
</ul>
<p>Made With ML was an open platform (<strong>20K</strong> monthly active users) where the ML community shared what they were building.
We had indexed nearly 3K tutorials, surveys, blog posts, libraries, etc. to help people build.
But, in fact, this was not what was happening.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>hype</strong>: mostly only hype projects were trending (transformer architectures, image generation with GANs, etc.) and very little on applied ML.</li>
<li><strong>quality</strong>: quality of projects decreased as the platform grew in popularity.</li>
<li><strong>misuse</strong>: became a social platform where people gamified project upvotes.</li>
<li><strong>mistakes</strong>: many tutorials and blog posts written by the general public had errors (<em>caution</em>: this is happening in a lot of places).</li>
<li><strong>stale</strong>: many libraries quickly became stale after the initial hype phase.</li>
</ul>
<p>Luckily, we <strong>don’t</strong> depend on ads or traffic so we decided to make the changes necessary to realign with our goal of <a href="https://madewithml.com/about/">helping people build</a>.
Here are some tips to follow:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>relax</strong>: Don’t obsess over every new paper, blog post, library, etc. that you see online. Focus on the resources that matter most to what you’re building.</li>
<li><strong>build</strong>: While it’s good to explore trending topics (transformers, GANs, etc.), always try to build something that has practical utility. You’ll learn that these trending topics won’t usually be the best choice. And if you’re looking for a career in industry, a practical project will go a long way compared to yet another “finetuned image generation with GANs” tutorial.</li>
<li><strong>unfollow</strong>: There are these <em>influencers</em> and <em>evangelists</em> on Twitter and LinkedIn who repost daily content but they themselves would have contributed very little original content. It’s overwhelming and they’re doing it for followers.</li>
<li><strong>ignore</strong>: When you see large dumps of resources you’ll rarely refer back to them when actually building something and guaranteed the poster did not go through them all. But they’ll always stay in the back of your head making you feel like if you aren’t learning about everything, you know nothing. Just use Google and GitHub search <em>as you’re building</em>. Here are a few examples:
<ul>
<li>awesome lists on GitHub</li>
<li>lists of books to read</li>
<li>list of courses to take</li>
<li>AI expert roadmaps</li>
<li>our old Topics page</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Made With ML very quickly gained a lot of traction and we are guilty of creating some of the overwhelm mentioned above. We <strong>apologize</strong> and now we’re focused on helping people <a href="https://madewithml.com/about/">deliver (actual) value</a> with machine learning.</p>

<p>This blog post explains how to make a 3D population density render for any country in the world, using open data and free software. The main tool I'll use (<a href="https://ephtracy.github.io/index.html?page=aerialod" target="_blank">Aerialod</a>) is Windows-only at the moment, but it is amazing. I say 'render' rather than 'map' here because the images you'll generate are rendered by Aerialod, which is, technically, a 'path tracing renderer' rather than a piece of mapping software. But feel free to call them 3D maps - either way, this is an example of what they look like.&nbsp;</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wtcbDoJr4sA/X6vqDJqnsZI/AAAAAAAAGOk/RMHCbHtgb-41IUE9_mkzBbHU8eSY4rGoACLcBGAsYHQ/s2730/world_spikes_11520x6480_PERS_-55_tilt_10_sept_2020_final_poster_colour_25%2525.png"><img data-original-height="1152" data-original-width="2730" height="169" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wtcbDoJr4sA/X6vqDJqnsZI/AAAAAAAAGOk/RMHCbHtgb-41IUE9_mkzBbHU8eSY4rGoACLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h169/world_spikes_11520x6480_PERS_-55_tilt_10_sept_2020_final_poster_colour_25%2525.png" width="400"></a></td></tr><tr><td>Global population density <a href="https://automaticknowledge.co.uk/prints/" target="_blank">print</a></td></tr></tbody></table><p><br>But <i>why </i>do this? Well, partly because it's an interesting and often informative way at looking at population and settlement patterns, but also partly because this particular method produces nice-looking graphics. Perhaps the best answer I could give here is that's it's a combination of aesthetics, insight, and interest. In the image below, for example, we can see a lot of what we might already know, but it's often in the comparisons within and between places that we learn new things and that's also part of the point here - it can give us a new perspective on the world.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EhHxAh__P1M/X6v2wx0jBmI/AAAAAAAAGOw/1kXhMpCAvokaedV8flpGjOqTpq6HvO4BACLcBGAsYHQ/s2048/EXQhR63XgA0lrE6.jpg"><img data-original-height="1166" data-original-width="2048" height="228" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EhHxAh__P1M/X6v2wx0jBmI/AAAAAAAAGOw/1kXhMpCAvokaedV8flpGjOqTpq6HvO4BACLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h228/EXQhR63XgA0lrE6.jpg" width="400"></a></td></tr><tr><td>Singapore, KL, Medan, Ho Chi Minh City, etc</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>The ingredients</h3><p>What do we need to make a population density map like this of a single country? Well, it can be done in different ways, and you may have your own method, but the basic ingredients are outlined below. I'm going to use the example of the United Kingdom as a single country, but the data source I use has data for all countries in the world, so you can pick whatever you like and replicate the method. So, here's what we need:</p><ul><li>Some population data, preferably in raster format</li><li>A tool to render it in 3D</li></ul><p>For the data, there are a few different sources, including the European Commission's <a href="https://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/" target="_blank">GHSL</a> data and NASA's <a href="https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/collection/gpw-v4" target="_blank">GPWv4</a> but here we're going to use <a href="https://www.worldpop.org/project/categories?id=18" target="_blank">WorldPop population density data</a>. These datasets are all free and open (CC BY 4.0), and all have 1km resolution versions, but WorldPop allows you to download individual countries, for each of the years from 2000 to 2020, so I'll use that here. Just a note of caution now to say that '1km' means '1km at the equator', or 30-arc-seconds - so if you're at 50 degrees north then the cell will still be 1km in height but it will only be about 80% of that width. Also, you should read the <a href="https://www.worldpop.org/methods/populations" target="_blank">WorldPop - Mapping Populations</a> page about the data, so that you understand what it is, and how it was created.</p><p>For rendering the world as a 3D population surface, there are again lots of options, the best of which is probably <a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">Blender</a>. This is free, open source and extremely powerful but it's not what I'm using here. Instead, I'm using <a href="http://ephtracy.github.io/index.html?page=aerialod" target="_blank">Aerialod</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/ephtracy" target="_blank">@ephtracy</a>. I've <a href="http://www.statsmapsnpix.com/2020/03/making-3d-landscape-and-city-models.html" target="_blank">previously written</a> tutorials on how to use this for different kinds of data, but here' I'll focus on population density renders.&nbsp;</p><h3>About the vertical dimension of population density datasets</h3><p>You can just download some data from WorldPop for a single country, in tif or asc format, and then just dump it in Aerialod, but when you do that with population data, something like this will probably be the result (below). This is the 2020 UK population density file from <a href="https://www.worldpop.org/project/categories?id=18" target="_blank">WorldPop</a>, opened in Aerialod. I'm showing you this here as a way of explaining what Aerialod does and what you need to understand before you try to map population density in this way.&nbsp;</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-THkBqtn2Ge0/X6v7fGB3hRI/AAAAAAAAGO8/ExvjGU1njaQepDM3z6fsWDhDdoe5mdVWQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1404/what_the_tif.PNG"><img data-original-height="846" data-original-width="1404" height="241" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-THkBqtn2Ge0/X6v7fGB3hRI/AAAAAAAAGO8/ExvjGU1njaQepDM3z6fsWDhDdoe5mdVWQCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h241/what_the_tif.PNG" width="400"></a></td></tr><tr><td>What the tif?<br></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The <i>gbr_pd_2020_1km.tif</i> file from WorldPop (2,372KB) is a simple black and white raster image, measuring 1,250 by 1,321 pixels (you can see this in the image properties when you download it). But the individual pixel values have population counts in them. So, when I open the file and inspect it in QGIS (below) I can see that the highest pixel value is 27,500 - and since Aerialod extrudes the vertical dimension according to individual pixel values, what we see in the image above when we open it in Aerialod is a kind of population density tower 27,500 high and only 1,250 wide by 1,321 high. Not exactly very useful. So, we have a 1km area of London with 27,000 people in it and this then gets extruded 27,500 units on the z dimension in Aerialod, while our x and y units max out at 1,250 and 1,321 respectively. Next step is to fix this.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7AZrg2D9NXw/X6v-ODs5tNI/AAAAAAAAGPQ/wEEcmjEJnsov4N5_MDB6wGyikbTvZxJtACLcBGAsYHQ/s869/high_pixel_value.png"><img data-original-height="702" data-original-width="869" height="324" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7AZrg2D9NXw/X6v-ODs5tNI/AAAAAAAAGPQ/wEEcmjEJnsov4N5_MDB6wGyikbTvZxJtACLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h324/high_pixel_value.png" width="400"></a></td></tr><tr><td>We need to re-scale this file in order to use it</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Scaling population density data in QGIS</h3><p>This is probably the most important bit. I will say now that there are lots of different ways to do this next bit, but ultimately what we are trying to do is arrive at a situation where we can show population density patterns in 3D that provide a useful overview of the settlement patterns in different countries, or the world as a whole. I used a different approach in the image at the top of this blog post, plus different data (GHSL), but it is based on the same principle. The following is a simple workflow to take a tif file from WorldPop and then rescale it so you can use it in Aerialod. If you were mapping something with much lower actual values (e.g. elevation) then you don't need to do this re-scaling.</p><div><ul><li>Open the population density tif in QGIS. It should just display as a black-to-white image, with low population counts in darker colours and lighter shades for the highest values. You can see this in the screenshot from QGIS above.</li><li>Right-click the layer &gt; Export &gt; Save As... and then you want to change the <i>Output</i> mode to <i>Rendered image</i>, select a folder to save it to, plus a file name, and then click OK. This will add another raster layer to QGIS. You can see a screenshot of this below.</li><li>You'll see that the new raster layer in QGIS looks exactly the same, but it's not. Instead of the actual population values in each pixel, the values go from 0 to 198. This is what the <i>Rendered image</i>&nbsp;save option does - it scales the image using pixel values in the range from 0 to 255, where 0 is black and 255 is white.&nbsp;</li></ul></div><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ats3p64uhl4/X60PbH1gR6I/AAAAAAAAGPc/wAXLo470OG8M6P8nf2Crc3jl4D-X1o7aQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1143/export_rendered.PNG"><img data-original-height="947" data-original-width="1143" height="331" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ats3p64uhl4/X60PbH1gR6I/AAAAAAAAGPc/wAXLo470OG8M6P8nf2Crc3jl4D-X1o7aQCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h331/export_rendered.PNG" width="400"></a></td></tr><tr><td>Saving as a rendered image</td></tr></tbody></table><div><br><ul><li>When we add this new rendered image to Aerialod, and then change some of the settings (as in the screenshot below), we do get quite a good visual representation of population density.</li><li><i>But</i>, there's no land and the old 0 to 27,500 range has essentially been reclassified from 0 to 198, which means that the full range of classes (up to 250) hasn't been used. We'll fix that in a minute but first here's the result, below. As you can see, this does a pretty good job of illustrating the broad sweep of population density across the UK. If you're struggling with Aerialod here, you may need to go back to the links at the top of the page and see my tutorials on it, but all I did here was drag and drop the tif into the main Aerialod window and then change the settings, as per the screenshot.</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ovHUPplCdhk/X60R29jdGLI/AAAAAAAAGPo/nana44FCYkQPEgw_luiJ2IsjU3mMZmkgACLcBGAsYHQ/s1652/aerialod_uk_2020.PNG"><img data-original-height="1004" data-original-width="1652" height="243" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ovHUPplCdhk/X60R29jdGLI/AAAAAAAAGPo/nana44FCYkQPEgw_luiJ2IsjU3mMZmkgACLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h243/aerialod_uk_2020.PNG" width="400"></a></td></tr><tr><td>This works pretty well - but there's no land</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3>How do we get the land to appear? (don't use black for 0)</h3><p>This next bit is about how to change the raster image before exporting it so that when we add it to Aerialod we can see the land as well. There are loads of ways to do this, but here's one simple way that works well. This step is only really necessary if you want land to appear. I prefer doing this because it then gives me the option of including the land, or not (i.e. you can make the land disappear by changing the Offset value in Aerialod to something like -2.0 in this case).&nbsp;</p><div><ul><li>Go to the original raster layer (in our case the one that goes from 0 to 27,500) and then in the <i>Layer Properties</i>, <i>Symbology </i>section, we change the <i>Render type</i> to <i>Singleband pseudocolor</i>.&nbsp;</li><li>What you need to do here is edit the colours so that the ramp goes from almost black (<b><u>but NOT black - so don't use RGB 0, 0, 0 or #000000</u></b>) to white. Aerialod will interpret the darkest colours as low values and white as the highest values - see below for a screenshot on this.</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SZRdQ4fRbrI/X60Vl9mcPcI/AAAAAAAAGP0/B6DCPvGrFH89J0Z_W8Ro2Z7PBUKrRZL4gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1065/recolour_layer.PNG"><img data-original-height="765" data-original-width="1065" height="288" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SZRdQ4fRbrI/X60Vl9mcPcI/AAAAAAAAGP0/B6DCPvGrFH89J0Z_W8Ro2Z7PBUKrRZL4gCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h288/recolour_layer.PNG" width="400"></a></td></tr><tr><td>This is one way to do it</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div><ul><li>Once you've done this, you can then save the layer as a Rendered image from QGIS, just like we did above. It will then add a new dark to light raster layer to QGIS, just like before. Unlike before, however, when you click on a cell in QGIS with the Identify Features (i) tool, you'll get a value from just above 0 to 255, instead of the population count.&nbsp;</li></ul><div><ul><li><b><i>Check:</i> </b>are all your highest population spikes the same height, meaning they look truncated or flat-topped? If so, this means you probably need to adjust the light-dark colour gradient again in QGIS before exporting it and loading it in QGIS. This sometimes happens in the highest density areas so it's worth looking closely at it and then if it does happen, re-scale the data in QGIS using a different kind of classification (e.g. instead of Continuous you could try equal Interval or even Quantile). Also, just remember that this approach is quite a simplified visualisation approach to displaying population density data. The vertical extrusion is not super-precise, and of course depends upon the method you use to create the rendered tif. The idea with the approach outlined here is to give a good general overview of population distribution and density in a country.</li></ul></div><ul><li><b>N.B.</b> there are loads of different ways you could do this step, including the use of different colour ramp modes (e.g. continuous, equal interval, quantile) or you could re-classify the raster using a scaling factor (e.g. divide all values by 1,000), or do it in an image program, but here I am aiming at simplicity and a method that allows us to quickly arrive at a result that is both interesting and broadly representative of the spatial patterns of density on the ground.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>So, what does it look like when we add it to Aerialod now? Well, see below for the new image.</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-W8dC6G8Z03A/X60XRkjCqGI/AAAAAAAAGQA/W6SzXltVzhQvEwlXRpxbyleOADYplkC5QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1652/aerialod_uk_with_land_2020.PNG"><img data-original-height="1004" data-original-width="1652" height="243" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-W8dC6G8Z03A/X60XRkjCqGI/AAAAAAAAGQA/W6SzXltVzhQvEwlXRpxbyleOADYplkC5QCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h243/aerialod_uk_with_land_2020.PNG" width="400"></a></td></tr><tr><td>Reduce the Offset (on the right) to remove the land</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The point of this is to be able to create a 3D render of population density in any country, and this is one way of achieving that. For things like this, where I am striving for broad-brush patterns and workflow efficiency, rather than precise measurement from pixel values, I will often take shortcuts to achieve what I want - so for example, in the image below I have 'reprojected' the data by manually re-sizing it in IrfanView and then saving it as a png file, which ended up being 289KB in …</p></div></div></div>

<p>Robotti 150D has two Kubota diesel engines. One 75 hp engine is for propulsion and the other 75 hp engine is for the PTO and external hydraulics. Robotti navigates using RTK GPS. In the field it carefully operates according to a plan which the farmer makes using Agrointelli route planning software. The software calculates an optimised route for the field. What makes Robotti unique is that it is in many ways very standard and similar to a tractor. It carries the implement in the centre so that it does not swing and is always stabilised. About a dozen units are currently running in Czech Republic, Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium and in Denmark.<br><strong>Availability:</strong> In 2021 Robotti will be operating in most European countries. They will be sold, leased or rented. Sales prices start at € 175,000. In spring a single-engine 75 hp version, the Robotti 75S, will be launched for € 135,000.<br><strong>Watch videos <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEVvBpJ9bdQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_O5OgXwfp4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</strong></p>

<p>AgXeed is launching a track-based agbot autonomous tractor for specialised and standard implements designed for category III rear and category II front hitches. Working widths are up to six metres (depending on the type of implement used) and the track width is up to 3.2 metres. The vehicle is powered by a 156 hp four-cylinder Deutz diesel engine that drives an electric generator to power all actuators (drivetrain, PTO, fan, etc.). Navigation and planning takes place via cloud-based software that automatically generates path planning based on the field’s geofences and machine specifications. The biggest advantage is that the AgXeed AgBot can be used straight from the box. No special implements are required, nor special software on your home computer. AgXeed deliver a ready-to-use ecosystem that avoids compacting the soil by providing very low ground pressure of maximum 0.5 kg/cm².<br><strong>Availability:</strong> Initial sales in the Netherlands, Germany, France and the UK. The company is currently discussing several purchase models (sale and lease) with distribution parties. The starting price will be around € 249,500 depending on the options selected. The focus right now is on finalising the current design for pre-series production in 2021.<br><strong>Watch video <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://youtu.be/qcYR2XaD0UA" target="_blank">here</a>.</strong></p>

<p>The solar battery-powered FarmDroid FD20 performs fully automatic seeding and weeding of various crops between rows and in the row (intra-row). From the seeding process the FD20 knows the position of every seed and therefore knows where it subsequently must weed and, just as importantly, where not to weed. The farmer sets the corner points of the field, creating a geofence for the robot to work within. After setting the number of headlands passes and the direction of the rows, the robot runs on RTK GPS from a base station. The robot does not rely on cameras and never needs charging. Over 100 FD20 robots are active in Austria, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland and they have handled over 1,500 ha of sugar beet, onions, green kale, flowers, spinach, canola and beetroot.<br><strong>Availability:</strong> In 2021 it will also be available in France, Italy, Lithuania and Spain. Currently, dedicated implements and tools are being developed for the FD20.<br><strong>Watch video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIqguf1J-38" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</strong></p>

					<div><p>It’s happened to many a gamer. A video game’s difficulty gradually rises or suddenly escalates. Advancing to a high level, reaching a benchmark or obtaining a top score seems impossible. Maybe the gamer searches online for tips or cheats. Maybe the gamer takes a break and comes back later. Or maybe the gamer gets frustrated enough to fork over more cash.</p>
<p>In short, the game becomes too hard.</p>
<p>A new federal lawsuit asserts that Electronic Arts unlawfully increases its sports games’ difficulty in order to induce gamers into paying the video game publisher additional money.</p>

<p>In <em>Zajonc v. Electronic Arts</em>, a trio of California-based gamers—Jason Zajonc, Danyael Williams and Pranko Lozano—have sued EA for deceptive practices, false advertising and related claims under California law. Their case, which they hope becomes certified as a class action, concerns the 2017 to 2021 versions of <a href="https://www.sportico.com/t/madden/" id="auto-tag_madden" data-tag="madden">Madden</a>, <a href="https://www.sportico.com/t/fifa/" id="auto-tag_fifa" data-tag="fifa">FIFA</a> and <a href="https://www.sportico.com/t/nhl/" id="auto-tag_nhl" data-tag="nhl">NHL</a>. The trio is represented by, among others, California consumer rights attorney <a href="https://jackfitzgeraldlaw.com/jack-fitzgerald/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Jack Fitzgerald</a>. EA has yet to answer the complaint in court, and has until early next year to do so.</p>

<p>The lawsuit contends that EA dupes many gamers through “utilizing one or more artificial intelligence technologies that adjust game difficulty dynamically.” EA, the plaintiffs charge, neglects to tell consumers about these technologies or their impact on games. Relying on “heuristic prediction and intervention to adaptively change the difficulty of matches, and influence or even dictate the outcomes,” EA keeps gamers “more engaged”—almost as if EA knowingly exploits an addiction.</p>
<p>EA’s purported motivation is profit. After buying the base game, gamers are invited to purchase loot boxes, which EA terms “player packs.” These packs unlock a player card, among other in-game assets or loot, which can then be used to enhance a gamer’s team. Sometimes the player card is a retired star. Other times it’s a more ordinary player. The gamer doesn’t know what he or she will get. It’s a gamble of sorts.</p>
<p>As asserted by the plaintiffs, EA “deprives gamers who purchase player packs of the benefit of their bargains.” EA allegedly does so by tweaking the difficulty level to diminish the impact of a superior player. “This [triggers] a self-perpetuating cycle,” the complaint charges, “since difficulty adjusting mechanisms make gamers believe their teams are less skilled than they actually are, leading them to purchase additional player packs in hopes of receiving better players and being more competitive.”</p>

<p>Worse yet, the plaintiffs insist, gamers become victims of EA’s version of reality. EA markets many of its sports video games as replicating actual sports to the greatest extent possible. For example, EA describes FIFA as featuring “unrivaled authenticity” with the “most authentic ever representation of the league.” Likewise, players depicted in EA games are intended to mirror their real-life counterparts. This underscores <a href="https://www.sportico.com/t/ea-sports/" id="auto-tag_ea-sports" data-tag="ea-sports">EA Sports</a>’ famous slogan: <em>It’s in the game</em>.</p>
<p>Under this line of reasoning, gamers are led to believe they are purchasing a game “where the outcome of matches depends solely on the gamer’s competence and the strength of the players on his or her team, as compared to his or her opponent’s competence and team strength.” The plaintiffs accuse EA of secretly modifying gameplay features to frustrate gamers and tempt them into buying one player pack after another.</p>
<p>The case is before Judge Joseph Spero, the Chief Magistrate Judge of the federal district court in San Francisco. Judge Spero is also presiding over a minor league players’ pay <a href="https://www.sportico.com/law/analysis/2020/supreme-courts-rejection-of-mlb-adds-fuel-to-minor-league-baseball-overhaul-1234614430/">class action</a> against Major League Baseball.</p>
<p>EA—which faces a <a href="https://www.sportico.com/law/news/2020/madden-fifa-loot-box-lawsuit-1234611833/">separate lawsuit</a> over whether loot boxes violate California’s prohibition against slot machines—has not yet answered the complaint. The company’s answer is due on Dec. 1, though both sides recently expressed in a joint petition that, with Judge Spero’s blessing, EA’s deadline be extended to Jan. 11, 2021.</p>
<p>EA will surely deny the core allegation. The company will likely contend that gamers are aware that difficulty levels change within games. Such a phenomenon has been around since the days of the Atari 2600.</p>
<p>EA could also point out that gamers have options within games to make them easier. Likewise, gamers aren’t required to purchase player packs in order to play the base game or to take advantage of many of its features.</p>
<p>Further, EA could insist that gamers aren’t provided assurances that buying player packs guarantees any particular results. The company might assert that player packs are designed not to make a game “easier” or “harder” but to allow a gamer to play with a game-altering asset.</p>
<p>EA is also poised to cite its <a href="https://tos.ea.com/legalapp/WEBTERMS/US/en/PC/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">user agreement</a>. It mandates that aggrieved gamers turn to arbitration, rather than the courts, and compels them to relinquish potential class-action rights.</p>
<p>The initial case management conference—where both sides’ attorneys will meet with Judge Spero (most likely by Zoom) and discuss the case—is currently scheduled for Feb. 12, 2021.</p>

				<div><p><em>We’re launching a fellowship program to bring together mission-driven people working on projects to strengthen civic society and rethink public goods. This is part 2 of 3 giving more details on the upcoming Radicalxchange fellowship program. <a href="https://blog.radicalxchange.org/blog/posts/is-radicalxchange-fellowship-for-me/">Read part one</a> to find out about the projects we are looking for.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>We know the market does an efficient job at creating private (rivalrous and excludable) and club goods (non-rivalrous and excludable). We also know it does a poor job with non-excludable goods like common property resources (rivalrous and non-excludable) or pure public goods (non-rivalrous and non-excludable).</p>
<p>We have a rich entrepreneurship ecosystem for private goods for which excludability is possible. But because the Government is responsible for public goods, we lack a similarly rich ecosystem. There is lots of Government funding for R&amp;D with associated positive externalities. But where is the Y Combinator if an entrepreneur wants to develop a public good? Where is the guidance for changemakers focused on value creation not value capture? Where is the advice for teams that don’t want to pursue a growth-at-all costs VC-backed business but still make an impact?</p>
<p><strong>The RadicalxChange Fellowship program is designed to fill that gap</strong>. The fellowship is a forum for exploring radical ideas asking: do we now have the tools and technologies to create public goods in new ways? Does software mean economic excludability is no longer binary in the traditional competitive model? And how can we sustainably finance public goods without Government or traditional capital markets?</p>
<p>In creating a program to address these big questions, <strong>we have scoped down the focus to 12 goals which we call the RadicalxChange Development Goals</strong>. While not comprehensive, we believe these goals form a blueprint for fixing the public and market institutions we need to create a fairer future.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.radicalxchange.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/rxc_development_goals.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-src="https://blog.radicalxchange.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/rxc_development_goals.png"></p>
<h2 id="theme-1-governance">Theme 1: Governance</h2>
<p>By governance, we mean to increase the inclusiveness, transparency, and participation in collective decision-making processes. Public institutions need to address the chronic lack of trust and shared facts that continue to erode the social contract between state and citizen. **Private companies need decision-making and governance tools to build more sustainable, participatory and inclusive organisations to attract customers, employees and investors. **We’ve identified three high-level goals to achieve this:</p>
<ul>
<li>RxC Goal 1 (RxC1): Increase participation in public and private sector decision-making</li>
<li>RxC2: Increase transparency of public and private sector decision-making</li>
<li>RxC3: Increase quality and precision of public and private sector decision-making</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="theme-2-property">Theme 2: Property</h2>
<p>Under the property theme, we see a need to increase the digitisation of property systems to allow for more flexible, agile, programmatic rules for ownership and transfer. <strong>We believe upgrading property rights for the digital world has the potential for more flexible and inclusive forms of private and public ownership models</strong>. Three goals will help make this happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>RxC4: Digitize and increase transparency of property rights</li>
<li>RxC5: Improve efficiency of cooperative and more equitable corporate structures</li>
<li>RxC6: Advance SALSA or other partial common ownership systems</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="theme-3-data">Theme 3: Data</h2>
<p>By data, we are specifically referring to <strong>the control and access over data</strong>. One of the fundamental market and social imbalances of the digital age is between data creators and data processors. We are undergoing something like a 50 year project of acknowledging socially, politically and legally that data is property. Our technology and legal systems need updating to reflect this. Projects looking to tackle of the following goals would be a good starting point:</p>
<ul>
<li>RxC7: Reduce information asymmetry of data usage between consumers and firms</li>
<li>RxC8: Advance self-sovereign and self-custodial identity solutions</li>
<li>RxC9: Advance collective control and bargaining solutions for data</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="theme-4-competition">Theme 4: Competition</h2>
<p>Finally, and related to governance, property and data rights, is competition. We want to see a decrease in market concentration in digital goods but more importantly for long-term sustainability will be <strong>tools to more equitably share economic profits across society.</strong> Solutions based in software that benefit from network effects inherent in information and communication technologies should be designed in terms of ownership and governance with these dynamics in mind.</p>
<ul>
<li>RxC10: Advance “exit to community” and related equity systems</li>
<li>RxC11: Advance meaningful, thoughtful stakeholder control systems</li>
<li>RxC12: Address monopolized markets with solutions designed to limit remonopolization</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="apply">Apply</h2>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>Apple's iOS 14 update 5 months ago introduced iOS widgets, which allow users to get timely information from their favorite apps at a glance.</p>
<p>This also opened up a whole new realm of possibilites for developers to use widgets as surrogates for native iOS apps, hence saving tons of engineering resources while still providing an app-like experience for their users.</p>
<p>And this is how I was able to create a fully-functional "app" in the form of an iOS widget for <a href="https://recurrence.app/">Recurrence</a> using Javascript, a RESTful API endpoint, and the <a href="https://scriptable.app/">Scriptable</a> app.</p>

<p><a href="https://recurrence.app/">Recurrence</a> is a lightweight affiliate management software that allows you to keep track of all your affiliate sales in one single platform.</p>
<p>I built Recurrence with the objective of helping startup founders launch their affiliate programs in a hassle-free, one-click fashion without breaking the bank.</p>
<p>Abiding by the principle of dogfooding, I've been using Recurrence to track affiliate sales for my other project, <a href="https://www.oneword.domains/">One Word Domains</a>, and the results have been super encouraging so far â€“ over <strong>456 clicks</strong> tracked and <strong>$275.65 in affiliate sales</strong> recorded.</p>
<p>However, the only way my affiliates were able to track the progress of their clicks was through the Recurrence web-app (pictured below), which was more of a desktop-first experience. </p>
<p><img alt="Affiliate Dashboard - Recurrence" src="https://recurrence.app/static/assets/blog-images/recurrence-dashboard.png"></p>
<p>While the web-app was optimized for mobile, I still wanted something that was more mobile-friendly. Something that was <em>native</em> to the iOS experience.</p>
<p>And that's when I came across this <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1330573624827392003?s=20">tweet</a> by Pieter Levels. </p>
<p>Turns out, all you needed to do to build an iOS widget were 3 simple steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set up an API endpoint that contains the live data</li>
<li>Download the Scriptable app</li>
<li>Design and code the widget using Javascript</li>
</ol>

<p>Since I was using the Flask framework, all I needed to do is add an extra route for the API endpoint:</p>
<pre><span>from</span> <span>flask</span> <span>import</span> Flask, jsonify
<span>from</span> <span>flask_cors</span> <span>import</span> cross_origin
<span>import</span> psycopg2


<span>@app.route</span>(<span>'/api/v1/&lt;api_key&gt;'</span>)
<span>@cross_origin</span>()
<span>def</span> <span>fetch_data_api</span>(api_key):
    db_cursor<span>.</span>execute(<span>"SELECT clicks, earnings FROM affiliates WHERE api_key = </span><span>%s</span><span>"</span>, (api_key,))
    data <span>=</span> db_cursor<span>.</span>fetchall()[<span>0</span>]
    clicks <span>=</span> data[<span>0</span>]
    earnings <span>=</span> data[<span>1</span>]
    data <span>=</span> {
        <span>"stats"</span>: [{
            <span>"clicks"</span>: clicks,
            <span>"earnings"</span>: <span>"{:.2f}"</span><span>.</span>format(earnings)
        }]
    }
    <span>return</span> jsonify(data)
</pre>
<p>There are a few things to note in this code block:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm using <code>@cross_origin()</code>, which is a decorator from the <code>flask_cors</code> library that allows cross-origin browser/API requests for flask apps. You might need to install the library with <code>pip install flask_cors</code> for this to work.</li>
<li>Since I'm using PostgreSQL as my database, <code>db_cursor</code> is my <code>psycopg2</code> object, which allows me to connect to the database from a remote origin. You might change this depending on your database schema.</li>
<li>This function returns the data in JSON format using flask's<code>jsonify</code> method. This step is key, since the Scriptable app only reads data in JSON format.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can download the Scriptable app on the App Store <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scriptable/id1405459188">here</a>. However, for local development, I'd highly recommend using the <a href="https://scriptable.app/mac-beta/">Scriptable Mac Client</a> â€“Â&nbsp;that way you can test your code directly on your laptop instead of copying it from VSCode/Sublime and pasting into your phone just to test it out.</p>
<p><img alt="Scriptable MacBook Client" src="https://recurrence.app/static/assets/blog-images/scriptable-mac.png"></p>
<p>Once you've opened the Scriptable Mac App, all you gotta do is click on the little "+" sign at the top right corner and start coding up your Javascript.</p>

<p>First, let's build the function that will fetch us some live data from the API endpoint that we built earlier:</p>
<pre>async <span>function</span> loadData() {
  <span>let</span> url = <span>"https://recurrence.app/api/v1/YOUR_API_KEY"</span>
  <span>let</span> req = <span>new</span> Request(url)
  <span>let</span> json = await req.loadJSON()
  <span>return</span> json.stats
}
</pre>
<p>Here, we're building an asynchronous function with the <code>Request()</code> constructor from the Fetch API. This function visits our endpoint and fetches the data in JSON format every minute or so (more on this later).</p>
<p>Then, we'll design the function that renders the frontend of our widget:</p>
<pre>async <span>function</span> createWidget(data) {

    <span>let</span> widget = <span>new</span> ListWidget()
    widget.backgroundColor = <span>new</span> Color(<span>"#fff"</span>)
    widget.addSpacer()

    <span>let</span> stats = <span>String</span>(data[<span>0</span>].clicks) <span>// In this case, we're getting the first element of the data object and the "clicks" child element.</span>
    <span>let</span> stats_num = widget.addText(stats)
    stats_num.font = Font.boldSystemFont(<span>50</span>);
    stats_num.textColor = <span>new</span> Color(<span>"#4f5ce2"</span>)
    stats_num.centerAlignText()

    <span>let</span> subtitle = widget.addText(<span>"total clicks"</span>)
    subtitle.font = Font.mediumSystemFont(<span>15</span>);
    subtitle.textColor = <span>new</span> Color(<span>"#000"</span>)
    subtitle.centerAlignText()

    <span>let</span> image = widget.addImage(img)
    image.centerAlignImage()
    image.imageSize = <span>new</span> Size(<span>100</span>,<span>35</span>)

    <span>return</span> widget
}
</pre>
<p>This function creates a widget instance with <code>new ListWidget()</code> and begins defining various design parameters to style the widget:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set the background color of the widget to white with <code>widget.backgroundColor</code></li>
<li>Add the data that was retrieved from the API endpoint with <code>widget.addText(stats)</code></li>
<li>Style the displayed data with <code>stats_num.font</code>, <code>stats_num.textColor</code>, and <code>stats_num.centerAlignText()</code></li>
<li>Define and style the subtitle (# of clicks, total earnings, etc.) with the <code>subtitle</code> object</li>
<li>Add the logo of the app at the bottom with <code>widget.addImage(img)</code>. </li>
</ul>
<p>You can also refer to Scriptable's <a href="https://docs.scriptable.app/">official documentation</a> for more information about widget styling.</p>
<p>Finally, we'll have to call the functions we created earlier and render it in the Scriptable app:</p>
<pre><span>const</span> i = await <span>new</span> Request(<span>"https://i.ibb.co/cNqLLbD/logo.png"</span>);
<span>const</span> img = await i.loadImage();
<span>let</span> data = await loadData()
<span>let</span> widget = await createWidget(data)
<span>if</span> (config.runsInWidget) {
  <span>// The script runs inside a widget, so we pass our instance of ListWidget to be shown inside the widget on the Home Screen.</span>
  Script.setWidget(widget)
} <span>else</span> {
  <span>// The script runs inside the app, so we preview the widget.</span>
  widget.presentMedium()
}
Script.complete()
</pre>
<p>And that's it â€“ you're all set! Go ahead and hit the "Run" button at the bottom right corner of the screen:</p>
<p><img alt="scriptable" src="https://recurrence.app/static/assets/blog-images/scriptable.gif"></p>
<p>...and, voilÃ&nbsp;! Now all you gotta do is transfer this code over to the Scriptable app on your phone the same way you did on the Mac client. Here's the complete code snippet:</p>
<pre>async <span>function</span> loadData() {
  <span>let</span> url = <span>"https://recurrence.app/api/v1/YOUR_API_KEY"</span>
  <span>let</span> req = <span>new</span> Request(url)
  <span>let</span> json = await req.loadJSON()
  <span>return</span> json.stats
}

async <span>function</span> createWidget(data) {

    <span>let</span> widget = <span>new</span> ListWidget()
    widget.backgroundColor = <span>new</span> Color(<span>"#fff"</span>)
    widget.addSpacer()

    <span>let</span> stats = <span>String</span>(data[<span>0</span>].clicks)
    <span>let</span> stats_num = widget.addText(stats)
    stats_num.font = Font.boldSystemFont(<span>50</span>);
    stats_num.textColor = <span>new</span> Color(<span>"#4f5ce2"</span>)
    stats_num.centerAlignText()

    <span>let</span> subtitle = widget.addText(<span>"total clicks"</span>)
    subtitle.font = Font.mediumSystemFont(<span>15</span>);
    subtitle.textColor = <span>new</span> Color(<span>"#000"</span>)
    subtitle.centerAlignText()

    <span>let</span> image = widget.addImage(img)
    image.centerAlignImage()
    image.imageSize = <span>new</span> Size(<span>100</span>,<span>35</span>)

    <span>return</span> widget
}

<span>const</span> i = await <span>new</span> Request(<span>"https://i.ibb.co/cNqLLbD/logo.png"</span>);
<span>const</span> img = await i.loadImage();
<span>let</span> data = await loadData()
<span>let</span> widget = await createWidget(data)
<span>if</span> (config.runsInWidget) {
  <span>// The script runs inside a widget, so we pass our instance of ListWidget to be shown inside the widget on the Home Screen.</span>
  Script.setWidget(widget)
} <span>else</span> {
  <span>// The script runs inside the app, so we preview the widget.</span>
  widget.presentMedium()
}
Script.complete()
</pre>

<p>Lastly, you'll have to add your widget to your iPhone home screen. The fastest way to do that in iOS 14 would be to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tap and hold on your home screen until your apps begin to jiggle</li>
<li>Click on the "+" button at the top right corner of the screen</li>
<li>Select the Scriptable widget and your desired widget size</li>
<li>Click on "Add Widget"</li>
<li>Long hold on the widget again and select "Edit Widget"</li>
<li>For the "Script" selection, choose the script you pasted in earlier</li>
<li>For the "When Interacting" selection, choose "Open URL" and key in the URL for your appâ€“ in this case that would be https://recurrence.app/dashboard. This will allow you to get redirected to your app when you click on the widget.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's a quick GIF showing the steps above:</p>
<p><img alt="scriptable mobile" src="https://recurrence.app/static/assets/blog-images/scriptable-mobile.gif"></p>
<p>In most cases, the widget usually updates every minute or so, but if you want to receive notifications about the changes, you can set that in the Scriptable app under "Notifications".</p>
<p>If you did everything right, you should end up with the following widgets on your home screen:</p>
<p><img alt="scriptable widgets" src="https://recurrence.app/static/assets/blog-images/scriptable-widgets.png"></p>
<p>Congratulations, you've just built your first iOS widget! ðŸ¥³</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Flutter and React Native are the two most popular cross-platform native development frameworks out there. Many articles have been written comparing the two, but <em>none</em> of them can answer the most important question:</p><p>Which is right for <strong>you</strong>?</p><p>In <a href="https://seanconnolly.dev/how-to-make-better-technology-decisions">How to make better technology decisions</a>, you can find details of the evaluation method I am using for this analysis. In short, we are following a 3 step process:</p><ol><li>Identify <strong>options</strong></li><li>Identify and weight <strong>criteria</strong></li><li><strong>Score</strong> each option</li></ol><p>To facilitate this Flutter vs. React Native analysis, I am using the <a href="https://seanconnolly.dev/help-me-decide">Help Me Decide</a> tool, which you should check out if you are not familiar with it.</p><p>This analysis documents my findings from researching and prototyping with Flutter and React Native over approximately a 1 month period. If you are also deciding between these two options, I encourage you to <a href="https://seanconnolly.dev/how-to-make-better-technology-decisions">learn the process</a> and make your own informed decision.</p><h2 id="context-and-bias">Context and bias<a href="#context-and-bias">#</a></h2><p>Before we begin, one thing missing from most articles comparing Flutter and React Native is transparency around the author's <strong>context and bias</strong>. Without knowing these, you can easily be led astray, thinking because a few people made a choice, you should make the same choice. <strong>I am not here to decide for you</strong>, nor should you let anyone else make your decision. I am here to walk you through my process and give you the tools so you can make your own decision.</p><p><strong>Context</strong> describes the circumstances surrounding your evaluation. Are you performing this evaluation on behalf of a team or organization? What do your stakeholders care about? What technology is the team already familiar with? Are there specific requirements that apply to you that may not apply to others?</p><p><strong>Bias</strong> describes presupposed favor or disfavor toward an option. Do you already have an opinion? Have you already worked with one of the options? Did somebody tell you they "heard bad things" about one of them at a conference they attended two years ago?</p><p>The <strong>context</strong> for my evaluation of Flutter vs. React Native is that I am tasked by my employer with researching both frameworks and making a recommendation for our company, a small-medium startup that currently employs 4 native Android/iOS developers and 8 web developers. My stakeholders have a few loosely defined goals. One is to accelerate development of our primary mobile application, which is currently implemented in both Kotlin (Android) and Swift (iOS). Another is to optimize the team size (and therefore cost) required to build and maintain mobile applications. Finally, we aim to achieve "resource fungibility," an awkward term that we will dive into further later.</p><p>As for my <strong>bias</strong>, I am a web developer with over a decade of both full stack and web development experience, more recently focused on React for about 5 years and almost no professional native development experience. I began this evaluation with a considerable bias toward React Native, given my comfort and experience with React. That said, I still remember when <a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/sunsetting-react-native-1868ba28e30a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Airbnb sunsetted React Native</a> and a few other industry stories about React Native, so I am aware that organizations have experienced mixed results. I also have some personal skepticism with Google's ability to properly build and maintain a solid open source development framework and keep it alive for the duration I need it (hint: I did some Angular.js development and am <em>not</em> a fan of the latest version of Angular).</p><div><h3>Check yourself</h3><p>Keep your evaluation as objective as possible by paying attention to your bias and the bias of others.</p></div><p>Okay, enough about my context and my bias. Be sure to spend a few minutes writing down these points for yourself. The best way to keep your evaluation as objective as possible is to be aware of your biases.</p><h2 id="flutter-vs-react-native-criteria">Flutter vs. React Native criteria<a href="#flutter-vs-react-native-criteria">#</a></h2><p>Before we can evaluate Flutter and React Native we need to establish <strong>criteria</strong>, the principles and standards by which we may judge and decide.</p><p>Here is my list of criteria:</p><ul><li>Built-in Capabilities</li><li>Learning Curve</li><li>Resource Fungibility</li><li>Integration Support</li><li>Developer Experience</li><li>Performance</li><li>Community Support</li><li>Future Prospects</li></ul><p>Each criteria also needs a <strong>weight</strong>, a 1 to 5 rating that designates the level of importance for each criterion where 1 is the lowest importance and 5 is the highest.</p><h3 id="built-in-capabilities">Built-in Capabilities<a href="#built-in-capabilities">#</a></h3><p><strong>Weight: 5/5</strong></p><p><em><strong>Weight represents importance</strong></em> on a 1-5 scale where 1 is the least important criteria and 5 is the most important. If you are still not quite sure how the weights are being used, you can sneak a peak at the <a href="https://seanconnolly.dev/help-me-decide?s=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">final scores</a>.</p><p>This category covers the amount and quality of capabilities that are built into the framework itself.</p><p>I am ranking this criterion highly for a few reasons.</p><p>First, the more that is built into the framework, the <strong>faster</strong> our team can get started on any project and the less time we need to spend on <strong>maintenance</strong>.</p><p>Second, <strong>decision fatigue</strong> is real in the JavaScript/React community and it's been a real problem for me in my 5 years of React experience. It is good to have some choices, but I prefer to minimize the number of decisions that we need to make to get up and running.</p><p>Third, missing capabilities often require us to reach for a community solution. We do this all the time in web development, and it comes with significant risk as <strong>many community solutions do not stand the test of time</strong>. Even with well-maintained packages, there is <strong>significant overhead</strong> to staying on top of those ever-evolving dependencies (said Dependabot maintainers everywhere). Last, the more that is built into the framework, the more consistent applications are both within an organization and in the ecosystem itself. Consistency within an organization is beneficial for many reasons, and it is notoriously difficult when many teams are simultaneously solving their own problems and not necessarily checking in to see if others have already solved similar problems. Consistency across the ecosystem is beneficial too. Almost every tutorial or Stack Overflow question dealing with React has <em>something</em> that is inconsistent with the stack I am working in, whether it's using inline styles where we use Emotion, or they are using React Router where I am using the Next.js router, and so on.</p><p>Last, built-in capabilities lower the barrier to getting started with a proof of concept (POC). POCs need to be expendable so you want to minimize any up front investment. A framework with more built-in capabilities will accelerate your ability to go from nothing to a working POC in short time.</p><p>When it comes to built-in capabilities, I broke this up into 3 categories: components, navigation, and testing.</p><h4 id="components">Components<a href="#components">#</a></h4><p>Flutter provides a full <a href="https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Widget catalog</a> that includes the basic building blocks like text, buttons, containers, drawers, inputs, etc. This widget catalog also has built-in support for animation and motion, painting effects and layouts.</p><p>React Native provides a much smaller set of very basic built-in components. Looking for a community solution, I searched for something equivalent to <a href="https://material-ui.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Material-UI</a>, which I have used in many web applications, but had a difficult time finding something even close to the comprehensive suite of components you get with Material UI. I found <a href="https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">react-native-paper</a> and <a href="https://reactnativeelements.com/docs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">react-native-elements</a> and found them a bit underwhelming in both volume of components and customization flexibility. There may be better component libraries out there, but the fact that you need to find one in the community or create your own is a problem.</p><p>As a web developer, I have worked with many component libraries like Bootstrap, Semantic UI, Material UI, and fully custom design systems and I can say with certainty that I am fatigued from the industry thrashing and fragmentation in this category. Components are such a core part of frontend development that variance just in the component library you choose leads to variance in the entire application. And if you happen to choose a library that falls into obsolescence (looking at you, Semantic UI), you either carry the weight of abandonware or are forced to rewrite. While I don't think it is <em>difficult</em> to write custom components, it <strong>takes time</strong> that my stakeholders would rather be spent on building a product and iterating in market with real users.</p><h4 id="navigation">Navigation<a href="#navigation">#</a></h4><p>With React Native, you must choose between <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/navigation#react-navigation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">React Navigation</a> or <a href="https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">React Native Navigation</a> (and there are even other options out there).

that provides a unique view of your files by removing the
hierarchy constraints typically imposed on files and folders. In other words, it allows you to think about your
files not as objects <em>stored</em> in folders, but as objects that can be <em>filtered</em> by folders.</p>
<p>Below, the file path <code><span>/A/B/C</span></code> yields the <a href="https://amoffat.github.io/supertag/glossary.html#term-intersection"><span>intersection</span></a> of all of the files that have been tagged with the
tags <code><span>A</span></code>, <code><span>B</span></code>, and <code><span>C</span></code>. Notice that the resulting files do not live <em>inside</em> of the full path,
they simply appear there because they’ve been tagged with each part of the file path.
Supertag takes care of rendering a dynamic directory
structure through which you can filter and navigate these files.</p>
<p><img alt="Supertag file intersection" src="https://amoffat.github.io/supertag/_images/intersection-opt.gif"></p><div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>You <code><span>/A/B/C</span></code> yields the same file intersection as <code><span>/C/B/A</span></code>, <code><span>/B/C/A</span></code>, etc. It doesn’t matter what
order that the path tags are in, because we’re simply dealing with the intersection of the tags.</p>

These people are losing their bank accounts now and we need a solution,’ VVD parliamentarian Helma Lodders told the paper.</p><p>The banks are threatening to close the accounts of people with American nationality, unless they can furnish them with a US tax number. But there are thousands of Dutch nationals in the <a href="https://accidentalamericans.nl/">Netherlands with American nationality</a> who do not have a tax number because they have never lived in the country and may not even have realised they are also American.</p><p>The legislation, known as FATCA – Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act – requires all US citizens to supply the government with information about any assets they hold abroad, including bank accounts, houses and more. It also requires non-US banks with American clients to furnish the IRS with information about those holdings.</p><p>In the Netherlands some 20,000 people are thought to fall into the accidental American category.</p><p>A spokesman for the Dutch banking association said that people caught in the FATCA trap have had several years to sort out their individual situations. ‘Many Dutch banks which do business in the US cannot ignore their rules,’ the spokesman told the NRC.</p><p><strong>Europe</strong></p><p>Hoekstra told MPs ahead of Tuesday evening’s debate that the banks have agreed not to close the accounts of people who have started dealing with the red tape. In addition, the EU is preparing a letter to the US authorities calling for talks on the issue at an EU level, he said.</p><p>Earlier this year, DutchNews.nl reported that <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2020/04/accidental-americans-hit-by-us-consulate-corona-closure/">consulate closures</a> were causing long delays for people who were trying to sort out their paperwork.</p><p>The only other way open to Dutch Americans is to renounce their American nationality. This, however, comes at a prohibitive cost to many– the fee went up from $450 to $2,350 in 2014. They also have to prove they have paid US taxes for the past five years.</p><div onclick="window.location.href='https://www.dutchnews.nl/donate-to-dutchnews-nl/'"><div><h4>Thank you for donating to DutchNews.nl</h4><p>The DutchNews.nl team would like to thank all the generous readers who have made a donation in recent weeks.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>It has long been said that from 1973 to 1983, the American automotive industry was stuck in a rut that is now referred to as the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaise_era" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaise_era" target="_blank">Malaise Era</a>. This period of time, marked by some of the most underwhelming, gutless, depressing cars ever to come out of the United States, was bookended on the frontside by the energy crisis and the need for manufacturers who had focused purely on displacement and horsepower to shift their thinking to focus instead on efficiency, at a time that “efficiency” may as well have been a word from a foreign language to them. To compound things, emission controls added to vehicles beginning in 1974 pushed vehicle performance even further down, while often actually compromising fuel economy!</p>



<p>Looking back on this era as a car fan, most cars coming out of Detroit were incredibly depressing, underwhelming, and unmemorable. </p>



<p>So why would I bring this up on a blog where I normally talk about computing or technology topics? Because I believe that we’ve now firmly entered the PC Malaise Era. (I want to highlight right now that when I say PC in this post, I mean “Windows PC”. If I say Mac anywhere in this post, you’ll know I mean Macs.)</p>



<h4>Windows and the Neverending Pursuit of Moar Power</h4>



<p>From the earliest versions of Windows through Windows 7 (arguably most intensely with Windows Vista), Microsoft pushed and pushed the technical boundaries of computing, repeatedly asking for more memory, processor power, and eventually graphics processing power with each major revision of the OS. PC manufacturers repeatedly responded by opting for faster and faster Intel processors (eventually adding multiple cores), more and more RAM, and incredibly powerful graphics processors.</p>



<p>But during this “muscle computing” era, most vendors and most customers weren’t thinking at all about saving energy; even laptops shipped with comedically large, high wattage power adapters and ludicrously large batteries. (During the development of Windows Longhorn, we had to rely on high-end gaming laptops to deliver decent enough performance for customer-facing demos.)</p>



<p>With Windows 8, Microsoft’s single-minded focus on tablet computing pushed the PC platform physically towards tablets – but the lack of software that was a) optimized for touch and tablets, and b) optimized for a decent trade off of energy and performance led to an OS that failed to ever get off the ground.</p>



<p>As we look at Windows 10, things have shifted. Microsoft has focused the OS in more intensely on performance and battery life. Arguably they’ve gotten the OS closer to the silicon than they ever have before, and the Surface devices have surely helped with that. Still, the lack of applications optimized for the platform, and lack of <a href="https://www.autonationdrive.com/blog/2019/october/15/essential-auto-101-what-is-a-halo-car.htm" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.autonationdrive.com/blog/2019/october/15/essential-auto-101-what-is-a-halo-car.htm">halo</a> applications (no, not like the game) that truly pull the platform forward and make it something that consumers come to the platform <em>for.</em> </p>



<h4>Defining Malaise</h4>



<p>Now, this new PC Malaise Era isn’t “malaise” in the sense of the original era. There, we were gifted with these gutless wonders – cars that, regardless of the cubic inches, delivered mind-bogglingly low performance figures. In this PC Malaise Era I’m suggesting, the opposite is actually the case; Intel’s single-minded focus on performance and clock speed for decades leaves us with a default PC platform that is great with power, particularly when plugged in. But consumers want thin and light devices that don’t waste energy, get hot, and burn up their battery while doing nothing but standing by.</p>



<p>To me, we are in a PC Malaise Era due to four specific conditions:</p>



<ol><li>The inability of Intel to deliver processors that deliver a great harmonization of energy efficiency <em>and</em> high performance</li><li>The beginning push of ARM-based processors into the mainstream computing realm, in the form of Apple silicon.</li><li>The lack of compelling energy efficient halo <em>applications</em> on Windows to pull consumer desire for the platform forward</li><li>The lack of PC computing <em>devices</em> that push the platform forward overall.</li></ol>



<h4>Intel Processors and The Stop of the Tock</h4>



<p>For years, Intel iterated their processor architecture using an iterative tick/tock process. An initial tick release would typically push the processor architecture forward, and a following tock release would iterate on that tick, refining the story. Then the process would repeat.</p>



<p>However in 2016, Intel shifted away from this approach to a slower three-stage iterative <em>process</em>, <em>architecture, </em>and<em> optimization </em>approach. </p>



<p>Intel, long-focused on displacement, is now challenged to make processors that are energy efficient thoughout the day (<em>particularly when running Windows and legacy Win32 applications</em>), delivering performance when needed, and intense energy efficiency the rest of the time.</p>



<h4>ARM Processors and the big.LITTLE Mix</h4>



<p>ARM-based processors, particularly now with the introduction of Apple silicon, are now entering mainstream computing. The approach of using an ARM processor for a ”computer”, whether an Apple silicon Mac or Qualcomm-based “Windows on ARM” PCs, is still fraught with challenges for consumers, as there’s no guarantee any legacy application from one platform’s Intel architecture OS will run on their ARM-based computing devices.</p>



<p>Regardless of the architecture, the future appears to be based around an approach initially coined by ARM as big.LITTLE. A hybridized blending of high-performance cores and energy efficient cores, in concert with an OS designed to exploit them and applications tolerant of this platform flexibility, allows devices to deliver performance when pushed, and energy efficiency when standing by and running in the background. A big.LITTLE approach is a &lt;ahem/&gt; core tenet of Apple’s latest processors, the A14 for iOS/iPadOS, and M1 for Macs.</p>



<p>Intel has talked about, and earlier this year introduced, their own approach toward “<a href="https://www.extremetech.com/computing/313803-intel-makes-it-official-hybrid-cpu-cores-arrive-with-alder-lake" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.extremetech.com/computing/313803-intel-makes-it-official-hybrid-cpu-cores-arrive-with-alder-lake">hybrid cores</a>”, which will be available in 2021. But Apple’s notable lead, particularly now with the introduction of M1-based hybrid Macs, puts Intel even farther behind in the… tortoise/hare potato sack race of blended/hybrid computing, which could eventually allow Intel PCs to push performance when needed and deliver energy efficiency the rest of the time. But this is a brass ring that has, personally, seemed repeatedly elusive for Intel to grab.</p>



<h4>No PC Halo Applications</h4>



<p>I wish I could point to a bunch of applications that consumers and businesses just can’t live without, that blend the Windows 10 application development APIs, touch optimization, and energy efficiency. I wish I could point to a few of them. But, frankly I can’t. There’s no killer app on Windows that isn’t an old Coleman stove… a crusty old Win32 app you pull out of the garage when you need it on your new PC, but it’s not the reason why you buy a new PC. Even Slack and Teams, the supposedly must-have business applications in business, are both based on the bloated Electron runtime, not on Windows 10-native tooling that could deliver the best experience for the platform.</p>



<h4>PC Platform Stagnation</h4>



<p>Finally, much like Detroit during the automotive Malaise Era, it feels like as OEMs struggle to create devices with a great blended mix of performance and power conservation, they’re also struggling to deliver… anything new or innovative. Even Microsoft’s Surface devices have fallen into a pretty predictable iterative cycle, with little new or innovative to show for it, perhaps excepting the ARM-based Surface Pro X, which suffers from the lack of x64 application emulation, and poor battery life when used primarily with x86 applications. (Admittedly, if you need x86 or x64 applications most of the time, an ARM-based PC isn’t a great idea.)</p>



<h4>So how do we escape this PC Malaise Era?</h4>



<p>I’ve said before that Windows has never escaped x86. I’m still not sure if it ever can. So the challenges then come down to three things:</p>



<p>A) Can Intel succeed where they’ve failed for the last 5+ years, at building hybrid processors? The next year to two years should answer this question.</p>



<p>B) Can Microsoft succeed at finally getting application developers to write platform-optimized, energy-respectful, halo applications for the PC? I’ve been writing about the Windows Store for a long, long time. A long time. And I’m still not sure how Microsoft can light a fire under Windows application developers when they’ve lost that mindshare.</p>



<p>C) Can Microsoft begin pushing the Surface platform forward again? This one’s completely up to Microsoft. I’ve seen the rumors of the next Surface Pro… and it’s more of the same – evolutionary, not revolutionary.</p>



<p>I guess we will see in the next 3-5 years whether Intel can cross this chasm; if they can’t, then the future likely belongs to ARM, and that future will likely mean less and less to Microsoft, outside of running classic Win32 applications on x64/x86 Windows.</p>

November 30, 2020 | https://blog.peterzhu.ca/ruby-inplace-bug/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.peterzhu.ca/ruby-inplace-bug/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div itemprop="articleBody"> <blockquote> <p>This is an article in a multi-part series called <a href="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/adventures-in-ruby">“Peter’s Adventures in Ruby”</a></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>It is strongly recommended that you read my <a href="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/creating-ruby-strings-c">article on the ways to create Ruby strings in C extensions</a> if you’re not familiar with Ruby’s C string API</p> </blockquote> <p>Here’s a story of string corruption in MRI when the wrong function is used to create the Ruby string. But before that, let me explain a few Ruby features that you may not know.</p>  <h2 id="editing-a-file-in-place"> Editing a file in place <a href="#editing-a-file-in-place"></a> </h2> <p>Consider the following script:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>while</span> <span>gets</span>
  <span>puts</span> <span>$_</span><span>.</span><span>gsub</span><span>(</span><span>/perl/</span><span>,</span> <span>"ruby"</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>And then we run:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>echo</span> <span>"I like perl, it is my favourite language."</span> <span>&gt;</span> temp.txt

<span>$ </span>ruby <span>-i</span> script.rb temp.txt

<span>$ </span><span>cat </span>temp.txt
I like ruby, it is my favourite language.
</code></pre></div></div> <p>As you can see, with the <code>-i</code> flag we can read the text file line-by-line through <code>gets</code>, and replace that line with whatever is in the standard output (the <code>puts</code>).</p> <h2 id="backup-files"> Backup files <a href="#backup-files"></a> </h2> <p>Let’s run the script above again, but instead of the <code>-i</code> we pass to Ruby, let’s pass <code>-i.bak</code>:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>echo</span> <span>"I like perl, it is my favourite language."</span> <span>&gt;</span> temp.txt

<span>$ </span>ruby <span>-i</span>.bak script.rb temp.txt

<span>$ </span><span>cat </span>temp.txt
I like ruby, it is my favourite language.

<span>$ </span><span>cat </span>temp.txt.bak
I like perl, it is my favourite language.
</code></pre></div></div> <p>All this does is create a backup file (with the extension <code>.bak</code> in our case) with the original contents before modifying it.</p> <h2 id="run-the-ruby-script-line-by-line"> Run the Ruby script line-by-line <a href="#run-the-ruby-script-line-by-line"></a> </h2> <p>Did you know we can do the above, but with a single line of Ruby code? Consider the following Ruby script:</p>  <p>And then we run it as the following (notice we are running the script with an extra <code>-p</code> flag):</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>echo</span> <span>"I like perl, it is my favourite language."</span> <span>&gt;</span> temp.txt

<span>$ </span>ruby <span>-pi</span>.bak script.rb temp.txt

<span>$ </span><span>cat </span>temp.txt
I like ruby, it is my favourite language.

<span>$ </span><span>cat </span>temp.txt.bak
I like perl, it is my favourite language.
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The <code>-p</code> flag conviniently wraps your code around an implicit <code>while gets(); ...; puts $_; end</code>.</p> <h2 id="begin-blocks"> <code>BEGIN</code> blocks <a href="#begin-blocks"></a> </h2> <p>One question you might ask yourself is, if I use the <code>-p</code> flag, how do I do global setup? Ruby’s got a feature for that! Enter <code>BEGIN</code> blocks.</p> <blockquote> <p>Note: Ruby’s keywords are case sensitive, so <code>BEGIN</code> is not the same as <code>begin</code>.</p> </blockquote> <p>So now, if we do:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>BEGIN</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>puts</span> <span>"It is starting!"</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>$_</span><span>.</span><span>gsub!</span><span>(</span><span>/perl/</span><span>,</span> <span>"ruby"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>And then we can run it as follows:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>echo</span> <span>"I like perl, it is my favourite language."</span> <span>&gt;</span> temp.txt

<span>$ </span>ruby <span>-pi</span>.bak script.rb temp.txt
It is starting!

<span>$ </span><span>cat </span>temp.txt
I like ruby, it is my favourite language.

<span>$ </span><span>cat </span>temp.txt.bak
I like perl, it is my favourite language.
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Notice we get the <code>It is starting!</code> output in the terminal, and not in the file.</p> <h2 id="shebang"> Shebang <a href="#shebang"></a> </h2> <p>We want to minimize the number of characters we have to type. So we can omit the flags from the terminal and instead include it in the file using a shebang line.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/ruby -pi.bak</span>

<span>BEGIN</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>puts</span> <span>"It is starting!"</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>$_</span><span>.</span><span>gsub!</span><span>(</span><span>/perl/</span><span>,</span> <span>"ruby"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>And then we can run it as follows:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>echo</span> <span>"I like perl, it is my favourite language."</span> <span>&gt;</span> temp.txt

<span>$ </span>ruby script.rb temp.txt
It is starting!

<span>$ </span><span>cat </span>temp.txt
I like ruby, it is my favourite language.

<span>$ </span><span>cat </span>temp.txt.bak
I like perl, it is my favourite language.
</code></pre></div></div> <p>In fact, Ruby doesn’t actually check that the binary in the shebang is valid, just that it ends in <code>ruby</code>. So the following shebang would have worked too:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>#!/some/invalid/dir/ruby -pi.bak</span>
</code></pre></div></div>  <p>Ok, we finally have everything we need to reproduce the bug. Consider the following script:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/ruby -pi.bak</span>

<span>BEGIN</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>GC</span><span>.</span><span>start</span><span>(</span><span>full_mark: </span><span>true</span><span>)</span>
  <span>arr</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
  <span>1000000</span><span>.</span><span>times</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>x</span><span>|</span>
    <span>arr</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"fooo</span><span>#{</span><span>x</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>$_</span><span>.</span><span>gsub!</span><span>(</span><span>/perl/</span><span>,</span> <span>"ruby"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>So what do we expect it to do? Well, this is pretty much the same script as the one in example #5 (while doing some seemingly useless work in the <code>BEGIN</code> block).</p> <p>So let’s run this script:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>echo</span> <span>"I like perl, it is my favourite language."</span> <span>&gt;</span> temp.txt

<span>$ </span>ruby script.rb temp.txt

<span>$ </span><span>cat </span>temp.txt
I like ruby, it is my favourite language.

<span>$ </span><span>cat </span>temp.txt.bak
<span>cat</span>: temp.txt.bak: No such file or directory

<span>$ </span><span>ls
</span>script.rb
temp.txt
temp.txto106
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Wait what!?!? Where is our backup file <code>temp.txt.bak</code>? And what is <code>temp.txto106</code>? Let’s inspect these files.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>cat </span>temp.txt
I like ruby, it is my favourite language.

<span>$ </span><span>cat </span>temp.txto106
I like perl, it is my favourite language.
</code></pre></div></div> <p>It seems like <code>temp.txto106</code> contains the original file (the one that should have been the backup file). So what’s going on? You might have guessed it, because the wrong C function was used to create Ruby strings!</p> <h2 id="so-whats-wrong"> So, what’s wrong? <a href="#so-whats-wrong"></a> </h2> <p>When you pass the flag <code>-i.bak</code> to Ruby, it parses the arguments in your shebang from a Ruby string read from the contents of the Ruby script<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. We then set the extension of the backup file by calling <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/66efe373116d510c05d57964b5ffa47f1c6e565c/io.c#L12989"><code>ruby_set_inplace_mode</code></a>. This function is really simple, it’s defined like this.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>void</span>
<span>ruby_set_inplace_mode</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>suffix</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>ARGF</span><span>.</span><span>inplace</span> <span>=</span> <span>!</span><span>suffix</span> <span>?</span> <span>Qfalse</span> <span>:</span> <span>!*</span><span>suffix</span> <span>?</span> <span>Qnil</span> <span>:</span> <span>rb_fstring_cstr</span><span>(</span><span>suffix</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The problem here is the usage of <code>rb_fstring_cstr</code>, which (similar to <code>rb_str_new_static</code>) expects a pointer to a region of memory that is not <code>free</code>‘d before this Ruby string is swept (because it sets the pointer of the Ruby string directly to the string passed in).</p> <p>To explain using diagrams (don’t we all love diagrams?), we have a Ruby string of the flags in the shebang stored in <code>argv</code>. We then call <code>ruby_set_inplace_mode</code> and set <code>ARGF.inplace</code> to a Ruby string that points to <code>.bak</code>.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-inplace-bug/bug1.png" height="300"> </figure> <p>But then when we no longer need <code>argv</code>, but <code>ARGF.inplace</code> is still pointing to the string that <code>argv</code> was referencing.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-inplace-bug/bug2.png" height="300"> </figure> <p>So then we call <code>GC.start</code> which guarantees that <code>argv</code> is swept, and then we create a large amount of <code>fooo#{x}</code> strings. This helps us make sure the string <code>-pi.bak</code> is overwritten and so we get <code>ARGF.inplace</code> pointing to some other value. So then once the script terminates, the backup extension we use is <code>o106</code> (or some other gibberish).</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-inplace-bug/bug3.png" height="300"> </figure> <h2 id="the-fix"> The fix <a href="#the-fix"></a> </h2> <p>The fix only changes one line and a few characters!<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> The solution is instead of calling <code>rb_fstring_cstr</code> to create the string, we use <code>rb_str_new</code>, which allocates memory for the string and copies over the contents of the string. Once we do that, we no longer need to ensure that the original string is not <code>free</code>‘d.</p> <h2 id="acknowledgements"> Acknowledgements <a href="#acknowledgements"></a> </h2> <p>I would like to acknowledge <a href="https://www.eightbitraptor.com/">Matt Valentine-House</a> as the co-discoverer of the bug and the co-author of the fix.</p>  </div> </article> </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <div><p>«Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita</p><p>mi ritrovai per una selva oscura,</p><p>ché la diritta via era smarrita.»</p><p>«Midway upon the journey of our life</p><p>I found myself within a forest dark,</p><p>For the straightforward pathway had been lost.»</p></div><p>-&nbsp;<span>Dante Alighieri</span></p><p><span id="docs-internal-guid-831a4fb5-7fff-d639-36d7-57d1a4f7bed9"><p><span>I've rediscovered some long forgotten joys since I signed up for SpaceHey yesterday, and even if my mind and thoughts are undoubtedly clouded by nostalgia and a longing for simpler times, certain ideas sprang up in my mind, and I think there is truth to them. I'd like to share these with you, hoping that together we can plant even more new seeds and promote healthier growth in our online communities.</span></p><p><span>One of the biggest takeaways is the difference when compared to the passive consumption on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter or Instagram (or basically any other social network out there at the moment). Here I am not presented with an infinite amount of content for me to scroll through, I actively have to seek it out. In doing that my relationship with the network and the content available throughout it changes from a <i>reactive</i> one to a <i>proactive</i> one. It becomes an experience more similar to browsing wikipedia for example, guided by curiosity and a genuine sense of exploration. I haven't been able to find the right words so far to explain it in writing, but experiencing it first-hand is a visceral feeling where the contrast between the two approaches is instantly felt, one feels empty and passive, the other engaging and exciting.</span></p><p><span>Adding the like button may have boosted engagement, MAUs (Monthly Active Users), profits and so much else. Algorithms that choose what content to show us did the same. Having tried SpaceHey which lacks these features, what's painfully obvious is that we didn't ask for them, they (and others) were imposed on us to promote the growth of these platforms while disregarding our real needs. They may have boosted some internal metrics and to some extent were justified as a "nice" thing for users, but because of their "success", these "features" were doubled-down on, optimized further and eventually led us to the AI-driven, mostly passive-consumerism, infinity pools that social networks are today.</span></p><p><span>Likewise, standardization (across the board) led to successes, many principally of business value, for the big companies dominating the space. It inevitably led to a loss of individuality however, a digital communism if you will. Users were forced to express themselves in pre-approved formats, that gradually got more and more standardized and limited to the point where today you can't even make the text in your Facebook posts bold (you can choose from a predefined set of stickers though!). To what end has it been? Moderation is as hot of a topic as it ever was, with no definitive solution in sight, in the meantime we jump on every new app that let us express ourselves more, only to fall victim to the all powerful algorithms that ultimately decide which content actually reaches people.</span></p><p><span>There's been a trend in the last few years of longing for the "old internet", places like Yahoo! GeoCities, personal blogs and yes, Myspace profiles, where individuals, rather than big organized groups, were the producers of content. Places where somebody with minimal technical knowledge could put pencil to paper and create something unique that reflected who they were, and where others were actually inclined to discover their creations. Nowadays everything is (or isn't) found through an algorithm (whether the almighty Google Search or a social network's own ranking algorithm) and the services that allowed this kind of content to be created in the first place have either shut down or followed the money and moved on.</span></p><p><span>SpaceHey seems to bring back what made those original services special, introducing both an instrument through which pages can be created and a vibrant platform that allows their discovery. My </span><span><a href="https://spacehey.com/alex">SpaceHey profile</a> requires almost no scrolling, yet I get to convey my own message to you, in the format that I choose. There is an incredible sense of empowerment and liberty in this approach. I can see this as a place where I can connect with people, a starting point when it comes to connecting with the world at large, a place I can call home knowing full well that I will have to leave in order to explore, since after all, there is no endless wall to scroll through.</span></p><p><span>A massive <b>thank you</b> to </span><span><a href="https://spacehey.com/an">An</a> who, by bringing us back to simpler roots showed in such a powerful way how far we have strayed. Wow, can you feel how fresh the air is here! I wish you all the best on this adventure, luck in facing the obstacles that you'll encounter and on filling up those "coming soon" pages (let me know if you need help!).</span></p><p><span>I don't know how long it'll last, but in a way, it doesn't matter.</span></p></span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A new software version is always an exciting prospect,&nbsp;they can teach&nbsp;an old dog new tricks and potentially make her run faster than before on the same old legs. That is the magic of software, bringing new capabilities seemingly out of thin air. While it&nbsp;is easy to groom your beloved&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIBO" title="">Aibo</a>&nbsp;with the latest software update, updating a&nbsp;whole pack of dogs might not be. Different ages, models, versions... It can get complicated.</p><div><p>Putting robot dogs aside, the situation is the same for virtually any piece of software. In a simple scenario a major upgrade can be a humdrum operation;&nbsp;Say you upgrade your hobby project to the latest major release 15 minutes after launch, take another 15 to&nbsp;whip up a quick&nbsp;blurb on how easy it was to upgrade, post it to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/" title="">Hacker News</a> and&nbsp;let the audience marvel at your life in the seventh heaven&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding_edge_technology" title="">bleeding edge</a>.</p><p>The above is a true story, and is pretty amazing. Today the software industry&nbsp;moves at an exhausting pace. The continuous stream of updates provided to frameworks and libraries goes on day and night, every day there is a prospect of an upgrade, big or small. It is also part of the&nbsp;lure of the&nbsp;omnipresent&nbsp;<a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html" title="">microservices architecture</a>&nbsp;where systems are constructed from small independent and decoupled pieces of software.</p><h3>No microservice is an island</h3><p>But in reality a microservice is not 100% isolated from the outside world. An abundance of shared code is used, and it can&nbsp;take time to get all the parts to be compatible with the latest&nbsp;baseline software version. Say if you were to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js" title="">Node.js</a> it is likely that you have&nbsp;thousands of dependencies from the NPM catalogue. You can be ready to go in 15 minutes, but it's&nbsp;unlikely that the entire&nbsp;ecosystem is.</p><p><a href="https://www.ibexa.co/blog/on-cat-herding-and-securing-web-dependencies">Herding dependencies</a> is&nbsp;easier with platforms like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)" title="">Go</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deno_(software)" title="">Deno</a>, which have <a href="https://www.ibexa.co/blog/deno-is-the-same-as-node.js-but-different">a more extensive standard library</a>, but still you might need to tweak your own codebase quite a bit for a new&nbsp;a major version. That depends on the backwards compatibility changes, how conservative the project leadership is,&nbsp;and ultimately&nbsp;pure luck. 🍀</p><p>Obviously there is no single timeline on when you can upgrade to a new version. For cases where you have few dependencies, and the benefits (often improved performance) are so beneficial that you can go for an upgrade in days or weeks of the launch. Especially if you've already prepared in advance by working with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Stages_of_development" title="">betas and release candidates</a>&nbsp;as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Palmer" title="">Arnold Palmer</a> put it:&nbsp;<em>The more I practice the luckier I get.</em></p><h3>Case Ibexa DXP and PHP 8.0</h3><p>For <a href="https://www.ibexa.co/developer-portal/what-is-ibexa-dxp">Ibexa DXP</a> our core backend technology is built the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symfony">Symfony</a> framework&nbsp;that in turn runs on&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP" title="">PHP</a>. For both of these there are new versions arriving in late 2020. The Symfony framework will receive a new&nbsp;5.2 version. As per <a href="https://semver.org/" title="">semantic versioning</a>&nbsp;this is a minor version, which will be compatible with the current Symfony 5.1&nbsp;release used in <a href="https://www.ibexa.co/blog/product-launch-introducing-ibexa-dxp-3.2">Ibexa DXP 3.2</a>. The upgrade is planned for&nbsp;<a href="https://portal.productboard.com/ibexa/1-ibexa-dxp/tabs/16-release-3-3" title="">Ibexa DXP 3.3 LTS</a> due in early 2021.</p><p>For PHP 8.0 things are more tricky. The new version has some interesting <a href="https://www.php.net/releases/8.0/en.php" title="">new language features</a>&nbsp;and increased performance potential with some caveats:</p><blockquote><p>Regarding performance JIT seems to be a mixed bag here [for PHP 8.0], slowing down at low concurrency and providing a significant improvement to throughput over OPCache Preloading only. More investigation needed, but here the case is not clear as it could hinder performance. JIT seems like something to be considered case by case for PHP.<br>-&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibexa.co/developer-portal/blog/benchmarks-php-7.4-8.0-jit-opcache-preloading-symfony">PHP 8.0 and 7.4 benchmarks on Symfony 5.2</a></p></blockquote><p>For us to upgrade Ibexa DXP to support PHP 8.0 we need to make sure our software is validated&nbsp;with it and that the PHP ecosystem (including Symfony and a number of other libraries) is good to go with this as well. With all that in place we could achieve technical compatibility with PHP 8.x so that it will run with it. Nothing has been decided, but we could&nbsp;potentially add unofficial support for PHP 8 in Ibexa DXP 4.0. This doesn't mean&nbsp;you couldn't technically run Ibexa DXP on PHP 8.0 before 4.x, but for us to provide support for our software we need to guarantee compatibility.</p><p>Providing forward compatibility is one thing, but backwards compatibility is where it gets trickier. As software engineers our team would like to have access to the latest language features. But we also&nbsp;need to maintain discipline to make our software useful in as many environments as possible. Since Ibexa DXP is a development platform, we cannot make PHP 8.0 a requirement before it is commonplace.</p><p>But while our hands are tied from using some of the new capabilities in 8.0 until it becomes a hard&nbsp;requirement, it does not limit our partners and customers to use it from the day we officially support it and when it works on their specified environment. Implementation projects are free to use the latest syntax and other features, since ownership of that code&nbsp;belong&nbsp;to the integrators building on Ibexa DXP technology.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Making a call about an upgrade is striking a balance. Is the upgrade worth the risk, or should you follow the principle&nbsp;<em>If it ain't broken, don't fix it</em>. Say for a robotic racing&nbsp;greyhound, would you do an upgrade that would make her 9% quicker but also potentially turn her into a hellhound at the time of a full moon? Not a realistic scenario, but a business&nbsp;can suffer serious damage&nbsp;from a botched software upgrade.</p><p>For software vendors this is even more difficult, moving forward and fixing technical debt while maintaining backwards compatibility can be done. But it's a lot more work to do so, and does require consideration for the long term rather than quick wins. But the key here is continuous evaluation, and tracking the market trends. Up-to-date and well maintained software is not only more relevant for business, but is also more attractive for developers to work with. This is why we at Ibexa&nbsp;already looking into and talking about upcoming technologies, even if official support is not yet decided upon.</p><p>Regardless of whether you're an end user or purveyor of software, you should consider at least the following things before proceeding with a software upgrade from the perspective of that specific version&nbsp;— in the short, medium and long term:</p><ul><li>Readiness of your codebase?</li><li>Maturity of the ecosystem?</li><li>What benefits would you get?</li><li>What risks are there?</li><li>Do you need to be able to roll back? Can it be done?</li><li>Is the time<em>&nbsp;suitable</em>&nbsp;for the update?</li><li>Do you have the resources for the update?</li><li>Is delaying just pushing&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt#:~:text=Technical%20debt%20(also%20known%20as,approach%20that%20would%20take%20longer." title="">technical debt</a>&nbsp;forward?</li></ul><p>Sometimes the right choice is to upgrade right away to keep your application fresh and up-to-date, as leaping multiple major versions can be more work than upgrading one by one. Also one option is that an application should not be upgraded. If the piece of software is scheduled for <a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/sunsetting" title="">sunsetting</a>,&nbsp;then you should perform only critical updates and spend the time and effort elsewhere. Lifetime of a codebase is limited; At times this is by design or circumstance, but more often due to lack of regular maintenance.</p><p>At Ibexa we build future-proof software, but keep&nbsp;an eye on backwards compatibility.</p>

<p>After all, modern life can be stressful and quite frankly overwhelming sometimes. Being constantly connected, trying to multitask, and striving for better on a daily basis can be draining and affect our mental well-being.</p>
<p>In that context, journaling can be a powerful way to relieve some of this anxiety and stress and help us thrive. As a testament to this, some of the greatest minds of this world, such as Albert Einstein or Thomas Edison, have spent hours journaling, keeping track of their knowledge, achievements, dreams, and goals.</p>
<p>Do you want to know how journaling can help you be more productive, happier, or more relaxed?</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll explain what journaling is before highlighting the key benefits of keeping a journal. We’ll also deep-dive into some of the best journaling techniques before explaining how to start journaling. All you need to do is sit back, relax and enjoy the read ;)</p>
<h2>What is journaling?</h2>
<p>Journaling is the practice of writing your thoughts, emotions, or goals in a journal or diary on a regular basis. It’s also a way to connect with yourself, express your emotions, track your everyday life, your feelings, your dreams, your fears, and experiences. This self-care technique has been <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/jun02/writing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">shown</a> to help strengthen mental well-being and boost the immune system and has therefore enjoyed increased popularity over the last decade.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Journaling</h2>
<h3>Help Manage Your Stress</h3>
<p>Journaling can be a powerful therapeutic outlet to help relieve stress. Indeed, by expressing yourself on paper, writing down your fears, worries, and even recording negative experiences you’re facing at work or in your personal life, journaling can be cathartic. It can provide a safe and private space where you can freely express negative thoughts or repressed emotions you don’t feel you can share with anyone, allowing for emotional cleansing.
As a result, writing about stressful experiences can be an effective stress management tool that can help reduce stress and its impact on your emotional and physical health.</p>
<h3>Boost Your Memory</h3>
<p>A study published by the <a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/xge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Journal of Experimental Psychology</a> revealed that writing is an excellent way to boost your working memory. Indeed, the same way athletes need to train to stay in good shape, the study showed that your brain needs to keep active and engaged in order to stay sharp. Some of the key factors contributing to the improvement of your working memory when writing regularly include focusing on a single task without distraction, thinking of ways to describe events, and recalling descriptive words.</p>
<h3>Help You Fight Depression</h3>
<p>Journaling can be a great way to help you work through depression, navigate what’s happening in your life, and ultimately heal.</p>
<p>The reality is, the more you know about your depression, the better you can manage it. By helping you track your triggers and identify regular thoughts, patterns, and behaviors, journaling can help you better understand where your sadness comes from and define a plan to control it better.</p>
<p>Journaling also gives you an opportunity for some positive self-talk and acts as a reminder of your biggest achievements and your best memories.</p>
<p>By identifying your happiest moments and helping control your emotional triggers, writing can help also improve your mood.</p>
<h3>Help You Achieve Your Goals</h3>
<p>A journal is an excellent goal tracking tool. Indeed, by writing down clearly defined goals and recording the steps you’re taking in order to achieve them, a journal can help you fulfill your wildest dreams and aspirations. As a testament to this, a study led by the Dominican University in California even found that people are 42% more likely to reach their goals if they write them down. The reason is simple; writing down your goals can help declutter your mind, give you clarity, and help you create a vision for your future, ensuring your daily habits align with your priorities.</p>
<h3>Enhance Your Creativity</h3>
<p>Creative journaling is a very efficient way to boost your creativity. Your journal is your secret garden. Indeed, no one else has access to it, and nobody else will ever see or read what is in your journal. This helps relieve any kind of societal pressure and paves the way for your imagination to grow and your incredible ideas to flow unhampered.
Besides, not only can you write down your wildest dreams in a journal without fear of being judged, but you can also use your journal as a way to relax and free your mind from the daily draining clutter and noise, allowing your best ideas to mature and come to fruition.</p>
<h2>Best Journaling Techniques</h2>
<h3>Bullet Journaling</h3>
<p>A bullet journal can be used as an organization tool to keep track of your goals, daily achievements, write your to-do lists, or brainstorm ideas. It can also be used as a reminder tool. A bullet journal provides you with a one-stop-shop for all your ideas and allows you to plan, organize, and track your entire life in one consolidated place. The great thing about a bullet journal is that it can be adjusted at any time to fit your needs.</p>
<p>If you like structure and keep organized by listing things, a bullet journal might be a great tool for you.</p>
<p><strong>How to use a bullet journal?</strong>
You can either buy a pre-made bullet journal or create your own. Based on Caroll’s method, your bullet journal should feature an index, along with future, monthly, and daily logs allowing you to plan and track tasks, meetings, appointments or events, and add reminders. The tasks should be represented by a dot bullet, events by a circle bullet, and notes by a dash bullet. Priority tasks should also be highlighted using an asterisk, and completed tasks will be represented by an x. This way, you’ll get a birds-eye view of all the things you need to do this month and be able to adjust as you go.</p>
<h3>Freewriting</h3>
<p>Freewriting is a journaling technique that allows you to write about anything, for a set period of time without having to worry about grammar or self-editing. It was popularized by <a href="https://nataliegoldberg.com/books/writing-down-the-bones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Nathalie Goldberg</a> and encourages writers to take a leap of faith, freely write their thoughts, emotions, and let their creative juices flow. This technique is a powerful way to help content creators and academics boost their creativity while brainstorming ideas.</p>
<p><strong>How to freewrite?</strong>
The most important thing to do when you freewrite is to forget about language rules. Clear your mind, set a timer (ideally between 10 and 20 minutes), and write. Keep writing without ever stopping regardless of the grammatical mistakes or typos until the time limit is over. It’s important to write even if you think it’s stupid or useless, as this is the only way to unleash your creativity with this journaling technique. From this disorganized, seemingly meaningless writing, something powerful will emerge that you can use in your academic or official writings, even if it takes a few freewriting sessions.</p>
<h3>Art Journaling</h3>
<p>If you want to explore fun ways to express yourself, your thoughts, or your emotions, an art journal might be a fantastic tool for you! Whether you use drawings, paintings, sketches, doodles, collages, or a mix of these and writing, keeping an art journal can be an efficient way to help you channel your emotions. It can also help you express your dreams, relax, plan, and organize your life, boost your creativity, or reduce your stress.</p>
<p><strong>How to use an art journal?</strong>
With art journaling, there aren’t any specific rules. The idea is for you to have fun with it. Gather supplies such as paint, gel pens, scissors, markers, and old magazines and start creating ;)</p>
<h3>Unsent Letters</h3>
<p>If you need to process your feelings regarding a particular person, the unsent letter journaling technique could prove helpful. The idea is to put your emotions into words on a piece of paper, from anger and frustration to admiration or love. Sometimes writing down your feelings towards someone addressing them directly in your writing can help you navigate and channel your emotions and process them. As a result, this widely used technique can help you get closure, collect your thoughts, release repressed emotions, and even give you more clarity about specific feelings.</p>
<p><strong>How to write unsent letters?</strong>
When writing an unsent letter, make sure you’re completely honest and genuine and don’t repress from writing down your true feelings. Make sure you freely express your anger, frustration, sadness, or disappointment. Nobody will ever receive or read this letter, so unleash all of your thoughts. Also, unsent letters can be written to anyone or anything, so there is no limit as to who or what you can write a letter to. You can also start your letter with a prompt such as ‘’ What I need to tell you is’’ or ‘’What I don’t like about you is’’ to help you get started.</p>
<p>There are many other powerful journaling techniques, such as dream journaling, writing a reflective journal, or morning pages.</p>
<h2>How to Start Journaling</h2>
<p>Your journaling process should be unique to you. Don’t try and create a perfectly organized journal, instead strive for genuine self-expression and authenticity. To help you get started, we’ve listed below a few tips to follow:</p>
<div>
    <h3>Pick your journaling tool</h3>
    <p>It can be a notebook, a password-protected WordPress website, or an app. Some of the best journaling apps include Day One, Journey, and Grid Diary. Note that, while journaling apps all have different features, strengths, and weaknesses, Day One is regularly touted as the best journal app.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Write a little every day</h3>
    <p>Pick a time of the day where you can allocate ten or fifteen minutes to writing and make it a habit. Consistency is key if you want to make the most out of your journaling practice.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Start with short entries</h3>

<p>This past summer, at the World Wide Developer Conference (WWDC), Apple announced that it would be transitioning from Intel to its in-house Apple Silicon over the next two years. Apple said the first Macs with in-house silicon would arrive by the end of 2020. Well, here we are, and we have a new MacBook Air, 13 inch MacBook Pro, and a Mac mini. </p>
<p>The form factors of these devices are identical, but the real magic is the new M1 chip inside. Is it as fast as Apple claims? Will it run our apps properly? What does the M1 chip mean for desktop computing generally? In this article, I will try and answer these questions.</p>
<h2 id="the-importance-of-apple-silicon">The importance of Apple Silicon</h2>
<p>As I outlined in my articles about <a href="https://tech-bytes.net/posts/2020/6/29/apple-silicon-what-it-means-for-the-mac-and-the-computer-industry">Apple Silicon</a> and the broader industry move from <a href="https://tech-bytes.net/posts/2020/8/16/riscy-business-the-future-of-x86">ARM to x86</a>, Apple's transition from Intel to in-house silicon is significant. Apple hasn't made a platform shift in fifteen years, not since it switched from IBM's PowerPC architecture to Intel in 2005/2006. </p>

<p>"M1" is the name of Apple's new in-house Mac chip. This ARM-based CPU is being used in Apple's 'entry-level' Macs, including the MacBook Air, Mac Mini, and MacBook Pro. Once again, Apple is blurring the line between consumer and 'pro' devices. </p>
<p>All chips have tradeoffs. Typically, it comes down to performance vs efficiency. Low power Intel chips might provide better battery life, but performance takes a hit. The previous Intel MacBook Air was a perfect example. M1 delivers a <em>considerable</em> performance advantage <em>and</em> outstanding battery life. As noted by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/mac-mini-and-apple-silicon-m1-review-not-so-crazy-after-all/3/#h2">Are Technica</a>, M1 stays cooler than Intel, even when under load. </p>

</div></div><div data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606694118380_26507"><div><p>Apple opted for a fanless design in the MacBook Air. As my podcast co-host <a href="https://www.krishans.ca/">Kris Hans</a> notes, the MacBook Air is essentially an "iPad in a clamshell design" running macOS. The fan in the MacBook Pro and Mac Mini allows the M1 chip to run faster and longer, before having to throttle down due to heat. However, it's worth noting that the difference is minimal. The MacBook Air still delivers incredible performance, and a casual user probably wouldn't even notice.</p>
<h2 id="so-many-benchmarks">So many benchmarks</h2>
<p>A constant among the reviews so far is that the M1 chip outclasses almost all Intel x86 chips on the market - with a few exceptions.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.krishans.ca/">Apple Insider</a>, Apple "has never put a strong emphasis on the gigahertz race." The M1 has one configuration in all three machines, meaning the user can only change the RAM and SSD configurations when purchasing a new computer. I'm confident future pro machines will allow for more configurations, but for consumer machines, this is a return to form for Apple. The simpler options remind me of Steve Jobs' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkVs4ZqWgN8">four-by-four matrix</a> which was intended to simplify Apple's confusing product line. Consumers don't care about gigahertz so why not make it simple for them?</p>
<p>In terms of raw performance, the M1 chip is incredible. According to Apple Insider, it outperforms pretty much every Intel competitor. </p>

    <span>“</span>In terms of single-core performance, the M1 MacBook Pro outshines all of the Macs on test, with a score that is a clear 54% better than its nearest rival, the 16-inch MacBook Pro. This makes it faster than a relatively-recent Intel Core i9, and even the Mac Pro’s Xeon, a chip family generally considered to be a workhorse of processing.<span>”</span>

At this point, I've read reviews by veteran Mac users such as <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/11/the_m1_macs">John Gruber</a>, as well as several professional video editors and photographers. <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/11/m1-macs-review/">Jason Snell from Six Colors</a> reports nine and a half hours of battery life for the new Air and a bit more for the new 13-inch Pro. Colin Smith from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJSeqsxHLMY">Photoshop Cafe</a> reported little battery drain even during the initial setup of the computer which involved downloading and installing gigabytes of apps. Office workers can expect to get a full workday out of the battery.</p><p>Perhaps what most incredible about the M1 chip is its ability to remain cool under load. As a happy MacBook Pro 16-inch owner, I can report that this laptop generally runs cool but certainly heads up when exporting audio or video, or when working in photoshop. John Gruber notes that M1 never really heats up during regular use, and barely so during multi-core benchmarking.</p><p>How the M1 uses memory has also changed. With the Unified Memory Architecture, M1 (like Intel chips) has a CPU and integrated graphics. The computer memory is "shared by both processor cores and graphics cores," according to <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3597569/with-m1-macs-memory-isnt-what-it-used-to-be.html">Jason Snell</a>. But, this is where the similarity ends.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="31" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606694565185_12232"><div>

  <blockquote data-animation-role="quote">
    <span>“</span>But in shifting its terminology to describe a unified memory architecture, Apple’s trying to point out that the M1’s approach is a bit different. The biggest difference is that in the M1, the memory is a part of the M1 architecture itself. There’s no memory slot or slots on the motherboard of an M1 Mac, nor is there an area where a memory chip has been permanently soldered on. Instead, the memory is integrated into the same package that contains the M1 itself.<span>”</span>

Mac laptops have had soldered memory for a long time, making upgrades difficult (or impossible) except for the most proficient computer technicians. Now, the prospect of upgrading memory is gone because everything lives on a single chip. </p><p>In terms of day-to-day performance, there is nothing to indicate that the average user would even know these Macs run on a new architecture. Rosetta 2, Apple's translation software, allows Apple Silicon Macs to run x86 apps. All indications point to roughly equivalent, or slightly slower, performance while running x86 apps on the M1. Six Colors reported x86 apps running at about 80 percent as fast as native code. Keep in mind this 80 percent was still faster than many Intel Macs. Apps designed for Apple Silicon run considerably faster, so things will only get better with time. Here is what John Gruber said about Rosetta 2.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="31" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606694565185_35795"><div>

It's up to the developer if these apps appear on the Mac App Store, but the prospect is interesting.</p><p>The big question going into this transition was "can Apple's ARM-based chips scale for a laptop or desktop computer?" Most definitely yes. It appears that Apple Silicon has no problem scaling up to compete with desktop-class x86 chips. Also, keep in mind that the M1 is the entry-level chip. In his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJSeqsxHLMY" tabindex="0">YouTube video</a>, Colin Smith said current Intel Mac owners shouldn't run out and purchase an M1 device for this reason. Imagine what an "M2" chip would be like? What if the iMac ships with two M1 chips? There's every reason to suspect that the performance gap between Apple Silicon and Intel will widen with the introduction of professional-grade chips.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606694565185_37912"><div>

<p>The internet has stormed the world and is now a significant part of our everyday lives. This means that businesses and organizations need to get on board with this new reality.</p>
<p>Companies that refuse to do so have failed in the past. They will continue to fail for many years to come, making the transition to the digital world a necessity at this point. An increased number of IT projects come to be every day as businesses try to get on board with the digital world.<br>However, not all IT projects are created equal. Practice shows that the vast majority of IT projects do not make it to the finish line. A <a href="https://www.pmi.org/-/media/pmi/documents/public/pdf/learning/thought-leadership/pulse/pulse-of-the-profession-2017.pdf?v=6f297ba2-3627-4f66-b47e-e6bc2f658a7a&amp;sc_lang_temp=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">report</a> published by Project Management Institute (PMI) in 2017 evaluated the percentage of IT projects that fail or do not meet the finish line in their designated timeline. The report showed that almost 14% of all IT projects fail, representing total failures. There are other statistics that one should be worried about. Out of the 86% projects that did not wholly fail, 31% of projects did not meet their expected goals, 49% won’t complete on time, and 43% of the projects exceeded their designated budget.<br>This article will first discuss several main reasons why IT projects fail and then try to match these problems with corresponding solutions.</p>

<h2>Inaccurate Requirements</h2>
<p>One essential part of any project is its starting phase when the clients, management, and development team discuss and attempt to understand the client’s requirements, which is when most problems arise. Any misunderstanding during this time can bring one of the fatal mistakes for any IT project. The famous cartoon about a tree swing project explains this concept very well.<br>This image illustrates the kind of misunderstandings possibly occurring during the requirement-gathering phase. There are many reasons behind this inaccuracy, and a <strong>communication gap</strong> is one of those.</p>
<p>Not carrying out a <em>feasibility analysis</em> is another reason. Whenever customers explain what they want, this information does not necessarily translate well into the final scope. This is when feasibility analysis comes into play – you can use it to filter out junk and gather realistic requirements. Letting the client know beforehand can save both the company and the client a lot of time and money.</p>
<h2>Little to no involvement of Stakeholders</h2>
<p>Another major problem that has been a leading cause of IT projects fail is little to no project stakeholders’ involvement, i.e., project managers, the customer, or the end-user. In a large number of cases, usually, the waterfall methodology is utilized. According to this method, project requirements are gathered during the start, and then a linear management approach has opted in which a sequential project plan. This approach results in the project’s failure because the stakeholder becomes unaware of any ongoing progress. There are times when specific questions might arise, and the development team might be confused as to what to do, but the customer is <strong>not going to be</strong> there to guide them. Without a hand-holding approach to communication with customers, you may create something completely different from what they required.<br>One such decision taken in the absence of the customer can completely alter the fate of the project. <em>The agile approach</em> is more preferred in software development projects because customers and all other stakeholders are involved in <strong>every development stage</strong>. And any decision related to original changes is handled <strong>with the customer’s consent</strong>. This feature makes <em>Agile</em> extremely easy for the development team to decide while adhering to customer’s requirements.</p>
<h2>Changing Project Objectives</h2>
<p>Changing project objectives is another problem that development teams face. While revised goals might not lead to complete project failure, what they do lead to is extraordinary delays in the project timeline, increased project costs, and many other problems that come with these two.<br>Once again, the two approaches, i.e., the waterfall methodology and the agile methodology, deal with the changing project objectives in very different manners. Since <em>The Waterfall</em> is a linear management approach, project objectives changes can have devastating effects. For example, the team would have to start again from scratch, as there was no room for modifications.<br>The <em>Agile</em> methodology, on the other side, is all about working in small iterations. At the end of each iteration, there is an opportunity for change. While changing the project objectives is still not ideal, there is room for these modifications. However, these projects usually cost more and maybe take slightly longer than a project with fixed objectives.</p>
<h2>Unforeseen Risks</h2>
<p>As Donald Rumsfeld said,</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>There are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say, we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns—the ones we don’t know we don’t know.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>According to Donald, there are usually three kinds of risks</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Known Knowns</strong>, i.e., the ones that a team usually expects and is prepared to face</li>
<li><strong>Known Unknowns</strong>, i.e., these refer to the issues that have a slight potential of becoming a risk and</li>
<li><strong>Unknown Unknowns</strong> – these are the most dangerous of all as they arrive when everything is going alright, and you’re least prepared for any risk.</li>
</ol>
<p>The report by the Project Management Institute shows that unexpected risks account for 27% of the total IT project failures. This problem is one of those that you cannot do anything about other than being ready for it. A recent example of one such risk was the current global pandemic that turned the entire world upside down and led to many important IT projects’ failure. There wasn’t much that the development teams could do about it except those utilizing agile methodologies. Agile allows teams to be flexible and leave room for any transformations and modifications that might take place during the unexpected risk. A group of software engineers who practiced agile methodologies is better equipped to cope with such problems.</p>
<h2>Inaccurate Estimations</h2>
<p>Making correct estimations is perhaps one of the most critical parts of a project. Simultaneously, it is also one of the significant reasons behind delayed projects or going over the budget. Whenever a project is about to be started, customers require both a quote and a timeframe to complete it. This is when everyone from the development team to testing and project managers needs to come together to make accurate estimations about the price and the timeline of the project.<br>An accurate estimation of the cost includes considering everything that needs to be done and leaving a margin for unexpected expenses that may arise during the project. The same can be said about the project timeline, i.e., the team needs to evaluate everything that might consume time or cause delays in the project timeline.</p>
<h2>Dependency Delays</h2>
<p>While many IT projects are relatively simple and are carried out by small, individual teams, that does not hold for other large and complex IT projects. In such cases, multiple teams or numerous companies are working on the project at a given time. When tasks are divided between various software engineers, designers, testers, and so on, all team members <em>share</em> the overall work necessary for the project. This dependency means each team needs to complete their part of the project <em>before</em> even attempting a higher stage.<br>This condition is what causes delays in many projects and sometimes leads to project failure altogether. Some studies show that <a href="https://www.atspoke.com/blog/it/reasons-for-it-project-failure/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">dependency delays have cause almost 23% of the projects to fail</a> to reach their finish line. There is not much that could be done, especially in large IT projects where a single team cannot carry out the task, and there is no other option but to integrate more teams into the project.<br>A better approach to this problem is to divide the work into teams to reduce their dependability on each other. Since that is not 100% possible, contingency plans must also roll in place — the management must have a backup plan for each part of the project. If a team fails to deliver on time, a backup team must always be there to help them reach the goal on time.</p>
<h2>Lack of Resources</h2>
<p>Once again, this problem has been linked to an issue we discussed previously. A lack of resources, monetary resources, and human resources, is only caused when the team makes inaccurate estimations. It is habitual of the development teams to undermine the scope of work of a particular project or to understate the costs associated with each part.<br>When the project starts, the development team becomes overwhelmed with work and demands more human resources to be brought on to the group or run out of money and require more budget to fulfill the project goals.</p>
<h2>Poor Project Management</h2>
<p>Last but not least is the most important of all, i.e., project management. A better-managed project can help avoid all the problems mentioned above of an IT project and successfully see it to completion. On the other hand, bad project management can lead to any one of the issues discussed above. If a manager is not doing his job well, it may lead to inaccurate estimations of required human resources, or the project costs cause unusual delays in the project. A good project manager sets realistic timelines, understands the problems that a member of their development team might face, and forms a communication bridge between the development team and the stakeholders.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>To sum it all up, all these problems can be easily avoided, and a lot of past and existing projects could be made more successful. One of the steps that need to be taken by <strong><a href="https://codecoda.com/en/blog/entry/the-codecoda-software-development-process">software development</a></strong> teams is opting for more agile and adaptive development methodologies that are not rigid and allow room for change. These methodologies help deliver the projects on time and help the teams overcome any financial or human resource problems. Other than that, project managers of such projects need to bring their A-game to work and ensure that each …</p></div></div>

      <p>Tutanota gehÃ¶rt zu den wenigen E-Mail-Anbietern, die standardmÃ¤ÃŸig alle eingehenden Mails verschlÃ¼sseln. Ein Urteil des Landgerichts KÃ¶ln zwingt das hannoversche Unternehmen nun jedoch zum Einbau einer Funktion, mit der Ermittler einzelne PostfÃ¤cher Ã¼berwachen und Mails im Klartext lesen kÃ¶nnen.</p>

<p>Tutanota will Beschwerde gegen den Beschluss einlegen, diese hat jedoch keine aufschiebende Wirkung. â€žWir mussten daher bereits mit der Entwicklung der Ãœberwachungsfunktion beginnenâ€œ, erklÃ¤rte eine Sprecherin Mitte November gegenÃ¼ber câ€™t. Sollte die Beschwerde Erfolg haben, werde man die Funktion nicht aktivieren beziehungsweise wieder entfernen.</p>
<h3 id="nav_abweichende__0">Abweichende Rechtssprechung</h3>
<p>Das KÃ¶lner Urteil ist bemerkenswert, weil es von der Rechtsprechung anderer Gerichte abweicht. So hatte im Sommer <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Mailanbieter-Tutanota-Staatsanwaltschaft-wollte-Chef-in-Beugehaft-nehmen-4908806.html">das Landgericht Hannover entschieden</a>, dass Tutanota im rechtlichen Sinn keine â€žTelekommunikationsdiensteâ€œ erbringt oder daran mitwirkt â€“ und deshalb auch nicht zur TelekommunikationsÃ¼berwachung verpflichtet werden kann. Die hannoverschen Richter verwiesen wiederum auf ein Grundsatzurteil des EuropÃ¤ischen Gerichtshof (EuGH) von 2019. Diesem zufolge sind E-Mail-Dienste keine Kommunikationsdienste.</p>
  <a-script name="132" needs-consent="" src="https://a.teads.tv/page/87298/tag"></a-script>
  

<p>Das KÃ¶lner Gericht sieht Tutanota dennoch als â€žMitwirkendenâ€œ bei der Erbringung von Telekommunikationsdiensten. Folglich mÃ¼sse das Unternehmen die Ãœberwachung ermÃ¶glichen. Das Urteil, das câ€™t vorliegt, nennt allerdings weder den Namen noch den Betreiber des Telekommunikationsdienstes, an dem Tutanota angeblich mitwirkt. Aus Sicht des Unternehmens ist das Urteil deshalb â€žabsurdâ€œ.</p>
<h3 id="nav_lka_will__1">LKA will Postfach Ã¼berwachen</h3>






  


  <a-ad height="250" instant="" layout="responsive" media="(min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 767px)" preload-distance="200" safeframe="" sizes="300x50,300x75,300x100,300x150,300x250,320x50,320x75,320x100,320x250,fluid" targeting="{&quot;kw&quot;:[&quot;E-Mail&quot;,&quot;E-Mail-Provider&quot;,&quot;Gerichtsurteil&quot;,&quot;LKA&quot;,&quot;Tutanota&quot;,&quot;VerschlÃ¼sselung&quot;,&quot;Ãœberwachung&quot;],&quot;mpos&quot;:[&quot;2&quot;],&quot;themenhub&quot;:&quot;yes&quot;}" type="gpt" unit="/6514/www.heise.de/ct/ct-inhalt" width="300"></a-ad>



<p>In dem Fall geht es um eine Erpressungsmail, die von einem Tutanota-Postfach aus an einen Autozulieferer gesendet worden war. Tutanota sieht sich nun gezwungen, bis Jahresende eine Funktion zu programmieren, die es dem Landeskriminalamt Nordrhein-Westfalen ermÃ¶glicht, dieses Postfach zu Ã¼berwachen.</p>

<p>FÃ¼r die anderen Nutzer soll sich dadurch nichts Ã¤ndern, ihre Mails sollen weiter standardmÃ¤ÃŸig verschlÃ¼sselt werden. Gleichwohl sieht Tutanota eine einmalige Umgehung der VerschlÃ¼sselung als Datenschutz- und Sicherheitsrisiko fÃ¼r letztlich alle Kunden an.</p>
<p><strong>[Update, 30.11., 12 Uhr]</strong> Wie Tutanota betonte, betrifft die ÃœberwachungsmaÃŸnahme nur die neu eingehenden unverschlÃ¼sselten E-Mails. Bereits verschlÃ¼sselte Daten sowie Ende-zu-Ende verschlÃ¼sselte E-Mails in Tutanota kann das Unternehmen nicht entschlÃ¼sseln.<strong> [Update]</strong></p>
<p>AuÃŸer Tutanota speichern auch einige andere Anbieter alle eingehenden Mails in verschlÃ¼sselter Form. Bei Protonmail ist das ebenfalls Standard, Posteo und Mailbox.org bieten die VerschlÃ¼sselung als Option an.

If engineering operations investments are not done iteratively, pragmatically or in a timely way, these investments will likely result in negative returns. Your organization's effectiveness and efficiency will not be improved. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.managers.app/content/images/2020/11/engineering-onboarding-begin.jpg" alt="engineering onboarding - engineering operations" srcset="https://blog.managers.app/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/engineering-onboarding-begin.jpg 600w, https://blog.managers.app/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/engineering-onboarding-begin.jpg 1000w, https://blog.managers.app/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/engineering-onboarding-begin.jpg 1600w, https://blog.managers.app/content/images/size/w2400/2020/11/engineering-onboarding-begin.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>engineering onboarding - engineering operations</figcaption></figure><p>Too vague? Let's talk about a concrete example: Do you remember your <strong><em>engineering onboarding experience? &nbsp;</em></strong></p><p>This example might resonate a bit more with people who were fortunate enough to join a startup that ended up hiring more engineers after they joined. One of the areas falling under engineering operations is managing engineering onboarding. Ramping up new engineers quickly to start solving your customers' problems has a direct impact on your business' bottom line. </p><p>One onboarding experience I remember vividly is the day I joined a startup with less than 10 people as their first engineering hire. Over the next 10 years the engineering team grew from 2 to 500+. Here is a summary of how engineering onboarding progressed over time: &nbsp;</p><p>I remember having to assemble my own computer on my first day. I &nbsp;was eager to get things up and running and eager to start learning the codebase. As you can imagine there was no onboarding process to speak of. The founders built some stuff and there were code repositories, but there were no instructions for setting up the development environment, or for testing and deploying code. There were no design or architecture diagrams. Lots of tribal knowledge was hidden in places which I would figure out slowly over the next few months. As we started hiring more engineers I took turns walking new hires through setting up their development environment, giving them an overview of the architecture and getting them familiar with the tribal knowledge. We were already stretched thin, working &nbsp;long hours and shipping product features as fast as possible. Onboarding new engineers was happening more frequently and taking many hours from our days. It was a pain and it had to be mitigated!</p><figure><img src="https://blog.managers.app/content/images/2020/11/engineering-onboarding-organize.jpg" alt="engineering onboarding – iterative improvements" srcset="https://blog.managers.app/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/engineering-onboarding-organize.jpg 600w, https://blog.managers.app/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/engineering-onboarding-organize.jpg 1000w, https://blog.managers.app/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/engineering-onboarding-organize.jpg 1600w, https://blog.managers.app/content/images/size/w2400/2020/11/engineering-onboarding-organize.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>engineering onboarding – iterative improvements</figcaption></figure><p>We started putting together some documentation (a checklist) for new engineers. The motivation was to &nbsp;help new engineers ramp up quickly and become productive but also to reduce the load on ourselves. Organizing the information around what the new engineers needed was an iterative improvement for our onboarding process and definitely helped both the new engineers as well as the engineers responsible for onboarding them. These checklist documents evolved and got more detailed over time. We built some tools to automate setting up local environments. We created some documents outlining design decisions, and the architecture of our systems. </p><p>Our improved onboarding process still had a few shortcomings: </p><ul><li>Our onboarding checklists and presentations got stale pretty quickly, despite our best efforts. We added to presentations and asked new engineers to update checklists, but keeping onboarding documents up-to-date was not our primary focus, and as at most startups, things changed very quickly. </li><li>Our onboarding was not centralized. As the engineering team grew each code-centric team (api team, ui team) created its own onboarding checklist. Engineers who were just joining the company didn't know about common processes. They didn't know how different systems were interdependent, and they had no view of the overall system design and architecture. They had no knowledge of common engineering expectations, scary production incidents from the recent past, or land mines to watch out for.</li></ul><p>We eventually assigned someone to own engineering operations and put together an onboarding curriculum for new engineers joining our organization. Onboarding evolved into a multi-week process that involved not only getting an overview of our engineering organization, walking through systems owned by different groups, and joining a deep-dive presentation, but also running through a product exercise to understand how our customers used the systems our engineers built. It was certainly far from the humble beginnings where I had to build my own computer and figure out all of this myself, but this story is not so uncommon and is certainly a fun one to reminisce about. </p><p>Not all startups get to a phase where they have to hire someone full-time to create an onboarding process as part of an engineering operations effort, but I believe the first iteration of onboarding documents and tools should start as soon as there is an engineer . Even if you have a team of one and don't plan to have a new hire for a year, the first iteration of onboarding documents should be done. This will not only start the iteration cycle to keep improving the onboarding process, but it is also important from the "bus-factor" perspective.</p><h3 id="areas-under-engineering-operations-">Areas Under Engineering Operations: </h3><p>Engineering onboarding is one area that falls under engineering operations but there are many others. Here are a few to keep in mind: </p><ul><li><strong><em>Defining engineering roles, levels and expectations: </em></strong><em>This means defining a set of responsibilities that you will hold every engineer in your organization to. It will not only help you coach and grow engineers in your engineering organization but will also help you hire the right people at the right levels.</em></li><li><strong><em>Creating an engineering hiring and interview process: </em></strong><em>Hiring good help is never a secondary task for a good engineering organization. Invest in collecting the right signals during the interview process, evaluating candidates and ensuring candidates walk away with good experiences and thoughts about your company regardless of the outcome of the interview. </em></li><li><strong><em>Implementing tools and processes around on-call rotations and reliability management:</em></strong><em> Teams who don't take reliability seriously can't build good software. Define expectations for how teams manage on-call rotations, production incident postmortems, and prioritization of follow-up action items. </em></li><li><strong><em>Establish/Improve engineering roadmap planning &amp; execution speed </em></strong></li><li><strong><em>Organize and contribute to community events such as tech talks, and conferences</em></strong></li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.managers.app/content/images/2020/11/image-30.png" alt="Why startups should invest in engineering operations" srcset="https://blog.managers.app/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/image-30.png 600w, https://blog.managers.app/content/images/2020/11/image-30.png 663w"><figcaption>Why startups should invest in engineering operations</figcaption></figure><h3 id="why-should-you-invest-in-engineering-operations">Why Should You Invest In Engineering Operations? </h3><p>Investing in engineering operations is usually deferred at startups. This is mainly because anyone who can work in engineering operations is usually busy with many other engineering related responsibilities, but<em> </em><strong><em>a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step </em></strong>and the first step must be taken as early as possible. &nbsp;</p><p>Starting and iteratively improving your engineering operations will have a huge impact on what your engineering organization will look like in years to come. On day one it will set the right tone for anyone who is just joining your team. If done right your engineering operations will ensure that every engineer understands your engineering philosophy, your values and your expectations for them. </p><h3 id="how-to-start-your-engineering-operations">How to Start Your Engineering Operations </h3><p>What you do and how you do it will really depend on the current stage of your engineering organization. As mentioned at the beginning of this post, your engineering operations processes need to be <strong>iterative</strong>, <strong>pragmatic</strong> and <strong>timely. </strong>These attributes help ensure that you are implementing a process with the right reasoning, and with a bottom-up approach that is actually solving a real problem. A process mandated from the top down which does not solve a real problem won't get adopted by engineers in your organization.</p><p>If you have multiple engineers joining your company every month I highly recommend hiring someone full-time to oversee you engineering operations. Hire someone who is technical, who understands how engineering teams work and what engineers do day-in and day-out, and who likes working with people. If they are passionate about helping teams, then that person can bring so much value to your engineering org. </p><p>If you are not hiring enough people to justify a full-time position, I suggest having an engineering manager or a technical project manager take ownership of engineering operations part-time. They can implement chosen areas of engineering operations.</p><p>Finally, you can also consider getting outside help if your team does not have the bandwidth to start iterating on areas of engineering operations. This person should be someone who has gone through the growing pains of engineering organizations in the past. It should be someone who is technical and values improving engineering operations iteratively, in collaboration with you and engineers on your team.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.managers.app/content/images/2020/11/engineering-operations-summary-image.png" alt="engineering operations - summary" srcset="https://blog.managers.app/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/engineering-operations-summary-image.png 600w, https://blog.managers.app/content/images/2020/11/engineering-operations-summary-image.png 946w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>engineering operations - summary</figcaption></figure><h3 id="key-takeaways-">Key Takeaways: </h3><p>Engineering operations is putting together tools and processes to help engineering organizations solve the right problems and solve them efficiently. </p><p>You should figure out engineering operations areas you need to invest in and start implementing them asap.

                    <article class="page">
	
<p>Let me share a story that I’ve heard too many times.</p>



<blockquote><p><em>”… We were developing an ML model with my team, we ran a lot of experiments and got promising results…</em></p><p><em>…unfortunately, we couldn’t tell exactly what performed best because we forgot to save some model parameters and dataset versions…</em></p><p><em>…after a few weeks, we weren’t even sure what we have actually tried and we needed to re-run pretty much everything”</em></p><p>– unfortunate ML researcher.</p></blockquote>






<p>And the truth is, when you develop <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/all-machine-learning-models-explained-in-6-minutes-9fe30ff6776a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ML models</a> you will run a lot of experiments.</p>



<p>Those experiments may:</p>



<ul><li>use different models and model hyperparameters</li><li>use different training or evaluation data,&nbsp;</li><li>run different code (including this small change that you wanted to test quickly)</li><li>run the same code in a different environment (not knowing which PyTorch or Tensorflow version was installed)</li></ul>



<p>And as a result, they can produce completely different evaluation metrics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Keeping track of all that information can very quickly become really hard. Especially if you want to organize and compare those experiments and feel confident that you know which setup produced the best result.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is where ML experiment tracking comes in.&nbsp;</p>


<div>
        <h2>In this article, you will learn:</h2>
        
</div>





<h2 id="what-is">What is ML experiment tracking?</h2>



<blockquote><p>Experiment tracking is the process of saving all experiment related information that you care about for every experiment you run.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>Experiment tracking is the process of saving all experiment related information that you care about for every experiment you run. This “metadata you care about” will strongly depend on your project, but it may include:</p>



<ul><li>Scripts used for running the experiment</li><li>Environment configuration files&nbsp;</li><li>Versions of the data used for training and evaluation</li><li>Parameter configurations</li><li><a href="https://neptune.ai/blog/how-to-track-machine-learning-model-metrics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Evaluation metrics&nbsp;</a></li><li>Model weights</li><li>Performance visualizations (confusion matrix, <a href="https://neptune.ai/blog/f1-score-accuracy-roc-auc-pr-auc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ROC</a> curve)&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Example predictions on the validation set (common in computer vision)</li></ul>



<p>Of course, you want to have this information available after the experiment has finished, but ideally, you’d like to see some of it as your experiment is running as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why?</p>



<p>Because for some experiments, you can see (almost) right away that there is no way they will get you better results. Instead of letting them run (which can take days or weeks), you are better off simply stopping them and trying something different.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To do experiment tracking properly, you need some sort of a system that deals with all this metadata. Typically, such a system will have 3 components:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Experiment database</strong>: A place where experiment metadata is stored and can be logged and queried</li><li><strong>Experiment dashboard</strong>: A visual interface to your experiment database. A place where you can see your experiment metadata.</li><li><strong>Client library</strong>: Which gives you methods for logging and querying data from the experiment database.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Experiment-dashboard.jpg?resize=682%2C383&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="682" height="383" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Experiment-dashboard.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Experiment-dashboard.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Experiment-dashboard.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Experiment-dashboard.jpg?w=1367&amp;ssl=1 1367w" sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>Of course, you can implement each component in many different ways, but the general picture will be very similar.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Wait, so isn’t experiment tracking like MLOps or something?</em></p>






<h3><strong>Experiment tracking vs ML model management vs MLOps</strong></h3>



<p>Experiment tracking (also referred to as experiment management) is a part of MLOps: a larger ecosystem of tools and methodologies that deals with the operationalization of machine learning.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>MLOps deals with every part of ML project lifecycle</strong> from developing models by scheduling distributed training jobs, managing model serving, monitoring the quality of models in production, and re-training those models when needed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That is a lot of different problems and solutions.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/MLOps-cycle-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/MLOps-cycle-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/MLOps-cycle-1.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/MLOps-cycle-1.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/MLOps-cycle-1.jpg?w=1366&amp;ssl=1 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>



<p><strong>Experiment tracking focuses on the iterative model development phase</strong> when you try many things to get your model performance to the level you need.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So how is experiment tracking different from ML model management?</p>



<p><strong>ML model management starts when models go to production:</strong></p>



<ul><li>streamlines moving models from experimentation to production</li><li>helps with model versioning</li><li>organizes model artifacts in an ML model registry</li><li>helps with testing various model versions in the production environment</li><li>enables rolling back to an old model version if the new one seems to be going crazy</li></ul>



<p>But not every model gets deployed.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Experiment tracking is useful even if your models don’t make it <br>to production (yet).</p></blockquote>



<p><strong>Experiment tracking is useful even if your models don’t make it to production</strong> (yet). And in many projects, especially those that are research-focused, they may never actually get there. But having all the metadata about every experiment you run ensures that you will be ready when this magical moment happens.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ok, if you are a bit like me, you may be thinking:</p>



<p><em>Cool, so I know what experiment tracking is. …but why should I care?</em></p>



<p>Let me explain.&nbsp;</p>






<h2 id="4-ways">Why does experiment tracking matter?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Building a tool for ML practitioners has one huge benefit. You get to talk to a lot of them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And after talking to hundreds of people who track their experiments in Neptune, I saw <strong>4 ways in which experiment tracking can actually improve your workflow.</strong>&nbsp;</p>






<h3><strong>All of your ML experiments are organized in a single place</strong></h3>



<p>There are many ways to run your ML experiments or model training jobs:</p>



<ul><li>Private laptop</li><li>PC at work</li><li>A dedicated instance in the Cloud&nbsp;</li><li>University cluster</li><li>Kaggle kernel or Google Colab</li><li>And many more.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Sometimes you just want to test something quickly and run an experiment in a notebook. Sometimes you want to spin up a distributed hyperparameter tuning job.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Either way, during the course of a project (especially when there are more people working on it), <strong>you can end up having your experiment results scattered</strong> across many machines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the <strong>experiment tracking system,</strong> all of your experiment <strong>results are logged to one experiment repository by design.</strong> And keeping all of your experiment metadata in a single place, regardless of where you run them, makes your experimentation process so much easier to manage.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p><em>“[experiment tracking system] allows us to keep all of our experiments organized in a single space. Being able to see my team’s work results any time I need makes it effortless to track progress and enables easier coordination.”</em><br>– Michael Ulin VP, Machine Learning @Zesty.ai</p></blockquote>



<p>Specifically, a centralized experiment repository makes it easy to:</p>



<ul><li>Search and filter experiments to find the information you need quickly</li><li>Compare their metrics and parameters with no additional work</li><li>Drill down and see what exactly it was that you tried (code, data versions, architectures)&nbsp;</li><li>Reproduce or re-run experiments when you need to</li><li>Access experiment metadata even if you don’t have access to the server where you ran them&nbsp;</li></ul>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="532" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Experiment-tracking-Neptune.png?resize=1024%2C532&amp;ssl=1" alt="Experiment tracking Neptune" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Experiment-tracking-Neptune.png?resize=1024%2C532&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Experiment-tracking-Neptune.png?resize=300%2C156&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Experiment-tracking-Neptune.png?resize=768%2C399&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Experiment-tracking-Neptune.png?w=1179&amp;ssl=1 1179w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>

<p>Additionally, you can sleep peacefully knowing that all the ideas you tried are safely stored, and you can always go back to them later.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Compare experiments, analyze results, debug model training with little extra work</strong></h3>



<p>Whether you are debugging training runs, looking for improvement ideas, or auditing your current best models, comparing experiments is important.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But when you don’t have any experiment tracking system in place:</p>



<ul><li>the way you log things can change,&nbsp;</li><li>you may forget to log something important</li><li>you may simply lose some information accidentally.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>In those situations, something as simple as comparing and analyzing experiments can get difficult or even impossible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With an experiment tracking system, your experiments are stored in a single place, you follow the same protocol for logging them, so those comparisons can go really deep. And you don’t have to do much extra.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p><em>“Tracking and comparing different approaches has noticeably boosted our productivity, allowing us to focus more on the experiments [and] develop new, good practices within our team…”</em><br>– Tomasz Grygiel, Data Scientist @idenTT</p></blockquote>



<p>Proper experiment tracking makes it easy to:</p>



<ul><li>Compare parameters and metrics</li><li>Overlay learning curves</li><li>Group and compare experiments based on data versions or parameter values</li><li>Compare Confusion Matrices, ROC curves, or other performance charts</li><li>Compare best/worst predictions on test or validation sets</li><li>View code diffs (and/or notebook diffs)</li><li>Look at hardware consumption during training runs for various models</li><li>Look at prediction explanations like Feature Importance, SHAP or Lime</li><li>Compare rich-format artifacts like video or audio&nbsp;</li><li>… Compare&nbsp;anything else you logged&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p><a href="https://ui.neptune.ai/o/neptune-ai/org/credit-default-prediction/compare?shortId=%5B%22CRED-93%22%2C%22CRED-92%22%2C%22CRED-91%22%2C%22CRED-89%22%2C%22CRED-85%22%2C%22CRED-80%22%2C%22CRED-70%22%5D&amp;viewId=a261e2d2-a558-468e-bf16-9fc9d0394abc&amp;legendFields=%5B%22shortId%22%2C%22valid_auc%22%2C%22learning_rate%22%5D&amp;legendFieldTypes=%5B%22native%22%2C%22numericChannels%22%2C%22numericParameters%22%5D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">See this view in app</a></p>



<p>Modern <a href="https://neptune.ai/blog/best-ml-experiment-tracking-tools" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">experiment tracking tools</a> will give you many of those comparison features (almost) for free. Some tools even go as far as to automatically find diffs between experiments or show you which parameters have the biggest impact on model performance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you have all the pieces in one place, you might be able to find new insights and ideas just by looking at all the metadata you logged. That is especially true when you are not working alone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Speaking off…</p>






<h3><strong>Improve collaboration: see what everyone is doing, share experiment results easily, access experiment data programmatically&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>When you are part of a team, and many people are running experiments, having one source of truth for your entire team is really important.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p><em>“[An experiment tracking system] makes it easy to share results with my teammates. I’m sending them a link and telling what to look at, or I’m building a view on the experiments dashboard. I don’t need to generate it by myself, and everyone in my team has access to it.”</em><br>– Maciej Bartczak, Resarch Lead @Banacha Street</p></blockquote>

<p>[Edit April 25 2019: Please note <strong>this is not an iPhone or Android app</strong>, and I have no plans to release it as such. You can use your phone or any other camera to take pictures of your ground coffee, but then you need to install the application on either OS X or through Python (on any operating system) to analyze the data. <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize/archive/master.zip">Download the application package here</a>.]</p>



<p>Today I would like to present an OS X application I have been developing for a few months. It turns out writing Python software for coffee is a great way to relax after a day of writing Python software for astrophysics.</p>



<p>When I started being interested in brewing specialty coffee a few years ago, one of the first things that irritated me was our inability to recommend grind sizes for different coffee brewing methods, or to compare the quality of different grinders in an objective way. Sure, some laboratories have laser diffraction equipment that can measure the size of all particles coming out of a grinder, but rare are the coffee geeks that have access to these multi-hundred thousands of dollars kinds of equipment.</p>



<p>At first, I decided to take pictures of my coffee grounds spread on a white sheet, and to use an old piece of software called <a href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">ImageJ</a>, developed by the National Institutes of Health mainly to analyze microscope images, to obtain a distribution of the sizes of my coffee grounds. This worked decently well, and allowed me to start comparing different grinders. Then <a href="https://www.scottrao.com/">Scott Rao</a> made me realize that a stand-alone application that doesn’t need a complicated installation and that is dedicated to coffee would be of interest to many people in the coffee industry. Probably just the 10% geekiest of them, but that’s cool.</p>



<p>I’m hoping that this application will help us understand the effects of particle size distributions on the taste of coffee. I don’t think the industry really kept us in the loop with all the laser diffraction experiments, so hopefully we can help ourselves as a community.</p>



<p>If you are interested in measuring the particle size distribution of your grinder, then this app is for you ‒ and it’s free. I placed it as “open source” on <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize">GitHub</a>, so if you are a developer, you are welcome to send me suggestions in the form of <em>push requests</em> (the developers will know what that means).</p>



<p>If you would like to get started, I suggest you read this quick <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize/blob/master/Help/coffee_grind_size_installation.pdf">installation guide</a>, which will explain how to download the app and run it even though I am not a registered Apple Developer. Then, you can choose to either read this <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize/blob/master/Help/coffee_grind_size_summarized_manual.pdf">quick summary</a> that will get you running with the basics, or this <strong><em>very</em></strong> detailed and wordy <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize/blob/master/Help/coffee_grind_size_manual.pdf">user manual</a> that will guide you through all the detailed options the application offers you.</p>



<p>I would like to show you an example of what can be done with the software. Below, I am comparing the particle size distribution of the Baratza Forté grinder, which uses 54 mm flat steel burrs, with that of the Lido 3 hand grinder, which uses 48 mm conical steel burrs. I set both grinders in a way that produces a similar peak of average-sized particles with diameters around 1 mm, but as you can see, the particle size distributions are very different ! The Forté generates way less fines (with diameters below 0.5 mm) and slightly less boulders (with diameters of approximately 2 mm), which is indicative of a better quality grinder.</p>

Each red bar corresponds to one kind of particle diameter generated by the Lido 3 grinder (smallest particles correspond to the leftmost bar, largest ones correspond to the rightmost bar), and their heights correspond to the total contribution of these kinds of particles, by mass. As you can see, the particles that contribute to the largest amount of mass have sizes just above 1 mm. The red circle shows the average particle diameter for the Lido 3, and the horizontal bars show the “characteristic width” of the distribution – this corresponds to the width that covers approximately 68% of all the distribution. Similarly, the blue line and the blue circle describe the distribution of the Forté grinder.</figcaption></figure>



<p>For now, the app is only intended to be used on OS X computers. But if you are running any other kind of system and know your way around Python, you can always download it directly from <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize">GitHub</a> and run it with your own installation of Python 3.</p>

<p>I would like to thank Scott Rao for his excitement when I shared this project idea with him, and for beta testing the software. I would also like to thank Alex Levitt, Mitch Hale, Caleb Fischer, Francisco Quijano and Victor Malherbe for beta testing the software.</p>

It was a great conference as always. Last year, <a href="https://200ok.ch/tags/emacsconf.html">200ok was able to host one of two real-world satellites</a>. This year, we are happy EmacsConf is happening, again. This time even in a 2-day format hosting many great talks! This blog post is accompanying <a href="https://emacsconf.org/2020/schedule/25/">Alain’s talk from yesterday</a>.</p>
<p>If you are working with complex nested JSON structures, you are probably familiar with jq which is like sed for JSON data and great at what it does. However, being a command-line tool like <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html">sed</a>, the feedback for writing queries and seeing their results is a discrete process and not live.</p>
<p>When working with Emacs, we are used to good auto-completion and live feedback. Formerly, this was mostly done with static input, but with modern completion frameworks like <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper">Ivy and Counsel</a>, this can be done with dynamic inputs, as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/200ok-ch/counsel-jq"><code>counsel-jq</code></a> is a package with which you can quickly test queries and traverse a complex JSON structure whilst having live feedback. Just call M-x counsel-jq in a buffer containing JSON, then start writing your jq query string and see the output appear live in the message area. Whenever you’re happy, hit RET and the results will be displayed to you in the buffer <em>jq-json</em>.</p>
<p>In this &lt;10m lightning talk, I’ll give a quick overview on how to use <code>counsel-jq</code> and how to build similar completion functionality:</p>

<p>The talk was generally well received. Some relevant (and really nice!) remarks were:</p>
<ul>
<li><q>The amount of time this will save is ‘scary’</q> (zeroed, IRC freenode, #emacsconf)</li>
<li><q>This is going to be a life saver &lt;3</q> (bhavin, IRC freenode, #emacsconf)</li>

<p>Finally, there were lots and lots of great talks at EmacsConf 2020. The organizers are working hard in post to get these talks processed and online. Already now, you can see the schedule and some resources online. The videos will follow soon.

<p>If you are interested in counsel-jq, you might be an Emacs user. If you are an Emacs user, you might also be into Org mode. If you’re into Org mode, you might be interested to use it ‘on the go’ on your phone, share Org files with a non-Emacs user or have access to your files from any web browser in the world. If so, we have you covered: We are building a free and open source implementation of Org mode without the dependency of Emacs - built for mobile and desktop browsers: <a href="https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice">https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1606731266812/l3lWPmA5Z.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>I've been working on the Elixir track on  <a target="_blank" href="https://exercism.io/my/tracks/elixir">Exercism</a> for a while in order to improve and better my approach to problem solving with Elixir. Coming from an OO background, there's no question that functional programming requires some rewiring of how you approach problems.</p>
<p>So what I aim to do with this series is to go over a single problem per post and not only work out the solution, but also go over the thought process and reasoning behind my solution. By doing so I hope to share some information for new comers to the language, and also receive some feedback from the Elixir community.</p>
<p>I've decided to skip the <code>Hello World</code> problem, and jump to <code>Nucleotide Count</code> as the first problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given a single stranded DNA string, compute how many times each nucleotide occurs in the string.</p>
<p>The genetic language of every living thing on the planet is DNA. DNA is a large molecule that is built from an extremely long sequence of individual elements called nucleotides. 4 types exist in DNA and these differ only slightly and can be represented as the following symbols: 'A' for adenine, 'C' for cytosine, 'G' for guanine, and 'T' thymine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The solution requires two functions: <code>count</code> which simply counts the number of a given nucleotide in the sequence, and <code>histogram</code> which returns a map of the each nucleotide and its count in the sequence. Let's start with the simple one: <code>count</code></p>
<p>The <code>count</code> function takes a string and a char as its arguments. It is expected that the functions returns and integer representing the number of occurrences of the char in the string. From the tests:</p>
<pre><code>NucleotideCount.count(<span>'CCCCC'</span>, ?C) == <span>5</span>
</code></pre><p>So what's the best approach here? Likely we're going to iterate over the characters in the string and count how many times the characters match the second argument. A quick check of the <code>Enum</code> module shows us <code>Enum.count\2</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>count(enumerable, fun)</p>
<p>Returns the count of elements in the enumerable for which fun returns a truthy value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds perfect for our case, so let's write our function:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>count</span><span>(strand, nucleotide)</span></span> <span>do</span>
    strand
    <span>|&gt; Enum.count(fn x -&gt; x == nucleotide <span>end</span>)
  <span>end</span></span>
</code></pre><p>We pipe the <code>strand</code> into the <code>Enum.count\2</code> function and if the character matches <code>nucleotide</code> it gets counted. Can we do better? We can make use of the ampersand or catch operator <code>&amp;</code>, to simplify the anonymous function</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>count</span><span>(strand, nucleotide)</span></span> <span>do</span>
    strand
    <span>|&gt; Enum.count(&amp;(&amp;1 == nucleotide))
  <span>end</span></span>
</code></pre><p>Does exactly the same, but is a little easier to read and a common pattern to replace the more verbose anonymous function syntax. The docs have more information on the <a target="_blank" href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/modules-and-functions.html#function-capturing">capture operator</a> if you want to read more.</p>
<p>So moving on to <code>histogram</code>. Looking at the tests, we can see what's expected from us:</p>
<pre><code>test <span>"repetitive sequence has only guanine"</span> <span>do</span>
  expected = %{?<span><span>A</span> =&gt;</span> <span>0</span>, ?<span><span>T</span> =&gt;</span> <span>0</span>, ?<span><span>C</span> =&gt;</span> <span>0</span>, ?<span><span>G</span> =&gt;</span> <span>8</span>}
  assert NucleotideCount.histogram(<span>'GGGGGGGG'</span>) == expected
end
</code></pre><p>We return the count of each nucleotide in the given string, including 0 occurrences. As we need to count each and every nucleotide in the string, even if it is absent, let's start by creating a constant at the top of our module</p>
<pre><code>  @nucleotides [<span>?A</span>, <span>?C</span>, <span>?G</span>, <span>?T</span>]
</code></pre><p>We can enumerate over this and use our previous <code>count</code> function to do our counting can't we? Ok, so we need to return a <code>Map</code> so it's best to head to the <a target="_blank" href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Map.html#content">Map docs</a> and see what we can make use of. After some perusing we find</p>
<blockquote>
<p>new(enumerable, transform)</p>
<p>Creates a map from an enumerable via the given transformation function.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the example given </p>
<pre><code>Map.new([<span>:a</span>, <span>:b</span>], fn x -&gt; {x, x} <span>end</span>)
<span>%{a: :a, b: :b}</span>
</code></pre><p>Seems ideal. As we need to return a map in the format <code>%{?A =&gt; 0, ?T =&gt; 0, ?C =&gt; 0, ?G =&gt; 8}</code> we should use the previously defined constant <code>@nucleotides</code> as the enumerable, and write a function that returns the nucleotide mapped to its count. We've already written the <code>count</code> function, so let's make use of that to give us</p>
<pre><code><span>def</span> <span>histogram</span>(strand) <span>do</span>
  <span>Map</span><span>.new</span>(<span>@nucleotides</span>, &amp;{<span>&amp;</span><span>1</span>, <span>count</span>(strand, &amp;<span>1</span>)})  
<span>end</span>
</code></pre><p>I've used the capture operator <code>&amp;</code> here instead of an anonymous function. What we've said here is that for each item in <code>@nucleotides</code> we want to return a map element of the type <code>{key, value}</code> where the key is the nucleotide character, and the value is the result of counting the nucleotide in the provided <code>strand</code> string.</p>
<p>If we run all the tests now we should see them all pass. Excellent, we've solved our first Elixir challenge on Exercism. Feel free to leave questions of other comments below.</p>
<p>Next week we'll tackle the <code>Secret handshake</code> problem. See you then.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<p>Back last winter – in the beforetimes, as they say now – I did a lot of thinking about how I could be most politically impactful in this election cycle. What I landed on was fundraising focused on my state legislature here in North Carolina. <a href="http://blairreeves.me/2020/08/31/thoughts-on-fundraising/">I wrote a blog about it</a> – one of the few I’ve gotten around to writing this year – and promised a follow-up on what I learned about the nuts-and-bolts of indie political fundraising. So here is that follow-up.</p>

<p>When I launched the <a href="http://longleafpineslate.org/">Long Leaf Pine Slate</a> in January of 2020, I figured I might be able to raise a few thousand dollars from family and friends. Not much, but something. We wound up doing a lot more than that. “The Slate” caught fire, and over the course of the year, became <i>the largest independent channel of funding based in the state</i> to Democrats running for the North Carolina state legislature. We raised more than $300,000 from over a thousand donors for a small group of our most strategic Democratic candidates running against vulnerable Republican incumbents.</p>
<p>That may not sound like much if you’re used to reading about Senate races which raise tens of millions. But at the state legislative scale, that’s actually very big money. Here’s some comparison to give you a sense of scale:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://blairreeves.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Q3-PAC-graphic.png" alt="" width="960" height="540" srcset="http://blairreeves.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Q3-PAC-graphic.png 960w, http://blairreeves.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Q3-PAC-graphic-300x169.png 300w, http://blairreeves.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Q3-PAC-graphic-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"></p>
<p>If the Long Leaf Pine Slate were a PAC, we’d have been the third-largest in the state and the single largest donor to Democrats based in North Carolina. Better: all of that money went to just a small group of our most important races. We raised almost as much money for those select Democrats as Duke Energy – basically the evil empire of right-wing power in North Carolina – gave to Republicans. (Directly, anyway. More on that later.)</p>
<p>The Long Leaf Pine Slate was nothing but <a href="http://longleafpineslate.org/">a website</a> that linked to an ActBlue fundraising page featuring our candidates and <a href="https://twitter.com/forwardcarolina">a Twitter account</a>. When donors gave, every dollar thus went directly to our candidates’ campaigns, nowhere else. The Slate was not, itself, a PAC – meaning we didn’t touch any money. You could not, for example, write a check to the Long Leaf Pine Slate. We didn’t even have a bank account. It was a 100% volunteer project.</p>
<p>Something similar to this – a no-nonsense ActBlue fundraising slate for state legislative candidates – should exist in every state. If you’re reading this, maybe you should start one, or join up with others who are. The purpose of this blog is to offer up some lessons learned, and maybe – just maybe – convince you, dear reader, that you can do this too.</p>
<h2>Why this model works</h2>
<p>An ActBlue fundraising page literally takes every dollar that is contributed and just slices it up among the campaign recipients you list. If there are ten campaigns listed, then each gets 10 cents. It’s that simple. What you see is what you get.</p>
<p>Old-fashioned PACs and parties act as intermediaries between a donor and the campaigns that need their money, and this causes lots of problems. Unfortunately, both (but particularly PACs) tend to be incredibly inefficient ways for donors to help the good guys, and wind up spending lots of money on things other than getting candidates elected. Very, very few people who give to PACs or parties ever actually look at the disclosures to see where their money went. Without naming names, I have been personally disappointed when I actually saw the spending disclosures from progressive PACs that I thought were good, but turned out to be big money-furnaces for politicos to get paid. (Caveat: yes, there are some good PACs too. They’re just rarer than you’d think.)</p>
<p>Besides its transparency, another large advantage of the ActBlue model is it allows organizations to raise substantially more money per candidate. If we’d been a PAC, we would’ve been limited to giving $5,400 per endorsed candidate – the legal maximum in North Carolina. But in the ActBlue model, <i>we’re</i> not the donor – in a way, we’re just pointing the actual donors to a list of candidates and saying, “these are the folks to give to.” So when you get lots and lots of folks giving money through that page, and each one can give up to the legal limit, it really adds up. ActBlue allows you to see just how much folks have given through your page, which is how we know the Slate raised so much money, almost entirely from folks who never would’ve found our candidates otherwise.</p>
<p>Fun fact: unlike the PACs, the Long Leaf Pine Slate is completely invisible on NC campaign finance reports. All the reports show is the donors, not the online channel they used. This keeps the Republican oppo researchers guessing and the media clueless. But the candidates know very well, because their ActBlue candidate dashboards show exactly what fundraising pages their money is coming from.</p>
<p>Legal stuff: every state is different, but this model is perfectly compliant everywhere I’m aware of. In North Carolina, there are certain conditions where you need to establish a political committee to promote candidates for office – like if you spend much money doing it. We thus had a (very, very low) spending limit for this project. This is the reason for the Slate’s <a href="http://longleafpineslate.org/">extremely basic webpage</a> – it’s literally just a hardcoded HTML file sitting on AWS. Dirt cheap! (I had lots of folks write in offering their help to create a much fancier webpage. This was very generous, but I could do that too. It’s basic because we couldn’t afford to do something nicer. I’m not kidding when I said our spending limit was low.)</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://medium.com/@longleafpineslate/the-long-leaf-pine-slate-44e6abc51318">this explanatory post</a> about the Long Leaf Pine Slate that covers why raising money matters, why it’s hard for most candidates, and why that difficulty enables a lot of corporate corruption in our politics.</p>
<h2>What we did</h2>
<p>After I built the website and set up the ActBlue page, I knew that making a splash on social would be vital to winning eyeballs and attention for the Slate. So pre-launch, I begged a lot of big-audience folks on Twitter for retweets. Believe me, it felt as cringeworthy as it sounds. But incredibly, some obliged, including <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonkander">Jason Kander</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Bakari_Sellers">Bakari Sellers</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffjacksonnc/">Jeff Jackson</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ClintSmithIII">Clint Smith</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/danpfeiffer">Dan Pfeiffer</a> and several more. The initial pop sent a lot of traffic and eyeballs on the project, and a little money. It made a difference. (Over time, I noticed that social eyeballs were good for traffic, but not so much for money.)</p>
<p>But what really made the Slate grow was just flogging it relentlessly every day. It was honestly a real grind. I sent hundreds of cold emails. (Didn’t work.) I promoted the Slate on Twitter, explaining why it was important. (Kinda worked.) <a href="https://medium.com/@longleafpineslate">I blogged about it</a> (useful for inbound traffic, sometimes for money).</p>
<p>What I found was that successfully fundraising requires you to be needy, persistent and a little bit pushy. Very, very few people will ever volunteer to give you money. You have to ask. And the vast majority of people you ask (directly or not) will say no. And just like in a job interview, you can’t take it personally. (If I cold emailed you and asked for money, sorry!) Asking for money sucks. I don’t like it and I don’t think anyone else does, either. But doing so for a good cause makes it a little easier, and over time, I got used to it.</p>
<p>I just kept doing this all year. Call it a “hustle” or “bootstrapping” or whatever you like, but slowly and gradually, folks started paying attention. We started raising more money. A real audience began to develop. I started writing <a href="https://thelongleafpineslate.substack.com/">email updates</a> to our donors, and those were a hit. Our list grew.</p>
<p>Speaking of email, another fun fact: as a fundraising page owner, ActBlue gives you the ability to ask your donors whether they want to share their email addresses with the recipient campaigns or not. I enabled this, so that every contributor to the Slate got to choose. The Slate still gets your email address, but whether recipient campaigns do was up to you. I now have a rather large donor list, and I made everyone a promise: the Slate will never, ever share or sell your email. It’s just not a deal I’m interested in. You’re welcome.</p>
<p>I knew we must be doing something right when Republican spies started sniffing around. I started getting emails from “supporters” I didn’t recognize, from obviously fake email addresses, asking for recordings from candidate calls. (<a href="https://americarisingpac.org/about/">America Rising</a> lackeys, I see you!) The Slate works in public, so this was fine – a vote of confidence if nothing else.</p>
<h2>So, what happened?</h2>
<p>I won’t bury the lede here: we still lost many of the races we backed.</p>
<p>So was this all a failure? Nah. The money mattered. But as I always remind people, money is just ammunition. It doesn’t buy races. We were able to raise money early in the cycle, which mattered a lot for our candidates. (For a campaign, $1 in October is worth $5 in January.) We funded candidates in “frontier” districts, where the fundamentals were hard, often in rural and exurban areas. Most of our candidates outperformed Biden in their districts, but unfortunately, the “top of the ticket” just didn’t perform as well in NC as we needed it to. Democrats nationwide had a rather poor showing downballot, so it wasn’t just us.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t a total loss. Some of our candidates (both millennials!) won. In other places, we funded campaigns where there hadn’t been a really legit Democratic campaign in a decade or more. Even though we lost, there’s now a network of volunteers in place and up-to-date supporter lists that will make subsequent campaigns much stronger. To win, you need to run candidates in difficult districts, and when you do that, some of them are going to lose.</p>
<p>Besides – we were also badly outspent. Remember Duke Energy above? Well, aside from their direct (“hard”) giving, they sunk millions of dollars into a dark-money super PAC to run ads and mailers vilifying Democrats. So did the NC Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber’s super PAC, Citizens for a Better North Carolina, was run by two former top aides to Phil Berger (the GOP State Senate leader) who now have their own political consultancy. (Though of course, I’m sure all of their business was conducted without any …</p></div></div>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you do reverse engineering for a living?

<p>No?</p>
<p>Well, read anyway.</p>
<p>-- <em>babush</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today we are proud of showing the world the first prototype of <strong>Big Match</strong>, our tool to find open-source libraries in binaries <strong>only using their strings</strong>.
How does it work?
Read this post to find out, or head to <a href="https://bigmatch.rev.ng/"><strong>our demo website</strong></a> to try it out.</p>
<p><a href="https://bigmatch.rev.ng/"><img src="https://rev.ng/blog/big-match/homepage.png"></a></p>
<p><strong>Spoiler:</strong> we are analyzing all the repositories on GitHub and building a search engine on top of that data.</p>

          
          
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>There's a thing that every good reverser does when starting to work on a target: look for interesting strings and throw them into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"><strong>Google</strong></a> hoping to find some open-source or leaked source.
This can save you anywhere from few hours of work to several days.
It's kind of a poor man's function (or library) matching.</p>
<p>In 2018, I decided to try out <strong><a href="https://line.me/en/">LINE</a>'s Bug Bounty</strong> program and so I started reversing a library bundled with the Android version of the App.
For those unfamiliar with LINE, it's the most used instant messaging App in Japan.
Anyway, there were many useful error strings sprinkled all around my target, so I did exactly that manual googling I've just mentioned.
Luckily, I was able to match some strings against Cisco's <a href="https://github.com/cisco/libsrtp"><code>libsrtp</code></a>.
But little did I know, my target included a modified version of <a href="https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject"><code>PJSIP</code></a>, a <strong>huge</strong> library that does indeed include <code>libsrtp</code>.
Unfortunately, I discovered this fact much later, so I wasted an entire week reversing an open-source library.</p>
<p>So, I thought: <em>"can we do better than manual googling? Why hasn't anyone built a huge database of all the strings in every public repository?"</em>.
And, just like that, the main idea for <strong>Big Match</strong> was born.</p>
<h2>Outline of our approach</h2>
<p>The way we, at rev.ng, decided to approach this problem is actually simple conceptually, but gets tricky due to the scale of the data we are dealing with.</p>
<p>In short, this is the outline of what we did:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Get the source code of the top C/C++ repositories on GitHub</strong>, where <em>"top"</em> means <em>"most starred"</em>. Ideally we would like to analyze all of them, and we will eventually, but we wanted to give priority to famous projects.</li>
<li>
<strong>Deduplicate the repositories:</strong> we don't want to have 70k+ slightly different versions of the Linux kernel in our database.</li>
<li>
<strong>Extract the strings</strong>: use <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep"><code>ripgrep</code></a> as a quick way to extract strings from source code.</li>
<li>
<strong>De-escape</strong> the strings. E.g.: turn <code>'\n'</code> into an actual newline character.</li>
<li>
<strong>Hash</strong> the strings.</li>
<li>
<strong>Store them</strong> in some kind of database.</li>
<li>
<strong>Query</strong> the database using the hashes of the strings from a target binary.</li>
<li>
<strong>Cluster</strong> the query results.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Where to start</h2>
<p>The first thing we did was figure out a way to <strong>get the list of all the repos on GitHub</strong>, sorted by stars.
It turns out, however, that this is more easily said than done.
GitHub has an official API but it is rate-limited and we wanted to avoid writing a multi-machine crawling system just for that.
So we looked around and, among many projects making available GitHub data, we found the amazing <a href="https://ghtorrent.org/"><strong>GHTorrent</strong></a>.</p>
<p>GHTorrent, short for <em>GitHub Torrent</em>, is a project created by Prof. Georgios Gousios of TU Delft.
What it does is periodically poll GitHub's <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/#list-public-events">public events API</a> and use the information on commits and new repositories to record the history of GitHub.
So, for example, if user <code>thebabush</code> pushes some changes to his repository <code>awesome-repo</code>, GHTorrent analyzes those changes and, if the repo is not present in its database, it creates a new entry.
It also saves its metadata, e.g. star count, and some of its commits.
By exploiting the GitHub REST API, GHTorrent is able to create a somewhat complete <a href="https://ghtorrent.org/relational.html">relational view</a> of all of GitHub (except for the actual source code):</p>
<p><a href="https://rev.ng/blog/big-match/ghtorrent-schema.svg"><img src="https://rev.ng/blog/big-match/ghtorrent-schema.svg"></a></p>
<p>GHTorrent's data is made available as either a MySQL dump of the relational database in the picture or as a series of daily MongoDB dumps.
GHTorrent uses Mongo as a caching layer for GitHub's API so that it can avoid making the same API call twice.</p>
<p>Once you import the GHTorrent MySQL dumps on your machine, you can quickly get useful information about GitHub using good ol' SQL (e.g.: information about the most popular C/C++ repos is a simple <code>SELECT ... WHERE ... ORDER BY ...</code>).
It also contains information about forks and commits, so you have some good data to exploit for the repo deduplication we want to do.</p>
<p>However, <strong>GHTorrent is best-effort by design</strong>, so you'll never have a complete and consistent snapshot of GitHub.
For example, some repos might be missing or have outdated metadata.
Another example is that commits information is partial: GHTorrent cannot possibly associate every commit to every repository containing it.
Think about the Linux kernel: one commit would need to be added to 70k+ forks and that kind of things doesn't scale very well.</p>
<p>Finally, there's another risk regarding the use of a project like GHTorrent: <strong>maintenance</strong>.
Keeping a crawler working costs money and time, and it seems like in the last couple of years <a href="http://ghtorrent-downloads.ewi.tudelft.nl/mysql/">they haven't been releasing MySQL dumps that often anymore</a>.
On the other hand, they still release their <a href="http://ghtorrent-downloads.ewi.tudelft.nl/mongo-daily/">incremental Mongo updates daily</a>.
Since they create the MySQL DB using REST API calls that are cached through MongoDB, those incremental updates should be everything you need to recreate their MySQL database.</p>
<p>A fun fact is that <strong>Microsoft used to sponsor GHTorrent</strong>, but I guess <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/announcement/microsoft-acquires-github/">they don't need to do it now</a> 🙃.
And yes, that's not a good thing for us.</p>
<p>In the end, since we don't actually need all the tables provided by the GHTorrent MySQL dump, we decided to write a script that directly consumes their Mongo dumps one by one and outputs the information we need into a bunch of text files.
In fact, <strong>most of our pipeline is implemented using bash scripts</strong> (you can read more in our future blogpost about what we like to call <strong><em>bashML</em></strong>).</p>
<h2>Repository deduplication</h2>
<p>We mentioned in the outline that we need to deduplicate the repositories.
We need to do that for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>As stated earlier, we don't want to download every single fork of every single famous project out there.</li>
<li>Duplicated data means that our database of repos grows very fast in size. The first ~100K repos we downloaded from GitHub amount to ~1.4TB of <code>gzip</code>'d source code (without <code>git</code> history), so you can see why this is an important point.</li>
<li>Duplicated data is bad for <strong>search results accuracy</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>GHTorrent has information about forks but, as for GitHub itself, that only counts forks created with the <em>"Fork"</em> button on the web UI.
The other option is to look for common commits between repositories.
If we had infinite computing resources, we would do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Clone every repository</strong> we care about.</li>
<li>Put every commit hash in a <strong>graph database</strong> of some kind.</li>
<li>Connect commit hashes using their <strong>parent/child relationship</strong>.</li>
<li>Find the <strong>root commits</strong>.</li>
<li>For every root commit, <strong>keep only the most-starred repo</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, we live in the real world, so this is simply impossible for us to do.
We would like to have a strategy to deduplicate repos <strong>before</strong> cloning them, as cloning would require a lot of time and bandwidth.
On top of that, when using git you can merge the history of totally-unrelated projects.
So, if you deduplicate repos based on the root commit alone, you end up removing a lot of projects you actually want to keep.</p>
<p>Case in point: <strong><a href="https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife"><code>octocat/Spoon-Knife</code></a></strong>.</p>
<h2>Octocat</h2>
<p><code>octocat/Spoon-Knife</code> is the <strong>most forked project</strong> on GitHub, and there's a reason for that: it's the repo that is used in GitHub's <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/">tutorial on forking</a>.
This means that a lot of people learning to use GitHub have forked this repo at some point.</p>
<p>You might be wondering why <code>Spoon-Knife</code> causes troubles to our theoretical deduplication algorithm.
Well, take a look at this screenshot of <code>LibreCAD</code>'s git history:</p>
<p><img alt="LibreCAD history" src="https://rev.ng/blog/big-match/librecad.png"></p>
<p>At some point in the past some user by the name of <code>youarefunny</code> was learning to use GitHub and so he forked <code>Spoon-Knife</code>.
At some other point, he forked <code>LibreCAD</code> and made some commits.
Then, for whatever reason, he thought <em>"well, why not merge the history of these two nice repositories in a single one? So we can have a branch with the history of both projects!"</em>.
And finally, just to <del>fuck with us</del> contribute to a useful open-source project like <code>LibreCAD</code>, he decided to open a pull request using that exact branch.
And that pull request was accepted.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> the history of <code>Spoon-Knife</code> is included in <code>LibreCAD</code>'s repo.</p>
<p>If you want to check this out, visit <a href="https://github.com/LibreCAD/LibreCAD/commit/f08a37f282dd30ce7cb759d6cf8981c982290170">this link</a> or clone <code>LibreCAD/LibreCAD</code> and run <code>git diff f08a37f282dd30ce7cb759d6cf8981c982290170</code>.</p>
<p>Things like this present a serious issue for us because <code>Spoon-Knife</code> has 10.3k stars at the moment, while <code>LibreCAD</code> only has 2k.
Which means that if we were to remove the least starred project, we would actually remove <code>LibreCAD</code> and keep the utterly useless <code>Spoon-Knife</code> repo.</p>
<p>I hate you <code>yourefunny</code>.
And no, you are not actually funny.</p>
<p>But <code>yourefunny</code> is not alone in this: during our tests we've found that some people also like to merge the history of Linux and LLVM.
Go figure.</p>
<h2>Best-effort deduplication</h2>
<p>So we can't <code>git clone</code> every repo on GitHub and we can't do root-based deduplication.
What we can do is use GHTorrent once again and implement a different strategy.
In fact, <strong>GHTorrent has information about commits</strong>, too, albeit limited.
This is what it gives us:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<em>(partial)</em> <code>(parent commit, child commit)</code> relations.</li>
<li>
<em>(partial)</em> <code>(commit, repository)</code> relations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Exploiting this data we can't reconstruct the full git history of every repository, but we can recreate <strong>subgraphs</strong> of it.
We then apply this algorithm:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find a commit for which GHTorrent doesn't have a parent (we call them <em>parentless commits</em>) and consider it a root commit.</li>
<li>Explore the commit history graph starting at a root commit. We do this going <strong>upward</strong>, that is, only following <code>parent → child</code> edges.</li>
<li>We group all the repositories associated with the commits of a subgraph we obtain in step 2. We call such group a <em>repository group</em>.</li>
<li>For every repository group, we find the most starred repo it contains and consider it the <em>parent repo</em>, …</li></ol></div></div>

  </p>


<p>x86 is back in the general programmer discourse, in part thanks to Apple’s M1 and
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_silicon/about_the_rosetta_translation_environment">Rosetta 2</a>.
As such, I figured I’d do <em>yet another</em> x86-64 post.</p>

<p>Just like <a href="https://blog.yossarian.net/2020/06/13/How-x86_64-addresses-memory">the last one</a>,
I’m going to cover a facet of the x86-64 ISA that sets it apart
as unusually complex among modern ISAs: the number and diversity of registers available.</p>

<p><a href="https://stefanheule.com/blog/how-many-x86-64-instructions-are-there-anyway/">Like instruction counting</a>,
register counting on x86-64 is subject to debates over methodology. In particular, for this blog
post, I’m going to lay the following ground rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I <strong>will</strong> count sub-registers (e.g., <code>EAX</code> for <code>RAX</code>) as distinct registers. My justification:
they have different instruction encodings, and both Intel and AMD optimize/pessimize
particular sub-register use patterns in their microcode.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I <strong>will</strong> count registers that are present on x86-64 CPUs, but that can’t be used in long mode.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I <strong>won’t</strong> count registers that are <em>only</em> present on older x86 CPUs, like the 80386 and
80486 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_register">test registers</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I <strong>won’t</strong> count microarchitectural implementation details, like shadow registers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I <strong>will</strong> count registers that aren’t directly addressable, like MSRs that can only be accessed
through <code>RDMSR</code>. However, I <strong>won’t</strong> (or will try not to) double-count registers that
have multiple access mechanisms (like <code>RDMSR</code> and <code>RDTSC</code>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I <strong>won’t</strong> count model-specific registers that fall into these categories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>MSRs that are only present on niche x86 vendors (Cyrix, Via)</li>
      <li>MSRs that aren’t widely available on recent-ish x86-64 CPUs
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Errata</strong>: I accidentally included AVX-512 in some of the original counts below,
  not realizing that it hadn’t been released on any AMD CPUs. The post has been updated.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>MSRs that are <em>completely</em> undocumented (both officially and unofficially)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the rules above, I’m going to use the following considerations and methodology
for grouping registers together:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Many sources, both official and unofficial, use “model-specific register” as an umbrella term
for any non-core or non-feature-set register supplied by an x86-64 CPU. Whenever possible, I’ll
try to avoid this in favor of more specific categories.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both Intel and AMD provide synonyms for registers (e.g. <code>CR8</code> as the “task priority register,” or
<code>TPR</code>). Whenever possible, I’ll try to use the more generic/category conforming name (like <code>CR8</code>
in the case above).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general, the individual cores of a multicore processor have independent register states.
Whenever this <strong>isn’t</strong> the case, I’ll make an effort to document it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2 id="general-purpose-registers">General-purpose registers</h2>

<p>The general-purpose registers (or GPRs) are <strong>the</strong> primary registers in the x86-64 register model.
As their name implies, they are the <strong>only</strong> registers that are <em>general purpose</em>: each has a set
of conventional uses<sup id="fnref:conventional" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:conventional">1</a></sup>, but programmers are generally free to ignore those conventions and use
them as they please<sup id="fnref:ignore" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ignore">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Because x86-64 evolved from a 32-bit ISA which in turn evolved from a 16-bit ISA, each
GPR has a set of <em>subregisters</em> that hold the lower 8, 16 and 32 bits of the full 64-bit
register.</p>

<p>Some of the 16-bit subregisters are also special: the original 8086 allowed the <strong>high</strong> byte
of <code>AX</code>, <code>BX</code>, <code>CX</code>, and <code>DX</code> to be accessed indepenently, so x86-64 preserves this for some
encodings:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    
    <th>16-bit</th>
    
    <th>8-bit (high)</th>
    
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    
    <td>AX</td>
    
    <td> AH</td>

<p>So that’s 16 full-width GPRs, fanning out to another 52 subregisters.</p>

<p><strong>Registers in this group: 68</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="special-registers">Special registers</h2>

<p>This is sort of an artificial category: like every ISA, x86-64 has a few “special” registers that
keep things moving along. In particular:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <em>instruction pointer</em>, or <code>RIP</code>.</p>

    <p>x86-64 has 32- and 16-bit variants of <code>RIP</code> (<code>EIP</code> and <code>IP</code>), but I’m <strong>not</strong> going to count
  them as separate registers: they have identical encodings and can’t be used in the same
  CPU mode<sup id="fnref:ip" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ip">3</a></sup>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <em>status register</em>, or <code>RFLAGS</code>.</p>

    <p>Just like <code>RIP</code>, <code>RFLAGS</code> has 32- and 16-bit counterparts (<code>EFLAGS</code> and <code>FLAGS</code>). Unlike
  <code>RIP</code>, these counterparts can be partially mixed: <code>PUSHF</code> and <code>PUSHFQ</code> are both valid in
  long mode, and <code>LAHF</code>/<code>SAHF</code> can operate on the bits of <code>FLAGS</code> on some x86-64 CPUs
  outside of compatiblility mode<sup id="fnref:cpuid-lahf-sahf" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:cpuid-lahf-sahf">4</a></sup>. So I’m going to go ahead and count them.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Registers in this group: 4</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Running total: 72</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="segment-registers">Segment registers</h2>

<p>x86-64 has a total of 6 segment registers: <code>CS</code>, <code>SS</code>, <code>DS</code>, <code>ES</code>, <code>FS</code>, and <code>GS</code>. The operation
varies with the CPU’s mode:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In all modes except for long mode, each segment register holds a <em>selector</em>, which indexes into
either the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Descriptor_Table">GDT</a> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Descriptor_Table#Local_Descriptor_Table">LDT</a>. That yields
a segment <em>descriptor</em> which, among other things, supplies the base address and extent of the
segment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In long mode all but <code>FS</code> and <code>GS</code> are treated as having a base address of zero and a 64-bit
extent, effectively producing a flat address space. <code>FS</code> and <code>GS</code> are retained as special cases,
but no longer use the segment descriptor tables: instead, they access base addresses that
are stored in the <code>FSBASE</code> and <code>GSBASE</code> model-specific registers<sup id="fnref:kernelgsbase" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:kernelgsbase">5</a></sup>.
More on those later.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Registers in this group: 6</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Running total: 78</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="simd-and-fp-registers">SIMD and FP registers</h2>

<p>The x86 family has gone through <em>several</em> generations of SIMD and floating-point instruction
groups, each of which has introduced, extended, or re-contextualized various registers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>x87</li>
  <li>MMX</li>
  <li>SSE (SSE2, SSE3, SSE4, SSE4, …)</li>
  <li>AVX (AVX2, AVX512)</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s do them in rough order.</p>

<h3 id="x87">x87</h3>

<p>Originally a discrete coprocessor with its own instruction set and register file, the x87
instructions have been regularly baked into x86 cores themselves since the 80486.</p>

<p>Because of its coprocessor history, x87 defines both normal registers<sup id="fnref:normal-ish" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:normal-ish">6</a></sup>
(akin to GPRs) and a variety of special registers needed to control the FPU state:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>ST0</code> through <code>ST7</code>: 8 80-bit floating-point registers</li>
  <li><code>FPSW</code>, <code>FPCW</code>, <code>FPTW</code> <sup id="fnref:mynames" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:mynames">7</a></sup>: Control, status, and tag-word registers</li>
  <li>“Data operand pointer”: I don’t know what this one does, but the Intel SDM specifies it<sup id="fnref:sdm" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:sdm">8</a></sup></li>
  <li>Instruction pointer: the x87 state machine apparently holds its own copy of the current
x87 instruction</li>
  <li>Last instruction opcode: this is apparently distinct from the x87 opcode, and has its
own register</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Registers in this group: 14</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Running total: 92</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="mmx">MMX</h3>

<p>MMX was Intel’s first attempt at consumer SIMD in their x86 chips, released back in 1997.</p>

<p>For design reasons that are a complete mystery to me, the MMX registers are actually sub-registers
of the x87 <code>STn</code> registers: each 64-bit <code>MMn</code> occupies the mantissa component of its corresponding
<code>STn</code>. Consequently, x86 (and x86-64) CPUs cannot execute MMX and x87 instructions at the same time.</p>

<p>In addition to <code>MM0</code> through <code>MM7</code>, MMX also defines a new status register (<code>MXCSR</code>) as well as
a load/store instruction pair for manipulating it (<code>LDMXCSR</code> and <code>STMXCSR</code>).</p>

<p><strong>Registers in this group: 9</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Running total: 101</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="sse-and-avx">SSE and AVX</h3>

<p>For simplicity’s sake, I’m going to wrap SSE and AVX into a single section: they use the same
sub-register pattern as the GPRs and x87/MMX do, so they fit well into a single table:</p>

<p>In other words: the lower half of each <code>ZMMn</code> is <code>YMMn</code>, and the lower half of each <code>YMMn</code> is
<code>XMMn</code>. There’s no direct way register access for just the upper half of <code>YMMn</code>, nor does
<code>ZMMn</code> have direct 256- or 128-bit access for the thunks of its upper half.</p>

<p>SSE also defines a new status register, <code>MXCSR</code>, that contains flags roughly parallel
to the arithmetic flags in <code>RFLAGS</code> (along with floating-point flags in the x87 status word).</p>

<p>AVX-512 <strong>also</strong> introduces eight <em>opmask</em> registers, <code>k0</code> through <code>k7</code>. <code>k0</code> is a special case
that behaves much like the “zero” register on some RISC ISAs: it can’t be stored to, and
loads from it always produce a bitmask of all ones.</p>

<p><strong>Errata</strong>: The table above includes AVX-512, which isn’t available on any AMD CPUs as of 2020.
I’ve updated the counts below to only include SSE and AVX2-introduced registers.</p>

<p><strong>Registers in this group: 33</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="bounds-registers">Bounds registers</h2>

<p>Intel added these with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_MPX">MPX</a>, which was intended to
offer hardware-accelerated bounds checking. Nobody uses it, since
<a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Intel-MPX-Is-Dead">it doesn’t work very well</a>.
But x86 is eternal and slow to fix mistakes, so we’ll probably have these registers taking up space
for at least a while longer:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>BND0</code> — <code>BND3</code>: Individual 128-bit registers, each containing a pair of addresses
for a bound.</li>
  <li><code>BNDCFG</code>: Bound configuration, kernel mode.</li>
  <li><code>BNDCFU</code>: Bound configuration, user mode.</li>
  <li><code>BNDSTATUS</code>: Bound status, after a <code>#BR</code> is raised.</li>

<h2 id="debug-registers">Debug registers</h2>

<p>These are what they sound like: registers that aid and accelerate software debuggers, like
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/">GDB</a>.</p>

<p>There are 6 debug registers of two types:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code>DR0</code> through <code>DR3</code> contain linear addresses, each of which is associated with a breakpoint
condition.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>DR6</code> and <code>DR7</code> are the debug status and control registers. <code>DR6</code>’s lower bits indicate which
debug conditions were encountered (upon entering the debug exception handler), while <code>DR7</code> controls
which breakpoint addresses are enabled and their breakpoint conditions (e.g., when a particular
address is written to).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>What about <code>DR4</code> and <code>DR5</code>? For reasons that are unclear to me, they don’t (and have never)
existed<sup id="fnref:guess" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:guess">9</a></sup>. They <em>do</em> have encodings but are treated as <code>DR6</code> and <code>DR7</code>, respective, or produce
an <code>#UD</code> exception when <code>CR4.DE[bit 3] = 1</code>.</p>

    <h4><a href="http://santiagodevelopment.com/p/2020/11/26/kindle-esxi-monitor">Using a Kindle Screen to Monitor ESXi</a></h4>
    <p>Posted Thursday, November 26, 2020 <span>in <a href="http://santiagodevelopment.com/p/category/Projects">Projects</a></span></p>
<h5>The Premise</h5>
<p>This is a bit of a thanksgiving project that I've been pushing off for a bit.  Luckily, I've already had some of the groundwork set out from when I took my old Kindle DX and repurposed it into a <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Literary-Clock-Made-From-E-reader/">literary clock</a>.  A big part of that project was reworking the generation of PNGs based off the quotes to make them a bit cleaner and nicer looking on the DX's larger screen.  I did this <a href="https://github.com/jamessantiago/QuoteToImage">PNG rework in C#</a>, which in hindsight, was a terrible choice for image generation.  It seemed like a good idea at the time, because “do what you know,” right?  Well, it turns out that the text-to-image manipulation ecosystem in .NET is a nightmare with all kinds of weird issues that require fixes like <strong>dynamically loading windows libraries</strong> to force Win32 API calls to set opacity (wow!).</p>
<p>Anyway, I decided to take another crack at it, and this time to adapt the Kindle setup towards a status screen for my home server.</p>
<h5>The Plan</h5>
<p>I have a few things as monitoring targets: ESXi, pfsense, gitlab, various web servers, and some applications.  I figured I could boil this down to the bare essentials by grabbing key ESXi stats and maybe a bit of the web stuff from the frontend proxy (nginx in this case).  Once I have a few stats, I found that <a href="https://github.com/pjimenezmateo/kindle-wallpaper">this SVG editing method</a> would be a good method of getting my data from text to png fairly easily.  So the general process is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Setup an image display service on the Kindle</li>
<li>Setup some statistics retrieval for Esxi and Nginx</li>
<li>Create an SVG template to display the relevant statistics</li>
<li>Create a script to generate the appropriate PNG and ship to the Kindle</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, I was lucky enough that former-me already setup the display service on the Kindle based on the <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Literary-Clock-Made-From-E-reader/">literary clock project</a>.  This also included all the work for <a href="https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Kindle4NTHacking#Jailbreak">jailbreaking the kindle</a>.  So for step 1, all that was left was to make some minor modifications to the literary clock scripts to display a single “image.png” that I'd update remotely over the usbnet piece that I installed as part of the jailbreak (my Kindle DX unfortunately does not have wifi capabilities).</p>
<h5>Stats from a Hobbyist's ESXi</h5>
<p>For your lowly home server uses, ESXi can be pretty handy and has a lot of benefits over hypervisors I've used for experimentation.  Benefits like being compatible with more than a handful of operating systems and not falling to bit rot the second you look away.  But one thing ESXi doesn't have over hypervisors like proxmox, is an easy avenue to hack away to your heart's content.  Easy access to APIs and niceties are locked away behind paid licensing or partner agreements.  Which, in retrospect of ESXi being totally free, is not the worst thing in the world.  Somebody needs to be a billionaire around here and it certainly isn't going to be me.</p>
<p>One of the APIs that have slipped through the licensing cracks is SNMP.  Probably because it's a huge pain to use.  You can start down this trail by first <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.monitoring.doc/GUID-2E4B0F2A-11D8-4649-AC6C-99F89CE93026.html">configuring the ESXi host for SNMP</a>.  For this project, I setup my host with SNMP v3, sha1 auth, and aes128 privacy.  You'll want to do a lot of testing here with tools like snmpget, snmpwalk, or whatever the windows equivalent is for testing snmp mibs.  There's a few resources at <a href="https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2145018#cpu">vmware</a> and <a href="https://github.com/humorless/esxicollector">github</a> that can help you track down relevant mibs.</p>
<p>I decided to collect the snmp data via python, so I used the <a href="http://pysnmp.sourceforge.net/">python module pysnmp</a>.  There's a few weird concepts in play with pysnmp that makes walking snmp mibs a bit different than traditional tools, but it just takes a bit of desk-to-head application to get just right.  There are a <a href="https://www.ictshore.com/sdn/python-snmp-tutorial/">few tutorials</a> that I used to help out here.</p>
<p>I decided to narrow my SNMP data collection down to CPU, memory, and upload/download speeds.  You do need to fenagle these values a bit and, unfortunately, it looks like the CPU values are probably way off.  I found several forum posts for RedHat, IBM, and some in serverfault for ESXi that seems to point to the SNMP counter values for CPU load to be well off from what the GUI reports.  I gave up here and just grabbed the lowest CPU core load value instead of the much less accurate average value.  Probably still way off, but oh well.  Memory and network usage is a bit tricky as well, so there's a few tricks I threw in to get the proper values.</p>
<h5>Pretty Pictures</h5>
<p>Once I had my data I would now need to throw that into a PNG.  For this part, I went over to <a href="https://editor.method.ac/">Method Draw</a> and crafted an SVG.  For each of the text boxes I wanted to replace with real data, I threw in some placeholder text (S1, S1, etc…).  After saving off the SVG, I now had what is essentially a text file that I could easily perform a find and replace on before converting to PNG.  I also thew in a warning icon in here and set the opacity to 0.  I figured I could use this later by changing the opacity of the icon to something viewable for when a statistic hits some threshold.  I haven't actually used this, but I figured it's important to plan ahead.</p>
<p>Throwing the code into my update_kindle.py script, I'm now collecting stats, updating my template.svg, and then converting to a Kindle appropriate png (proper grayscale and all that).</p>
<h5>Server/Kindle Comms</h5>
<p>Maybe this is easier on other Kindles, but for the DX I'm working on, the method of getting the image onto the Kindle's filesystem is a wee bit of a never-ending plumet into madness.  The first thing you might find is that the Kindle's <em>framework</em> and <em>powerd</em> services will interfere with screen manipulation, but also are critical for maintaining a usb mass storage drive which WOULD BE NICE for sending my images to.  My alternative here is the great usbnet addition provided by the users over on <a href="https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Kindle4NTHacking#Jailbreak">mobileread</a>.  Unfortunately, ESXi doesn't provide native support for USB network devices.  Fortunately, a “fling” is available to provide <a href="https://flings.vmware.com/usb-network-native-driver-for-esxi#summary">usb network drivers</a> as an installable vib package.  I did need to update my ESXi image from 7.0.0 to 7.0.1U1 for this to work though.  Once I did all the updates, I was able to attach the Kindle as a usb network device to the VM of my choice.  The last event here in the series of unfortunate events, is that the usb network device is a bit flaky and prone to crashing.  I played around with a few fixes, but what seems to work the best is to simply reduce the speed that scp sends over the image.</p>
<p>The wrap up here is to have the update_kindle.py script scp the generated PNG over to the kindle.  This is kicked off by a cronjob every two minutes.</p>

    <p><a href="https://12days.cmdchallenge.com/">Command Challenge</a> has been running for over 3 years now and I would consider it one of those “serverless” architectures. The front-end services requests using API Gateway and Lambda functions and commands are forwarded to a Docker executor running on a VM.</p>
<p>Overall, the costs have been minimal thanks to mostly low-ish traffic and keeping it inside the AWS free-tier limits.
By “free-tier” I mean the “always-free” limits of an AWS account, since the 12 month trial period for new accounts expired quite some time ago.</p>
<p>Here is a 2020 update for the services that are used to run the site and a short explanation of what they do.</p>
<h2 id="serverless-architecture">Serverless Architecture</h2>
<p><img src="https://jarv.org/img/cmd-architecture.png" alt="cmd-architecture"></p>
<p>Where we could probably move all of this to a single VM and reduce some of the configuration complexity, I don’t think it would be any cheaper except on a shared hosting provider.</p>
<p>As you can see in the diagram, this project isn’t completely “serverless” because a server is required for executing user-submitted commands in Docker.
For this, it’s a matter of finding the cheapest VM available for this type of workload.</p>
<h2 id="free-cloud-services">Free Cloud Services</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/">GoatCounter</a></strong>: An analytics service <a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/why#what-are-goatcounters-goals">that respects your privacy</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Slack</strong>: Used to receive notifications for unique submissions and errors, useful to keep an eye on what is going on.</li>
<li><strong>Grafana Cloud</strong>: Grafana offers a <a href="https://grafana.com/signup/starter/connect-account">free starter plan</a>. This connects to Prometheus which is running on the GCP VM for monitoring Docker and node level metrics.</li>
<li><strong>Sentry</strong>: <a href="https://sentry.io/">Sentry.io</a> is very nice for side-projects, offering a free tier that I found indispensable for tracking down front-end JS errors in different browser configurations.</li>
<li><strong>GitLab</strong>: <a href="https://gitlab.com/">GitLab.com</a> drives the CI pipeline, every new commit on master updates <a href="https://testing.cmdchallenge.com/">the testing environment</a>, with a manual promotion to prod.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="aws---2month">AWS - $2/month</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>CloudFront</strong>: Used as the CDN for all requests to the site. HTTP GET requests to <code>/r/*</code> are for command submissions and are forwarded to the API Gateway. These requests are cached here, so if multiple submissions are sent for the same challenge CloudFront will return a cached response. Other requests that are not command, assets and the static page are forwarded to S3.</li>
<li><strong>S3 bucket</strong>:  Hosts all static content and serves as the origin for CloudFlare. Also receives periodic updates for user solutions, stored as JSON files.</li>
<li><strong>API Gateway</strong>: Previously REST API, this was <a href="https://jarv.org/posts/http-api-gateway/">recently switched to the HTTP API Gateway</a>. Accepts an HTTP request and forwards it to Lambda function for submissions.</li>
<li><strong>Lambda</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Submission Handling</strong>: Responsible for handling submission and rate-limiting logic. It takes a submission and forwards it to the Docker executor. If it receives the same input for a challenge that has already been evaluated, it will return a cached response</li>
<li><strong>Solutions Updater</strong>: This is split into multiple Lambda functions that look up solutions and writes them to S3 as <code>json</code> files. It runs in multiple jobs because the queries to DynamoDB span many records and take awhile to run.</li>
<li><strong>Slack Notfications</strong>: On every unique successful submission, or error a notification is sent to Slack. This is helpful to keep an eye on what is going on and aids troubleshooting when there are problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>DynamoDB</strong>: Every submission is stored in the database which is used for both rate limiting, and tracking correct/incorrect submissions.</li>
<li><strong>CloudWatch Logs</strong>: Collects logs from Lambda for debugging.</li>
<li><strong>Event Bridge</strong>: Previously called CloudWatch Rules, this triggers periodic events that are used to trigger a Lambda function that generates a list of user-submitted solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Route53</strong>: The one service that doesn’t have a free tier, for .50 a month it manages the cmdchallenge.com DNS zone.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon Certificate Manager</strong>: Free HTTPs certificates for all of cmdchallenge.com</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="breakdown-of-a-typical-monthly-bill">Breakdown of a typical monthly bill</h3>
<p><img src="https://jarv.org/img/aws-bill.png" alt="aws-bill"></p>
<h2 id="gcp---6month">GCP - $6/month</h2>
<p><img src="https://jarv.org/img/gcp-bill.png" alt="gcp-bill"></p>
<p>The production site uses an <code>e2-micro</code> instance costing around $6/month, this is a bit more than we need typically but it gives us some headroom when the site gets busy.
There is only a single VM which is a single-point-of-failure for the site. This can cause a bit of disruption if there is a spontaneous reboot or if an upgrade is required.
Thankfully, in GCP this is very fast, and thanks to the multiple-layers of caching (CloudFlare, DynamoDB) in the serverless stack, it only causes a problem for unique submissions that haven’t been seen before.</p>
<p><img src="https://jarv.org/img/cpu-memory.png" alt="cpu-memory"></p>
<ul>
<li>Memory utilization hovers around 300MB when there isn’t a lot of activity, this means that on smaller shared-core VMS like the <code>f1-micro</code> some swap is necessary.</li>
<li>CPU Utilization is generally low, though it varies because traffic due to site usage tends to be bursty.</li>
</ul>

<p>This architecture spans cloud providers to keep costs low as I found GCP gives a better value for the money on VMs compared to AWS at this lower tier.
Here is a current-as-of-now overview of cheap VMs under $15 from the main cloud providers.</p>
<p>All of these are non-preemptable shared core instances or burst-rate limited in the case of AWS.
This means that you cannot count on using the full CPU all of the time.</p>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>For GCP, preemptable instances would be cheaper but with only one it doesn’t really work since it would mean a service interruption.</li>
<li>The <code>f1-micro</code> is a bit too small for the main site, I use it for the <a href="https://testing.cmdchallenge.com/">testing environment</a>.</li>
<li>AWS LightSail / Digital Ocean have basically the same offering and might also be a good fit.</li>
</ul>
<p>For now, the main site is powered by an <code>e2-micro</code> instance for $6/month.
It offers 2 cores, which is more than the other options in the same price-range though it’s not uncommon to see stalls due to CPU steal:</p>
<p><img src="https://jarv.org/img/cpu-steal.png" alt="cpu-steal"></p>
<p>It runs <a href="https://cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs">Container Optimized OS</a> and only runs Docker and a Prometheus exporter for node metrics.</p>
<h2 id="so-is-it-worth-it">So, is it worth it?</h2>
<p>From a cost perspective for now I still think so. Of course there is always a risk that something happens where my cloud spend will spiral out of control but if this were to happen I would just shut it down.
There is the meme “Wouldn’t it be easier to run this on a $5 DO droplet”? I think it might apply here, though the type of workload it runs is ideal for serverless because it is a single-page app where API Gateway requests are only required for submissions.  This keeps the number of Lambda executions low.</p>
<p>Ignoring spend I think there are two big disadvantages to running servless. One is the complexity of gluing the cloud-native components together and keeping a configuration that is easy to manage and update.
This is solved by keeping everything in a single <a href="https://gitlab.com/jarv/cmdchallenge/-/blob/master/terraform/site.tf">terraform script</a>, and though updates are automatically applied in CI I think there is a rather big initial investment in getting it to work properly.</p>
<p>The other, bigger reason I found is that <strong>it’s difficult, if not impossible to test everything locally</strong>,  without a lot more work which would be my number one complaint about this setup.
The way I have worked around this is to have an identical <a href="https://testing.cmdchallenge.com/">testing environment</a> running in parallel, this actually doesn’t cost anything extra because it doesn’t get any usage beyond a small amount of testing.</p>
<p>To sum up, while it’s been fun for someone who enjoys doing infrastructure, I have been thinking about re-writing it all as a single server that run on a single VM, with sqlite as the db. I’m pretty sure it would perform better :)</p>

closest future of the healthcare industry.</p></div></div><article><div target="_blank"><div><p>Exciting medical projects dedicated to 3D printed organs, surgical nanorobots, and genetic engineering have been booming in recent years. The period from 2019 to 2020 is expected to be just as exciting for the healthcare and pharmaceuticals market as the past few years have been.<br>Due to their sensitive nature and extremely long testing and certification processes, it takes years for medical products and services to become available on the market.</p><p>In the coming years, we’ll observe the continued development of existing projects along with new trends that support the growth and scaling of healthcare businesses. Let’s have a look at a few trends and projects that will be advancing in 2019.<br>‍</p></div><h2>Healthcare and Artificial Intelligence</h2><p>Within just the past few years, we’ve seen the rise of AI leaders in the medical industry, and drastic changes have been taking place in front of our eyes! A few projects will dominate and drive the AI healthcare market in 2019 and 2020.</p><p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson/health/" target="_blank">IBM Watson Health</a> is the most revolutionary medical ecosystem. It has already “impacted over 15,000 clients, 80,000 professionals and 185,000 patients with AI solutions.” IBM offers a whole range of AI solutions for the complete business and treatment cycles, starting from administrative tools and ending with cutting-edge research products such as IBM Watson for Genomics and IBM Watson for Oncology.<br>‍<br>Both IBM Watson for Genomics and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/ibm-watson-for-oncology" target="_blank">IBM Watson for Oncology</a> are used commercially in some hospitals in the US, India, and the UK.</p><figure id="w-node-dcdc59372f80-7a0a8b78"><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w4HpCW18Zdg"></iframe></p></figure><p>One more IBM product that stands out is <a href="https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_group.php?id=4384" target="_blank">IBM Medical Sieve</a>. It aims at “developing a cognitive assistant system for radiologists and cardiologists to detect anomalies using holistic clinical information” derived from digital imaging such as MRIs, CT scans, and ultrasound. The project is in the final stages of development and should be available for commercial use soon.</p><figure id="w-node-f54d104340b5-7a0a8b78"><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0i11VCNacAE"></iframe></p></figure><p><a href="https://deepmind.com/applied/deepmind-health/about-deepmind-health/" target="_blank">DeepMind Health</a> (acquired by Google in 2014) is a relatively young project that has shown promising advances in healthcare AI research:<br>‍<br>– Detecting eye disease quickly<br>– Planning radiotherapy cancer treatment<br>– <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/research-department-veterans-affairs/" target="_blank">Detecting patient deterioration from electronic records<br>‍</a><br>The main DeepMind Health product is the AI-powered mobile app <a href="https://deepmind.com/applied/deepmind-health/working-partners/how-were-helping-today/" target="_blank">Streams</a>. This app brings together crucial medical data like a patient’s blood test results, heart rate, and blood pressure so doctors can spot serious issues quickly. In case of bad symptoms, Streams sends an urgent smartphone alert to the right clinician. Streams has recently been commercialized.</p><figure id="w-node-c1f4f7002c7e-7a0a8b78"><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2HIcloy_OYk"></iframe></p></figure><p>NeuroLex Laboratories offers voice analysis software that examines speech waveforms and the actual text of a speech sample to diagnose such conditions as:<br>‍<br>– Depression<br>– Psychosis<br>– Alzheimer’s<br>– Parkinson’s</p><figure id="w-node-cdefb564a69c-7a0a8b78"><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LEtRD7v1DWY"></iframe></p></figure><h2><br>Healthcare and the Internet of Things</h2><p>IoT is slowly penetrating the healthcare market, with the main driver being significant cost savings for care providers. There are two main IoT trends in healthcare:</p><h4><strong>Remote care</strong></h4><p><strong>‍</strong>Remote care via IoT technologies is expected to <a href="https://www.towerswatson.com/en-US/Press/2014/08/current-telemedicine-technology-could-mean-big-savings" target="_blank">lower US employer healthcare costs by as much as $6 billion a year</a> with the help of in-home devices with sensors, such as <a href="https://bismart.com/en/eldcare-friendly-reminders/" target="_blank">BiSmart Eldcare</a>. The Eldcare device sends fall alerts to emergency services using a set of cameras and sensors.</p><figure id="w-node-3109d3c18bd2-7a0a8b78"><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xycbR1-c54U"></iframe></p></figure><h4><strong>Health monitors</strong></h4><p><strong>‍</strong>There are many IoT health monitoring projects at the development stage. <a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/01/introducing-our-smart-contact-lens.html" target="_blank">Google Smart Contact</a> Lens is one of the most ambitious.<br>‍<br>Currently this smart lens, designed for patients with diabetes, is at the testing stage. The lens measures glucose levels in tears with the help of a tiny wireless chip and miniaturized glucose sensor that are embedded between two layers of soft contact lens material.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5d0ce06dc097b594ae077282_5cf6724d7fc2b1031c845f1f_contact-lens-2.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><h2><br>Mergers and acquisitions<br></h2><p>Hospitals, pharmaceutical vendors, and insurance companies are highly profitable. The healthcare market is supported by many smaller businesses that focus on specific locations and specialties. These businesses sooner or later merge with or are acquired by larger companies in order to achieve greater geographic reach and scale. We expect the healthcare market to become more consolidated in 2019–2020.</p><p>Here are some statistics on the largest deals of the last 17 years based on data from a white paper by Irving Levin Associates titled <a href="https://products.levinassociates.com/hc21/" target="_blank">Seniors Housing and Health Care M&amp;A in the 21st Century</a>.</p><figure id="w-node-9ff92c689ab3-7a0a8b78"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5fb7dfd35ebfd3380f9487a5_5f6ccaa44b1024d0d55bcacf_5d109972dc8b4e844499c96f_1.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><figure id="w-node-100e4ab6eb20-7a0a8b78"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5fb7dfe39e7caa3326fa0327_5f6cca98e457f45e5029f66a_5d109980730acd202b508421_2.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>Healthcare management technologies</h2><p>An increasing number of patients, shortages of nurses and home healthcare providers, and constant regulatory updates push business owners towards new process management technologies. In 2019 and 2020 we expect further digitalization of healthcare, with wider use of process management software powered by AI:</p><ul role="list"><li>Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software for managing sales and customer data</li><li>Human Capital Management (HCM) software for recruiting and training employees</li><li>Field Service Management (FSM) software for better workflow synchronization</li></ul><p>As experts in digital healthcare solutions, we expect that artificial intelligence, IoT, consolidation within the industry, and adoption of AI-powered process management software will be the the trends that deliver the most innovative services and products in 2019 and 2020. Be ready, as these trends can impact our lives in the most unexpected ways!</p><p>Feel free to approach EGO to learn how you can develop truly innovative experiences by leveraging AI and IoT in your mobile app.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5fb7c533a29d5b2035e7ec00_5f6cbf011fddb44501d8d28d_5d3042f66324e92dec2018cb_Business%20Insights.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍<br></p></div></article><section><div><div><p>LIKE THIS ARTICLE?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><p><strong>UPDATE (11/30/2020):</strong><span> Espressif has confirmed the leak, officially announcing the ESP32-C3 as its first fully-RISC-V-based microcontroller product.</span></p><p>"ESP32-C3 attempts to address the most common needs for connected devices," the company explains. "Security is of prime importance. Even the lowest-cost connectivity solution needs to provide an appropriate level of security for common security threats. Bluetooth Low Energy availability is useful for improving user experience and field diagnostics. While cost is a very important parameter, the availability of sufficient memory for common use-cases is equally important."</p><p>The company's official announcement includes confirmation that the part is based on a 32-bit single-core RISC-V microcontroller running at up to 160MHz with 400kB of static RAM (SRAM), 2.4GHz Wi-Fi and Bleutooth Low Energy 5.0 support, and 22 programmable general-purpose input/output pins.</p><p><span>Espressif's announcement can be found </span><a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/news/ESP32_C3" rel="nofollow">on the company website</a><span>, along with a link to the part's datasheet.</span></p><p><em>Original article continues below.</em></p><p>Details of Espressif's next system-on-chip design, the ESP32-C3, have leaked ahead of schedule — and reveal a switch to the free and open source RISC-V instruction set architecture for the main processor, a first for the company.</p><p><span>Espressif's ESP family of microcontrollers has long been popular with makers and tinkerers thanks to its flexibility and low cost. The ESP8266 has been the basis for a number of builds requiring Wi-Fi connectivity, while the ESP32 offers improved performance. The ESP32-S2, meanwhile, boosted specifications still further — and </span><a href="https://www.hackster.io/news/espressif-s-240mhz-esp32-s2-socs-modules-and-boards-enter-mass-production-with-risc-v-coprocessor-9e70c98369dd" rel="nofollow">broke ground by adding an ultra-low-power coprocessor based on the free and open source RISC-V instruction set architecture</a><span>.</span></p><p>Now, it looks like Espressif is making the jump from Arm to RISC-V: Details have leaked of the ESP32-C3, the company's upcoming ESP32 entry, with claims it will be the first to use a RISC-V core as its primary processor — ditching Arm entirely.</p><div><div><p><span>The ESP32-C3 is claimed to be a drop-in replacement for the ESP8266.

A preliminary block diagram confirms a 32-bit RISC-V primary processor running at up to 160MHz, 2.4GHz Wi-Fi 802.11b/g/n and Bluetooth 5.0, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and Bluetooth Mesh connectivity, a real-time clock, cryptographic acceleration, and a range of on-board devices including GPIO, I2C, I2S, SPI, PWM, UART, GDMA, USB, TWAI, ADC, RMT, timers, and a temperature sensor.</span></p><p>Leaker Johnny Wu also claimed the parts will include 400kB of static RAM (SRAM) and 384kB ROM — figures backed up by a leaked datasheet marked "pre-release version 0.3" and bearing a 2020 copyright date. Software development, meanwhile, would take place in an updated framework compatible with existing ESP8266 applications.</p><p><span>Espressif has yet to confirm the leak, with more details available </span><a href="https://esp32.com/viewtopic.php?t=18107&amp;p=67696" rel="nofollow">in the ESP32.com forum</a><span>.</span></p></div></section><section></section><div><div><a href="https://www.hackster.io/ghalfacree"></a><div><p><span><a href="https://www.hackster.io/ghalfacree">Gareth Halfacree</a><span></span></span></p><p>Freelance journalist, technical author, hacker, tinkerer, erstwhile sysadmin.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<article>
<p>I have no real interests or hobbies. If I was shopping for myself I’d probably just buy another book on “growing your side hustle” or one of the many “building a startup” books.</p>
<p>Revenue, monetization, and profit are always the primary driver for my activities. Whether or not I actually care about a particular topic is sorta irrelevant. And my frustration is that depending on who I talk to, I get entirely different perspectives on whether this going to facilitate my success in life or not. For example, people who are like my business/money focused family applaud my efforts. They don’t understand how this is bad.</p>
<p>“Dave, how is spending your free time trying to make more money a bad thing? You can use that money to pursue your hobbies or interests.”</p>
<p>“Yeah uncle, but I honestly don’t know what my hobbies and interests are besides things that make more money.”</p>
<p>“Great Dave, so your passion is making money!”</p>
<p>“But I don’t want that to be my passion!”</p>
<p>But if I talk to my more passion focused friends, I’m sorta self-judging in my head.</p>
<p>“Dave, I’m working on a youth charity. It’s soo many hours of long work and stressful, but really rewarding.”</p>
<p>“Oh umm…that’s great Pam. But that’s a lot of work, and no money? Like…is it really worth it? Imagine if you turned it into some type of education business. What’s the market like for that? You could charge at least $300 per student.”</p>
<p>Ugh, this is what gives me migraines. My 25 year old anxiety is telling me that if I pick the wrong strategy then my future is forever doomed. I also have no idea where this obsession began. I didn’t grow up poor, so I can’t use that as an excuse for my obsession. I think it might have to do with imposter syndrome and feeling like I have to prove myself. Basically, if I have lots of money rolling in then I can say “fuck the system” and not be criticized. I falsely feel like people can’t judge me if I have my own business that’s making Elon Musk level income.</p>
<p>Or maybe it’s simply because I live in the United States, and that’s just our culture here. Plus with all the uncertainty, you never know when debt can hit you. Poverty, streets, homeless shelter, etc.</p>
<p>But this just all feels wrong to me. It feels like I’m digging myself into a bad hole. What if my time was used toward genuine activities and interests? I could also have a chance at financial success with those. I just don’t know what those genuine interests are. All I know is that when I chase after these money quests, I always feel cheated in the end.</p>
<p>Let’s walk inside my mind for a second.</p>
<p>So I work on coding side projects outside of work. Do I love coding and problem solving? Eh, I’m not really sure. But, I do love the idea of one day rolling in cash from some tool or app I built. Therefore, I’m going to spend my time trying to find a niche market that I can penetrate with some basic app/program that I can at least charge $100 a month for. Then I just need to spend a couple of hours everyday scouring through Google trends, Reddit, or Exploding Topics to find something people are currently into. Then maybe set up a landing page, and see if people enter in their credit card info. Or how about I search the Apple App Store and find some shitty app that people pay big bucks for and copy it? Oh wait, hold up, snack boxes are trending! Okay, so I can just set up a service for $20 a month to send people almonds, right?</p>
<p>Trust me, it gets worst.</p>
<p>I make videos on YouTube. I have a little over 200k subscribers currently. Do I like making videos? Eh…I’m not really sure. Truthfully, most days I would rather not engage in the activity. But influencer sponsorships pay a lot! Also, adsense is a really nice passive income source. So what I need to do is spend my time studying the YouTube algorithm so I can produce videos that get more views. More views equals more money!! Oh and remember when I made videos on Android? Yeah nobody cares about that niche anymore. So I’m going to use tools like TubeBuddy or VidIQ to see trending topics that people are watching. Okay people are all talking about <em>Among Us</em> right now. So if I make a video that’s at least 10 minutes long I can stick a mid-roll ad into it too! Don’t forget all the long-tail keywords. Wait, my website hardly has any ads on it right now. I’m missing out on extra income! I need at least a sidebar ad and also a footer ad.</p>
<p>Guess what? After two days I lost motivation in the Snackbox idea. As for YouTube, I made videos on the “well researched SEO friendly topics” and they performed horribly. It was like another slap in the face saying “Dave, this is what happens when you chase money without regard for interests.” But….but…all the entrepreneurs say just having interest in building a business is enough!</p>
<p>Yeah, so I don’t know what to say or how to end this. I’m just hoping that by sharing my obstacles and fears I get some helpful incite; or at least connect people who also share this struggle. I feel like it’s one of the many problems that’s not addressed adequately and leaves us just desperate for answers.</p>

<p>Using <code>&lt;iostream&gt;</code>´s <code>std::cin</code> and <code>std::cout</code> is the preferred way to handle
input and output in C++. It's type-safe and extensible, but all of this comes
at a cost. Let's look at an example program.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;iostream&gt;</span><span></span>

<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>argc</span><span>,</span> <span>char</span><span>*</span> <span>argv</span><span>[])</span>

<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Compiling this program with g++ 9.10 and running it on my machine with 10^6

<p>This doesn't seem half bad but we can do better!</p>
<h4 id="disable-synchronization-with-stdio">Disable Synchronization with <code>stdio</code><a href="#disable-synchronization-with-stdio" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>The C and C++ standard streams are per default synchronized. This allows you to
mix C- and C++-style I/O and get deterministic results. However, if you are
sure that you won't use C-style I/O, you can disable this synchronization. This
can lead to an improvement in performance.</p>
<p>To disable synchronization, add following line to your program:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;iostream&gt;</span><span></span>

<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>argc</span><span>,</span> <span>char</span><span>*</span> <span>argv</span><span>[])</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>ios_base</span><span>::</span><span>sync_with_stdio</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>);</span>
</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>int</span> <span>n</span> <span>=</span> <span>1000000</span><span>;</span>

    <span>for</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>n</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>int</span> <span>d</span><span>;</span>
        <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>cin</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>d</span><span>;</span>
        <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>cout</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>d</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This brings the program runtime down to 0,421 seconds.</p>

<h4 id="untying-stdcin-from-stdcout">Untying <code>std::cin</code> from <code>std::cout</code><a href="#untying-stdcin-from-stdcout" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>One additional trick is to untie <code>std::cin</code> from <code>std::cout</code>. Tied streams
ensure that one stream is flushed before any I/O operations on the other. This
is useful for interactive console programs but also slows down programs for
large I/O. It is possible to untie the two streams with the following function
call:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;iostream&gt;</span><span></span>

<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>argc</span><span>,</span> <span>char</span><span>*</span> <span>argv</span><span>[])</span>

    <span>}</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Running this program takes 0,100 seconds, which is a massive improvement.</p>

<p>The C standard library provides the <code>scanf()</code> and

<p>So, are <code>std::cin</code> and <code>std::cout</code> unsynchronized and untied still the winners?
No - we can do better!</p>
<h3 id="getchar-and-putchar">getchar() and putchar()<a href="#getchar-and-putchar" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p><code>getchar()</code> and <code>putchar()</code> are the most primitive I/O functions in the C

<p>As it happens, there is one more trick we can use. Both <code>getchar()</code> and
<code>putchar()</code> are thread safe which is generally preferrable. If one really wants
the fastest possible I/O there are so called unlocked versions of <code>getchar()</code>
and <code>putchar()</code>. These functions should only be used in thread-safe contexts
such as single-threaded applications.</p>
<p>On POSIX systems, they are defined as <code>getchar_unlocked()</code> and
<code>putchar_unlocked()</code>. On Windows systems, they are defined as
<code>_getchar_nolock()</code> and <code>_putchar_nolock()</code>. Let's use these in our custom I/O
functions.</p>

<p>So, how should you do I/O? Usually, just use <code>std::cout</code> and <code>std::cin</code> or
<code>scanf()</code> and <code>printf()</code> as they are safe and easy to use. If you need to
squeeze out performance you can, in very specific cases use the tricks
mentioned in this article.</p></div></div>]]>

                <p><em>By <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabian-hauck/">Fabian Hauck</a> (<a href="https://www.yes.com/">yes.com</a>), Daniel Fett (<a href="https://www.yes.com/">yes.com</a>), <a href="https://twitter.com/josephheenan">Joseph Heenan</a> (<a href="https://www.authlete.com/">Authlete</a>)</em></p>

<p>OAuth flows on mobile devices can benefit a lot from native apps. With native
apps, for example, it is possible to use already existing sessions and biometric
authentication features. While apps improve the user experience, they also bring
new security challenges to OAuth, especially for services like open banking.
This document describes the challenges of redirections between native apps and
web applications on Android and iOS and recommends solutions based on currently
available features of the mobile operating systems and browsers. Our
recommendations are more detailed than those from <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8252">RFC8252 (OAuth 2.0 for Native
Apps)</a> and also address use cases with very
high security requirements. A <a href="https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-Android/pull/622">pull request for the AppAuth-Android
project</a> has been created.
<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="1-what-is-the-problem">1. What is the Problem?</h2>

<p>When using OAuth to authorize the access to protected resources or OpenID
Connect for authentication, it is crucial to secure the issuance process of the
access token or ID token. Above all, it is important that the Authorization
Request and the Authorization Response do not get hijacked by an adversary.</p>

<p>If, for example, an OAuth Authorization Response is hijacked and the client does not
use <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636">PKCE</a>, the adversary could inject the
stolen authorization code into his own session to get access to the victim’s
protected resources (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics-14.html#rfc.section.4.5">Code
Injection</a>).
PKCE can help to protect against Code Injection, but if the Authorization
Request is hijacked as well, the attacker can modify it and use the resulting
authorization code despite PKCE. This attack is similar to the one described
<a href="https://web-in-security.blogspot.com/2017/01/pkce-what-cannot-be-protected.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Even using <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-par">Pushed Authorization
Requests</a> (PAR) or <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-jwsreq">signing
the Authorization Request</a>
will not mitigate all of the attacks that are possible if the OAuth redirection
gets hijacked: For example, an attacker who can intercept the authorization
request and response on a victim’s device could replace the whole authorization
request (containing the PAR request URI or JAR signed request) with an
authorization request generated using a client under his control. Then, after
the victim authorized the access, the attacker could read the authorization
response and use the authorization code on his own device, gaining access to the
victim’s resources. Therefore, it is critical to properly secure the redirection
to the OpenID Connect Identity Provider (IDP) (or OAuth authorization server)
and back in terms of integrity and secrecy.</p>

<p>In a browser, it is generally secure to redirect the user using a URL, assuming
that the URL is not under the attacker’s control, but on mobile operating
systems, the situation is much more complicated.</p>

<p>Android, for example, permits arbitrary apps to claim that they handle a
specific domain - even of other apps installed from the Google Play Store.
Although it is possible to verify a domain-app association (<a href="https://developer.android.com/training/app-links">Android App
Link</a>) this mechanism is not
active if the app belonging to the domain is not installed on the device. In
case the IDP app is not installed, the user would have to choose from a menu
with which app he wants to open the URL.</p>

<p><img src="https://danielfett.de/img/posts/app2app/app_chooser_dialog.png" alt=""></p>

<p>As we can see in the picture, a malicious OpenID Provider app also claims to
handle the authorization server’s domain. In this case, the user could choose
the malicious app instead of the browser.</p>

<p>Another problem on Android is the redirection back from the IDP website loaded in the browser to the Relying Party (RP) app. If the RP app uses an Android
App Link and the user was redirected to the Chrome browser, the user
can be sent back to the app by simply being redirected to the Android
App Link. This does not, however, work in most of the other browsers. To be
browser independent, it is necessary to use a custom URL scheme.
Arbitrary apps, however, can register themselves
to handle the same custom scheme, making this technique susceptible to redirect
hijacking.</p>

<p>On iOS the situation is different. There, an app can only claim to
handle an <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code> scheme URL if it can verify an association 
with the domain (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/universal-links/">Universal Links</a>).
Custom schemes can be claimed, like on Android, by every app, but the OS will
not display a selection menu - it will instead arbitrarily pick one of the apps.</p>

<p>In the following, we will distinguish the following cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>app2app: Both RP or OAuth client and the IDP or OAuth authorization server
have a native app installed on the user’s device.</li>
  <li>app2web: The RP or OAuth client is a native app, but the IDP/server app is
not installed. A web application is to be used instead.</li>
  <li>web2app: The RP or OAuth client is a web site, but an IDP or OAuth server app
is installed.</li>
</ul>

<p>The web2web case is (more or less) classic OAuth/OIDC and therefore not
considered in this document.</p>

<h2 id="2-attacker-model">2. Attacker Model</h2>

<p>When talking about a class of security problems, it is always helpful to have a
rough idea of the types of attackers that are considered relevant and those that
are out of scope. Here, the attacker model could be outlined as follows:</p>

<p>We assume that attackers …</p>

<ul>
  <li>… can install apps that register the same custom scheme as an honest app.</li>
  <li>… cannot install apps that verify an app association with a domain they do
not control.</li>
  <li>… cannot manipulate the operating system.</li>
</ul>

<p>Specifically on Android, the following distinctions are important as well:</p>

<p>We assume that attackers …</p>

<ul>
  <li>… cannot install apps through the Play Store with the same applicationID as
an honest app in the Play Store.</li>
  <li>… can install apps with the same applicationID as an honest app through a
third-party app store or sideloading.</li>
  <li>… cannot sign an APK with a certificate they do not control.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3-security-goals">3. Security Goals</h2>

<p>Under the attacker model outlined above, what are the goals that a good solution should achieve?</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>When the user is redirected from the RP to the IDP, he should either go to
the legit app or to the default browser to ensure integrity and secrecy of
the authorization request. Ideally, an in-app browser that shares cookies
with the system’s default browser is opened (on Android, if supported, an
Android Custom Tab; on iOS <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code>). There should never
be a menu where the user has to choose between multiple apps.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the user is redirected from the IDP back to the RP, he should be sent
back to the app/browser where he started the process.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="4-solution-on-ios">4. Solution on iOS</h2>
<p>On iOS, we can use Universal Links to redirect the user from one app to another.
The good thing here is that we can set a flag called <code>.universalLinksOnly:
true</code>. This will only redirect the user if an app that has claimed this link is
installed and the link has been verified by the OS for the domain.</p>

<p>(Source: <a href="https://openid.net/2019/10/21/guest-blog-implementing-app-to-app-authorisation-in-oauth2-openid-connect/">Blog post by Joseph
Heenan</a>.)</p>

<p>In case the app is not installed, we can launch an
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/aswebauthenticationsession">ASWebAuthenticationSession</a>
that opens an in-app browser session powered by Safari. With this, it is
possible to use existing session cookies from the Safari browser. To redirect
back to the app, the app specifies a claimed https url before launching the
browser. If the browser is redirected to the claimed https url the browser will
exit and give the URL back to the app.</p>

<h3 id="41-limitations-on-ios">4.1. Limitations on iOS</h3>

<p>If the user normally uses a browser other than the system Safari, it is at best difficult to return them to that browser in the web2app flow, and to send them to that browser in the app2web flow.</p>

<p>iOS14 improves this situation by adding a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/allowing_apps_and_websites_to_link_to_your_content/preparing_your_app_to_be_the_default_browser_or_email_client">system level preference where the user can select an alternative browser</a> - however the alternative browser will not be able to share cookies/sessions with the system Safari, and <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code> will always be handled by the system Safari. Unfortunately the rules for 
alternate browsers do not currently seem to require them to implement Universal Links, nor to provide a similar user experience to Safari if they do support them.</p>

<p>iOS requires apps are signed using an extra permission that is manually granted by Apple before they can become the default browser, so it seems we can trust that the default browser is generally not malicious.</p>

<p>For the OAuth client (OIDC relying party), if flows starting in both app and mobile web are supported, it’s probably best to use different redirect uris depending on whether the flow starts in the app or in the mobile web browser, so there is a higher chance the flow ends up back where the user started. (By contrast, the OAuth server / OpenID Provider should generally not use different urls for its authorization endpoint for the web vs app flows, as there is no standard way to publish the alternative URL.)</p>

<h2 id="5-solution-for-android">5. Solution for Android</h2>

<p>For Android, we will first look at the challenges of the app2app/app2web case
and the web2app case separately. Afterwards, we will provide a recommendation
for a  robust solution.</p>

<h3 id="51-app2app-and-app2web-solutions-on-android">5.1. App2App and App2Web Solutions on Android</h3>

<p>How could we approach the problem on Android?</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Open app via HTTPS link</strong>
    <div><div><pre><code><span>val</span> <span>uri</span> <span>=</span> <span>Uri</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>"https://app2app.unsicher.ovh?request_uri=Hello_World"</span><span>)</span>

<span>val</span> <span>browserIntent</span> <span>=</span> <span>Intent</span><span>(</span><span>Intent</span><span>.</span><span>ACTION_VIEW</span><span>,</span> <span>uri</span><span>)</span>
<span>startActivity</span><span>(</span><span>browserIntent</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>If the app of the domain owner is installed and supports <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/app-links">Android App
Links</a>, the legit app will
always be opened. If the domain owner app is not installed, the OS will
display an app chooser dialog (as can be seen in the screenshot above). Since
any app can claim to handle the domain name, the user could choose an app
from an attacker. This is not a good solution.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Open the web browser with an intent that has the category <em>CATEGORY_APP_BROWSER</em> set</strong>

            <p>In the last 10 or so years, Product management has become one of the <a href="https://blog.linkedin.com/2019/january/10/linkedins-most-promising-jobs-of-2019">most sought after roles</a> across the globe. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->  <!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The thrill of launching products for millions, if not billions, of users has led to an unprecedented increase in the demand for product management jobs. New product companies (and roles) are not sprouting up at the same rate as aspiring product managers. As a result, there are considerably more job seekers than product management job openings.</p><p>This imbalance is making it challenging for non-PMs to land their first PM jobs. The employers, on the other end, are not to blame. They have a wide variety of experienced professionals to choose from; hence they prefer hiring candidates with more experience over those who have zero product experience.</p><p>This asymmetry in the product management job market makes the evergreen question - &nbsp;<em>"How can I get relevant product management experience without being a PM?"</em> - very relevant and, at the same time, tough to answer.</p><p>If you still don't believe that this problem has existed for years, take a look at these tweets from the last five years.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/prodmgmt?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#prodmgmt</a> Can one really get a &lt;b&gt;product management&lt;/b&gt; job without prior work experience? <a href="http://t.co/3klrqXuIj4">http://t.co/3klrqXuIj4</a></p>— Ali Sadhik Shaik (@sadhiqali) <a href="https://twitter.com/sadhiqali/status/550562681087090688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 1, 2015</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>I spent the last few weeks reading tens of articles and speaking to product leaders in my pursuit to find the perfect answer to the above question. As an outcome, I created a strategy that is relentlessly practical and will help aspiring PMs acquire the expertise and knowledge required to land their first PM job.</p><p>I will share this guide in three posts. This post contains resources that will help you understand a PM's real responsibilities without actually being a PM. The second post will highlight the skills required and what you can do to acquire them. In the final post, I will share the different paths that aspiring PMs can take to land their first job.</p><h2 id="how-to-understand-a-pm-s-real-responsibilities">How to understand a PM's real responsibilities</h2><p>Do this to understand what a PM does every day:</p><ol><li>Have a side project</li><li>Keep building your network</li><li>Ask for help</li></ol><h2 id="have-a-side-project-">Have a side project. </h2><p>Product management is all about solving real problems by creating world-class solutions. </p><p>Doing that <strong><a href="https://emojipedia.org/index-pointing-up/">☝️</a></strong> doesn't need you to have a product mangement job. All you need is to identify a real-world problem - preferable something that you can relate to - and then try your best to solve it. The best way to do that - A Side Project aka Side Hustle aka Indie Hacking</p><p>Side projects could be of two types: freelanced short-term tasks or longer-term projects that you'd like to grow and maintain over time. I believe starting and growing a side project is a stricter test to pass than doing a few one-off freelanced tasks. But, both have their merits.</p><h3 id="why-you-should-do-it-">Why you should do it: </h3><p>Working on a side project is very similar to working in a small startup or a new product. As a side project founder, you will ask the same questions that experienced PMs answer every day. And provided you keep working on your idea consistently, you will also start uncovering the answers to these questions. </p><p>Creating and growing a project will be the closest you can get to being a PM without having a real PM job. </p><p>Some of the questions that you might ask your self when you start a side project:</p><ol><li>What problem should I solve?</li><li>For which customers am I solving the problem?</li><li>What is the best solution to the problem? How do I validate the solution / how do I find product-market fit?</li><li>Given that I work a day job, how do I prioritize my time and make enough progress every week?</li><li>How do I scale my project from 10 to 100 to 1000 users?</li><li>What does success look like for my project?</li></ol><p>This list can go on and on. But, the point is simple - if you seriously set out to solve a meaningful problem, you will ask the right questions, and do whatever it takes to find suitable answers. This is what a PM does every day.</p><h3 id="how-you-should-do-it-">How you should do it: </h3><p>If you want to explore the freelance route, you can choose from many online platforms. A few that I know of are <a href="https://www.freelancer.com/">Freelancer</a>, <a href="https://www.upwork.com/">Upwork</a>, <a href="https://www.toptal.com/">Toptal</a>.</p><p>If you want to explore the second route (of doing something that is more long-term), here is my recommendation:</p><p><strong>Start broad, but go deep.</strong> There are hundreds of blogs, newsletters, communities, and job boards started as side projects. But even then, only a very few stand out. The reason is simple - solving a challenging problem for a niche audience always does well. These inspiring stories will help you put things in perspective: <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/forum/quick-chat-with-harry-dry-of-marketing-examples-116a066793?utm_campaign=digest-daily&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=indie-hackers-emails">Marketing Examples by Harry Dry</a>, <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/70-000-monthly-pageviews-10-months-of-blogging-51fba271f4?utm_campaign=digest-daily&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=indie-hackers-emails">70K page views in 10 months of blogging</a>, <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/how-my-paid-community-made-5k-in-its-first-week-08f10cf0d7?utm_campaign=digest-daily&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=indie-hackers-emails">Blogging for Devs Paid Community made $5K in its first week</a>.</p><p><strong>Get on the #nocode wagon</strong>. No-code tools allow you to create full-blown websites, blogs, SaaS solutions in a matter of weeks without any coding skill. These tools have gained more popularity in the recent WFH times, as more and more people have more and more time, and hence want to try building something on their own.</p><p>There are many tools available. I use and highly recommend the following:</p><ol><li><a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> for blogging</li><li><a href="https://mightynetworks.com/">Mighty Networks</a> and <a href="http://circle.so/">Circle</a> for community building</li><li><a href="https://carrd.co/">Carrd</a> for landing pages</li><li><a href="https://convertkit.com/">ConvertKit</a> for email newsletters</li><li><a href="http://bubble.io/">Bubble</a> and <a href="https://webflow.com/">Webflow</a> to build full-scale websites.</li><li><a href="http://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> to automate and make all of it work together</li></ol><p><strong>Actively browse and participate in relevant online communities.</strong> Find relevant communities and utilize them to discover new ideas, or to validate your thoughts, or both. Aim for communities which have high engagement rates and helpful members.</p><p>Good communities will also provide an archive of success stories, which are the most significant source of inspiration and motivation. A few communities that I strongly recommend:</p><p>1. <a href="http://indiehackers.com/">IndieHackers</a> - a community of highly engaged solo founders who share their progress and help others building their side businesses</p><p>2. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/">Product Management subreddit</a> - has a highly engaged reader base and very interesting posts like this one:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote data-card-created="1606694496"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/hywwwt/i_know_pms_will_actually_value_this_this_is_how_a/">I know PMs will actually value this. This is how a blind person uses iPhone. I always have heard accessibility questions in interviews, this gives a real perspective to them.</a> from <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement">r/ProductManagement</a></blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: html--><p>3. Follow relevant accounts on Twitter. Most product champions and experts use Twitter to share their opinions. In other words, the product gurus of the world share knowledge on Twitter. For free. </p><p>I will save you the pain of finding these accounts by sharing a few Twitter lists that I created and follow actively: <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1281216638969360384">Product People</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1288266872710995968">Product CEOs and Founders</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1311426179904278528">Product Companies</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1313485407418560515">Community Building</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/183562147">Content Marketing</a></p><p>4. Quora Spaces on product management like <a href="https://www.quora.com/topic/Product-Management?q=product">this one</a> and <a href="https://www.quora.com/topic/Product-Managers">this one</a></p><hr><h2 id="keep-building-your-network-">Keep building your network.</h2><h3 id="why-you-should-do-it--1">Why you should do it: </h3><p>The more people you know, the more you learn, and the more opportunities you discover. Product management is not science, which means every person you talk to will have a different approach to the same problem (<em>"How can I get relevant product management experience without being a PM?")</em>. The more solutions you discover, the better the chances of you solving the problem for yourself.</p><p>You never know when one of your connections is looking for a new PM, and gets in touch with you because they enjoyed their last interaction with you.</p><p>It sounds better when Robert Kiyosaki says it:</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The richest people in the world look for and build networks, everyone else looks for work. Marinate on that for a minute.</p>— therealkiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) <a href="https://twitter.com/theRealKiyosaki/status/453653343961772032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 8, 2014</a></blockquote>

</figure><h3 id="how-you-should-do-it--1">How you should do it:</h3><p><strong>Add relevant people on LinkedIn</strong>. I am confident there is at least one person out there who has a background similar to yours and works for the company you aspire to work for. The goal is to find that person (or persons) and ask them how they did what you are now trying to do.</p><p>An easy way to find such people is to do a simple LinkedIn search that includes relevant keywords. For example, when I was applying for product management jobs during MBA, I would find relevant profiles by using a combination of keywords like "ISB product manager India", or "ISB product manager Amazon", or "engineering product manager India".</p><p>Once you find the relevant people, ensure you ask targeted questions. Most people helpful, but there is a high chance they get multiple unsolicited messages every day. So keep your questions short and to the point. "How do I get into Facebook" type of questions will almost always not get you a response.</p><p><strong>Volunteer and attend conferences. </strong>Attend networking events, webinars, seminars on subjects that you find interesting. Attending these events will help you do two things: learn about the topic and meet new people who you can call later for guidance. The lockdown has forced the world to make all events virtual, which means it is easier for you to attend events that you wouldn't have had acess to otherwise. Make the most of this opportunity.</p><p><strong>Leverage AMA (ask me anything) sessions</strong> by asking targeted questions to the speaker. You will realize that other participants in these sessions are facing the same problems as you. Connect with such people and exchange ideas and best practices. The <a href="http://The lockdown has forced most of the bigger seminars, conferences to be virutal. Which means it is easier than ever before to be a part of these talks. Don't miss out on this opportunity.">Product School Slack Community</a> does regular AMAs with PMs from Google, FB, Uber, etc.</p><hr><h2 id="ask-for-help">Ask for help</h2><h3 id="why-you-should-do-it--2">Why you should do it: </h3><p>There are more people than you think who are willing to go out of their way to help. And most of them have a lot of expertise and experience through which you can learn. Hence, just straight up …</p></div></article></main></div></div></div>

            <!-- content --><p>Years ago, we had a big decision to make. In 2013, STH had grown to a size that would seem immeasurably small by the traffic we do today. Still, at that point, we made the decision that it made fiscal sense to leave Amazon AWS for colocation. We chronicled the reasoning in <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/falling-sky-sth-leaving-cloud-amazon-aws/">Falling From the Sky Why STH is Leaving the Cloud</a> and then the cost breakdown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/falling-sky-part-3-evaluating-amazon-ec2-vps-dedicated-colocation-options/">Falling From the Sky Part 3 – Evaluating Amazon EC2, VPS, Dedicated and Colocation Options</a>. Since 2013, we have been doing some irregular updates that largely correspond to planned upgrades of our infrastructure. Since we are taking a look at a few upgrades again, it is time to go through the exercise again.<span id="more-48850"></span></p>

<p>If you want to hear this instead of just reading, we have a YouTube video with some commentary here:</p>
<p><iframe title="Our Colocation Hosting versus AWS Costs Compared 2020 Edition" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RqetN_i0BnE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, we can go into a bit more detail below, but some prefer to listen rather than read so we have that option.</p>

<p>In 2018, we looked again at whether it was time to move back to the cloud. In our cost analysis, this is what we found using 1-year estimates:</p>
<figure id="attachment_26722" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-26722"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/falling-from-the-sky-part-4-leaving-the-cloud-5-years-later/sth-2018-web-hosting-budget-v-aws/" rel="attachment wp-att-26722"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/STH-2018-Web-Hosting-Budget-v-AWS.jpg" alt="STH 2018 Web Hosting Budget V AWS" width="536" height="156" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/STH-2018-Web-Hosting-Budget-v-AWS.jpg 536w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/STH-2018-Web-Hosting-Budget-v-AWS-400x116.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/STH-2018-Web-Hosting-Budget-v-AWS-533x156.jpg 533w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/STH-2018-Web-Hosting-Budget-v-AWS-534x156.jpg 534w" sizes="(max-width: 536px) 100vw, 536px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-26722">STH 2018 Web Hosting Budget V AWS</figcaption></figure>
<p>Just to give some sense of how that March 2018 estimate has gone in the 32 months since we looked at this, we ended up using:</p>
<ul>
<li>Way more bandwidth. STH has grown a ton since 2018. We also focus more on reviews which tend to use more photos. Even with lazy loading images, our bandwidth usage is significantly higher. This did not incur an incremental cost based on how we buy bandwidth. See: <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/buyers-guide-hosting-bandwidth-data-transfer-billing/">Buyer’s Guide to Hosting: Bandwidth, Data Transfer and Billing</a></li>
<li>Several of our VMs doubled memory requirements and we added slightly more storage. We overprovisioned so this was absorbed with still enough leftover.</li>
<li>We replaced a <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/9-step-calm-and-easy-proxmox-ve-boot-drive-failure-recovery/">SSD</a>, upgraded a firewall, and added another <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/explaining-the-automatic-transfer-switching-ats-pdu/">ATS PDU</a>. We have not done long-term infrastructure upgrades.</li>
<li>We ended up using an upgraded node that we had available, as a “hot spare”. We tend to “self-warranty” hardware, and so we had an extra system/ chassis there.</li>
<li>We are going to say we used four hours of labor. This includes drive time to the primary data center. Since it is far away (18-20 minute drive), we actually did not go there for several quarters. So over 32 months, we had budgeted $640 for remote hands. We effectively either paid $160/ hr or paid less than that even rounding up to four hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, it looks like we probably over-estimated self-hosting costs again, and underestimated AWS costs with respect to how much we would spend there, even after service discounts.</p>
<h2>The Late 2020 AWS v. Colocation Update</h2>
<p>We wanted to answer the question of what the picture would look like for hosting STH now. A few quick words before we get there on assumptions.</p>
<p>First off, we completely could change the way we run the site. That is a given. Frankly, running in VMs whether on the cloud or in self-hosting is convenient. Indeed, we run containers in VMs as well. We could also overhaul the entire software stack again, but frankly, we want to spend more time creating content then doing that work. Something that we learned was that we had less reliability by increasing complexity than by keeping things as simple as possible.</p>
<p>Second, we are modeling current data transfer, and a minimal set of VMs. We actually have a lot more running, including some services that we run for some of the labs. One could argue that since they are lab services they are part of bringing you STH, but they are not focused on the web hosting aspect so we are going to remove them. Also, we have other VMs that are likely only online because we wanted to try something and had capacity. We may or may not elect to run the VMs if there was the AWS incremental cost. We could model these as on-demand or spot instances, but instead, we are just removing them entirely.</p>
<p>Third, we completely understand spot pricing. We are modeling a basic set instead of adding extras. At some point, we need databases, nginx servers, and so forth.</p>
<p>Fourth, we are going to add a mix of AMD EPYC and Intel Xeon instances roughly about what we use for our hosting. We are heavily weighting the larger instances toward the EPYC instances since that helps bring down the costs and for our workloads, there is no appreciable difference. We could go Arm, but that requires some small lift and shift work.</p>
<p>Finally, we do use some AWS services. Those services we would use regardless so we are excluding them from the analysis. We are also not modeling services such as Mailchimp which handles our weekly newsletter, Teespring that handles our online merch shop, YouTube which hosts our videos, and so forth.</p>
<h3>AWS Cost 1-Year Reserved No Upfront</h3>
<p>Here is the calculator for the absolute base setup for our hosting using 1-year reserved upfront instances:</p>
<figure id="attachment_48851" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48851"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/falling-from-the-sky-2020-self-hosting-still-pays/2020-aws-calculator-1-year-reserved-no-upfront/" rel="attachment wp-att-48851"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Reserved-No-Upfront.jpg" alt="2020 AWS Calculator 1 Year Reserved No Upfront" width="1114" height="222" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Reserved-No-Upfront.jpg 1114w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Reserved-No-Upfront-400x80.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Reserved-No-Upfront-800x159.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Reserved-No-Upfront-696x139.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-Calculator-1-Year-Reserved-No-Upfront-1068x213.jpg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1114px) 100vw, 1114px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48851">2020 AWS Calculator 1 Year Reserved No Upfront</figcaption></figure>
<p>As you can see, our hosting costs are just under $4,300 per month.</p>
<h3>AWS Cost 1-Year Reserved Partial Upfront</h3>
<p>Swapping to 1-year reserved partial up-front on the instances helps bring pricing down a bit albeit with a $19,512 up-front cost.</p>

<p>When we factor in the up-front we get a $4,137.63 monthly cost along with a $49,651.56 total annual cost for the year. We are not discounting here using future values/ present values. There is a big issue with this. Typically, we tend to see our servers run for years. To model that, we tend to use 3-year reserved partial upfront.</p>
<h3>AWS Cost 3-Year Reserved Partial Upfront</h3>
<p>Using the 3-year reserved partial upfront on the instances gives us a much lower operating cost with a larger up-front payment.</p>

<p>First off, the $39,020 is more than we have spent in the last three years on hosting hardware. We do not purchase machines with long warranties or high markups, so if you are buying the average Dell/ HPE/ Lenovo server and think that sounds like a single server, you are trading higher upfront costs for service contracts. Given what we have seen on hardware/ remote hands, it is not a model we are pursuing. On the operating side, we get down to $1,968.51 per month which is great.</p>
<h2>STH 2020 Hosting Budget</h2>
<p>Next year, we will likely do two small changes. First, we will upgrade database nodes and instead of using Optane SSDs, we will move to Cascade Lake and Optane PMem DIMMs into the database servers and upgrade a few older nodes to AMD EPYC 7002 “Rome” systems. We are testing the Ampere Altra 80-core server right now, and we are at the point where we might consider using Arm in the hosting cluster this year. We are going to increase our hardware budget to $10,000 this year. Although we did not use most of our hardware budget in 2019 nor 2020, we expect to in 2021.</p>
<p>Making up our monthly cost, we increased a bit for inflation. We used a $895/ mo budget in 2018. Our costs are effectively flat, but we are going to assume a bit more labor to install servers/ upgrade the hardware.</p>
<figure id="attachment_48855" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48855"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/falling-from-the-sky-2020-self-hosting-still-pays/2020-aws-v-self-hosting/" rel="attachment wp-att-48855"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-v-Self-Hosting.jpg" alt="2020 AWS V Self Hosting" width="685" height="197" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-v-Self-Hosting.jpg 685w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-AWS-v-Self-Hosting-400x115.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 685px) 100vw, 685px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-48855">2020 AWS V Self Hosting</figcaption></figure>
<p>We are budgeting $22,000 per year or around $1833.33 per month. This is about the same as we would need for EC2’s 3-year partial upfront reserved instance, albeit without the up-front costs.</p>
<p>The one item that skews this substantially, is that we are not replacing every node every year. We are now in a very different place than we were when we started this journey. We have existing infrastructure that is frankly fine from a performance and node count standpoint even though we have relatively under-invested over the past 32 months. We had budgeted around $1687/ month for the last two months and spent under $1000. Still, at some point, we like to replace equipment before it fails.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>There is clearly a lot going into this. We now have just under 8 years since this 10U colocation spot in Las Vegas was our first setup:</p>

<p>What is not reflected in our discussion is all of the lessons learned along the way. Also, as hardware has gotten faster, and memory prices have decreased, the cost of self-hosting has gone down significantly for our applications. We are also taking advantage of falling bandwidth prices. While AWS is absolutely the right choice for many applications, and indeed we use them, for our web hosting it is not what we want for a simple and inexpensive setup. This may not be the perfect analysis, but it is a little bit of how we now look at hosting at STH.</p>

<h2 data-mce-style="text-align: left;"><b>Who has taught Yahav the most about eCom?</b></h2>
<p>Yahav had a detailed answer to this question. He claimed that as he transitioned through businesses, so did his mentors. At Emarsys, he looked up to his manager. It was under his influence that he strengthened his product skills and learned about eCom. While working in the ad agency, he looked up to MUTESIX, which is a world-class ad agency. Currently, with Madgicx, he looks up to companies with the same business models generating yearly revenue of over 100 million.</p></div></div>]]>

                    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed the way we operate in the world. One of the most significant changes has been a large shift to remote work. According to a <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/ceo-agenda/ceo-panel-survey-emerge-stronger.pdf">survey conducted by PwC</a>, 80% of CEOs expect widespread remote work to continue even after COVID-19 passes.</p><p>With distributed workforces becoming more prevalent, the use of video conferencing technology has skyrocketed. We used our <a href="https://www.datashake.com/review-index-api">Review Index API</a> to analyze the aggregated consumer reviews of Zoom Video Communications and how those reviews relate to the company’s stock performance.</p><blockquote>We include the notebook used for this data analysis at the end of this post, as well as all the raw data for your own analysis.</blockquote><p>Extracting the online review data for this analysis was made easy by our Review Index API, allowing us to extract Zoom's online reviews in just one API call:</p><figure><pre><code>$ curl --request GET --url 'https://app.datashake.com/api/v2/review_index?domain=zoom.us&amp;ticker_symbol=ZM' --header 'spiderman-token: API_KEY'</code></pre><figcaption>Remember to replace API_KEY with your own API key.</figcaption></figure><p>In the background, this API has done the heavy lifting of indexing all of Zoom's review profiles across the Internet, along with their associated reviews.</p><h2 id="diving-into-the-data">Diving into the Data</h2><p><strong>Review Rating</strong></p><p>Although Zoom has exploded in popularity since the pandemic, it has been a favorite among remote workers for years. Zoom is not only a great video conferencing software but a top software company overall. The Software Report, which ranks companies based on industry professional and customer reviews, <a href="https://www.thesoftwarereport.com/the-top-100-software-companies-of-2020/">ranked Zoom 33rd best</a> software company in the world in 2020.</p><p>Compared to its competitors – which include BlueJeans, GoToMeeting, Join.me, Skype, Slack and Webex – Zoom’s consumer reviews are exceptional. Since the beginning of 2019, Zoom’s average review rating has not dropped below a score of 4 (out of 5).</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iTGuYrDaOXUWe_7-zwD7_wvRfN9RUKfa-4l8L5II9Jnevn4nBaktsi5TL1G8Vbb2AhfVJUnsQUbUhEhSp6gx47lTBe_DoBiP_pswrULTac5x2yJxDnCPouo1Of5K4vsnZXM_DQJDzRg82tT2mg" alt=""></figure><p>However, Zoom’s average rating has dropped slightly since COVID-19 started. Before the pandemic, Zoom averaged a review rating of 4.66 and averaged a review rating of 4.55 after the pandemic.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/z9aeFU3rcw06ELomxMX2TE6yArPS40r5ZQ8nMF6DFvxkcMgjXlPF9iEMK-EOWLMRAQaQqR2o7IYcWTr394DT_oFCcl4Up0n2pwkAax01VCz5zIeJUvWEfMQgzxRT6LAX7ZHZEXgpuIyqyFP4gg" alt=""></figure><p><strong>Review Text</strong><br>Zoom’s rating drop can most likely be attributed to a large influx of new users putting more stress on their infrastructure. Our Review Index API also comes with the actual review text for every review across multiple platforms. &nbsp;If we look at reviews with a rating of 3 or worse that mention “quality” in the review text, we can get a good idea of how many consumers were unhappy with Zoom’s quality.</p><p>We can see from the chart below that quality issue reviews spiked from July to August, right around the same time Zoom’s average rating dropped. The review rating and the percentage of quality issue reviews have a correlation coefficient of -0.38. So, when quality issues rise, the average review rating tends to drop.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7NtOKn_xUFg_lnDp3femO58IgmqNPDKiBukZpRzUCYCz1aQIQbuoIL71o3wR0dp_oDYBJdlGv3WoO77lAXfrGlZVHecdfMtJY59BYS5kpg9q_BbpsczVAeT_yrisLUjfuRVf60d37BKjm__N6Q" alt=""></figure><p>After COVID-19 began, Zoom’s average rating dropped by 2.2%, which was the second to worst drop compared to Join.me’s 2.3% drop. Zoom’s quality issues may be something to keep an eye on in the short-term but a well-managed company like Zoom should be able to make the necessary adjustments.</p><p><strong>Review Volume</strong></p><p>When it comes to review volume, Zoom’s advantage over competitors becomes more apparent. Since COVID-19 began, the review volume of Zoom’s competitors has dropped or only slightly risen while Zoom’s review volume has surged.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/GfyE4NBkIYLa6zbPHtSeVrESc5dEbGu9r6KO8mWCS6fBs_JxCbLj_ZZ6H3XrDNPV0mpRuFg_98cgGaB8VBFTWXpad4HeFrqt9nCqcWrnd1EHJR6KJLrN44QqXquRSusg9ht9vfjIcdeANhU3DA" alt=""></figure><p>Before COVID, Zoom and Slack were fairly even at 22 and 20 average daily reviews, respectively. After COVID, Zoom averaged 40 daily reviews and Slack’s average dropped to 12 daily reviews. Zoom’s review volume peaked in early October at a whopping 95 reviews per day.</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_BsaLOOWX_gooJMmoH893ndZhdGP9mF0dxpHXTK5xEoapmZ7SpTyo0oImWXyy-Tqm_avWWHnXfoQqRDWiyrUcPQsS4LrXzlxizfMwgc5cMulkkPNB5CqSqkO9jXkj2KrK8qid-AksNHzsmfgQA" alt=""></figure><p><strong>Stock Prediction</strong></p><p><strong>Review Data &amp; Stock Correlation</strong></p><p>Zoom’s rapidly growing review volume is reflected in its stock price. When the noise of both the stock price and review volume data is smoothed with a 20-day moving average, the two have a 0.51 correlation coefficient. So, generally, when one goes up so does the other.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/FNbCbXS2NH1IU5fIy_G0Kry4HZdfTDOy5pQfOIIIxr42LmStGxxJKH5KRLerrG0f9ke9pHFxJPCZGj1wCWk6USN8N7D-8Kwye9PYyuKJYB3gABzTPKVpyezzq7OJqm0FRBQFJlrACGp1W9e-_Q" alt=""><figcaption>Note: The parent companies of Skype (Microsoft), BlueJeans (Verizon) and Webex (Cisco) are shown in the chart above. GoToMeeting and Join.me are privately owned.</figcaption></figure><p>Stocks overall have performed well since the lockdown due to fiscal and monetary stimulus, but few have performed as well as Zoom. &nbsp;Zoom’s stock price has grown four times larger than its closest competitor since the lockdowns started and eight times larger than its closest competitor since the middle of 2019. Zoom’s average daily stock returns grew from 0.5% before the pandemic to 1.1% after the pandemic.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/te4pDczFeqFYQVkHRJdJXk9E_SORbe1fjPtRPqL7eH-JEnThErsMN4Fjlm6OibMVeihXCPjzUnlL4VAJnim7sjbpMZ-ojnLRY_u1d-IvprlwCQSUU8uuqlWiLmaAj-is335RIodvxXZZBTqEmg" alt=""></figure><p>Zoom’s review volume and stock price are not the only interesting correlation. Zoom’s review volume and trading volume have a correlation coefficient of 0.39.</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/XnNI4DaO8JmSeeix_TwjjWf1TW4gMVdeq_J2cv22St58nnzFf5WfexkNaGKHFpqEIaD5TkDCO_UCYyWZOxZ_1cL7_o_o5suKMDnOkDOdsAtDK7e1Ei15wRCpYo4dv40leMm0TtmJ88hoDzaZvQ" alt=""></figure><p>There are strong similarities between Zoom’s review volume and trading volume, but the two curves were a bit out of sync. Shifting review volume back 12 days raises the correlation coefficient to 0.47. This relationship could be used to reaffirm buy/sell signals from On-Balance Volume (OBV) or similar indicators.</p><p>There is also a relationship between Zoom’s review volume and stock price volatility.</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ZCj_crYjjKq3mGZyPKUC8gkObPvDPHrr1ZddJ7n-T-xJgkN4giKWRZvekUgSfemstnDJId9FNDp2Ja8DNLd6cxkGadAsVY5Qqf1OpN-G77X-BUWiPmCrvfmAOYQnRFvZeo2eHwO-0XNS5_lrtw" alt=""></figure><p>If we shift Zoom’s review volume back 27 days, the correlation coefficient with volatility goes from 0.06 to 0.51.<br></p><p><strong>Methodology</strong></p><p>Because there’s a clear relationship between Zoom’s online reviews and their stock data, we set out to use the review data to predict Zoom’s stock price movements. The goal was to build a machine learning model with decent accuracy and determine which features (variables) were most predictive.</p><p>Along with the review volume, review rating, the quality issues metric and basic stock price data, we used some of the most common technical indicators, including simple and exponential moving averages, Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Stochastic Oscillator, Bollinger Bands and Relative Strength Index (RSI).</p><p>We also built another feature to add context to the review data. &nbsp;We used Python’s TextBlob package to apply a sentiment score to each review text. The sentiment scores range from -1 to 1, with -1 being perfectly negative, 1 being perfectly positive and 0 being neutral. The sentiment scores are normally distributed and centered on ~0.25.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/k5UrRhRgMSaDq7MDhQb46hcymBXXz9uzJ0kXsQsGYOjChymXAcb0hRV9KyV3MsxK2BVSmkGWJjF0j0nPTLO_dlkYrlxuuHZRkg6RnloEzl3nyeq9eoNacFxw1I9mswlOcFmL5Gcy4DAddx0Juw" alt=""></figure><p>The data was split into training and test datasets, with the test dataset being the last 75 days of trading and the training dataset being the 277 trading days before that.</p><p>Several machine learning models were trained and tested, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gaussian NB, Random Forest, Adaboost and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)/LSTM. The variable being predicted was the following day’s price direction (up or down) from the opening price to the closing price.</p><p>In the entire dataset, 51.4% of the days had a price direction of “up.” So, if we used a model that guessed the majority class (up) every time, we would be correct about 51% of the time. We used this baseline accuracy as the accuracy to beat.</p><p><strong>Results</strong></p><p>Out of the standard machine learning models, the Adaboost with a Random Forest base estimator performed the best with an accuracy of 53.3%. Although this accuracy leaves something to be desired, this particular model provides us with an opportunity to evaluate the predictive power of our variables.</p><p>With decision tree models, like the Random Forest, <a href="https://medium.com/bigdatarepublic/feature-importance-whats-in-a-name-79532e59eea3">Feature Importances</a> can be calculated to determine each variables impact on the accuracy of the model. Out of all the features used in the model, the sentiment score and review volume ranked 2nd and 4th most important in terms of predictive power. Our quality issues metric did not perform as well as hoped.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/4y4whSq75-9ddw29zYeSO7VTFJJk2r3IMxCKZa25RXUJS2K-nc0srFtTOcfDu0HXOZtQHBAivNS8I0rdzsYpzvZ7uwTvnvpWn5IDvey5FkuqFgGHClJlCGDgYzpkad1TWSGaOi0zVPPbPZ0NSg" alt=""></figure><p>The standard machine learning models resulted in mediocre accuracy and were quite overfit. The RNN/LSTM model improved prediction accuracy significantly. The accuracy improvement is most likely due to the RNN’s ability to learn patterns across time. &nbsp;We also added dropout layers to reduce the problem of overfitting.</p><p>Below you can see the architecture of the Recurrent Neural Network. In this simple design, each LSTM layer is followed by a Dropout layer. The Dense output layer has a sigmoid activation function which keeps outputs in the range of 0 to 1. An output greater than to 0.5 is a prediction of “up” and an output less than or equal to 0.5 is a prediction of “down.” The learning rate was 0.01, the loss was binary cross-entropy and the optimizer used was Adam. The model was trained over 400 epochs and the batch size was 15 samples. The data was preprocessed to reflect a 10-day look-back period.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Qb-0oPqiNak61VqYqqMmxzuPorQtNeHArqNQIIvUxrB0ki1HIfAzb63vjgVha3xb3u6Pry8ujsVKKaPC_4ybNbeaVDwdIreW7Va6rcidiJoJyYHudd5W6PRnxaXuxiuYSuxwO5m1A05EJL24SQ" alt=""></figure><p>If we look at the accuracy over all epochs, we see that the training and validation accuracy converges over time.

Although the validation accuracy improved throughout training, the validation loss drifted upward. This is unusual, but a bit of research revealed that it is due to the model making worse and worse predictions on samples where it was already wrong. For example, let’s say the correct prediction for a sample was “down.” The sigmoid function would output a 0.60 (up) in the first epoch, then a 0.70 in the next epoch, a 0.80 in the next epoch and so on. The prediction was always wrong, but the sigmoid function kept outputting a worse result.</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZJFPH8EGR0oe5s7Rc5eyYP625_BxkOjtQWlYWJcXukHRDZwsDNRbWKULvdKBq5-YDOXbr93ltmIZ4CAdqDOlj2MZVPKcjmS8Pxciavki0hPOYbprpPndhLrLD3lJbxA6FQHwsNHYUY3zTzNXw" alt=""></figure><p>Although the validation loss drifted slightly upward, the epoch where the model accuracy peaked (339) coincided with a local minimum in validation loss.</p><p>Below we can see a confusion matrix of the test dataset predictions.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you were thinking of learning a new programming language in 2019 then I would highly recommend to have a close look at F#. No matter if you are already a functional developer from a different community (Haskell, Clojure, Scala, etc.) or you are a complete newbie to functional programming (like I was 3 years ago) I think F# can equally impress you. F# is a <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/languages/fsharp">functional first language</a>. This means it is not a pure functional language but it is heavily geared towards the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional programming paradigm</a>. However, because F# is also part of the <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/languages">.NET language family</a> it is equally well equipped to write object oriented code too. Secondly F# is - contrary to common believe - an extremely well designed <a href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/why-use-fsharp/">general purpose language</a>. This means that F# is not only good for all sorts of "mathematical" stuff, but also for so much more. Without doubt F# is, like most other functional (algebraic) languages, greatly suited for this kind of work, but it is certainly not at the forefront of the creators of F# and neither a very common use case by most people who I know work with F#. So what is F# really good for? Well, the honest answer is almost anything! F# is an extremely pragmatic, expressive, statically typed programming language. Whether you want to build a distributed real time application, a service oriented web backend, a fancy looking single page app, mobile games, a line of business application or the next big social internet flop, F# will satisfy most if not all of your needs. As a matter of fact F# is probably a much better language for these types of applications than let's say Python, Java or C#. If you don't believe me then please continue reading and hopefully I will have convinced you by the end of this post!</p>

<h2 id="domain-driven-development">Domain Driven Development</h2>
<p>Before I started to write this article I asked myself why do I like F# so much? There are many reasons which came to my mind, but the one which really stood out to me was the fact that F# has some great capabilities of modelling a domain. After all, the majority of work which we do as software developers is to model real world processes into a digital abstraction of them. A language which makes this kind of work almost feel natural is immensely valuable and should not be missed.</p>
<p>Let's look at some code examples to demonstrate what I mean. For this task and for the rest of this blog post I'll be comparing F# with C# in order to show some of the benefits. I've chosen C# because many developers consider it as one of the best object oriented languages and mainly because C# is the language which I am the most proficient at myself.</p>
<h3 id="identifying-bad-design">Identifying bad design</h3>
<p>A common use case in a modern application is to read a customer object from a database. In C# this would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>public Customer GetCustomerById(string customerId)
{
    // do stuff...
}
</code></pre>
<p>I have purposefully omitted the internals of this method, because from a caller's point of view the signature of a method is often all we know. Even though this operation is so simple (and very familiar) there are still a lot of unknowns around it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which values are accepted for the <code>customerId</code>? Can it have an empty string? Probably not, but will it instantly throw an <code>ArgumentException</code> or still try to fetch some user data?</li>
<li>Does the ID follow a specific format? What if the <code>customerId</code> has the correct format but is all upper case? Is it case sensitive or will the method normalise the string anyway?</li>
<li>What happens if a given <code>customerId</code> doesn't exist? Will it return <code>null</code> or throw an <code>Exception</code>? There's no way to find out without checking the internal implementation of this method (docs, decompilation, GitHub, etc.) or by testing against all sorts of input.</li>
<li>What happens if the database connection is down? Will it return the same result as if the customer didn't exist or will it throw a different type of exception?</li>
<li>How many different exception types will this code throw anyway?</li>
</ul>
<p>The interface/signature of this method is not very clear in answering any of these questions. This is pretty poor given that the signature or interface of a method has the only purpose of defining a clear contract between the caller and the method itself. Of course there are many conventions which make C# developers feel safe, mostly by making broad assumptions about the underlying code, but at the end of the day these are only assumptions which can (and will eventually) lead to severe errors. If a library only slightly differs from an established convention then there is a high chance of introducing a bug which will catch them later.</p>
<p>If anything, conventions are rather weak workarounds for missing language features. Just like C# is perhaps seen as a better language than JavaScript, because of its statically typed feature, many functional programming languages are seen superior to C#, Java, and others, because of their domain modelling features.</p>
<p>There are ways of improving this code in C#, but none of those options are very straightforward (or often very cumbersome), which is why there is still plenty of code written like the one above.</p>
<h3 id="f-makes-correct-code-easy">F# makes correct code easy</h3>
<p>F# on the other hand has a rich type system which allows developers to express the true state of a function. If a function might or might not return a <code>Customer</code> object then the function can return an object of type <code>Option&lt;'T&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>Option&lt;'T&gt;</code> type defines a return value which can either be something or nothing:</p>
<pre><code>let getCustomerById customerId =
    match db.TryFindCustomerById customerId with
    | true, customer -&gt; Some customer
    | false, _       -&gt; None
</code></pre>
<p>It is important to understand that <code>None</code> is not another way of saying <code>null</code>, because <code>null</code> is truly nothing (there is nothing allocated in memory), whereas <code>None</code> is an actual object/case of type <code>Option&lt;'T&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>In this example the <code>TryFindCustomerId</code> method is a typical .NET member which has an <code>out</code> parameter defined like this:</p>
<pre><code>bool TryFindCustomerById(string customerId, out Customer customer)
</code></pre>
<p>In F# you can use simple pattern matching to extract the <code>out</code> parameter on success:</p>
<pre><code>match db.TryFindCustomerById customerId with
| true, customer -&gt; Some customer
| false, _       -&gt; None
</code></pre>
<p>The benefit of the <code>Option&lt;'T&gt;</code> type is not only that it is more expressive (and therefore more honest about the true state of the function), but also that it forces the calling code to implement the case of <code>None</code>, which means that a developer has to think of this edge case straight from the beginning:</p>
<pre><code>let someOtherFunction customerId =
    match getCustomerById customerId with
    | Some customer -&gt; // Do something when customer exist
    | None          -&gt; // Do something when customer doesn't exist
</code></pre>
<p>Another extremely useful type which comes with F# is the <code>Result&lt;'T,'TError&gt;</code> type:</p>
<pre><code>let validateCustomerId customerId =
    match customerId with
    | null -&gt; Error "Customer ID cannot be null."
    | ""   -&gt; Error "Customer ID cannot be empty."
    | id when id.Length &lt;&gt; 10 -&gt; Error "Invalid Customer ID."
    | _ -&gt; Ok (customerId.ToLower())
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>validateCustomerId</code> function will either return <code>Ok</code> with a normalised <code>customerId</code> or an <code>Error</code> object which contains a relevant error message. In this example <code>'T</code> and <code>'TError</code> are both of type <code>string</code>, but it doesn't have to be the same type and you can even wrap multiple types into a much richer return value such as <code>Result&lt;Option&lt;Customer&gt;, string list&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>The type system in F# allows for even more flexibility. One can easily create a new type which truly represents all possible outcomes of a function like <code>getCustomerById</code>:</p>
<pre><code>type DataResult&lt;'T&gt; =
    | Success         of 'T option
    | ValidationError of string
    | DataError       of Exception

let getCustomerById customerId =
    try
        match validateCustomerId customerId with
        | Error msg -&gt; ValidationError msg
        | Ok    id  -&gt;
            match db.TryFindCustomerById id with
            | true, customer -&gt; Some customer
            | false, _       -&gt; None
            |&gt; Success
    with ex -&gt; DataError ex
</code></pre>
<p>The custom defined <code>DataResult&lt;'T&gt;</code> type declares three distinctive cases which the calling code might want to treat differently. By explicitly declaring a type which represents all these possibilities we can model the <code>getCustomerById</code> function in such a way that it removes all ambiguity about error- and edge case handling as well as preventing unexpected behaviour and forcing calling code to handle these cases.</p>
<h3 id="f-makes-invalid-state-impossible">F# makes invalid state impossible</h3>
<p>So far we have always assumed that the <code>customerId</code> is a value of type <code>string</code>, but as we've seen this creates a lot of ambiguity around the allowed values for it and also forces a developer to write a lot of guard clauses to protect themselves from errors:</p>
<pre><code>public Customer GetCustomerById(string customerId)
{
    if (customerId == null)
        throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(customerId));

    if (customerId == "")
        throw new ArgumentException(
            "Customer ID cannot be empty.", nameof(customerId));

    if (customerId.Length != 10 || customerId.ToLower().StartsWith("c"))
        throw new ArgumentException(
            "Invalid customer ID", nameof(customerId));

    // do stuff...
}
</code></pre>
<p>The correct way of avoiding this anti-pattern is to model the concept of a <code>CustomerId</code> into its own type. In C# you can either create a <code>class</code> or <code>struct</code> to do so, but either way you'll end up writing a lot of boilerplate code to get the type to behave the way it should (eg. GetHashCode, Equality, ToString, etc.):</p>
<pre><code>public class CustomerId
{
    public string Value { get; }

    public CustomerId(string customerId)
    {
        if (customerId == null)
            throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(customerId));

        if (customerId == "")
            throw new ArgumentException(
                "Customer ID cannot be empty.",
                …</code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-89cfead268f30384aa7d"><div><p><em>TLDR: Simplicity is still a controversial topic. Most argue that consumers desire simpler products. Some argue that they want simplicity but only if it is executed correctly (what that means is often left undefined). And a few believe that it’s actually complexity that makes consumers buy. This disagreement is rooted in the fact that no one seems to agree on what simplicity means. I suggest avoiding using it in any professional capacity, in favor of a more precise tool kit. What motivates the buying decision are the 3 components of the Fogg Behavior Model: motivation, ability, and prompt. Motivation, in order to make the sale, can be further broken down into the Job To Be Done (why is the consumer hiring the product?) and acute satisfaction (how badly do they want it in that moment?). Ability, making a behavior easier or harder to do, can be subdivided into time, money, physical effort, mental effort, repetition, social deviance, location in space, and location in time. Getting comfortable with these concepts will give you a productive framework to work with when deciding what features to include/exclude, and help you create products people actually want to buy, use, and recommend.</em></p><p>One of the most fundamental theorems to have come out of behavior science is that <strong>shine changes behavior</strong>.</p><p>What’s shine? Shine is the emotion you feel when you feel successful. When you aced that job interview, got your first customer, or finally won that match in your game or sport. [1] By making behavior easy to do, you increase the probability that you’ll succeed instead of fail. When you succeed, you feel successful which reinforces the connection in your brain between that behavior and that positive feeling, and that leads  to behavior change.&nbsp;</p><p>Simplicity → Shine → Behavior Change.</p><p>Because simplicity means so many different things to so many different people, a more precise way to think about it is in terms of ability. High ability means a behavior is easy to do. Low ability means it’s hard to do. So when you’re thinking about consumer behavior change, think about increasing ability, making it easy to do.</p><p><em>For the purpose of this essay you can use consumer and user interchangeably.</em></p><p>Obvious right? Well, no. The problem with fields like behavior science is tool bias. Which I described in <a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/covid" target="_blank">Covid-19 And Human (Ir)Rationality — PART 1</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“This is a fascinating bias I call tool bias (if it has an official name, let me know), which ties the complexity of the tool to the perception of difficulty. Math can appear complex even when the application is very simple. Influencing behavior can appear simple even when the application is very complex. This phenomenon occurs in comedy as well. It’s easy to underestimate how difficult it is to create a good set because the tools (language) are simple, so while you laugh you think, I could do this easily.”</p></blockquote><p>I.e. behavior science suffers from hindsight bias because it’s so easy to understand. It all appears obvious ex post facto.&nbsp;</p><p>If something seems easy, we think “that must BE easy.”</p><p>But if you were to ask around as to what creates behavior change, you’d get many different answers (mainly around motivation) but making things easy to do wouldn’t be one of them. [2]</p><p>Okay, if simplicity or more precisely, increasing ability is so important (and obvious) then why are products so complicated?</p><p>Because it’s that very complexity that sells.</p><p>When we see something that’s complex, we think “that must have a lot of value.” If you’re a consultant giving simple answers to complex problems, it seems as though you’re not very smart or, at the very least, you aren’t taking it seriously. When you make it so complex that people can hardly follow along, it becomes hard for people to estimate the boundaries of your knowledge.&nbsp;</p><p>E.g. suppose you hire a consultant to help you with next year’s strategy. If they give you a thick stack of papers that supports their conclusion, you’ll perceive it more favorably than if they give you a single sheet with 2 paragraphs on it, sharing that same conclusion. Complexity acts as a heuristic for value. [3]</p><p><em>An obvious, but important nonetheless note, is that truth has to be measured by truth, not truthiness. </em><strong><em>Complexity impacts truthiness but it has no correlation with truth</em></strong><em>. I.e. just because something is complex doesn’t make it true. Just because something is simple doesn’t make it false. But that’s exactly the cognitive bias we have and partly explains our obsession with data-driven arguments. Read </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/misleadingdata?rq=data" target="_blank"><em>Your Data Is Lying To You And You’re Listening</em></a><em> for more on that.</em></p><p>Is this only true in information? No. You see the same phenomenon from consumer products to enterprise software.</p><p>According to Thompson, Hamilton, and Rust (2005), increasing the complexity of a product can have a positive effect on consumer satisfaction because of an increase in perceived capability.</p><p>Look at the following products:</p><p><strong>Stripey toothpaste: </strong>Why do they go to so much trouble to make sure stripey toothpaste comes out of the tube, well… stripey? An overly logical engineer would see that and claim that you should just mix the products. It would have the exact same effect on oral hygiene and you’d actually save on cost. But that’s only correct if your customers were logical robots. But they’re emotional humans. Consumers simply don’t believe your toothpaste has 3 functions if they don’t see it. ‘’Healthy gums. Strong teeth. Fresh breath.” Show me, don’t tell me.</p><p><strong>Dishwashing tablet: </strong>Same argument. Just blend all the ingredients into one homogenous tablet. But again, I, the consumer, wouldn’t believe you.</p><p><strong>Toilet rim block: </strong>Look at how these simple blocks have grown in complexity. Multiple liquids in a container, different colored solid spheres, sticky discs you shoot onto your bowl, etc. [4]</p><p><strong>Coffee machine: </strong>The most expensive ones have the most gizmos. More features to increase perceived capability, which is exactly what I, the consumer, want. Take Dolce Gusto machines for example. A manual lever to flip to make coffee? What am I, a 17th-century peasant?! I’ll take the model with the fancy LCD touch screen so I can feel like Louis the 14th thank you very much.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606422050075_102553"><p><strong>Cars: </strong>Steering wheels with roughly similar complexity as NASA's mission control. Mirrors that can be moved electronically, are heated, dim based on light intensity, and more. Just take a look at the incredible feature set of these 2021headlights:</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606422050075_35746"><p><strong>iOS:</strong> Remember that the original “iPhone OS” didn’t even have an Appstore yet? Just the 15 apps that shipped with the phone. Now you got an app for everything, cameras that rival mirrorless cameras and DSLRs in the right conditions, and more power than many laptops.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606422050075_27120"><div><p>It seems that if we want to sell more, we should simply add features.</p><p>Well, yes. But also… well, no.</p><p>There are many UX experts that advocate precisely this. “Simplicity is overrated and consumers, ceteris paribus, want more features because they want the most powerful products.”</p><p>This is partly true. Would you pay more for a phone that does less? It has a basic camera, or perhaps no camera, it has less memory, it’s not fast, it’s missing features (even if you don’t use them). Probably not. While one can imagine an audience of minimalists for that, one can’t imagine that they’d pay more for it than the flagship phone which sets the anchor for that particular price hierarchy.</p><p>But if that’s the whole story, that raises the question, why do products ever get disrupted? Surely, if features sell then Yahoo wouldn’t have gotten disrupted by Google. Or Netflix by Blockbuster. Or Facebook by Myspace. Or any other startup, since pretty much all of them started very simple.</p><p>The erroneous assumption here is that simple means getting rid of features. But a car that’s missing two wheels, the engine, and the body, that’s not simplicity. That’s not even a car. A bagless vacuum cleaner — &gt; a cordless bagless vacuum cleaner — &gt; the Dysons we have now with all kinds of attachments, different vacuum heads, and automatically adjusting suction levels… now you’ve got my attention. The “simple” Dysons still had high usability despite lower capability. So it’s not just about removing features, it’s about being diligent about which features you do add. And your customers are the arbiter that decide whether or not you got it right.</p><p>On top of that, Rust, Thompson, and Hamilton (2006) demonstrated that an increase in features (even the right features) doesn’t automatically translate into more consumer satisfaction. In fact, as perceived capability increases, perceived usability decreases. This is known as feature fatigue. (Thompson, Hamilton &amp; Rust, 2005; See also Kemenade, 2018).</p><p>So if we can’t simply add or remove features, how should we think about getting consumers to buy?</p><p>The user needs to want it (motivation), they need to be able to buy it (have the ability), and be provoked into buying it (prompt). (Fogg, 2009). Ability usually isn’t the most constraining factor. If a consumer really wants to buy something, they’ll take care of any cognitive dissonance for you. E.g. “I don’t have the space for this new guitar. But damn, I really want it. Okay, I’ll just clean up the attic, and then I’ll have enough space.” (Which they won’t do). Not carrying (enough) money is also not really an issue anymore with Apple Pay and the like.&nbsp;</p><p>You could imagine a physical constraint. E.g. they wanna buy but the product is too big to take home in their car. That’s a place where you could offer some delivery service to solve for ability. E.g. Ikea or AptDeco. Or your site only accepts credit cards, which are never used in The Netherlands. In which case the user probably wouldn’t buy because it’s too much of a hassle. </p><p>Prompts aren’t perfect in 2020 but rarely do products fail because they were so amazing yet the company simply forgot to tell people about it. And pretty much the only thing marketers actually understand is CTA: Call To Action, which is just another word for prompt. So buying is primarily a motivation issue. And secondarily an …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>What this article is</strong>: a starting point for people that seek knowledge in a digestible fashion + my personal summary of the best ways to learn.</p><p><strong>What this article is not</strong>: a guide on how to plan your self-development path.</p><h2>Let's code!</h2><p>Do you want to start programming but are not sure how to do it? Or maybe you already know some things but feel stuck?</p><p>A little over a year ago, I switched my career path from biotechnology and became a manual QA. It was a huge unknown for me at that time - a year passed, though, and I'm now programming alongside super-talented engineers as a full-fledged member of a Team Undefined (awesome name, I know) in <a href="">Stoplight's</a> <a href="">11Sigma</a> crew.</p><p>During that time, I was (and still am) simultaneously working and learning. It was never easy, I had my ups and downs, but now I can confidently say I improved a lot. If only I knew at the beginning what I know now, it would save me a lot of time and stress.</p><p>Along the way, I used various learning materials of different kinds. Not all of them might fit you, but it's good to know about their pros and cons - which is why I prepared this summary.</p><h3>Theory</h3><p>This part of learning resources is pretty straightforward - it makes you sit and do a lot of reading. No shortcuts, just learning everything by yourself. It can give you a lot of satisfaction, but sometimes an equal amount of frustration.</p><ul><li>Documentation &amp; handbooks - per task, when you need to understand complex stuff quickly: <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs">TypeScript</a>, <a href="https://visjs.github.io/vis-network/docs/network/">vis.js - network</a> + its <a href="https://visjs.github.io/vis-network/examples/">examples</a>, <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/api/api/table-of-contents.html">Cypress</a>, <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">Yarn</a>, <a href="https://blueprintjs.com/docs/">Blueprint</a>, <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs">Tailwind CSS</a>.</li><li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">MDN</a> for the win - a ton of useful information on multiple topics for both beginners and advanced.</li><li>Online courses w/o progress verification (<a href="https://www.internetingishard.com/">Interneting is Hard</a>) - they can give a sense of direction and structured material.</li><li>Books: <a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/">Eloquent Javascript</a>, <em>"Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship"</em> by Robert C. Martin.</li><li>Websites / guides - like <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git">Getting Git Right</a> by Atlassian or <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS-tricks</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Reliable sources of knowledge.</li><li>Allows us to understand both core concepts and dig deeper into specific details.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>You can get bored very easily if you don't use the gained knowledge parallel to reading.</li></ul><h3>Real-life problems</h3><p>Let's say you understand the basics of the topic you have chosen. You are either working in a real team or doing some coding on your own. In both scenarios, at some point, you will face a blocker. That's when you should reach for these:</p><ul><li>Dev.to, Medium, StackOverflow - tips &amp; tricks for specific cases.</li><li>Read somebody else's code / understand the product you are working on - because it's not necessary to reinvent the wheel, but good to understand how it works.</li><li>Write something simple and let people judge it - good criticism is one of the best teachers.</li></ul><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Quick progress.</li><li>Working with code that is used somewhere will give you a real-life experience.</li><li>Access to great ideas and solutions that you could potentially spend hours on when doing them by yourself.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Requires a basic understanding of the topic.</li><li>Easy to forget what you've learned if you only copy-paste.</li></ul><h3>Practice makes perfect</h3><p>You don't like spending hours reading books or documentation? Then learn by doing!</p><ul><li>Interactive tutorials - <a href="https://flexboxfroggy.com/">Flexbox Froggy</a> by <a href="https://codepip.com/">Codepip</a>.</li><li>Courses that involve practical tasks (<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>) - you can use your knowledge/skills in real-life problems.

I strongly recommend starting one.</li></ul><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>You can evaluate your progress.</li><li>Knowledge and skills that are used repeatedly stick better.</li><li>If you don't feel like you make good progress, it's a perfect way to check if that's true. A lot of times, it turns out that you've learned more than you thought you did.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Focusing too much on quiz points and external expectations can decrease your internal motivation and remove the fun.</li></ul><h3>Collaborate / teach</h3><ul><li>Pair programming / mentoring - for when you get stuck or are very unfamiliar with a topic.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1606393390920/_sH5RujzQ.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>Most web application developers reach for the tried and tested approach of fetching data from their API right when they need it, and they don't give an offline-first approach the consideration it deserves. Perhaps that's because working offline is generally thought of as a specific feature and that it's not necessarily applicable or appropriate for a wide variety of applications. However, there's a lot to be gained from going offline-first, even if your app isn't the "typical" offline application. Hopefully, after reading this article, you'll feel like you're better equipped to answer if working offline-first is right for your app.</p>

<p>When we say "offline-first", we don't just mean a bit of caching that means your user can revisit some pages they've already seen before. Many web apps make heavy use of the browser cache to achieve some basic level of functioning without a working internet connection. We're talking about going well beyond that.</p>
<p>For us, an offline-first web application is an application that is designed to be (close to) fully-functional without an internet connection. Now of course, the application may need an internet connection the first time around to authenticate the user and download some data. However, after that initial sync, it should be able to function without internet connectivity for some period of time. This means that not only browsing data (i.e. read operations) should work, but the user should also be able to create and update data (i.e. write operations) while in a disconnected state.</p>
<p>There are a million and one ways to achieve this kind of offline-first functionality. There's the browser cache, service workers, local storage, IndexedDB and a myriad of other tools that can be brought together to give your users a brilliant offline experience. </p>
<p>Inspired by the offline-first tools we use every day like Superhuman, Figma and Pitch, we've recently been working hard to turn <a target="_blank" href="https://kitemaker.co/">Kitemaker</a>, our product management tool for cross-functional, self-organizing product teams, into an offline-first application. We fetch the data the user may need ahead of time and store it in a local cache. The web application itself operates on that local cache only, and a separate layer takes care of syncing those changes back to the server. Our design was heavily inspired by the work Evan Wallace published about <a target="_blank" href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/">how multiplayer behavior works in Figma</a>. We're currently working on using service workers to download static assets and using IndexedDB to back our cache with persistent storage. We'll do a follow-up blog post on how offline works in Kitemaker, but here's a quick peek at the architecture:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1606393439657/Q9T8clsHl.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="offline_architecture.png"></p>
<p>But this is just one example of how to achieve offline functionality. Exactly how you solve it will depend heavily on your application. The important part is that you start to think about whether your app <em>should</em> be offline-first.</p>

<p>You may be thinking that offline functionality sounds nice, but isn't super relevant most applications. We tend to disagree. We think there is a trend to push more and more SaaS products towards supporting working offline, and we think this is absolutely the right idea.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is your application's performance (how fast it responds to your users' inputs) important/critical?</li>
<li>Will your users be using your application in areas with spotty connectivity?</li>
<li>Will your users by using your application on airplanes?</li>
<li>Will your users be using your application when roaming on their data connections, such as when on vacation?</li>
</ul>
<p>We'd be surprised if you didn't answer "yes" to at least a couple of those questions.</p>

<p>There are a bunch of advantages that come along with making your application offline-first:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It'll work offline.</strong> Yep, that's right. If you make your application work offline, it will in fact work offline 😊 It's actually a pretty killer feature and one which we appreciate greatly, especially when traveling/commuting.</li>
<li><strong>It'll survive flaky networks.</strong> There's nothing worse than getting an error on a web application just because your network had a hiccup. We really wish more chat applications (you know who you are) worked offline-first to avoid bad behavior on bad networks.</li>
<li><strong>It'll make your application react quicker to your users' inputs.</strong> Instead of waiting for a server roundtrip to update a UI, offline-first applications can behave optimistically and update local data right away and then send off changes to the server. This means your users don't need to wait around for the response.</li>
<li><strong>It sets you up nicely for "multiplayer" behavior.</strong> In order to make your application work offline, you  need to be able to handle conflicts that might arise when your users come back online and start shipping queued changes to your servers. Handling these queued operations is very often the same type of logic that's needed to handle two users operating on the same data at the same time, which means you might be able to unlock more collaborative features of your application.</li>
<li><strong>It can help you scale your writes on your server.</strong> Because your users aren't waiting around for responses from the server, you can treat your writes a bit differently. Maybe you queue them up for processing, or adopt a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html">CQRS</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html">event sourcing</a> approach. It opens up all sorts of possibilities.</li>
<li><strong>It can simplify your app logic.</strong> For us in Kitemaker, this was a big one. Before we adopted this offline-first approach, our GraphQL API calls had wormed their way into our code in a lot of places. Whenever changing data, we had to set up a GraphQL mutation, handle the response, provide optimistic responses to get the performance we need, etc. It was messy and complex. Now we just operate on objects in our local cache and the changes are transparently synced to our backend (and onwards to other users).</li>
<li><strong>It can simplify your backend API.</strong> This one is not guaranteed by any means, but for us, our backend API became a very simple thing indeed. Instead of create/update/delete endpoints (or in our case mutations since we use GraphQL) for all of the different resources in our system, we now have a really simple API for sending changes from the client to the server. That's it. Of course YMMV.</li>
</ul>

<p>While there are numerous advantages to working in an offline-first, it's not a given that you should dive in right away. Think about these things a little first:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the data your users need to interact with reasonable small or can you chunk it into smaller datasets that your users can selectively choose to download for offline use (e.g. restaurant recommendations for a particular country/city)? If not, it will be very hard to build a good offline experience.</li>
<li>Can you ensure that most operations that your users perform while offline will succeed? Being offline-first does not lend itself to applications where your users will frequently get their requests rejected, transactions will be get rolled back, etc. Basically you need to ensure you have a very simple and deterministic way to handle any conflicts that might occur. If you can't ensure this, you'd better think twice before digging in.</li>
<li>It can be <em>a lot</em> of work to get it right. There are tools out there to help you, but you won't get offline-first behavior for free. You need to decide if it's worth the investment for your product or not.</li>
</ul>

<p>We hope this article got your gears turning a little when it comes to offline-first web applications. We don't think appropriate for every application - it can be quite a lot of work to get right and for some applications it just doesn't make a lot of sense. But we just think people should give it some thought when designing and architecting a new application. We've learned from experience that retrofitting this type of behavior can also be quite a lot of work, but we're super happy we did it nonetheless!</p>

      <div>

        

        <div>
                      <p><span><strong>What was the last product demo you saw?<br>
Not on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram, they’re all over those, but on tv, billboards or press (does press still exist?).<br>
You just don’t see agencies doing them anymore.<br>
Odd, because, and I hope I’m not giving away any trade secrets here, the goal of most advertising is to persuade people that the product featured is good.<br>
Ideally, REALLY good.<br>
So showing it in action, performing well, seems like it might be a good way to go?<br>
Because most purchasing decisions are based on what a product does. But sometimes in ad agencies, we can get too distracted with our own fancy theories and philosophies.<br>
Not just in agencies, sometimes when I teach I’ll review work that, although clever, doesn’t feel like it’ll sell anything.<br>
It doesn’t feel like it’s trying to sell anything.<br>
Would you buy that cereal because you’re told it’s what the cool folks eat?<br>
Or a computer because the company that makes it has some very progressive social policies?<br>
Maybe.<br>
But most wouldn’t, they want to know what’s in it for them.<br>
My advice when such a situation arises is always the same; imagine you’re with a friend, face to face, how would you persuade them to buy this product?.<br>
They know they can’t waffle and bullshit friends, so they stop trying. Instead, they start thinking about why their friend may actually part with money for this product.<br>
Focussing on what it does.<br>
How it may help them.<br>
The ideas often become less grandiose and more like common-sense advice.<br>
Which is more persuasive.<br>
As the saying goes – Don’t tell me you’re funny, make me laugh.<br>
So why are we producing less product demos?<br>
Less products to warrant that type of advertising today?<br>
Would that kind of <em>‘hard sell’</em> advertising reflect badly on a brand today? Or that it would reflect badly on us?<br>
(Answers on a postcard, etc, etc.)</strong></span></p>
<p><span>p.s. &nbsp;I couldn’t help wondering if the British Government spent less money telling people what to do about Covid-19 and more on demonstrating the benefits of wearing masks and washing hands, the situation may be a bit better?</span></p>
<p><span>E.g. 1. Masks.</span></p>

<p><span><em>E.g. 2. Soap.<br>
</em></span></p>


<p><span>When I gathered together this bunch, I didn’t look through awards sites or annuals, I just tried to remember product demonstrations, ones that had stuck with me.</span><br>
<span>Consequently, there are some ads in here that I couldn’t tell you when or where they were done, like Tonka and the nail varnish ad.</span><br>
<span>But having collated all of this ‘unfashionable’ work, it dawned on me that most of it was created by the most fashionable agencies.<br>
At least, the most fashionable in their of the day.<br>
DDB, PKL, WRG, GGT, BBH, WCRS, DDB, AMV, APPLE.<br>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
    <p><img src="https://yusufhegazy.com/img/bof-normies/header.png" alt="Fractal Tree"></p><h2 id="what-is-a-buffer-anyway">What is a Buffer anyway?</h2>
<p>We can think of buffers as containers to hold our data for later use, it’s not really something specific to computer science; In fact, we have buffers in electronics, mechanics, chemistry and even politics!
We can say that the word buffer is just a fancy name for a placeholder (temporary storage)!</p>
<h2 id="buffer-in-computer-science">Buffer in Computer Science</h2>
<p>Now, it’s time to get more technical and get to know buffers more in computer science!</p>
<p>Online video streaming is a pretty good application of buffering, back in the old days we would see YouTube showing that nostalgic loading bar while waiting the video to load and that’s exactly why we use buffers!
We need to store video data in someplace so that when we need that data we can load it directly from the computer’s memory since we can’t really have our internet connection playback videos in realtime without having some temporarily storage for data to reside in, and that’s the reason why livestreams never sync with realtime and have a couple seconds delay.</p>
<p>here is a more lower level representation of a buffer:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>#define BUFSIZE 1024
</span><span></span><span>char</span> buffer[BUFSIZE];
size_t len;

<span>// ... later
</span><span></span><span>while</span>((len<span>=</span>read(STDIN, <span>&amp;</span>buffer, BUFSIZE)) <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span>)
    write(STDOUT, buffer, len);
</code></pre></div><p>This snippet basically check for data available then reads it from the standard input (command line) and writes that data back to the standard output (command line too).</p>
<h2 id="buffer-overflows">Buffer Overflows!</h2>
<p>It’s time for the good stuff now!</p>
<p>Let’s say we have an arbitrary variable of size 5 bytes, and we stored some value in that variable which <em>exceeds 5 bytes</em>, that’s a simple buffer overflow!</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>char</span> someVariable[<span>5</span>];

<span>/* we are trying to copy 15 bytes to a 5 bytes sized variable */</span>
memcpy(someVariable, <span>"Hello, world!</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, <span>15</span>); 

printf(someVariable);
</code></pre></div><p>We encounter buffer overflows more frequently than we imagine, ever seen <code>Segmentation Fault</code> appear in your C program out of nowhere? That’s also a buffer overflow but your computer has prevented it from causing any damage and stopped the program from running.</p>
<p>Let’s get back to our 5 bytes overflown variable example. What happens to the overflown data? Where is it’s destination? Does it get lost in the void of nothingness?</p>
<p>Nope, in fact we just overwrite other data when we overflow any variable, and that’s the core of our problem. We can’t just overwrite data and act as if nothing happened. What if we overwrite important data? What if we can overwrite data related to process memory and already running programs?</p>
<p>These are all possibilities which are just a mere consequence of buffer overflows and can cause great damage to computers</p>
<h2 id="weaponizing-buffer-overflows">Weaponizing Buffer Overflows</h2>
<p>A basic technique used by hackers when exploiting buffer overflow vulnerabilities is determining the place where data gets overwritten and <strong>handcrafting</strong> the overflown data to inject <strong>arbitrary code</strong> in the program, imagine if that program runs at elevated privileges and a hacker takes control of it’s execution flow, you get <em>pwned.</em></p>
<p>And that’s just the basic technique in abusing buffer overflow vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2 id="am-i-really-safe">Am I Really Safe?</h2>
<p>Sadly, yes you are safe.</p>
<p>Buffer overflows aren’t as popular in 2020 (as of writing this article) as they used to be back in the old days of computers, all modern processors/operating systems have strict rules and mitigations for all the paradigms and techniques of buffer overflows.</p>
<p>Some of these famous mitigations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>ASLR</strong> (Address Space Layout Randomization)</p>
<p>Basically randomizes all the memory addresses at runtime whenever you execute any program so it makes it impossible to hardcode memory addresses for exploiting buffer overflow attacks</p>
<p>i.e: the exploit needs to be completely dynamic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>NX Bit</strong></p>
<p>Basically marks areas of memory as non-executable, prevents hackers from injecting malicious code into areas of memory in an attempt to execute it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stack Canaries</strong></p>
<p>Basically generates some random value in memory at runtime and checks before returning from any function if that random value got overwritten or not, if yes then program exits.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And these are just some of the basic mitigation used in 2020.</p>
<p>But again, <em>these doesn’t really make your computer invincible</em> as much as making it just harder for an attacker to compromise your system using buffer overflow attacks.</p>
<p>Hackers still can bypass these mitigations using underhanded methods such as bruteforce and leaking addresses from memory but using these mitigations correctly can make buffer overflows nearly useless.</p>
<p>It’s also worthy to mention that buffer overflows can be prevented from the programmers side by following the coding best practices and avoiding unsanitized input etc…</p>

                    <h2>Best so far</h2>
<p>I have been writing every day for more than a month now, and it has not been apparent to me that I got any better.</p>
<p>I make mistakes when writing the first draft. I butcher some of the sentences. Hemingway wants me to change the structure of every sentence. </p>
<p>It is all the same.</p>
<p>But yesterday, I have <a href="https://klimy.co/blog/when-productivity-increases">written the best article</a> I have written so far.</p>
<p>It took much more time than usual to finish. It required me to do research. It required me to make custom images for it, but I did all of that it.</p>
<p>What really caught me off guard is that I  edited it. </p>
<p>I really hate the editing process, at least I did hate it. Ever since I started writing an actual novel book and thousands of people started reading what I write, I started feeling conscious of my mistakes.</p>
<p>Instead of just trying to finish the task straight away, I had to make sure that at least the text itself had no mistakes. I knew that it wouldn’t go in vain and people will be reading it.</p>
<p>The biggest advantage of editing that I found is that you learn a lot when editing. You see the common trends in mistakes. You start to understand how you write and what mood does your writing give.</p>
<p>That has enabled me to accelerate my learning.</p>
<h2>How I started writing the blog</h2>
<p>I started with just a simple resolution, on October the 12th, to write every single day a piece of writing that others could read. It didn’t have to be long or amazingly good. It just had to be some writing.</p>
<p>That is how a person that never written anything half-decent can start writing.</p>
<h3>How I started writing a novel</h3>
<p>After around a month, I was drained reading the novels that had a thin plot and were just straight up badly written. So I had to give it a try myself. I had no experience in writing and had no idea how to write a novel either. The first chapters, expectedly, were tough to write. But after it started flowing as if it was my second nature. It became much easier to write a novel.</p>
<h2>My plan</h2>
<p>It all started with me promising to write at least 200 words per day, and now I write around 2 thousand per day. Plus all the editing. To tell you the truth, I would off never expected everything to end up like this.</p>
<p>By reading this, you might think that I am planning on going somewhere and setting myself crazy goals that I want to achieve? Well yes and no.</p>
<p>I want to achieve great goals, but setting them is not the ideal way for me to do it.</p>
<p>I want to get to the goals unexpectedly and with the habits instead of sheer motivation. </p>
<p>Ever since I started with habits, I don’t believe in motivation anymore. Motivation is best used to start habits, but in the long run, it is meaningless. You better use your motivation on starting a new habit, then forcing yourself to the next goal.</p>
<p>When I wake up in the morning, I don’t have to motivate myself to write. I just do it. It is the next thing that I do after a shower, as easy as that. This understanding enables me to occupy my head with other things that truly matter.</p>
<p>The only thing I am planning on making different is spending more time on my writing on the weekends. I can see that this area can be scaled. It can be scaled well enough actually to give a benefit to others.</p>
<p>That means that if I put extra effort into articles that will actually rank and become higher indexed on Google. Then I will also be able to get new traffic from SEO, which means I can help even more people.</p>
<p>I have to say that I really under appreciate what is happening right now with everyone being able to write. It is a blessing that I should have been using from the day I got a computer. </p>
<p>If you still haven’t started writing, then:</p>
<p>Start now. Get perfect later.</p>
<p>Klim Y</p>

Today I would like to introduce you the first official release <code>v0.1.0</code> of the Chaos language and talk about
the details of the Chaos compiler.</p>
<h2>The Code</h2>
<p>The Chaos compiler is implemented in <strong><a href="https://github.com/chaos-lang/chaos/blob/v0.1.0/compiler/compiler.c">compiler.c</a></strong>
module. It takes the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that built by the
<strong><a href="https://github.com/chaos-lang/chaos/blob/v0.1.0/parser/parser.y">parser</a></strong> as input and spits out the C code.
So for example, let's say the <strong>hello.kaos</strong> file is:</p>
<pre><code><span>print</span> <span>"hello world"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>so you compile this program with:</p>
<pre><code><span>$</span><span> chaos -c hello.kaos -o hello</span>
Starting compiling...
Compiling Chaos code into build/hello.c
Compiling the C code into machine code...
Cleaning up the temporary files...

Finished compiling.

Binary is ready on: build/hello
<span>$</span><span> build/hello</span>
hello world
</code></pre>
<p>if you compile this file with the <code>-k</code> option like: <code>chaos -c hello.kaos -o hello -k</code> it will not remove (<strong>keep</strong>) the
intermediate C source code so you can take a look at the generated C code with <code>cat build/hello.c</code>:</p>
<pre><code>

<span>#<span>include</span> <span>"hello.h"</span></span>

<span>extern</span> <span>bool</span> disable_complex_mode;

<span>int</span> kaos_lineno;
<span>bool</span> is_interactive = <span>false</span>;
<span>unsigned</span> <span>long</span> <span>long</span> nested_loop_counter = <span>0</span>;
<span>const</span> <span>long</span> <span>double</span> inf = <span>1.0</span> / <span>0.0</span>;

<span><span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>(<span>int</span> argc, <span>char</span>** argv)</span> </span>{
    program_file_path = <span>malloc</span>(<span>strlen</span>(<span>"hello.kaos"</span>) + <span>1</span>);
    <span>strcpy</span>(program_file_path, <span>"hello.kaos"</span>);
    <span>char</span> *argv0 = <span>malloc</span>(<span>1</span> + <span>strlen</span>(argv[<span>0</span>]));
    <span>strcpy</span>(argv0, argv[<span>0</span>]);
    initMainFunction();
    Symbol* symbol;
    <span>long</span> <span>long</span> exit_code;
    phase = PREPARSE;
    phase = PROGRAM;
    kaos_lineno = <span>0</span>;
    <span>printf</span>(<span>"hello world\n"</span>);
    <span>free</span>(argv0);
    freeEverything(argv0);
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>and the header file:</p>
<pre><code>

<span>#<span>ifndef</span> HELLO_H</span>
<span>#<span>define</span> HELLO_H</span>

<span>#<span>include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span></span>
<span>#<span>include</span> <span>&lt;stdbool.h&gt;</span></span>

<span>#<span>include</span> <span>"interpreter/function.h"</span></span>
<span>#<span>include</span> <span>"interpreter/symbol.h"</span></span>

<span>unsigned</span> <span>long</span> <span>long</span> nested_loop_counter;
jmp_buf LoopBreak;
jmp_buf LoopContinue;


<span>#<span>endif</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>At the first glance, it might look like an overkill for a "Hello, World!" program but when you consider the fact
that Chaos is a high-level programming language, it's actually a short code.</p>
<h2>The Size</h2>
<p>When you look at the size of this binary:</p>
<pre><code><span>$</span><span> <span>stat</span> -c %s build/hello</span>
262648
</code></pre>
<p>you'll see that it's 260 KB. So it can be said that a program in Chaos can only be that small.</p>
<p>You might wonder the answer of; while the "Hello, World!" in C:</p>
<pre><code><span>#<span>include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span></span>

<span><span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> </span>{
   <span>printf</span>(<span>"hello world\n"</span>);
   <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>is only 16 KB, why is the same program in Chaos 260 KB in size? The answer is; Chaos programs are compiled against
<strong><a href="https://github.com/chaos-lang/chaos">the language's source</a></strong>. So that it <strong>packs the Chaos runtime</strong> into
the compiled binary. That's why it's a little bit bigger in size.</p>
<p>The one aspect of Chaos language that enables shipping the runtime with every compiled program is; the language's
source is designed with the mindset that every library, even the core libraries, will be <strong>shipped separately</strong> and will
<strong>not be included</strong> in the language's source. With this way, both the bloated code is prevented and
the language's size is reduced significantly.</p>
<p>If you're still not convinced about the necessity of shipping the language with the program, I urge you to write
the <strong>equivalent</strong> of this <strong><a href="https://github.com/chaos-lang/chaos/blob/v0.1.0/tests/list.kaos">list.kaos</a></strong> (291 KB)
example in <strong>C language</strong> and look at the size of your binary. You'll see that it does not worth to write it in C.
It's also possible that you can increase the size while trying to do it in C.</p>


<h2>The Performance</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/chaos-lang/chaos/blob/v0.1.0/tests/everything.kaos">everything.kaos</a></strong> is a pretty
suitable example that demonstrates almost all of the features of the language in a single short program.
You compile this program with <code>chaos -c tests/everything.kaos -o everything</code> and then when you
look at the time statistics:</p>
<p>Interpreted:</p>
<pre><code><span>$</span><span> time chaos tests/everything.kaos</span>
real    0m0,005s
user    0m0,001s
sys     0m0,005s
</code></pre>
<p>Compiled:</p>
<pre><code><span>$</span><span> time build/everything</span>
real    0m0,004s
user    0m0,001s
sys     0m0,003s
</code></pre>
<p>The compiled program is <strong>almost 50% faster</strong> than the interpreted program. The reason for this
performance improvement is; while running the compiled program
neither the <strong><a href="https://github.com/chaos-lang/chaos/blob/v0.1.0/lexer/lexer.l">lexer</a></strong>
nor the <strong><a href="https://github.com/chaos-lang/chaos/blob/v0.1.0/parser/parser.y">parser</a></strong> is executed.</p>
<p>The peak memory usage is also slightly lower in case of the compiled program. The peak memory usage statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interpreted: <code>Maximum resident set size (kbytes): 2552</code></li>
<li>Compiled: <code>Maximum resident set size (kbytes): 2308</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Because of these performance advantages, it's highly recommended to use the compiled version of your program
in the production environment. Chaos has the interpreter and the REPL (read–eval–print loop) options to
<strong>speed up your development process</strong> while slowing down your runtime. The outcome of the compiled and
the interpreted programs are and will <strong>always be identical</strong>.</p>
<h2>The Extra</h2>
<p>The Chaos binary has a flag <code>-e, --extra</code> to inject <strong>extra flags into C compiler command</strong> for advanced users.
With this flag you can increase your debugging posiblities. Here are some examples:</p>
<p>GNU Debugger:</p>
<pre><code>chaos -c hello.kaos -o hello -e "-ggdb"
</code></pre>
<p>Clang MemorySanitizer (MSan):</p>
<pre><code>chaos -c hello.kaos -o hello -e "-fsanitize=memory -fsanitize-memory-track-origins=2 -O1 -fno-optimize-sibling-calls -ggdb"
</code></pre>
<p>Clang AddressSanitizer (ASan):</p>
<pre><code>chaos -c hello.kaos -o hello -e "-fsanitize=address -fno-omit-frame-pointer -g -ggdb"
</code></pre>
<p>Clang UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (UBSan):</p>
<pre><code>chaos -c hello.kaos -o hello -e "-fsanitize=undefined -ggdb"
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Clang sanitizers require your Chaos binary to be compiled with <code>clang</code> instead of <code>gcc</code>. So make sure that
you have compiled Chaos from <a href="https://github.com/chaos-lang/chaos">its source</a> with <code>make clang</code> command.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Apple Silicon M1</h3>



<p>So Apple is migrating CPU architectures <span id="easy-footnote-1-36"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-36" title="<a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/mac/m1&quot;>https://www.apple.com/mac/m1</a>"><sup>1</sup></a></span>. Again. For the <em>third time</em>. Now from x86 (bought from Intel) to ARM:self-designed, baked by TSMC. We can all read up on their bombastic claims and decide if its good or not. Good performance? Good battery life? But bad for environment as nothing is repairable or upgradable? Everybody has an opinion. Mine? I personally think it’s an interesting, good move… but lets talk about something else.</p>



<h3>Rosetta of 2005</h3>



<p>Let’s draw your attention to the <em>transition</em> <em>period</em> side of things. Cast your minds back to 2005, when Apple migrated from PowerPC to x86 architecture. “How is that possible? All our software would no longer run!” – users might shout. But a key piece of technology was developed to smooth out the transition, Rosetta <span id="easy-footnote-2-36"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-36" title="<a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/news/the-brains-behind-apples-rosetta-transitive&quot;>https://www.cnet.com/news/the-brains-behind-apples-rosetta-transitive</a>"><sup>2</sup></a></span>  <span id="easy-footnote-3-36"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-36" title="<a href=&quot;https://thenextweb.com/insider/2011/10/22/how-one-of-apples-most-important-pieces-of-software-came-from-a-small-uk-startup&quot;>https://thenextweb.com/insider/2011/10/22/how-one-of-apples-most-important-pieces-of-software-came-from-a-small-uk-startup</a>"><sup>3</sup></a></span>. It was developed by a company called Transitive, in Manchester, UK. Coincidentally, I was lucky enough to work there as well. But I joined a few years after Rosetta had been unveiled, and did not get a chance to join it’s development effort. However, for many a year Transitive remained my benchmark for an ideal workplace.</p>

<p>It is important to understand how really, <em>really</em> complicated that solution was. It is <em>not</em> <em>only</em> an emulator. I’ve written emulators. It wasn’t rocket science. The big brains behind the software is a real time, dynamic binary translation engine, reading in instructions from one CPU architecture, and figuring out how to produce code for another architecture altogether. Where no direct 1-to-1 mapping of such operations may even exist. Or a different amount of registers are available. Or many, many other challenges – to list most of them i would need a series of blogs. But let us review what Steve Jobs claimed in 2005:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="230" src="https://i1.wp.com/occasional.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/rosetta-1.jpg?resize=300%2C230&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/occasional.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/rosetta-1.jpg?resize=300%2C230&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>– Dynamic Binary translation<br>– Runs existing Apps!<br>– Transparent to users<br>– Lightweight<br><strong><em>– Fast (<span>enough</span>)</em></strong></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>In my humble opinion, the key take-away was the last point there. It showed that Apple (Transitive) did made it work! But they wanted to downplay user expectations. Maybe they were not 100% confident?</p>



<h3>Rosetta of 2020</h3>



<p>Now back to the future (or rather, the present). This time we have Rosetta 2. It is no longer built by Transitive, as that has been acquired by IBM back in 2008 <span id="easy-footnote-4-36"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-36" title="<a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/ibm-acquires-transitive&quot;>https://www.zdnet.com/article/ibm-acquires-transitive</a>"><sup>4</sup></a></span>. But the experts are still out there, the technology has been proven, and Apple built a new one.</p>



<p>The success of Apple Silicon will be defined by how good the hardware is. The success of the transition will be defined by <em>two</em> things: how well Rosetta 2 performs, and how fast software providers distribute updated versions of their applications. Popular tech news articles will once again briefly-or-not mention Rosetta 2, most likely calling it an emulation layer. You, my dear reader, by now should guess that it is <strong>not just that</strong>. Once again, it is an amazing solution, a complicated engine to perform difficult computational tasks, solve register and memory management issues, perform as fast as possible (or better!!), never crash, and handle anything that is thrown at it. There should be no option to fail here. No place to </p>



<pre>log.error("TODO: finish this instruction translation later");</pre>



<p>So… What is special about the second version <span id="easy-footnote-5-36"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-5-36" title="<a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_silicon/about_the_rosetta_translation_environment?language=objc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_silicon/about_the_rosetta_translation_environment"><sup>5</sup></a></span>? Let’s have a quick look at Apple developer documentation.<br></p>



<blockquote><p>“If an executable contains only Intel instructions, macOS automatically launches Rosetta and begins the translation process. When translation finishes, the system launches the translated executable in place of the original. However, the translation process takes time, so users might perceive that translated apps launch or run more slowly at times,” </p></blockquote>



<p> It’s not all powerful, Apple lists instruction set extensions and things they don’t support yet: kernel extensions, hypervisors running x86 VMs, vector instructions… But it is still fascinating. Let’s take their example: your software is already ‘new’, compiled for the ARM architecture. But it has plugins you want to use, and those are not. In theory, Rosetta 2 should be able to run the whole process ‘translated’, and handle the old plugins fine. So what did Tim Apple boast about Rosetta this time?</p>

<p>Notice that key differences in the presentation. </p>



<ul><li>No longer did Apple downplay user expectations: “fast enough” vs “Fast performance”. To me it shows they have more confidence in it, and a more powerful tool at their fingertips.</li><li>Translated at install time: now that sounds cool. Does that mean, that if you attempt to install an x86 app, it is completely translated immediately, and you have a translated binary ready to go? That is generally called “static binary translation”, but has great limitations for code that is loaded dynamically.</li><li>Dynamic translation for JITs: this means they not only do static translation. They support what is called “self modifying code”, where static translation is not possible. What is the value in translating the code ahead-of-time, if the code will go and change itself?</li><li>Transparent to the user: now that does not change. It must still remain the most amazing software you will never see!</li></ul>



<p>Most likely it has a multi-layered caching/storage solution of translated code to avoid translating the same things over and over again. But note that warning in the quote above: “…the translation process takes time, so users might perceive that translated apps launch or run more slowly at times”.<br>It is important to understand this. At first launch of an app, all code is encountered for the first time. So Rosetta 2 must go instruction by instruction, decode its function, check for side effects, and produce good ARM alternatives. Then cache/store the results. Then chain those together. Now this process takes time, of course, and the application may appear to run slower. But what Apple is banking on – is that their chip is actually so good that it can offset that slowdown and in the end, it is not impossible for the application to actually – at least perceivably – run even faster than on a previous Intel based mac!</p>



<h3>So How Fast is it, anyway?</h3>



<p>Now, the first benchmarks are already pouring in. Just a quick shout-out – I have just purchased an HP Elitebook with a Ryzen 7 Pro 4750U CPU. I absolutely love it.

<blockquote><p>Jetstream is the broadest of the three benchmarks shown here—it combines an enormous number of JavaScript and WebAssembly benchmarks. Workloads include regex parsing, list sorting, ray tracing and (much, much) more.</p></blockquote>



<ul><li>HP Elitebook Ryzen 7 4750U Google Chrome         <strong><em>129.8</em></strong></li><li><em>Apple M1 Mac Mini Google Chrome x86_64            <strong>93.1</strong></em></li></ul>



<p>.. thats a ~28 percent performance hit on a really heavy benchmark. I give it a 9 out of 10. But…</p>



<ul><li>Apple M1 Mac Mini Google Chrome M1 Native.      <strong><em>156.9</em></strong></li></ul>



<p>… Apple, your ARM chip outperforms my brand new spanking HP laptop. You really pulled a rabbit out of the hat this time.</p>







<p>Disclaimer 🙂<br>I’m not an ‘Apple fanboy’. I have never purchased Apple products myself but actually owned some. But I am a big fanboy of amazing hardware and software. Which Rosetta 2 most definitely is. As well as M1.<br></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
        <p>Published on: 2020-11-30</p>
        
<p>In the last year, a lot of companies have been forced to go remote and are now advertising jobs as "remote". Over the last two seasons the number of "remote" roles on AngelList, for example, increased by what seems to be an order of magnitude.</p>
<p>You may be tempted to quit your office job or your "soon to be office" job to find a permanent remote role. Before you do that I do want to remind you of several things that cause companies to work in offices, then list several things that you can look for in a role to make sure it stays remote for the long-haul.</p>
<h2>I - We could have worked remotely since the 90s</h2>
<p>Skype, IRC, email, version control for code, and fiber optics were all a thing back then. Yes, you might not have been able to work from the Everest base camp or the thickets of the Congo, or even from a cafe. But you could have worked from the comfort of most homes and hotels just fine.</p>
<p>Indeed, the largest projects o the 90s, things such as the Linux kernel and GCC, were worked on remotely.</p>
<p>No change makes remote work fundamentally easier now than it was then. If it is easier, it's so by a small margin.</p>
<p>Indeed, an increase in salary and s.s. taxes throughout the US and the EU actually makes it more economically viable to rent an office nowadays for most companies, since they are getting a much better bang for their buck from giving employees nice views, fancy swings, and free lunches than for paying them (where, depending on location, the government takes 30-60% of the money).</p>
<h2>II - Offices serve the same role</h2>
<p>Offices, in my subjective empirical experience, have four well-defined roles:</p>
<ol>
<li>To put people in a work-priming environment.</li>
</ol>
<p>An environment where they know that whatever they do for 8 hours, they must focus on works. They have eyes on them and they have colleagues around them talking about work, their brain diverges towards work, as opposed to, e.g. browsing facebook, playing a game, or reading a book, or writing a mediocre blog-article just to fulfill a self-imposed creativity quota.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>To provide lonely people the company of colleagues.</li>
</ol>
<p>The lonely people are usually highly motivated workers that end up being part of management or essential to the company. So providing them a social environment is critical, otherwise they might move to find one. I know at least 2 smart guys working for much less than what they could have asked for wage wise, which seemed to be sticking for the social element, and finally left during the pandemic.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>To work around accountability.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's very easy to tell what someone is working on when you can see all the PRs they made a given month (both literally and figuratively speaking, depending on the case). This is uncomfortable for a variety of reasons. It forces acknowledging that some people are doing nothing and are being kept around just because "we like them".</p>
<p>It leads to management having to work more to keep themselves and their teams accountable. In an office, accountability can be proxied onto things like "Well, he comes into work every day and spends 6 hours typing at his desk, he must be doing something".</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Social-power hungry leaders.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some people that lead and/or manage do so because they like having some sort of imagined "social prestige", even if subconsciously. This is rewarding in an office setting, but not when working remotely, being a remote leader/manager probably does not lead to the same social-power highs that fulfilling that role in-person does.</p>
<p>All these 4 pillars or office work will remain unchanged after the pandemic. Indeed, the lack of office work is making many crave an office even more.</p>
<p>Just to be clear, I don't think there's anything bad in that. But some of us have or want a lifestyle built around never having to work in an office.</p>
<h2>III - Remote jobs for the long run</h2>
<p>Thus, if you are offered a remote role, please keep in mind that it's likely <em>not</em> to be remote for long.</p>
<p>The best way to make sure this is the case is to just ask "Are you sure I will be able to work in this or a similar role remotely even 3 years from now ?".</p>
<p>But unless you are working for startups, where you can talk to the people making these shots directly, it's possible an interviewer won't be able to answer this question with any degree of certainty.</p>
<p>So if you want to work remotely for a long time look for roles at companies:</p>
<ol>
<li>That were working remotely before the pandemic started.</li>
<li>That don't have offices close to where you live, and make sure to mention relocation is not an option to see how they react.</li>
<li>Where all the employees and managers you interact with give assurances about liking remote work and the work remaining remote for <em>a long time</em>.</li>
<li>That have a well-defined remote work protocol, something that most teams that plan on returning to the office might not have. Core indicators of this might be more communication over text, accountability systems for the work done, and flexible schedules with few mandatory meetings.</li>
<li>That don't currently rent an office building... potentially hard to find out.</li>
<li>That offer remote-focused benefits, such as travel health insurance, budget for online courses, team building events around the world, budget for shared workspaces.</li>
<li>Where most of the team is remote and distributed throughout the world. If every single employee is in a different country, it's unlikely that getting an office will work out.</li>
</ol>
<p>The list above is probably incomplete and I don't think all 7 boxes must be ticked for you to have a high certainty that a job will remain remote for the long haul.</p>
<p>But it's something important to keep in mind when looking for work.</p>

<p>Web components allow us to create custom HTML elements with custom behavior. HTML was originally designed primarily for documentation purposes with some form controls. Then by using CSS, we developers attempted to style the page and give the looks that we wanted. With HTML 5, new “web components” came up such as <strong>dialog</strong> and <strong>progress</strong>. But they are somewhat limited and due to that HTML language is almost transformed into the assembly language of the web developer. We tend to abstract and stay away from HTML and treat it as a second class citizen where we hook into our shiny SPA web frameworks. We look at the job ads, no one is searching for an HTML developer anymore but they look for React devs, Angular devs, Vue devs. 10 years ago, it was hard to land a job if you didn’t know jQuery, 5 years ago it was Angular that recruiters wanted and the developers have been turned into hamsters running in a circle. Perhaps it is time to revisit the fundamentals, give HTML some respect and treat it as a first-class citizen. Web components are an attempt to give that respect back to it.</p>

Window web component</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/modalwindow.png" alt="shadowdom">
Although web components are meant to be written via JavaScript, there is no reason not to do it from Fable. This post will also demonstrate some more capabilities (and limitations) of Fable in terms of JavaScript interop.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>And by the way, this is the final markup that we are going to use at the very and as our web component:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>&lt;modal-window</span> <span>visible</span> <span>onclose=</span><span>'alert(this.tagName)'</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;span</span> <span>slot=</span><span>"title"</span><span>&gt;&lt;button</span> <span>onclick=</span><span>"this.parentNode.parentNode.close()"</span><span>&gt;</span>Title Button<span>&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;span</span> <span>slot=</span><span>"description"</span><span>&gt;</span>Onur<span>&lt;/span&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/modal-window&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>Basically, web components have 3 ingredients:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A custom element class</strong>: You create an ES 6 class with some special named members.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Shadow DOM</strong>: Web components live in a concept called shadow dom. shadow dom is like an independent HTML root, you could imagine it something like an iframe but unlike iframe, it is still an integral part of the page. In general most CSS styles cannot transcend upwards or downwards through the shadow dom with the exception of things like color and event bubbling still works</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>HTML Template</strong>: Basically a string of HTML markup, which can include the styling, that will compose our control</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Once we gathered the ingredients we register our tag and use it.</p>



<p>This common question arises, as we could do all complicated dynamic stuff by using our fancy SPA frameworks.</p>

<p>Well, the first benefit is your components become framework agnostic. Since the final output is HTML, once you have written a web component it can be easily consumed by React, Angular, Vue or Web assembly.</p>

<p>The second benefit is, web components give you a <strong>shadow dom</strong> which allows you to hide the CSS classes into the component. So that, you could have truly isolated CSS styling as CSS styles outside of the shadow dom won’t penetrate inside and the ones inside won’t be leaking to the outside of the shadow dom.</p>

<p>Another great benefit is for designers. Whether you use react, angular or fable a common problem is that you start to write your HTML with the SPA’s language with extra augmentations such as JSX or full Fable F# syntax, and then if you have an HTML designer who is not familiar with F#/react, etc in your team, it becomes a problem to sync the designer’s code with your own code. To solve this problem Shadow DOM gives you <strong>HTML slots</strong>, which allow you to treat HTML as a native templated language with default looks. We will investigate slots briefly in our example below.</p>



<p>React, Angular, Vue, and web components are complementary, not rivalry. That is, you can write web components that are rendered via react. Then you can re-consume the custom HTML element from React, like a sandwich.</p>

<p>React –&gt; Html Web Component –&gt; React</p>

<p>This way you can end up with SPA framework-agnostic components and you can use your SPA where it is needed, that is primarily templating your data, not the looks.</p>

Window web component</a> and for the rest of the post we will do a walk-through the code.</p>

<p>At we first we have a reusable WebComponent module which is the basis and encapsulating common code for our future web controls.</p>

<p>At the top, we create a template element in Fable way as they are missing in Fable library. This for getting type safety and auto-complete.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>[&lt;</span><span>AllowNullLiteral</span><span>&gt;]</span>
    <span>type</span> <span>HTMLTemplateElement</span> <span>=</span>
        <span>inherit</span> <span>HTMLElement</span>
        
        <span>abstract</span> <span>content</span><span>:</span> <span>DocumentFragment</span> <span>with</span> <span>get</span><span>,</span> <span>set</span>

    <span>[&lt;</span><span>AllowNullLiteral</span><span>&gt;]</span>
    <span>type</span> <span>HTMLTemplateElementType</span> <span>=</span>

        <span>//cool way to generate the constructor</span>
        <span>[&lt;</span><span>EmitConstructor</span><span>&gt;]</span>
        <span>abstract</span> <span>Create</span><span>:</span> <span>unit</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>HTMLTemplateElement</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next we need a shadow dom type and we define it as below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>//We create our own ShadowRoot to interact with browser api.</span>
    <span>[&lt;</span><span>Global</span><span>&gt;]</span>
    <span>type</span> <span>ShadowRoot</span><span>()</span> <span>=</span>

        <span>member</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>appendChild</span><span>(</span><span>el</span><span>:</span> <span>Browser</span><span>.</span><span>Types</span><span>.</span><span>Node</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>jsNative</span>

        <span>member</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>selector</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>):</span> <span>Browser</span><span>.</span><span>Types</span><span>.</span><span>HTMLElement</span> <span>=</span> <span>jsNative</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Again this is primarily for type safety and auto-complete support while interacting with Browser’s DOM API. Notice the global attribute. This is to say Fable, don’t generate code for this type, it already exists in the hosting environment in this case the browser. And members are not mangled. Mangling is a mechanism in fable that would change the actual generated member name in order to support things like overloading. Obviously no code is generated here.</p>

<p>The HTML specification says, in order for web components to deal with its attributes we need a specially named member <strong>observedAttributes</strong> and this member should be static getter property. As mentioned above, Fable by default, mangles all property names with some $ and numerical symbols unless the member is virtual or an interface member. To work around the issue we need some helpers to generate static getters. And here’s the code for it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>//Below two helpers works around fable limitation: </span>
    <span>//No static members without name mangling.</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>inline</span> <span>attachStatic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>obj</span><span>):</span> <span>unit</span> <span>=</span> <span>jsConstructor</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;?</span><span>name</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>f</span>

    <span>let</span> <span>inline</span> <span>attachStaticGetter</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>V</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>unit</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'</span><span>V</span><span>):</span> <span>unit</span> <span>=</span>
        <span>JS</span><span>.</span><span>Constructors</span><span>.</span><span>Object</span><span>.</span><span>defineProperty</span> <span>(</span><span>jsConstructor</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;,</span> <span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>!!{|</span> <span>get</span> <span>=</span> <span>f</span> <span>|})</span>
        <span>|&gt;</span> <span>ignore</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We will see how these functions are used.</p>

<p>All the classes that we will use for the web components must derive from: <strong>HtmlElement</strong>. Fable already offers one but unfortunately, some members we require, are missing. So we create one of our own:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>// The built in html element is missing below props so we use our own</span>
    <span>[&lt;</span><span>Global</span><span>;</span> <span>AbstractClass</span><span>&gt;]</span>
    <span>[&lt;</span><span>AllowNullLiteral</span><span>&gt;]</span>
    <span>type</span> <span>HTMLElement</span><span>()</span> <span>=</span>

        <span>member</span> <span>_.</span><span>getAttribute</span><span>(</span><span>attr</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>):</span> <span>obj</span> <span>=</span> <span>jsNative</span>

        <span>member</span> <span>_.</span><span>setAttribute</span><span>(</span><span>attr</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span><span>:</span> <span>obj</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>jsNative</span>

        <span>member</span> <span>_.</span><span>attachShadow</span><span>(</span><span>obj</span><span>):</span> <span>ShadowRoot</span> <span>=</span> <span>jsNative</span>

        <span>member</span> <span>_.</span><span>dispatchEvent</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>:</span> <span>CustomEvent</span><span>):</span> <span>unit</span> <span>=</span> <span>jsNative</span>

        <span>abstract</span> <span>connectedCallback</span><span>:</span> <span>unit</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>unit</span>

        <span>default</span> <span>_.</span><span>connectedCallback</span><span>()</span> <span>=</span> <span>()</span>

        <span>abstract</span> <span>attributeChangedCallback</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span> <span>*</span> <span>obj</span> <span>*</span> <span>obj</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>unit</span>

        <span>default</span> <span>_.</span><span>attributeChangedCallback</span><span>(_,</span> <span>_,</span> <span>_)</span> <span>=</span> <span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can see there are some virtual members (abstract-default pairs make a member virtual in F#)  One is <strong>connectedCallback</strong> and the other is <strong>attributeChangedCallback</strong>.</p>

<p>These member names are special and they are called by the browser. <strong>connectedCallback</strong> is called when the member is attached to the DOM tree and <strong>attributeChangeCallback</strong> is called when the attributes are first time set or changed. We will use these members to initiate the rendering.</p>

<p>If you are going to use react inside your web component then I advise you to use <strong>react-shadow-dom-retarget-events</strong> as react’s way of handling events doesn’t work by default with shadow dom. But once you use below snippet everything works fine.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>(* in your app add react-shadow-dom-retarget-events via yarn uncomment below code 
        to make sure react components work fine 
       then call it from your component with:  retargetEvents shadowRoot *)</span>
       
    <span>let</span> <span>retargetEvents</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>ShadowRoot</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>unit</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
        <span>importDefault</span> <span>"react-shadow-dom-retarget-events"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And finally, we conclude our module with a special member:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>//special member for html web components</span>
    <span>[&lt;</span><span>Literal</span><span>&gt;]</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>observedAttributes</span> <span>=</span> <span>"observedAttributes"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is just string and we put it there for because it is a special member name.</p>

<p>Now it is time to write our actual ModalWindow module.</p>

<p>We first define and <strong>HTMLTemplateElement</strong> as this is also missing with Fable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>//fsharplint:disable</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>template</span><span>:</span> <span>HTMLTemplateElement</span> <span>=</span> <span>!!</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>createElement</span> <span>"template"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice the fsharplint comment as if you use editors like VSCode, we suppress the linters as F# code conventions are not compatible with HTML or JS.</p>

<p>Then we define our html template as string:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>let</span> <span>private</span> <span>html</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span> <span>=</span> <span>"""

Consolas,monaco,monospace"</span> <span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>div</span> <span>class</span><span>=</span><span>"modal-background"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span>

    <span>&lt;</span><span>div</span> <span>class</span><span>=</span><span>"modal-content has-shadow has-margin-bottom-20"</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span><span>div</span> <span>class</span><span>=</span><span>"box is-radiusless has-margin-bottom-0 has-background-white has-padding-30"</span><span>&gt;</span>
            <span>&lt;</span><span>div</span> <span>class</span><span>=</span><span>"has-text-left"</span><span>&gt;</span>
                <span>&lt;</span><span>h2</span> <span>class</span><span>=</span><span>"title is-size-2 is-marginless has-text-primary"</span><span>&gt;</span>
                    <span>&lt;</span><span>slot</span> <span>name</span><span>=</span><span>"title"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Title</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>slot</span><span>&gt;</span>
                <span>h2</span><span>&gt;</span>
                <span>&lt;</span><span>p</span> <span>class</span><span>=</span><span>"has-text-subtle is-size-5 has-text-primary"</span><span>&gt;&lt;</span><span>slot</span> <span>name</span><span>=</span><span>"description"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Description</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>slot</span><span>&gt;&lt;/</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span>
            <span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span>
            <span>&lt;</span><span>div</span> <span>class</span><span>=</span><span>"buttons has-margin-top-20 is-right"</span><span>&gt;</span>
                <span>is</span><span>-</span><span>radiusless</span><span>" onClick="</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>dispatchEvent</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>CustomEvent</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>close'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>bubbles</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span><span>composed</span><span>:</span><span>true</span><span>}))</span><span>" &gt;Close
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        CustomEvent('close', { bubbles: true,composed:true}))"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span>"""

<h2>Migrating from Google Music to Navidrome on Kubernetes</h2>

<p>When <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/10/rip-google-play-music-2011-2020/">Google Music shut down</a>
this month, instead of taking the easy way out and migrating to Youtube Music I decided to have a stab
at hosting my music collection myself. I think that it went pretty well so I thought I'd share the details.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This is certainly not the most cost effective or simple way to solve this problem. It's suitable
for the fairly niche intersection of people who have a personal Kubernetes cluster and are too stubborn to
just give up and use Spotify.</p>
<h2>Navidrome</h2>
<p>Searching for an open source Google Music replacement, it didn't take too long to find <a href="https://www.navidrome.org/">Navidrome</a>, a modern web based streaming server written in Golang.</p>
<p>It met my main fairly basic requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Browser based music streaming</li>
<li>Mobile support (through <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=github.daneren2005.dsub&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US">DSub</a>)</li>
<li>(nice to have) Multiple user support</li>
</ul>
<p>I discovered that this family of music streaming software tend to support the <a href="http://www.subsonic.org/pages/api.jsp">Subsonic API</a> which means that generally mobile and other apps are available for them and Just Work, which is pretty handy!</p>
<h2>Navidrome on Kubernetes</h2>
<p>I have a Kubernetes cluster that I use for tinkering (because that's the sort of person I am!). It's mostly stable so it seemed sensible to put Navidrome there. Is this the simplest way to get this up and running? No. Is it a fun way to learn more about Kubernetes? Yes!</p>
<p>There isn't an existing Helm chart (a type of Kubernetes package) for Navidrome so I made my own (<strong>experimental</strong>) chart. Here's how to get that set up in your existing Kubernetes cluster.</p>
<h3>Create a PVC</h3>
<p>The first thing you need to do is create a <code>PersistentVolumeClaim</code> where your music and Navidrome data files will go. Here's an example that I used to create a 250 GB volume on Digital Ocean (<code>storageClassName</code> will likely vary between cloud providers).</p>
<div><p><span>pvc.yaml</span></p><pre><span></span><code><span>apiVersion</span><span>:</span> <span>v1</span>
<span>kind</span><span>:</span> <span>PersistentVolumeClaim</span>
<span>metadata</span><span>:</span>
  <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>navidrome</span>
<span>spec</span><span>:</span>
  <span>accessModes</span><span>:</span>
  <span>-</span> <span>ReadWriteOnce</span>
  <span>resources</span><span>:</span>
    <span>requests</span><span>:</span>
      <span>storage</span><span>:</span> <span>250Gi</span>
  <span>storageClassName</span><span>:</span> <span>do-block-storage</span>
</code></pre></div>
<div><pre><span></span><code>kubectl create -f pvc.yaml
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Install Navidrome</h3>
<p>Once the PVC is created, we can install Navidrome and connect it up.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>helm repo add navidrome https://andrewmichaelsmith.github.io/navidrome
helm repo update   
<span># Note we're telling it to use the PVC called "navidrome" we created above</span>
helm install --set persistence.enabled<span>=</span><span>true</span> --set persistence.existingClaim<span>=</span>navidrome navidrome/navidrome --generate-name
</code></pre></div>
<p>If this works, helm should output some values to for <code>POD_NAME</code> and <code>CONTAINER_PORT</code> that allows you run:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>kubectl --namespace default port-forward <span>$POD_NAME</span> <span>8080</span>:<span>$CONTAINER_PORT</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This should give you a running instance of Navidrome on <a href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080</a>, where you can set up an admin user and login (🎉):</p>
<p><img alt="Navidrome empty home" src="https://andrewmichaelsmith.com/images/navidrome-empty.png" title="Navidrome empty home"></p>
<h2>Adding Music</h2>
<p>So this is great and everything, but we're still missing something quite important - the music!</p>
<p>I am assuming that you have managed to <a href="https://lifehacker.com/save-your-google-play-music-library-before-it-disappear-1844624691">export your music</a> and have it on disk under <code>/home/your_user/Music</code>.</p>
<p>This technique is a little hacky but for a one off it does the job and I was able to copy a large music collection easily in a day. What we're going to do is get the container to rsync the files from our machine.</p>
<p><strong>This assumes you have an internet accessible SSH server (<code>your_server</code>) set up on the computer with the music collection</strong>.</p>
<p>Let's jump on a shell in our Navidrome pod:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>kubectl <span>exec</span> -ti <span>$POD_NAME</span> -- sh
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now, some set up. Here we get an SSH login working to your SSH server and then start copying the files:</p>

<p>This will sync music from <code>/home/your_music/Music</code> on the server <code><a href="https://andrewmichaelsmith.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="84fdebf1f6dbf1f7e1f6c4fdebf1f6">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>_server</code> in to where Navidrome looks for music (🎉!).</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you find that some music isn't showing up, you may need to "Rescan server" from the web UI.</p>
<h2>Getting an entry point</h2>
<p>So this is great - Navidrome is running and we can play our music from it! However, you may have noticed that our access currently
depends upon the <code>kubectl port-forward</code> command above.</p>
<p>That might be enough for you but likely won't be that stable and it also will mean that you can't connect a mobile app to Navidrome.</p>
<p>This is where we need to set up an ingress. There are many <a href="https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/">other posts</a> describing
this set up so I won't get into that detail here.</p>
<p>However, I will show you how I wired my existing nginx ingress controller:</p>
<div><p><span>ingress.yaml</span></p><pre><span></span><code><span>apiVersion</span><span>:</span> <span>networking.k8s.io/v1beta1</span>
<span>kind</span><span>:</span> <span>Ingress</span>
<span>metadata</span><span>:</span>
  <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>navidrome-ingress</span>
<span>spec</span><span>:</span>
  <span>rules</span><span>:</span>
  <span>-</span> <span>host</span><span>:</span> <span>navidrome.mydomain.net</span> 
    <span>http</span><span>:</span>
      <span>paths</span><span>:</span>
      <span>-</span> <span>backend</span><span>:</span>
          <span>serviceName</span><span>:</span> <span>navidrome-1606039281</span>
          <span>servicePort</span><span>:</span> <span>4533</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p><img alt="Navidrome Dsub on Android" src="https://andrewmichaelsmith.com/images/navidrome-dsub-android.png#float-right" title="DSub on Android connected to Navidrome"></p>
<p>Here I'm using ingress to connect <code>navidrome.mydomain.net</code> to <code>navidrome-1606039281</code>. You can get the Service name by running <code>helm list</code>. With this set up - I'm able to connect an Android app to my Navidrome instance:</p>
<p>Note that the end point will be protected by the admin credentails that you setup, you'll likely want to consider setting up TLS on your ingress as well but I won't go into details of that here.</p>
<h2>Was it worth it?</h2>
<p>So I've been using this set up for a few weeks now and it works great, but was it worth it?</p>
<h3>Costs</h3>
<p>As I've mentioned, this lives on an existing Kubernetes cluster, but if I were to do this from scratch how much it would it be?</p>
<p>Prices are for Digital Ocean.</p>
<ul>
<li>2vCPU Server - $10/month</li>
<li>Load Balancer - $10/month</li>
<li>250 GB block storage - $25/month</li>
</ul>
<p>So that's $45 Navidrome on Kubernetes vs $0 Google Music. Not cheap!</p>
<p>The key thing to understand here is that I'm already paying for the
Server and Load Balancer for other projects. Admittedly, in 2020 it
still feels a bit steep to be paying $25/month for 250 GB but I can
live with it.</p>
<h3>Removing dependency on Google and using Open Source</h3>
<p>This is a big win for me - I am on a slow, steady path
to <a href="https://degooglisons-internet.org/en/">de-googlify</a> myself and this
is one step on that journey.</p>
<p>It's also great to use a music streaming server that is under active development
and that I can contribute to.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I'm pretty happy with my set up and if you have similar niche interests I'd recommend
giving it a go!</p>

November 29, 2020 | https://smalldata.tech/blog/2018/08/16/building-a-simple-static-site-generator-using-node-js | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://smalldata.tech/blog/2018/08/16/building-a-simple-static-site-generator-using-node-js">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
  A colleague of mine was recently looking into setting up a blog and asked me for recommendations. After doing a bit of research
  into
  <a href="https://smalldata.tech/api/to/3f2dada3fa09469343564bfd37b597b7">static site generators</a> and blog engines, I decided that Hugo would be a great
  choice. However, my colleague also had a couple of requirements like wanting a custom url for blogs and a custom css theme.
  While all of this is possible with Hugo, I decided to skip the learning curve and see if I could make a really simple static
  site generator given that she already had the html ready to go and that she had no problems writing her blog posts in html.
</p>

<p>
  <u><i>The static site generator script turned out be 100 lines and hardly any magic.</i></u> The code and a sample blog
  can be found
  <a href="https://smalldata.tech/api/to/1e7cb084f632f9b375c46fca2840074a">here</a>. Note that Gitlab provides free hosting for static pages
  and also comes with a CI/CD feature which allows you to compile your pages before deployment.
</p>

<p>
  The following is a tutorial on setting up your own static site generator using Node.js <code>&gt;= 8.11.x</code>. Let us
  first setup the project:
</p>

<pre>npm init
npm i --save-exact bluebird chokidar fs-extra mustache
mkdir src
mkdir public
</pre>

<p>
  The first order of business is to ask the question - why exactly does one need a static site generator? The answer is in
  fact that you don't really. If all you are doing is running a low traffic blog, you could very simply create your html
  pages by hand and publish them. <i>In fact this is how most web publishing was done for the longest time before the rise
    of server-side programming.</i> However, once you have a few pages and some content, it can get tedious to make changes
  to sections that are common across all pages, like the footer for example. Therefore, it would be ideal if we could have
  some sort of a simple templating engine that could allow splitting of common content and inserting it where required.
</p>

<p>
  Before we start looking into templating engines, let us first setup our website. For the moment, we will create 2 folders
  under the project root,
  <code>src</code> (where our current website lives) and
  <code>public</code> (which will contain our generated website). For our initial attempt we will simply copy the contents
  of
  <code>src</code> over to
  <code>public</code>. Create the following
  <code>index.js</code> under your project root:
</p>

<pre>const Promise = require("bluebird");
const fse = require("fs-extra");

Promise.resolve().then(async () =&gt; {
  await main();
});

const main = async() =&gt; {
  await generateSite();
};

const generateSite = async() =&gt; {
  await copyAssets();
};

const copyAssets = async() =&gt; {
  await fse.emptyDir("public");
  await fse.copy("src", "public");
};
</pre>

<p>
  Run this script via
  <code>node index.js</code> and bask in the glory that is programming.
</p>

<div>
  <p><a href="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/006-backend-developers.jpg">
      <img alt="" src="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/006-backend-developers.jpg">
    </a></p><p>
    Congratulations! You are a backend developer now.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  As a second step we will add a file watcher so that any changes within our
  <code>src</code> folder will re-generate the website. Since this will be a blog with 500-1000 files in total (assuming
  100 blog entries), we can afford to regenerate the entire website on any change:
</p>

<pre>const chokidar = require("chokidar");

const main = async() =&gt; {
  await generateSite();
  watchFiles();
};

const watchFiles = () =&gt; {
  const watcher = chokidar.watch(
    [
      "src"
    ],
    {
      ignored: /(^|[\/\\])\../, // chokidar will watch folders recursively
      ignoreInitial: false,
      persistent: true
    }
  );

  watcher.on("change", async path =&gt; {
    console.log("changed " + path + ", recompiling");
    await generateSite();
  });

  // catch ctrl+c event and exit normally
  process.on("SIGINT", function() {
    watcher.close();
  });
};
</pre>

<p>
  The above code makes it clear now why the initial version had a function called
  <code>generateSite</code>. We can start our static site generator now via
  <code>node index.js</code> and if we now edit any file under
  <code>src</code>, the changes should be reflected under
  <code>public</code>. At this point, we will also add an environment variable to differentiate between development and production
  modes. In development mode we will watch for changes and regenerate the website and in production mode we simply regenerate:
</p>

<pre>const env = process.env.NODE_ENV || "dev";

const main = async () =&gt; {
  console.log("Running app in " + env);
  await generateSite();

  if (env === "dev") {
    watchFiles();
  }
};
</pre>

<p>
  We can run the above via:
  <code>export NODE_ENV=prod || set NODE_ENV=prod &amp;&amp; node index.js</code>. Note that watching the source directory for changes
  and recompiling is not entirely necessary, you could always skip this step and simply run the script everytime you make
  changes but programming is all about avoiding repetitive tasks.
</p>

<p>
  Interestingly, we are almost done! All that is really required now is to come back to the original question of creating a
  static site generator in the first place - templating. We will use
  <a href="https://mustache.github.io/">Mustache.js</a> for templating mostly because it is the simplest and our needs are
  not too complicated. Let us create a folder
  <code>src/partials</code> which will hold our common sections. We then modify our website structure slightly so that all
  our pages now live under
  <code>src/pages</code>. Now all that is remaining to do is to load all partials, load the pages and render them using Mustache:
</p>

<pre>const fs = require("fs");

const generateSite = async () =&gt; {
  await copyAssets();
  await buildContent();
};

const buildContent = async () =&gt; {
  const pages = await compilePages();
  await writePages(pages);
};

const compilePages = async () =&gt; {
  const partials = await loadPartials();

  const result = {};
  const pagesDir = path.join("src", "pages");
  const fileNames = await fs.readdirAsync(pagesDir);
  for (const fileName of fileNames) {
    const name = path.parse(fileName).name;
    const fileContent = await fs.readFileAsync(path.join(pagesDir, fileName));
    result[name] = Mustache.render(fileContent.toString(), {}, partials);
  }
  return result;
};

const loadPartials = async () =&gt; {
  const result = {};
  const partialsDir = path.join("src", "partials");
  const fileNames = await fs.readdirAsync(partialsDir);
  for (const fileName of fileNames) {
    const name = path.parse(fileName).name;
    const content = await fs.readFileAsync(path.join(partialsDir, fileName));
    result[name] = content.toString();
  }
  return result;
};

const writePages = async pages =&gt; {
  for (const page of Object.keys(pages)) {
    await fs.writeFileAsync(path.join("public", page + ".html"), pages[page]);
  }
};
</pre>

<p>
  To see the final version check out the
  <a href="https://gitlab.com/wheresvic/software-dawg">Software Dawg</a> project. There are a few minor differences from
  the tutorial here:
  </p><ul>
    <li>The script itself is under the
      <code>src</code> folder.</li>
    <li>It is slightly over 100 lines, 130 at the time of writing, mostly due to clean code practices, i.e. constants instead
      of strings for folder paths, etc.</li>
    <li>Instead of copying over the entire src folder, the script only copies necessary assets such as css, images, etc.</li>
    <li>The project also uses
      <code>node-sass</code> to compile the template css. This dependency is however not required as the compiled css is
      also checked into git.</li>
  </ul>


<p>
  As a bonus, you could also install the
  <code>browser-sync</code> package globally and run that via the provided command
  <code>npm run live-reload</code> so that your browser automatically refreshes on any change. Note that this does not work
  out that well on windows unfortunately, due to the fact that we are regenerating the entire site on any change.
</p>

<p>
  Gitlab provides static website hosting for free and all that is needed is a
  <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> configuration file. What is really incredible is that you can define the build process which
  means that in our case, we can generate the website before deployment! See <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/features/pages/">here</a>
  for more details on this feature.
</p>

<p>
  This concludes the tutorial and my colleague is extremely satisfied with her current solution as it is ultra flexible and
  allows her to customise it to her liking. She is looking into creating custom paths for blog posts at the moment :)

<![CDATA[I am an 80 column purist]]>

<br/>
November 29, 2020 | https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/30/i-am-an-80-column-purist/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/30/i-am-an-80-column-purist/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>I write and prefer code that fits within 80 columns in <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a> and other projects – and there are reasons for it. I’m a little bored by the people who respond and say that they have 400 inch monitors already and they can use them.</p>



<p>I too have multiple large high resolution screens – but writing wide code is still a bad idea! So I decided I’ll write down my reasoning once and for all!</p>



<h2>Narrower is easier to read</h2>



<p>There’s a reason newspapers and magazines have used narrow texts for centuries and in fact even books <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_length">aren’t using long lines</a>. For most humans, it is simply easier on the eyes and brain to read texts that aren’t using really long lines. This has been known for a very long time.</p>



<p>Easy-to-read code is easier to follow and understand which leads to fewer bugs and faster debugging.</p>



<h2>Side-by-side works better</h2>



<p>I <em>never</em> run windows full sized on my screens for anything except watching movies. I frequently have two or more editor windows next to each other, sometimes also with one or two extra terminal/debugger windows next to those. To make this feasible and still have the code readable, it needs to fit “wrapless” in those windows.</p>



<p>Sometimes reading a code diff is easier side-by-side and then too it is important that the two can fit next to each other nicely.</p>



<h2>Better diffs</h2>



<p>Having code grow vertically rather than horizontally is beneficial for diff, git and other tools that work on changes to files. It reduces the risk of merge conflicts and it makes the merge conflicts that still happen easier to deal with.</p>



<h2>It encourages shorter names</h2>



<p>A side effect by strictly not allowing anything beyond column 80 is that it becomes really hard to use those terribly annoying 30+ letters java-style names on functions and identifiers. A function name, and especially local ones, should be short. Having long names make them really hard to read and makes it really hard to spot the difference between the other functions with similarly long names where just a sub-word within is changed.</p>



<p>I know especially Java people object to this as they’re trained in a different culture and say that a method name should rather include a lot of details of the functionality “to help the user”, but to me that’s a weak argument as all non-trivial functions will have more functionality than what can be expressed in the name and thus the user needs to know how the function works <em>anyway.</em></p>



<p>I don’t mean 2-letter names. I mean long enough to make sense but not be ridiculous lengths. Usually within 15 letters or so.</p>



<h2>Just a few spaces per indent level</h2>



<p>To make this work, and yet allow a few indent levels, the code basically have to have small indent-levels, so I prefer to have it set to two spaces per level.</p>



<h2>Many indent levels is wrong anyway</h2>



<p>If you do a lot of indent levels it gets really hard to write code that still fits within the 80 column limit. That’s a subtle way to suggest that you should not write functions that needs or uses that many indent levels. It should then rather be split out into multiple smaller functions, where then each function won’t need that many levels!</p>



<h2>Why exactly 80?</h2>



<p>Once upon the time it was of course because terminals had that limit and these days the exact number 80 is not a must. I just happen to think that the limit has worked fine in the past and I haven’t found any compelling reason to change it since.</p>



<p>It also has to be a hard and fixed limit as if we allow a few places to go beyond the limit we end up on a slippery slope and code slowly grow wider over time – I’ve seen it happen in many projects with “soft enforcement” on code column limits.</p>



<h2>Enforced by a tool</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://curl.se/">curl</a>, we have ‘checksrc’ which will yell errors at any user trying to build code with a too long line present. This is good because then we don’t have to “waste” human efforts to point this out to contributors who offer pull requests. The tool will point out such mistakes with ruthless accuracy.</p>

November 29, 2020 | https://osi.codes/build-a-cgpa-calculator-with-adonisjs-authentication | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://osi.codes/build-a-cgpa-calculator-with-adonisjs-authentication">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Hey there, welcome to the second tutorial in the series. Refer to the first tutorial <a target="_blank" href="https://osi.codes/build-a-cgpa-calculator-with-adonisjs-introduction">here</a>. If you will like to skip setup, clone the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/vicradon/cgpa-api">repo</a> and checkout to the <strong>getting-started</strong> branch.</p>
<h2 id="authentication-for-apis">Authentication for APIs</h2>
<p>Securing APIs can be done in a number of ways. From API keys to JSON Web Token (JWT). AdonisJS is so awesome that it comes configured with several authentication methods. We will be using JWT to secure our APIs. Refer to AdonisJS <a target="_blank" href="https://adonisjs.com/docs/4.1/authentication">authentication documentation</a> for more info.</p>
<p>The first step is to change the authenticator value in auth.js from <code>session</code> to <code>jwt</code>. </p>
<pre><code> - authenticator: <span>'session'</span>,
 - authenticator: <span>'jwt'</span>,
</code></pre>
<p>Now, in the <code>routes.js</code> file, add routes for registration and login.</p>
<pre><code>  Route.post(<span>"register"</span>, <span>"UserController.register"</span>).middleware(<span>"guest"</span>);
  Route.post(<span>"login"</span>, <span>"UserController.login"</span>).middleware(<span>"guest"</span>);
</code></pre>
<h2 id="csrf-protection">CSRF Protection</h2>
<p>According to <a target="_blank" href="https://owasp.org/">OWAPS</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they’re currently authenticated.
CSRF attacks mainly apply to web forms (POST, PATCH, DELETE) and pages (GET). Here's a <a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/10741650/10939384">StackOverflow answer</a> further explaining this. Learn more about CSRF from this video.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since we are purely building APIs we won't have to worry about CSRF, so we can safely disable it. In <code>shield.js</code>, set the <code>enable</code> key of the <code>csrf</code> field to false. </p>
<pre><code>  
  <span>csrf</span>: {
    - enable: <span>true</span>,
    + enable: <span>false</span>,
    <span>methods</span>: [<span>'POST'</span>, <span>'PUT'</span>, <span>'DELETE'</span>],
    <span>filterUris</span>: [],
    <span>cookieOptions</span>: {
      <span>httpOnly</span>: <span>false</span>,
      <span>sameSite</span>: <span>true</span>,
      <span>path</span>: <span>'/'</span>,
      <span>maxAge</span>: <span>7200</span>
    }
  }
</code></pre>
<h2 id="auth-routes">Auth routes</h2>
<p>We will start API versioning right from the start. Create an auth group with two POST requests.</p>
<pre><code>Route.group(<span>() =&gt;</span> {
  Route.post(<span>"register"</span>, <span>"UserController.register"</span>).middleware(<span>"guest"</span>);
  Route.post(<span>"login"</span>, <span>"UserController.login"</span>).middleware(<span>"guest"</span>);
}).prefix(<span>"api/v1"</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>These routes have a middleware("guest") attached to them. This means only requests without valid JWT will work. In essence, these routes are publicly exposed. Note the use of <code>UserController</code>. This means these routes will be handled by the register and login methods of the user controller which we will create in a bit.</p>
<h2 id="user-controller">User controller</h2>
<p>Create the user controller by running. Select HTTP requests when prompted.</p>
<pre><code>adonis make:controller User







</code></pre>
<p>You can shorten this to </p>
<pre><code>adonis make:controller User --<span>type</span>=http
</code></pre>
<p>We will add the register, login and other methods concerning the User model here.</p>
<h2 id="models-and-tables">Models and tables</h2>
<p>Adonis has a database provider called Lucid. Lucid is used for CRUD operations on tables. If you look into the <code>app/Models</code> directory, you will find two files: <code>User.js</code> and <code>Token.js</code>. These models represent database tables. Analysing the User model shows that this model extends the Model class which is from Lucid.</p>
<pre><code>
<span>const</span> Model = use(<span>"Model"</span>);

<span><span>class</span> <span>User</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Model</span> </span>{ ... }
</code></pre>
<p>Ideally, each table you create should be created from a model. We execute business logic in controllers using models to simplify CRUD operations. </p>
<h2 id="user-registration">User registration</h2>
<p>First, import the User Lucid model using this syntax.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> User = use(<span>"App/Models/User"</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>Add this method to the <code>UserController.js</code> file. Notice the auth, request and response destructured objects on the method. Unlike in ExpressJS, the auth method is available to all controller methods.</p>
<pre><code>  <span>async</span> register({ auth, request, response }) {
    <span>try</span> {
      <span>const</span> { email, password } = request.all();

      <span>const</span> user = <span>await</span> User.create({
        email,
        password,
      });

      <span>const</span> authedUser = <span>await</span> auth.withRefreshToken().attempt(email, password);
      <span>return</span> response.status(<span>201</span>).send(authedUser);
    } <span>catch</span> (error) {
      <span>console</span>.log(error);
      <span>return</span> response.status(<span>500</span>).send(error);
    }
  }
</code></pre>
<p>A user is created with <code>User.create</code> and is authenticated using their email and password. </p>
<h2 id="user-login">User login</h2>
<p>Add this method below the register method</p>
<pre><code>
  <span>async</span> login({ auth, request, response }) {
    <span>try</span> {
      <span>const</span> { email, password } = request.all();

      <span>const</span> authedUser = <span>await</span> auth.withRefreshToken().attempt(email, password);

      <span>return</span> response.status(<span>200</span>).send(authedUser);
    } <span>catch</span> (error) {
      <span>return</span> response.status(<span>404</span>).send(error);
    }
  }
</code></pre>
<p>Notice how insecure the API is? If a user loses their password, an attacker can perform malicious activities on the user's account. We can solve this by adding 2FA using email or adopting OAuth.</p>
<h2 id="validating-request-data">Validating request data</h2>
<h3 id="installing-adonisjsvalidator">Installing <a href="https://hashnode.com/@adonisjs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@adonisjs</a>/validator</h3>
<p>AdonisJS offers a first part package called <a target="_blank" href="https://indicative.adonisjs.com/guides/master/introduction">indicative</a> for handling validation. We can include it in our project using the <a href="https://hashnode.com/@adonisjs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@adonisjs</a>/validator package. Run this command to include it</p>
<pre><code>adonis install @adonisjs/validator



</code></pre>
<p>Notice the use of adonis install. It uses npm under the hood and runs some setup instructions within the package like opening setup instructions within in your browser. Now, add <code>@adonisjs/validator/providers/ValidatorProvider</code> to the <code>providers</code> array in <code>start/app.js</code>. Refer to the <a target="_blank" href="https://adonisjs.com/docs/4.1/validator#_setup">validator docs</a> for more info.</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-validation-in-usercontoller">Setting up validation in UserContoller</h3>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://adonisjs.com/docs/4.1/validator#_validatealldata_rules_messages_formatter">validateAll</a> method helps us validate all fields before resolving. Require <code>validateAll</code> in <code>UserController.js</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> { validateAll } = use(<span>"Validator"</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>Here are three steps for handling validation. Add them to the <code>register()</code> method:</p>
<ol>
<li>Define rules<pre><code>   <span>const</span> rules = {
     <span>email</span>: <span>"required|email|unique:users,email"</span>,
     <span>password</span>: <span>"required|min:8"</span>
   };
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Validate request data <pre><code>  <span>const</span> validation = <span>await</span> validateAll(request.all(), rules);
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Return validation errors if any<pre><code>   <span>if</span> (validation.fails()) {
     <span>return</span> response.status(<span>400</span>).send(validation.messages());
   }
</code></pre>
Ensure you do all these above the user creation.<pre><code>   <span>const</span> user = <span>await</span> User.create({
     email,
     password,
   });
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Follow the same steps for login method but use these rules instead.</p>
<pre><code>      <span>const</span> rules = {
        <span>email</span>: <span>"required|email"</span>,
        <span>password</span>: <span>"required"</span>,
      };
</code></pre>
<h2 id="testing-what-we-have-so-far">Testing what we have so far</h2>
<p>Ensure your server is running. Test the /register and /login routes using your favourite API testing app. </p>
<p>Here's what a successful registration will return </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1606405816377/4cJi6D-mu.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="successful-registration.png"></p>
<p>And here' a registration attempt with error messages should look like</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1606405828548/p6s6-Gieb.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="errors-on-registration.png"></p>
<p>Notice how the errors are returned as JSON. It is up to you to either modify these error messages to suit the API consumer or return them as is. </p>
<h2 id="getting-a-users-profile-where-auth-comes-into-play">Getting a user's profile (where auth comes into play)</h2>
<p>To get a user's profile, we first add the GET route in routes.js </p>
<pre><code>  Route.get(<span>"/users/profile"</span>, <span>"UserController.show"</span>).middleware([<span>"auth"</span>]);
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that this route has the auth middleware attached. An error will be thrown for requests without a valid JWT token. Add this show method to UserController.js.</p>
<pre><code>  <span>async</span> show({ auth, response }) {
    <span>try</span> {
      <span>const</span> user = <span>await</span> auth.user;
      <span>return</span> response.status(<span>200</span>).send(user);
    } <span>catch</span> (error) {
      <span>return</span> response.status(<span>500</span>).send(error);
    }
  }
</code></pre>
<p>To test the GET <code>/users/profile</code> route, we add the JWT obtained from registration or login to the Authorization request header. In postman, we do this in the Auth tab.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1606411707256/cwy0a7bT3.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="auth-steps.png"></p>
<h2 id="handling-profile-update">Handling profile update</h2>
<p>A user must be authenticated to update their profile. We have several routes handling profile updates. </p>
<ol>
<li>/users/profile</li>
<li>/users/email</li>
<li>/users/password</li>
</ol>
<p>I'll handle the first and second. You can attempt the third on your own. You can always check what I did in the <code>authentication</code> branch of this <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/vicradon/cgpa-api">repo</a> for the complete code.</p>
<p>First things first, add these routes to your routes.js file. </p>
<pre><code>  Route.patch(<span>"/users/profile"</span>, <span>"UserController.updateProfile"</span>).middleware([
    <span>"auth"</span>,
  ]);
  Route.patch(<span>"/users/email"</span>, <span>"UserController.updateEmail"</span>).middleware([
    <span>"auth"</span>,
  ]);
  Route.patch(<span>"/users/password"</span>, <span>"UserController.updatePassword"</span>).middleware([
    <span>"auth"</span>,
  ]);
</code></pre>
<h3 id="profile-update">Profile update</h3>
<p>We will use the method below to update a user's profile.</p>
<pre><code>  <span>async</span> updateProfile({ auth, request, response }) {
    <span>try</span> {
      <span>const</span> { firstName, lastName } = request.all();
      <span>const</span> rules = {
        <span>firstName</span>: <span>"required"</span>,
        <span>lastName</span>: <span>"required"</span>,
      };
      <span>const</span> validation = <span>await</span> validateAll(request.all(), rules);

        <span>return</span> response.status(<span>400</span>).send(validation.messages());
      }

      <span>const</span> user = <span>await</span> auth.user;
      user.firstName = firstName;
      user.lastName = lastName;

      <span>await</span> user.save();
      <span>return</span> response.status(<span>200</span>).send(user);
    } <span>catch</span> (error) {
      <span>return</span> response.status(<span>500</span>).send(error);
    }
  }
</code></pre>
<p>Profile here refers to firstName and lastName. We can always more fields later using migrations. Notice how we used <code>user.save()</code> to persist the changed values to the DB. Adonis figures if it's going to create a new row or update an existing one.</p>
<p>On successful update, you should have a response similar to.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1606410055582/lJmNZ_laP.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="undesirable-fields.png"></p>
<p>Notice the password, created_at and updated_at fields. These fields are unnecessary, especially the password field. We exclude these fields from being returned by adding a hidden getter to the User model.</p>
<pre><code>  <span>static</span> <span>get</span> <span>hidden</span>() {
    <span>return</span> [<span>"password"</span>, <span>"created_at"</span>, <span>"updated_at"</span>, <span>"id"</span>];
  }
</code></pre>
<p>You may want to exclude the id also. </p>
<h3 id="email-update">Email update</h3>
<p>To update email, we follow the same steps as above. Only diff here are the rules</p>
<pre><code>      <span>const</span> rules = {
        <span>email</span>: <span>"required|email|unique:users,email"</span>,
      };
</code></pre>
<p>and the save logic</p>
<pre><code>      <span>const</span> user = <span>await</span> auth.user;
      user.email = email;

      <span>await</span> user.save();
</code></pre>
<h3 id="password-update">Password update</h3>
<p>You can handle the logic for new password however you wish. Here's a snippet for verifying that the current password matches the new one.</p>
<pre><code>      <span>const</span> passwordsMatch = <span>await</span> Hash.verify(currentPassword, user.password)

      <span>if</span> (!passwordsMatch) {
        <span>return</span> response.status(<span>400</span>).send(<span>"Supplied password is wrong"</span>);
      }
</code></pre>
<p>Hash is part of built-in Adonis helpers. Ensure you require Hash using. </p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> Hash = use(<span>"Hash"</span>);

<p>I have to admit, my research blog posts are getting longer and longer. From one
side I find it genuinely encouraging, because if one gets so much information
just by scratching the topic, imagine what’s hidden beneath the surface! One
university professor once said “what could be interesting in databases?”, and
it turns out freaking a lot! On the other side it certainly poses problems for
potential readers. To overcome them I would suggest an interesting approach:
print this blog post out, or open it on your tablet/e-reader, where you can
make notes with a pencil or markers. Now while reading it try to spot ideas
particularly exciting for you and mark them. Along the way there would be
definitely some obscure parts or questions, write them on the sides as well.
You can experiment with the diagrams, changing or extending them, or just
drawing funny faces. But do not read everything at once, have no fear of
putting it aside for a while, and read in chunks that are convenient for you.
Some parts could be skipped as the text is build out of relatively independent
topics. The table of contents can help and guide you. Having said that we’re
ready to embark on the journey.</p>

<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Whenever we speak about indexes, especially in PostgreSQL context, there is a
lot to talk about: B-tree, Hash, GiST, SP-GiST, GIN, BRIN, RUM. But what if I
tell you that even the first item in this list alone hiding astonishing number
of interesting details and years of research? In this blog post I’ll try to
prove this statement, and we will be concerned mostly with B-tree as a data
structure.</p>
<p><img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/btree-joke.png" width="80%"></p>

<p>Let’s start systematically and take a look at the definition first:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and
allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic
time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is your first association with the concept of B-tree? Mine is “old and
well researched, or in other words boring”. And indeed apparently it was first
introduced in <a href="https://infolab.usc.edu/csci585/Spring2010/den_ar/indexing.pdf">1970</a>! Not only that, already in 1979 they
were <a href="http://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~ad/M149/ubiquitous_btree.pdf">ubiquitous</a>. Does it mean there is nothing exciting left any
more? Once upon a time I came across a remarkable read called
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1561/1900000028">Modern B-Tree techniques</a> which inspired me to dig
deeper into the topic and read bunch of shiny new whitepapers. Afterwards
totally by chance I’ve stumbled upon a book “Database Internals: A Deep Dive
into How Distributed Data Systems Work”, which contains great sections on
B-tree design. Both works were the triggers to write this blog post. What was I
saying about nothing exciting left? At the end I couldn’t be more wrong.</p>
<p>It turns out that there are multitude of interesting ideas and techniques
around B-Trees. They’re all coming from the desire to satisfy different (often
incompatible) needs, as well as adapt to emerging hardware. To demonstrate how
many of those exist, lets play a game. Below you can find a table of names I’ve
found in various science papers, together with a couple of silly names I’ve
come up myself. Can you find out the fake ones?</p>
<table>

</table>

<p>Any ideas? Well, I have a confession to make – all of them are real, I just
don’t have enough imagination to come up with such names. Having this in mind
hopefully you understand that if we want to make a survey, the first step would
be to establish some classification. Not only this will help us to structure
the material, but also will explain why on earth anyone would need to invent so
many variations of what we though was so simple!</p>
<h2 id="2-rum-conjecture">2. RUM conjecture</h2>
<p>To classify different index access methods we need to think about the following
ambitious question – is there anything common between almost any index access
method? The authors of <a href="https://stratos.seas.harvard.edu/files/stratos/files/rum.pdf">RUM conjecture</a> provide an interesting
insight about this topic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fundamental challenges that every researcher, systems architect, or
designer faces when designing a new access method are how to minimize, i)
read times, ii) update cost , and iii) memory (or storage) overhead.</p>
<p>In this paper, we conjecture that when optimizing the read-update-memory
overheads, optimizing in any two areas negatively impacts the third</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This essentially states that if an index access method could be specified as a
point inside “Read”, “Update” (on the Fig. 1 it’s called “Write” for
convenience of drawing), “Memory” space we can observe an interesting
invariant. Every time we modify one index access method to have less overhead
for reading or memory footprint (i.e. shift the corresponding point closer to
“Read”/”Memory” corners), we inevitably loose on the updating workload (i.e.
getting further away from “Write” corner).</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/rum.png" width="50%">

</figure>
<p>In fact as a non-scientist I would even speculate that there should be another
dimension called “Complexity”, but the idea is still clear. I will try to show
this invariant at work via examples in this blog post, but it already gives us
some ground under the feet and opportunity to visually represent different
versions of B-tree by moving point on the triangle back and forth. But first
let’s recall the basics.</p>
<h2 id="3-b-tree-basics">3. B-tree basics</h2>
<p>So what is B-tree? Well, it’s a tree data structure: a root node, some number
of branch nodes (marked grey) and a bunch of leaf nodes (marked green):</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/btree.png" width="100%">
<br>
<figcaption>
Fig 2. B-tree nodes arrangement
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Every node of this tree is usually a page of some certain size and contains
keys (shaded slices of a node) and pointers to other nodes (empty slices with
arrows). Keys on page are kept in sorted order to facilitate fast search within
a page.</p>
<p>The original B-tree design assumed to have user data in all nodes,
branch and leaf. But nowadays the standard approach is a variation called
B<sup>+</sup>-tree, where user data is present only in leaf nodes and branch
nodes contains separator keys (pivot tuples in PostgreSQL terminology). In this
way separation between branch and leave nodes become more strict, allowing
better flexibility for choosing format of former and making deletion operations
can affect only latter. In fact the original B-tree design is barely worth
mentioning these days and I’m doing this just to be precise. Since
B<sup>+</sup>-tree is sort of default design, we’ll use B-tree and
B<sup>+</sup>-tree interchangeably in this text from now on. An interesting
thing to mention here is that the only requirements for separator keys is to
guide search algorithm to a correct leaf node. As long as they fulfil this
condition they can contain anything, no other requirements exist.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, only child pointers are truly necessary in this design, but
quite often databases also maintain additional neighbour pointers, e.g. what you
can see on the Fig. 2 between the leaf nodes. It could be helpful for some
operations like index scan, but need to be taken into account for node
split/merge operations. PostgreSQL uses <a href="https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy460/pdf/p650-lehman.pdf">Lehman-Yao</a> version,
called B<sub>link</sub>-tree, with links to both left and right sibling nodes
(the left link one is actually not presented in the original
B<sub>link</sub>-tree design, and it makes backward scan somewhat interesting),
and there are even implementations like WiredTiger with
<a href="https://github.com/wiredtiger/wiredtiger/blob/f08bc4b18612ef95a39b12166abcccf207f91596/src/include/btmem.h#L550">parent pointers</a>.</p>
<p>Having all this in place one can perform a search query by following the path
marked red on the Fig. 2, first hitting the root, finding a proper separator
key, following a downlink and landing on a correct page where we deploy binary
search to find the resulting key.</p>
<p>Until now, we were talking only about static parts of B-tree design, but of
course there is more to it. For example there is one dynamic aspect of much
importance (quite often it even scares developers like a nightmare), namely
page splits. What do we need to do when there is a new value to insert, but the
target page does not have enough space like on the following diagram?</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/page-split-1.png" width="60%">
<br>
<figcaption>
Fig 3. B-tree page split (a)
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>What happens here is we’re trying to insert the new value (shaded box) into the
page with not enough space for it. To maintain the three balanced we need to
allocate another leaf page, distribute keys between old and new leaf, promote a
new separator key into the parent page and update all required links
(left/right siblings if present):</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://erthalion.info/public/img/page-split-2.png" width="60%">
<br>
<figcaption>
Fig 4. B-tree page split (b)
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Curiously enough the new separator key could be chosen freely, it could be any
value as long as it separates both pages. We can see what does it change in the
optimization section.</p>
<p>Locking is obviously an important part of a page split. No one wants to end up
with concurrency issues when pages get updated while in the middle of a split,
so a page to be split is write-locked as well as e.g. right sibling to update
left-link if present.</p>
<p>As you can see, page splits are introducing performance overhead. We need to
bring in a new page, move elements around and everything should be consistent
and correctly locked. And already at this pretty much basic point we already
can see some interesting trade-offs. For example B*-tree modification tries to
rebalance data between neighbouring nodes to postpone page split as long as
possible. In terms of trade-offs it looks like a balance between complexity and
insert overhead.</p>
<p>I didn’t tell you everything about B<sub>link</sub>-tree and it’s going to be our next
topic example in this section. Not only Lehman-Yao version adds a link to the
neighbour, it also introduces a “high key” to each page, which is an upper bound
on the keys that are allowed on page. While obviously introducing a bit memory
overhead those two changes make it possible to detect a concurrent page split
by checking the page high key, which allows the tree to be searched …</p></div></div>

      <p> <em>Published: </em> 11/28/2020</p>

      <p>I’m not fat. There I said it, I should feel better about myself, right? Size is just a number. Right? Come on you know it’s true, size, weight and all that jazz is just a BS figure on the scale. That’s what we tell ourselves to make us feel better.</p>

<p>I’m obese, my medical BMI is 42.0. I’m 335 pounds. As Penn Jillette would say, I’m a “fat fuck”. I’m tired of being a “fat fuck” or as my wife prefers a “big guy”.</p>



<p>I’m an audiobook guy. I’m in love with Audible, she is very wonderful service to have, she reads to me every day, all day. About two weeks ago, I was bored, and she suggested Presto, a book by Penn Jillette about how he lost 100 pounds. I was bored, lazy and waiting for someone so I bought the book. Oh my gosh, the language is obscene, but the author is hilarious and entertaining. I could not put the book down. It made me want to toss the skinny white peppermint mocha and bananas in the trash…</p>

<p>Basically, Penn is a obese guy like me, well he was, he was 330 pounds at his highest. He went to the hospital for heart issues and nearly died. On a fist full of pills to keep his blood pressure less than the voltage of an outlet in Europe he embarked on a crazy, all in diet consisting of potatoes for two weeks. I like his style, he’s an all or nothing guy like me. Either give me the steak, the ice cream and the sides or give me nothing. I want to eat big; I want to live big. Moderation is bullshit as Penn would say, I would agree! I don’t do anything in moderation. If I’m going to do something, it’s all-in baby. When in Vegas last summer, I was the dipshit who went all in with a pair of kings in my hand and straight on the table; that’s me baby, not the smartest guy but hey I like to live it big.</p>

<p>I don’t do keto, I don’t do paleo, but when I do diet, I go really big, I go to Costco and literally buy everything I need to be successful on that plan, I research, I plan. It’s just like thanksgiving this year; I researched, I planned, I went to Costco and planned out each and every ingredient. I was diligent. Every doctor, health coach and fitness instructor has told me that my relationship with food is fucked up. Well, not fucked up, but bad; unhealthy. As Penn would say your life sucks if you’re taking diet advice from a Las Vegas Magician, well, Penn, my life does suck. I can’t breathe outside very well, hell, I get windy walking to the park. I’m an obese guy, I have a CPAP machine, I’m 335 pounds, I can barely do the things I want to do, basic stuff; sleep and wake rested, eat and not feel sick, go for a walk and not get winded. I’m half Penn’s age and his same weight… It’s time for a change.</p>



<p>The plan according to Penn’s buddy, Cray Ray, aka “Ray Cronise” is to do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Eat nothing but potatoes for two weeks. Boiled, baked, steamed, roasted; does not matter, just no salt, oil, or sugar. Plain, nothing added, no salt, no butter, no pepper, no olive oil, just a plain, boring potato. Sweet, red, yellow, gold, purple, do not be a racist pig about potatoes, eat the potato rainbow, but just potatoes. Feel free to pig out on potatoes; just no fries or chips, that’s the beautiful potato ruined by Americans</li>
  <li>Contrast showers: Humans have conquered winter &amp; cold. Therefore, in order to get back to the biologically true lifestyle we’ve grown as a species as, we need to bring back the cold. Turn down the thermostat and cycle 10 seconds hot; 30 seconds cold showers for 5 minutes. It’s brutal but the time goes by shockingly fast</li>
  <li>After two weeks on potatoes, you go to a plant based, vegan lifestyle until you hit your target weight</li>
</ol>



<p>One big thing with CrayRay and Penn is the need for a scale, the smartass of scales. On an impluse I plopped down $100 for the <a href="https://www.withings.com/us/en/body-plus">Withings Body + scale</a>. It’s been 10 days! 10 DAYS!!! I’m 326.4, on day 2 of the plan. In 10 days, 1 of which involving nothing but potatoes, I’ve lost 9 pounds. This is AMAZING.</p>

<p>On day 1, it’s black Friday, or sucker day of the year. Everyone piles in their car after a Thanksgiving Day hang over consisting of pie and turkey, to go buy more stuff to stuff into their garage in six months. It’s all American in style and glory. What am I do? Well, shopping for TVs on Amazon like every other fat guy scared out of his mind of COVID-19. I’m sitting on my couch waiting for the oven, 350 degrees for 45 minutes, to produce 9 potatoes. That’s right 9 potatoes, or about 1000 ish calories. Once done cooking, I scarf down one single sweet potato. It’s sweet (no shit sherlock), delicious and surprisingly moist. I like it, I chase it with 4 tiny petite potatoes and some black coffee. This diet is sure boring.</p>

<p>Lunch time rolls around and I make some food for the kiddo and thanksgiving dinner for lunch for the wife. What do I have? If you guessed potatoes, you’d win the prize! I had 2 potatoes, a red and white. It was bland, boring and good.</p>

<p>A car ride nap, so more black coffee and about 2 liters of water later, we’re sitting down to dinner. I made peanut noodles for the wife, mac and cheese with some TG leftovers for the baby. I have 3 more potatoes, a gold, a red and a sweet potato. 2 potatoes into the meal, I’m stuffed. STUFFED ON TWO POTATOES?!?!??! Yeah, I save the sweet potato for dessert and decide to count my potatoes.</p>

<p>A few days ago, while prepping for thanksgiving, I bought 10 pounds of potatoes. I thought that was a LOT of potatoes, but when I counted it out I had around 20 potatoes left. That’s enough to feed a family a four a potato a night for a week, but for a guy living on potatoes? It’s more like two days if I’m lucky, so I head to Costco.</p>

<p>I love Costco. Everything there is a deal, no matter what the idiots on Life Hacker tell you. I love their steak, their fruit and yes, I love their clothes and bedding. But potatoes, that’s where you really make off like bandits. The potatoes were on sale today too.</p>

<p>I knew to continue the diet I needed to account for 14 days of potatoes, less today and the 1.5 I had in revere; thus, I knew I need about 12 (rounding up) days of potatoes. I’m supposed to be on a calorie restricted diet of 1800 or less per day, which is helping, but to get 1800 calories a day eating just potatoes, I’d need to consume 5 POUNDS of potatoes. That’s right, every day on this thing to hit target calorie intake I’d need 5 POUNDS!?!?!? So, with 12 days needed to be shopped, a total of 60 pounds of potatoes, I headed to Costco.</p>

<p>That’s a lot of potatoes! The berries are for my son, Luke, for him to eat with yogurt and breakfast for the next two weeks. Not pictured is the bottles of the sparkling water I got to enhance my diet this week.</p>



<p>If you don’t want to see me shirtless, it’s time to close the page. My starting stats on 11/20/2020 are: 335 LBS, but the offical, diet starting stats are: 333.4 lbs, BMI of 41.7. I’ll be updating this blog with progress, but here’s to my weightloss and success.</p>

<p>I’m off to eat more potatoes!</p>

		<div>
						<p>The NYT describes “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/13/magazine/free-speech.html">The Problem of Free Speech in an Age of Disinformation</a>, and in response Hacker News commenter <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24813749">throwaway13337</a> says, in part, “It’s not unchecked free speech. Instead, it’s unchecked curation by media and social media companies with the goal of engagement.” There’s some truth to the idea that social media companies have evolved to seek engagement, rather than truth, but I think the social media companies are reflecting a deeper human tendency. I wrote back to throwaway13337: “Try teaching non-elite undergrads, and particularly assignments that require some sense of epistemology, and you’ll discover that the vast majority of people have pretty poor personal epistemic hygiene—it’s not much required in most people, most of the time, in most jobs.”</p>
<p>From what I can tell, we evolved to form tribes, not to be “right:” Jonathan’s Haidt’s <a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2012/03/25/jonathan-haidts-the-righteous-mind-and-what-were-really-arguing-about/"><em>The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion</em></a> deals with this topic well and at length, and I’ve not seen any substantial rebuttals of it. We don’t naturally take to tracking the question, “How do I know what I know?” Instead, we naturally seem to want to find “facts” or ideas that support our preexisting views. In the HN comment thread, someone asked for specific examples of poor undergrad epistemic hygiene, and while I’d prefer not to get super specific for reasons of privacy, I’ve had many conversations that take the following form: “How do you know article x is accurate?” “Google told me.” “How does Google work?” “I don’t know.” “What does it take to make a claim on the Internet.” “Um. A phone, I guess?” A lot of people—maybe most—will uncritically take as fact whatever happens to be served up by Google (it’s always Google and never Duck Duck Go or Bing), and most undergrads whose work I’ve read will, again uncritically, accept clickbait sites and similar as accurate. Part of the reason for this reasoning is that undergrads’s lives are minimally affected by being wrong or incomplete about some claim done in a short assignment that’s being imposed by some annoying professor toff standing between them and their degree.</p>
<p>The gap between elite information discourse and everyday information discourse, even among college students, who may be more sophisticated than their peer equivalents, is vast—so vast that I don’t think most journalists (who mostly talk to other journalists and to experts) and to other people who work with information, data, and ideas really truly understand it. We’re all living in bubbles. I don’t think I did, either, before I saw the epistemic hygiene most undergrads practice, or don’t practice. This is not a “kids these days” rant, either: many of them have never really been taught to ask themselves, “How do I know what I know?” Many have never really learned anything about the scientific method. It’s not happening much in most non-elite schools, so where are they going to get epistemic hygiene from?</p>
<p>The United States alone has 320 million people in it. Table DP02 in the Census at data.census.gov estimates that 20.3% of the population age 25 and older has a college bachelor’s degree, and 12.8% have a graduate or professional degree. Before someone objects, let me admit that a college degree is far from a perfect proxy for epistemic hygiene or general knowledge, and some high school dropouts perform much better at cognition, meta cognition, statistical reasoning, and so forth, than do some people with graduate degrees. With that said, though, a college degree is probably a decent approximation for baseline abstract reasoning skills and epistemic hygiene.</p>
<p>Almost anyone who wants a megaphone in the form of one of the many social media platforms available now has one. The number of people motivated by questions like “What is really true, and how do I discern what is really true? How do I enable myself to get countervailing data and information into my view, or worldview, or worldviews?” is not zero, again obviously, but it’s not a huge part of the population. And many very “smart” people in an IQ sense use their intelligence to build better rationalizations, rather than to seek truth (and I may be among the rationalizers: I’m not trying to exclude myself from that category).</p>
<p>Until relatively recently, almost everyone with a media megaphone had some kind of training or interest in epistemology, even they didn’t call it “epistemology.” Editors would ask, “How do you know that?” or “Who told you that?” or that sort of thing. Professors have systems that are supposed to encourage greater-than-average epistemic hygiene (these systems were not and are not perfect, and nothing I have written so far implies that they were or are).</p>
<p>Most people don’t care about the question, “How do you know what you know?” are fairly surprised if it’s asked, implicitly or explicitly. Some people are intrigued by it but most aren’t, and view questions about sources and knowledge to be a hindrance. This is less likely to be true of people who aspire to be researchers or work in other knowledge-related professions, but that describes only a small percentage of undergraduates, particularly at non-elite schools. And the “elite schools” thing drives a lot of the media discourse around education. One of the things I like about Professor X’s book <a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2011/06/10/summary-judgement-in-the-basement-of-the-ivory-tower-confessions-of-an-accidental-academic-professor-x/"><em>In the Basement of the Ivory Tower</em></a> is how it functions as a corrective to that discourse.</p>
<p>For most people, floating a factually incorrect conspiracy theory online isn’t going to negatively affect their lives. If someone is a nurse and gives a patient a wrong medication or incorrect medication, that person is not going to be a nurse for long. If the nurse states or repeats a factually incorrect political or social idea online, particularly but not exclusively under a pseudonym, that nurse’s life likely won’t be affected. There’s no truth feedback loop. The same is true for someone working in, say, construction, or engineering, or many other fields. The person is free to state things that are factually incorrect, or incomplete, or misleading, and doing so isn’t going to have many negative consequences. Maybe it will have some positive consequences: one way to show that you’re really on team x is to state or repeat falsehoods that show you’re on team x, rather than on team “What is really true?”</p>
<p>I don’t want to get into daily political discourse, since that tends to raise defenses and elicit anger, but the last eight months have demonstrated many people’s problems with epistemology, and in a way that can have immediate, negative personal consequences—but not for everyone.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/09/26/who-doesnt-read-books-in-america/">Pew Research data indicate that a quarter of US adults didn’t read a book in 2018</a>; this is consistent with <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/12/24/twilight-of-the-books">other data</a> indicating that about half of US adults read zero or one books per year. Again, yes, there are surely many individuals who read other materials and have excellent epistemic hygiene, but this is a reasonable mass proxy, given the demands that reading makes on us.</p>
<p>Many people driving the (relatively) elite discourse don’t realize how many people are not only not like them, but wildly not like them, along numerous metrics. It may also be that <a href="http://www.arnoldkling.com/blog/gossip-at-scale/">we don’t know how to deal with gossip at scale</a>. Interpersonal gossip is all about personal stories, while many problems at scale are best understood through data—but the number of people deeply interested in data and data’s veracity is small. And elite discourse has some of its own possible epistemic falsehoods, or at least uncertainties, embedded within it: some of the populist rhetoric against elites is rooted in truth.</p>
<p>A surprisingly large number of freshmen don’t know the difference between fiction and nonfiction, or that novels are fiction. Not a majority, but I was surprised when I first encountered confusion around these points; I’m not any longer. I don’t think the majority of freshmen confuse fiction and nonfiction, or genres of nonfiction, but enough do for the confusion to be a noticeable pattern (modern distinctions between fiction and nonfiction only really arose, I think, during the Enlightenment and the rise of the novel in the 18th Century, although off the top of my head I don’t have a good citation for this historical point, apart perhaps from Ian Watt’s work on the novel). Maybe online systems like Twitter or Facebook allow average users to revert to an earlier mode of discourse in which the border between fiction and nonfiction is more porous, and the online systems have strong fictional components that some users don’t care to segregate.</p>
<p>We are all caught in our bubble, and the universe of people is almost unimaginably larger than the number of people in our bubble. If you got this far, you’re probably in a nerd bubble: usually, anything involving the word “epistemology” sends people to sleep or, alternately, scurrying for something like “You won’t believe what this celebrity wore/said/did” instead. Almost no one wants to consider epistemology; to do so as a hobby is rare. One person’s disinformation is another person’s teambuilding. If you think the preceding sentence is in favor of disinformation, by the way, it’s not.</p>

<p>They told me, “You have to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhThso-PE_o">this interview where Mike Tyson talks about medieval history</a>,” and so I did, and there he was at the New York Public Library in 2013 being interviewed by curator Paul Holdengräber, whose German accent strikes the American ear as both effortlessly intellectual and lightly amusing, and who would seem to have nothing in common with the face-tattooed boxer.</p>



<p><img data-attachment-id="12067" data-permalink="https://quidplura.com/2020/11/29/and-this-worlds-a-fickle-measure/screen-shot-2020-11-28-at-11-57-11-pm-copy/" data-orig-file="https://quidplurablog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/screen-shot-2020-11-28-at-11.57.11-pm-copy.jpg" data-orig-size="1816,934" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="Screen Shot 2020-11-28 at 11.57.11 PM copy" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://quidplurablog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/screen-shot-2020-11-28-at-11.57.11-pm-copy.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://quidplurablog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/screen-shot-2020-11-28-at-11.57.11-pm-copy.jpg?w=863" src="https://quidplurablog.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/screen-shot-2020-11-28-at-11.57.11-pm-copy.jpg" alt=""></p>



<p>The two men do, in fact, find much to talk about. Their discussion is mesmerizing, because to most of us Mike Tyson is nothing but a face and fists, not a man who reflects aloud and at length about his inner life. Holdengräber prompts a reticent Tyson to narrate clips of his greatest moments in the ring, and newcomers to boxing will easily see why Tyson was such a sensation, but Iron Mike grows more animated when other matters arise.</p>



<p>Half an hour into the interview, Holdengräber says that their mutual friend, eccentric German filmmaker Werner Herzog, urged him to ask Tyson why he’s so fascinated by Clovis, the founder of the Merovingian Frankish dynasty, and Pepin the Short, the first Carolingian king of the Franks. Tyson’s answer, however halting, makes him come alive: </p>



<blockquote><p>I don’t know—it all comes from my insecurity from being poor, and not having enough—to be insecure, and being—yeah, that’s what it is: obscure. I never wanted to be obscure. I was born in obscurity and I never wanted to deal with that again, never wanted to be that. And they came from obscurity.</p></blockquote>



<p>Tyson then narrates a capsule history of the Frankish kings. He rambles, he doesn’t get all the details right, and his mispronunciation of names marks him as an autodidact, but it’s a shame to hear the audience laugh when Holdengräber asks, “Mike, how do you know all this shit?” Whether Tyson is mapping his own experiences onto medieval history or hearing echoes of the Franks in his troubled life, the credentialed, status-conscious audience is uncomfortable with his sincere interest in a past they find trivial.</p>



<p>Yet Tyson is the real deal, a book lover not because his peer group yaks about whichever author the <em>New York Times</em> has dubbed fame’s latest love child, but because he’s hungry for ideas, for meaning, for connections across time. He speaks with undisguised emotion about Cus D’Amato, the trainer and manager who turned him into a lethal boxer. Obsessed with Nietzsche and Clausewitz, D’Amato taught Tyson to see boxing as war and war as the key to decoding the world. “That is just what I do,” Tyson explains, an attentive pupil and dutiful son. “I love war. I love the act of war. I love the players in war, the philosophy of war.”</p>



<p>Tyson is searching for more than war on the pages of the past. Having grown up amid crime and chaos and founded his life on violence, he now relies on books to make moral and ethical sense of the world:</p>



<blockquote><p>Yeah—they’re our most priceless possessions, because if you think about it, you know, a room without a book is like a body without a soul. It’s the only way that we can connect the future with the past. Without that, there’s no way that we can know about the future, and know about particularly the past, or the present, you know, that when you think about history, the value of history is not necessarily scientific but moral. By liberating our minds and deepening our sympathies and fortifying our will, we can control—pretty much history allows us to control not society but ourselves, which is a much more important thing to do, you know what I mean? And it would allow us to pretty much meet the future more so than foretell it, and for that reason alone, in order to predict the future we always have to look through the past, because very rarely does time not repeat itself, and it always will repeat itself. </p><p>I’ve heard a quote before in a book that we would be fools to think historically that the past is us in funny clothes, but the past <em><span>is</span></em> us in funny clothes, and that’s truly what it is. That’s from somebody who really said a really profound statement but he misquoted what he was saying, he must have been saying it backwards, because that’s really what the past was, it’s just us in funny clothes, in different times, that’s really what it is.</p></blockquote>



<p>Of course, to hear Tyson cite <a href="http://thecampvs.com/2011/08/03/cicero-on-books-and-the-soul/">a quip inaccurately attributed to Cicero</a>, “a room without books is like a body without a soul,” is to wonder if he’s putting us on. Late in the interview, he jokes that if you quote books, you fool people into thinking you’re smart—but Tyson, for all his malapropisms and mispronunciations and odd mannerisms, <em>is</em> intelligent. He’s going round after round with big questions that  many of the ostensibly educated attendees at his book-talk don’t bother to ask.</p>



<p>When Holdengräber suggests that Tyson’s knowledge of history didn’t improve his behavior, Tyson calmly disagrees. He compares himself to the fictional Ben-Hur, a fellow athlete and celebrity who achieved glory but was doomed to be unfree until he set his priorities in order: “He may not have been famous again,” Tyson points out, “but he got his family, and that was his success.” </p>



<p>After listening to Mike Tyson—childhood criminal, devastating fighter, struggling alcoholic and recovering drug addict, convicted rapist, pop-culture eidolon—speak for an hour and a half, I still don’t quite know who he is. He may be the closest thing 21st-century America has to <a href="https://quidplura.com/2011/11/03/but-the-answers-you-seek-will-never-be-found-at-home/">a Robert E. Howard character</a>, a born barbarian who’s ignorant of social niceties but possesses earned wisdom that the civilization around him disdains. I don’t know whether he’s all in on his bookish pursuits or one slight away from again gnawing off someone’s ear. Whether he’s a good man or a bad man feels foolish to ask about a professional punch-thrower who reads Nietzsche, but Tyson looks like a <em>better</em> man, one who has perhaps searched harder for his humanity than the onlookers snickering from the safety of their library seats. What has their pride gained them? Tyson’s, by contrast, has brought him perspective, and with it the humility to admit that his story is still being written—and has been before.</p>

<div id="How-PyNNDescent-works">

<p>PyNNDescent uses neighbor graph based searching to efficiently find good candidates for the nearest neighbors of query points from a large training set. While the basic ideas turn out to be quite simple, the layers of refinements and tricks used to get the highest degree of efficiency complicate things a lot. With that in mind we will begin with the simple naive approach and gradually work out further refinements and details as we go. The core concept, upon which most everything else is based,
is using a nearest neighbor graph to perform a search for approximate nearest neighbors.</p>
<div id="Searching-using-a-nearest-neighbor-graph">
<h2>Searching using a nearest neighbor graph<a href="#Searching-using-a-nearest-neighbor-graph" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Suppose we are given a nearest neighbor graph (let’s ignore, for now, how we can have obtained such a thing without the ability to find nearest neighbors already). By a graph, I simply mean a network – a set of nodes connected by edges. By a nearest neighbor graph I mean that the graph has been derived from data existing in some sort of space for which we have a quantitative notion of similarity, or dissimilarity, or distance. In particular the graph is derived by making each data point a node
and connecting that data point, via edges, to the <span>\(k\)</span> most similar, least dissimilar, or closest other points. We would like to use this graph as an index structure for searching to find the nearest neighbors (points in the graph) of a new query point (potentially not a point in the graph) with respect to that notion of similarity of distance. How can we do this? We can do it via a kind of pruned breadth-first search of the graph, always keeping only the <span>\(k\)</span> best points we’ve found
so far. The algorithm, therefore, looks something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a starting node in the graph (potentially randomly) as a candidate node</li>
<li>Look at all nodes connected by an edge to the best untried candidate node in the graph</li>
<li>Add all these nodes to our potential candidate pool</li>
<li>Sort the candidate pool by closeness / similarity to the query point</li>
<li>Truncate the pool to <span>\(k\)</span> best (as in closest to the query) candidates</li>
<li>Return to step 2, unless we have already tried all the candidates in the pool</li>
</ol>
<p>We can see this play out visually on a small graph. For this case we will let <span>\(k=2\)</span> and have a 2-neighbor graph constructed by points in a plane. The query point will be drawn as an orange ‘x’. We then search, exactly as described, and find ourselves steadily traversing the graph towards the query point.</p>
<p>While that did indeed find the points closest to the query point, it was hardly more efficient than a linear search of all the points – there are only two points we didn’t try! This is ultimately about having such a small graph: while it is good for showing the algorithm clearly, the algorithm doesn’t really scale down that well to this case. If we want to see it providing benefits we’ll need a larger graph. That’s not hard to generate, so let’s see a larger example.</p>
<p>Now, with about as bad a start as we could hope to get, the algorithm efficiently traverses across the graph and find the neighbors of the orange query point, and this time we see that only a small fraction of the total number of points in the graph had to be tried. If we had been a little luckier with our start point we could have done significantly better again. We can scale up to even larger examples:</p>
<p>Again we had about as bad a starting point as possible, but again it very efficiently traverses the graph, steadily improving as it goes, until the algorithm eventually find the nearest neighbors of the orange query point. Notably the algorithm will continue to scale well as the number of points increases, and even as the dimension of the data increases – as long as the data itself has a low enough intrisic dimension.</p>
<p>There are, of course, several things that can be done to refine this algorithm to be a little more efficient, and more flexible at the same time. They include such things as keeping a hashtable of visited nodes to ensure you don’t compute distances twice, and keeping a slightly larger priority queue of candidate nodes to expand – anything with (1+:math:<cite>varepsilon</cite>) of the <span>\(k\)</span>th best candidate found so far will suffice. This latter point allows us greater flexibility in search,
allowing a degree of backtracking around local “optima” in the search. It also provides a parameter which we can tune to get a trade-off between the speed and accuracy that we desire: smaller epsilon gives a faster search, but less accuracy, while a large epsilon can give good accuracy but at the cost of a slower search.</p>
<p>All of this presumed, however, that we had a nearest neighbor graph to start with – the thing that we were using as our search index. The question remains: how are we to build that, since we could potentially just use the nearest neighbor search technique used to build the graph (which presumably has to be cheap) instead of the graph search described here. The answer, as it happens, is that we are going to use the graph search technique to build the graph itself – pulling ourselves up by our
own bootstraps so to speak.</p>
</div>
<div id="NNDescent-for-building-neighbor-graphs">
<h2>NNDescent for building neighbor graphs<a href="#NNDescent-for-building-neighbor-graphs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A good way to get to grips with the NNDescent algorithm for constructing approximate k-neighbor graphs is to think of it in terms of the search algorithm we’ve already described. Suppose we had a decent, but not exact, k-neighbor graph. We could use that graph as our search index – it won’t be great, and our search will be particularly approximate and often get stuck in local minima because of that, but it will still work a lot of the time. So, given that graph we could do a nearest neighbor
search, using that graph as the index, for each and every point in the dataset. Because of the nature of the search we could end up finding new neighbors for a node that are closer than the ones in our not-so-good graph. We could use that information to update our graph – make it better by using these newly found closer neighbors. Having improved the graph, we can run the search again for each and every point in the dataset. Since the graph is better we will do an even better job of finding
neighbors than before and potentially find some new neighbors that will let us update the graph again.</p>
<p>And that’s actually the core of the algorithm. Start with a bad graph, use the nearest neighbor search on that graph to get better neighbors, and make a better graph. Rinse, repeat, and eventually we will end up with a good graph. In fact, the better the graph is, the faster and more accurate the search will run. So each iteration will go faster than the last, and we will steadily converge toward the true k-neighbor graph.</p>
<p>There are a couple things to take note of at this point: a better graph results in a better search, so making a better graph sooner will help the search; finding a good initial candidate node for the search was generically a problem (our animations all had particularly bad initial candidates), but we can always use the point itself as the initial candidate since it is guaranteed to be in the graph. So, given a good initial candidate (the node itself), and a desire to update the graph as soon as
possible, it may not be worth running a full search to exhaustion. Instead we could run the search just far enough to potentially find some new neighbors that we haven’t seen before. The first round of search, starting from the node itself, will only find the neighbors we already have. The second round, however, will step out to neighbors of neighbors (friends of friends if you will), and potentially find some nodes that are closer neighbors than the ones currently in the graph. That would be
enough information to improve the graph – since we would have found new better neighbors. So the algorithm would now run:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with a random graph (connect each node to <span>\(k\)</span> random nodes)</li>
<li>For each node:</li>
<li>Measure the distance from the node to the neighbors of its neighbors</li>
<li>If any are closer then update the graph accordingly, and keep only the <span>\(k\)</span> closest</li>
<li>If any updates were made to the graph then go back to step 2, otherwise stop</li>
</ol>
<p>We can see this play out on some example data (the same data as the medium sized search example):</p>
<p>You can see the graph starts out looking nothing like a <span>\(k\)</span>-neighbors graph – just a mess of edges all over with no structure. Quickly, however, we update the graph, and the better the graph gets the better our updates go. After not very long at all the algorithm is simply refining an already very good graph with few, if any, updates at all actually occurring. We can see this most clearly by looking at things in terms of each round of iteration of the algorithm – consider the graph at
the point where we’ve updated neighbors for every node and we are at step 3, considering whether to loop back to step 2 or not. At each such iteration we can both look at the state of the graph and measure how close we are to the true <span>\(k\)</span>-neighbor graph. We start with a random graph:</p>
<!-- ![Iteration 0](how_pynn_works_naive_nndescent_iter0.png) --><p><a href="https://pynndescent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/how_pynn_works_naive_nndescent_iter0.png"><img alt="Iteration 0" src="https://pynndescent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/how_pynn_works_naive_nndescent_iter0.png"></a></p>
<p>After we have touched each node once and updated the neighbors based on the friends of friends we get the following:</p>
<!-- ![Iteration 1](how_pynn_works_naive_nndescent_iter1.png) --><p><a href="https://pynndescent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/how_pynn_works_naive_nndescent_iter1.png"><img alt="Iteration 1" src="https://pynndescent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/how_pynn_works_naive_nndescent_iter1.png"></a></p>
<p>Already, after just one pass through, the graph looks a whole lot less random. And, indeed, we have already improved from the sort of accuracy of neighbors we would expect at random, to a graph that has 30% of the neighbors correct for each node (on average). That is a much better graph for doing searches on than the purely random graph, so we would expect to be able to do a lot better when we do another iteration performing updates based on friends of friends in this new much better graph.</p>
<!-- ![Iteration 2](how_pynn_works_naive_nndescent_iter2.png) --><p><a href="https://pynndescent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/how_pynn_works_naive_nndescent_iter2.png"><img alt="Iteration 2" src="https://pynndescent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/how_pynn_works_naive_nndescent_iter2.png"></a></p>
<p>So now after just two passes we already have a graph that is 95% accurate! A search on this graph will be quite accurate, especially since we are guaranteed to be starting with a good candidate (the query itself). Running another pass should get a near perfect result.</p>
<!-- ![Iteration 3](how_pynn_works_naive_nndescent_iter3.png) --><p><a href="https://pynndescent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/how_pynn_works_naive_nndescent_iter3.png"><img alt="Iteration 3" src="https://pynndescent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/how_pynn_works_naive_nndescent_iter3.png"></a></p>
<p>The accuracy improved nicely, but you should note that visually there is very little difference between this graph and the previous graph. Very …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

<p>Drivers who block electric vehicle chargers in Victoria will be fined under new road rules. </p>
<p>Non-electric vehicles, or electric cars that aren’t plugged in to the charger, face fines of $330.44 for “stopping in a parking area for electric-powered vehicles”. </p>
<p>The rules are designed to stop electric vehicle chargers, which are sparse in some parts of Australia, from being blocked by drivers looking for a convenient spot to park their internal-combustion vehicle. </p>
<p>Similar rules have been implemented in American states such as Colorado to prevent what’s known as ICEing. </p>

<p>Although it has brought in new rules to protect electric vehicle drivers, Victoria has also made news for <a href="https://www.carexpert.com.au/car-news/victoria-aiming-to-raise-30-million-per-year-from-ev-road-tax">trying to tax them</a>. </p>
<p>The state has followed <a href="https://www.carexpert.com.au/car-news/south-australia-plans-ev-road-user-levy-but-also-pledges-to-buy-more-electric-cars-for-its-own-fleet">South Australia</a> in committing to a&nbsp;<strong>road tax for electric vehicle</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>plug-in hybrid vehicle</strong>&nbsp;owners.</p>
<p>The tax of&nbsp;<strong>2.5 cents per kilometre</strong>&nbsp;for pure electric vehicles and&nbsp;<strong>2.0 cents per kilometre</strong>&nbsp;for plug-in hybrid vehicles was announced by the Victorian Treasurer ahead of this week’s state budget, and will come into force in July 2021.</p>
<p>An electric vehicle owner who travels&nbsp;<strong>15,000km</strong>&nbsp;per year will be charged&nbsp;<strong>$375</strong>&nbsp;on top of their annual registration fee, while plug-in hybrid owners will pay an extra&nbsp;<strong>$300</strong>&nbsp;per year.</p>
<p>Although the estimated $30 million the tax will raise annually won’t be funnelled directly into electric vehicle infrastructure, the Treasurer said $45 million will be set aside in the budget to boost take-up of hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and electric vehicles.</p>

<p>Chairman of the Electric Vehicle Council of Australia, Behyad Jafari, described Victoria’s tax as a “shameful abdication of Victoria’s intention to reduce emissions”.</p>
<p>South Australia’s proposed charge will include a fixed component, similar to current registration charging, and a variable charge based on distance travelled.</p>
<p>The proposal has been widely criticised, with chief executive of the peak body for carmakers in Australia, Tony Weber, describing it as “beyond belief”.</p>
<p>“We believe this charge will make South Australia the only jurisdiction in the world that actually opposes the uptake of low and zero emission vehicles,” Mr Weber added.</p>
<p>As state governments in Victoria, South Australia, and New South Wales have moved to tax electric vehicle owners, the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) has positioned itself as the friendliest jurisdiction in the nation for EV buyers.</p>
<p>It recently announced an ambitious target to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.carexpert.com.au/car-news/all-act-new-car-sales-to-be-zero-emissions-by-2030-under-ambitious-plan">sell only zero-emissions new vehicles</a>&nbsp;by 2030.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle">Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle</a> is an important result in physics, expressing a limit regarding the measurement of certain pairs of particles’ physical properties. In essence, it states that the uncertainty of any measurement of these pairs of properties at the same time has a lower bound. For example, if we’re measuring a particle’s position and velocity, and want to be more certain about the particle’s <em>position</em> (measure the position more precisely),
at some point we would inevitably start becoming less certain about the particle’s <em>velocity</em>, regardless of the measurement tools we use. This limitation doesn’t come from any technical
properties of how we measure those properties. Rather, it points to a loss of mathematical meaning as the measurements get “too precise”.</p>

<p>I believe a similar phenomenon exists in the world of research and development. It seems trivial, but too many times I’ve seen it forgotten (or ignored) when it was inconvenient.</p>

<p>Pick a random project management book or article, and you’ll probably see projects depicted as triangles representing the projects’ constraints in some form. Two of the primary constraints
would be equivalents of <em>time</em> and <em>result</em>: we know what we want, and we know when we want it. In practice we are usually not overly concerned with calculating confidence intervals
for those variables.</p>

<p>But the more <em>novel</em> a project (or subtask) is, the more inherent uncertainty it has. This means that if we’re trying to take on something that no-one in-house has experience with
(and we’re not consulting someone with experience), the error bars on <em>both</em> time and result should be quite large. And if we’re tackling something entirely new (as far as we can tell
from preliminary research), it’s almost meaningless to assign an expected value to both the project’s duration and the result. This is important because after a certain threshold, a change of scope is warranted: as a manager, at some point you stop framing the project as “I want X by Y”, and start framing it as one of either:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“I want X and I don’t care how long it takes.”</li>
  <li>“I’m willing to give this project until Y, no matter the results.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course both of these framings are problematic from the business perspective. But the way I see it, assigning too-small error bars just to make a project’s premise feasible
business-wise is a risky endeavor at best.</p>

<p>Note that even when a project is not very novel, <a href="https://erikbern.com/2019/04/15/why-software-projects-take-longer-than-you-think-a-statistical-model.html">we are not great at making practical estimates</a>. Even when we would expect uncertainty to be controlled it comes back to bite us - all the more reason to be extra-careful of underestimating it.</p>

  <h2>WARNING: It has come to my attention that the particular implementation of WFC that
  I tested seems to have some issues. In particular it sometimes does not finish where other implementation do
  finish, and it may also as a result have slower runtime per completion. I need to redo this entire comparison
  in a follow-up post.</h2>

  <p>WFC is handy for quickly generating believable levels and other content in games, but it does have some limitations.
  My new algorithm, IPM, provides a different trade off and succeeds in some areas where WFC does not.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking. WFC output looks "clean" and IPM output looks "organic". That can be good or bad depending on the
  situation.</p>

  <p>On hard tile sets (which are hard either because there are many tiles, few legal ways for tiles to match
  eachother or because tiles are very large) WFC frequently failes to generate any output or will generate output that
  is repetitive (because it can only make legal matches of a small subset of the difficult tiles). So for these difficult
  situations WFC is slower, may not work at all, or the output may be unusable.</p>

  <h3>WFC advantages:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>100% accurately honors input tiles. âœ…</li>
    <li>Preserves alignment, repeating pattern output looks "correct". âœ…</li>
    <li>Preserves existing navigability of input tiles. âœ…</li>
    <li>Preserves tile edge matches, allowing "chunky" tile artifacts in game to mesh properly. âœ…</li>
    <li>Fast for simple tiles. âœ…</li>
    <li>Generates creative combinations and output within the tile constraints. âœ…</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>WFC disadvantages <small>(take with a grain of salt, need to retest with official implementation)</small>:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Frequently fails for larger tile sizes. â�Œ</li>
    <li>Frequently fails for complex tiles. â�Œ</li>
    <li>Frequently fails on large output sizes. â�Œ</li>
    <li>Much slower for complex tiles. â�Œ</li>
    <li>Tends to overuse the "easy" tiles within complex tile sets, creating repetitive output. â�Œ</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>IPM advantages:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Works with any tile set. âœ…</li>
    <li>Works with any tile size. âœ…</li>
    <li>Works with any output size. âœ…</li>
    <li>Fast for small/simple inputs/outputs. âœ…</li>
    <li>Much faster than WFC for large/complex inputs/outputs. âœ…</li>
    <li>Generates creative combinations and output within the tile constraints. âœ…</li>
    <li>Maintains high pixel variety, tile variety and reasonably high tile match accuracy. âœ…</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>IPM disadvantages:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Does not 100% match input tiles. â�Œ</li>
    <li>Does not preserve alignment, repeating pattern output can look "wrong". â�Œ</li>
    <li>Only partially preserves existing navigability of input tiles. â�Œ</li>
    <li>Does not preserves tile edge matches, "chunky" tile artifacts in game will frequently not mesh properly. â�Œ</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Direct comparisons <small>(take with a grain of salt, need to retest with official implementation)</small></h3>

  <p>I'm providing 17 comparisons. 15 are from WFC's samples and 2 are from IPM and try to represent complex world generation.

<p>Japan's <a href="http://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/law/detail_main?id=10&amp;vm=2&amp;re=">Employment Security Act</a> requires a recruitment business to obtain a license. Failure to do so can result in imprisonment of up to a year. While I've met sleazy recruiters, sending them to prison seems a tad excessive to me. Curious about why the industry is so harshly regulated, I started digging. This took me into the seemingly dry but surprisingly interesting topic of the history of recruitment in Japan. As virtually nothing about this is written in English, I'm sharing what I found.</p>

<h2 id="japans-first-employment-agency">Japan’s first employment agency</h2>

<p>The earliest account of an employment agency in Japan comes from the mid-Seventeenth century. <a href="http://shokugyo-kyokai.or.jp/shiryou/gyouseishi/01-1.html">Keian Yamato</a> was a doctor who was sometimes asked by his patients to introduce servants or help arrange marriages. He was compensated for these introductions, and eventually this side business grew so successful that it overtook his medical practice. In 1652, he quit his job as a doctor to focus on his introduction business instead. So much so was his early fame, that early employment agencies were called “Keian” after him.</p>

<p>Keian’s agency and others got started at that point in Japanese history because the economic conditions were right for them. For an employment agency to be a viable business, there needs to be both a large supply of people seeking employment, and employers seeking labor. By mid-Seventeenth century Japan, such a market for labor was flourishing in response to a shift in Japanese society that had started with the dawn of the Edo Period, fifty years earlier.</p>

<h2 id="the-labour-market-in-the-edo-period">The labour market in the Edo Period</h2>

<p>The Edo period started in 1603 when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokugawa_Ieyasu">Ieyasu Tokugawa</a> officially assumed control of Japan. Before he came to power, for the last century and a half, Japan had been in a state of near-constant civil war, leading to much of the country struggling to recover from the ongoing conflict.</p>

<p>Ieyasu chose Edo, modern day Tokyo, to be the center of his government and country. Previous to this, the political and cultural center was located in western Japan, and Edo and the surrounding region had been economically underdeveloped. But Ieyasu enacted policies that encouraged the urbanization of Edo, transforming it from a small castle town with only one hundred houses to a bustling metropolis of over 250,000 people by 1650.</p>

<p>Not only did Ieyasu pursue urbanization of Edo, but his policies encouraged it throughout Japan. The government divided all of Japan into specific regions, granting each to a local Daimyo, a powerful feudal lord, who built their own castles surrounded by Samurai residences. This lead to a growth in the number of artisans and merchants, who in turn needed staff, creating new employment opportunities.</p>

<p>Further driving demand for labour was the government policy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankin-k%C5%8Dtai">Sankin-kōtai</a>, which required Daimyo to alternate living between their holdings and Edo on a yearly basis, in an attempt to prevent them from gaining too much power. As it was infeasible for Daimyos to relocate their entire household to Edo, this led to a demand for temporary staff.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, Edo saw a large influx of job seekers. Traditionally in Japan, the eldest son inherited everything: the family name, business, and any assets. Other children were seen as a burden, particularly for poor families. Struggling families practiced “Kuchi-berashi”, literally translated as reducing the number of mouths, where they would place their children to work elsewhere. As Edo flourished, many second sons and daughters of poor rural families journeyed there in search of employment.</p>

<p>Not only did children seek employment in Edo, but so did adults. Often these were people from farming villages who were cast out by their family, or samurai who became masterless after their leader fell in battle.</p>

<p>As these job seekers didn’t have local connections, they sought out someone who could make introductions. With the burgeoning employment market, recruiting as a profession was born in Japan.</p>

<h2 id="employment-in-the-edo-period">Employment in the Edo period</h2>

<p>Employment is a relationship where an employer pays an employee for work. While this has been one type of relationship, there are others where people perform work without receiving compensation, such as slavery or indentured servitude. In the Edo Period, the division between compensated and forced labor was ambiguous, with the term <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A5%89%E5%85%AC">Hōkō</a>, roughly translated as “service” or “apprenticeship”, used to refer to a wide range of employment-like relationships.</p>

<p>The most straightforward kind of Hōkō was temporary labor, where a person tended to be paid daily. Another form was a long term contract of a year or more to work for a samurai house. With this contract, they were usually paid on a monthly or yearly basis, however the salary itself was low as they were also provided room and board while working for the family.</p>

<p>Unpaid apprenticeships also fall under the term Hōkō, whereby a person would work for an artisan or merchant to learn the business. While they usually wouldn’t be directly paid for their work, the expectation was that their previous employer would sponsor their new business.</p>

<p>Children could also be placed out to work under a Hōkō agreement, where they would often learn a craft while being given food, clothes, and a place to live, but not be directly financially compensated. The parents of the children would be given what was effectively an interest free loan: they’d get a lump sum payment when the child started the apprenticeship, which they’d need to pay back when it ended.</p>

<p>While Hōkō tended to refer to agreements of fixed duration, it also encompasses a slavery-like relationship, whereby a whole family was born to serve a wealthy family for their entire life. Near the beginning of the Edo period, this form of permanent Hōkō was banned, and restricted to a fixed period instead (a maximum of 3 years in 1616, but extended it to 10 years in 1625).</p>

<h2 id="recruiter-or-human-trafficker">Recruiter or human trafficker?</h2>

<p>In modern parlance, just like there is a clear divide between employment and forced labour, there is also a clear divide between recruiters who perform employment matchmaking, and human traffickers who provide uncompensated labourers to employers. In the Edo period, the difference between these two professions was murkier than it is today.</p>

<p>For instance, when children ventured into Edo in search of employment and didn’t have any local connections, they would sometimes make use of a local recruiter. These recruiters would sign a contract on behalf of the parents with an employer. While some of these were benevolent, it was easy for them to be exploitative, and force the children to take jobs with poor working conditions.</p>

<p>During this period, the government also established special regions called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%C5%ABkaku">Yukaku</a>, which became the only legal area to practice prostitution. The government saw Yukaku as a way of maintaining public order and collecting taxes. To ensure a steady stream of new prostitutes, the government allowed the “apprenticing” of young girls into prostitution. Unlike normal apprenticeships though, where the parents needed to pay back the “loan” that they received, the girl herself became responsible for paying it back. The amount the parents received was so much though, that even if the girl worked her entire life as a prostitute, she could never pay off the debt. The only way out was to have a wealthy man buy out her remaining debt, and become his mistress. Some recruiters took advantage of Yukaku, and effectively bought young girls from poor families in rural areas and sold them to brothels.</p>

<h2 id="first-steps-towards-regulation-of-recruitment">First steps towards regulation of recruitment</h2>

<p>In 1867, the Tokugawa shogunate was finally toppled, ushering in a new era in Japanese history, referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_(era)">the Meiji period</a>. Whereas the previous government had maintained an isolationist stance, the new government embraced western technology and culture, seeking to modernize the country before it was subjugated by western powers.</p>

<p>As part of this modernization, the government abolished the strict class system that divided Japanese into Samurai, peasants, artisans, and merchants, declaring that everyone who had been peasants, artisans, and merchants to be equal. People who were formerly Samurai and Daimyo however were still granted a status as nobles.</p>

<p>With this move modernity, the government sought to regulate the recruiting industry. In 1872, they introduced a requirement that recruiters be licensed and have a guarantor. They also limited the fee a recruiter could receive to be a maximum of 5% of the salary of the introduced employee. This fee was paid by both the employee and employer.</p>

<p>As part of the Treaty of Versailles that ended World War I, <a href="https://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/history/lang--en/index.htm">the International Labour Organization (ILO)</a> was founded to advance social and economic justice through setting international labour standards.</p>

<p>At their very first meeting in 1919, the ILO called on its members to establish free public employment agencies and move towards banning fee charging agencies. As a member of the ILO, Japan created a new law, which required municipal governments to establish public employment agencies and introduced stricter requirements for private employment agencies. While there had been 9,712 private agencies in 1926, the number dwindled to 2,541 by 1934.</p>

<p>The new regulation of the industry also saw stronger controls against unethical recruitment, such as using exaggerated or false claims to recruit people, forcing applications, recruiting women to be prostitutes, blocking applicants’ freedom, and so on.</p>

<p>In April 1938, the public employment agencies that had been operated at a local level were nationalized with a new law. This law also banned private agencies, except for some of the existing agencies, which were allowed to continue while facing even stricter regulations. Many of the private agencies who were banned merged into the national agency. The driving factor for this nationalization was not human rights though, but rather a response to a rapid increase in …</p></article></div>

<p>Inspired by her mother’s battler with breast cancer, a 23-year-old Spanish female engineer invented the first at-home breast cancer screening exam dubbed The Blue Box.</p>



<p>Winner of this year’s 2020 James Dyson Award, Judit Giró Benet, from Tarragona Spain, invented the The Blue Box, an easy-to-use, at-home, breast cancer testing device. It uses a urine sample and an AI algorithm to detect early signs of breast cancer.</p>





<p>40% of women miss their screenings leading resulting in 1 in 3 cases being detected late— Benet hopes to make screening more accessible and less costly.</p>



<p>The Spanish engineer is currently undergoing patent discussions for The Blue Box, and will spend the next few years working on the final stages of prototyping and data analytics software at the University of California Irvine, in preparation for human studies and clinical trials.</p>



<p>Once cleared, Benet plans to sell the device for $60. “An entire household of women can use The Blue Box at their desired frequency and convenience,” Benet says.</p>

<p>About 250,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed in women each year and about 2,300 in men in the United States alone according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/breast/basic_info/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CDC</a>. Early detection makes it possible in treating the disease and preventing fatalities, which makes regular testing incredibly important. And Benet just came up with a groundbreaking solution to the problem which could save thousands of lives in the process.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>This will be the first in a series of articles showing you how to model a public company.</p>
<p>We’re going to build a <strong>standalone model</strong> for Slack Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: WORK). A standalone model is exactly what it sounds like: a financial model for a given company without any assumed transactions (e.g., acquisition, dividend recap, etc.). Oftentimes, a standalone model is the first building block in a larger financial analysis exercise. For example, if a bank is hired to help a company review its strategic alternatives, one of the first steps is working with management to build a standalone model. The standalone model serves as the company’s <em>base case</em>, which all strategic alternatives are then compared to.</p>
<p>Likewise, public markets investors model public companies in order to project financial results and evaluate investment opportunities. For private equity investors, building a rigorously tested operating model is one of the key workstreams in any deal. Knowing how to build rock-solid standalone models is a foundational skill for investment banking, private equity, and hedge fund professionals.</p>
<p>This article will walk you through building a public market overview (PMO), which is the first step in any standalone model for a public company. A public market overview calculates a company’s equity value and enterprise value, along with basic trading multiples.</p>
<p>Future articles in this series will walk you through building the full standalone model and accompanying operating cases. This is step one.</p>
<h2 id="Getting-Started"><a href="#Getting-Started" title="Getting Started"></a>Getting Started</h2><p>We recommend you start from a blank Excel workbook and try to follow the steps below. But if you prefer, here’s the <a href="https://multipleexpansion.com/excel/Slack-PMO.xlsx">completed Excel file</a>.</p>
<h2 id="1-Create-Cover-Tab"><a href="#1-Create-Cover-Tab" title="1) Create Cover Tab"></a>1) Create Cover Tab</h2><p>First, we’re going to create a cover tab. Our cover tab looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://multipleexpansion.com/2020/11/25/standalone-model-public-market-overview/1-cover-tab.png"></p><p>A few things to point out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Below the cover area, we wrote our project code name (“WORK”) in cell F47. We’re naming this cell <code>PROJECT</code>.<blockquote>
<p>To name a cell, you press <strong>CNTL</strong> + <strong>F3</strong>. When you name a cell, you can then refer to it anywhere in the workbook using its new name (in this case, <code>PROJECT</code>).</p>
<p>Word to the wise: don’t overuse this functionality. If you have more than 10 named cells in your model, you’re doing too much.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>The title in the cover area is actually a formula using our project code name. The formula is:<blockquote>
<p>=”Project “&amp;PROJECT</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Similarly, the date / timestamp below the title is created using the formula:<blockquote>
<p>=now()</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-Create-PMO-Tab"><a href="#2-Create-PMO-Tab" title="2) Create PMO Tab"></a>2) Create PMO Tab</h2><p>Next, we’re going to create a new tab for our <strong>p</strong>ublic <strong>m</strong>arket <strong>o</strong>verview (PMO). Again, a public market overview calculates a company’s equity value, enterprise value, and implied trading multiples. This might sound simple, but calculating equity and enterprise values can involve a surprising degree of nuance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Okay, let’s create a new tab. The shortcut to create a new Excel tab is <strong>SHIFT</strong> + <strong>F11</strong>.</li>
<li>Now, let’s rename the new tab <code>PMO</code>. The shortcut to rename an Excel tab is: <strong>ALT</strong> &gt; <strong>H</strong> &gt; <strong>O</strong> &gt; <strong>R</strong>.</li>
<li>Let’s apply some basic formatting to our new tab. In the upper leftmost cell, we’ll reference the project name again.<blockquote>
<p>= “Project “&amp;PROJECT</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Below the project name, let’s put a page header - in this case, “Public Market Overview (PMO)”</li>
</ul>
<p>Your new PMO tab should look like this: </p>
<p><img src="https://multipleexpansion.com/2020/11/25/standalone-model-public-market-overview/2-blank-pmo-tab.png"></p><h2 id="3-Add-PMO-Layout"><a href="#3-Add-PMO-Layout" title="3) Add PMO Layout"></a>3) Add PMO Layout</h2><p>Let’s add the basic structure of our PMO. Remember - we’ll be calculating equity value, enterprise value, and trading multiples for Slack. </p>
<p><strong>How do we calculate equity value for a public company?</strong> Pretty simple, we multiply the number of shares by the stock price. We’ll need (i) the stock price and (ii) the fully diluted share count.</p>
<p><strong>How do we calculate enterprise value for a public company?</strong> We take the equity value, and we add net debt. We’re already calculating the equity value (above), but we’ll need to look at Slack’s latest filings in order to determine the net debt.</p>
<p><strong>How do we calculate trading multiples?</strong> (If you really have no idea, this is not the right tutorial series for you.) We’re going to divide equity value and enterprise value, respectively, by various financial metrics for Slack, such as revenue, EBITDA, and net income. The exact metrics and multiples we use will depend on the company’s financials.</p>
<p>Here’s what the outline of your PMO should look like:</p>
<p><img src="https://multipleexpansion.com/2020/11/25/standalone-model-public-market-overview/3-pmo-layout.png"></p><h3 id="Stock-Based-Compensation"><a href="#Stock-Based-Compensation" title="Stock-Based Compensation"></a>Stock-Based Compensation</h3><p>You’ll notice that we’re adding options &amp; RSUs to basic shares in order to calculate the <strong>f</strong>ully <strong>d</strong>iluted <strong>s</strong>hares <strong>o</strong>utstanding (FDSO). Most public companies offer some form of stock-based compensation to employees, and options and RSUs are two common varieties. When we go through Slack’s financial statements, we may discover additional share awards, or we may find out that Slack doesn’t have options or RSUs. Ultimately, we need the fully diluted share count, so that we can calculate accurate equity and enterprise values.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Some theory - why we’re focused on counting every last share…</strong><br>A company’s stock price gives us the implied equity value per share. We must assume that the market is relatively efficient. Therefore, the market is doing the same basic math as us, and knows exactly how many outstanding shares there are, including from stock-based compensation. Armed with this knowledge, the market is then giving us a price, which implicitly is the <em>most diluted</em> (lowest) value. If we don’t include all shares in our equity value calculation, we’re undervaluing the given company, because we’re multiplying the market price (reduced by share awards) by a half-baked share count.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="Noncontrolling-Interest"><a href="#Noncontrolling-Interest" title="Noncontrolling Interest"></a>Noncontrolling Interest</h3><p>Noncontrolling interest represents the portion of any subsidiaries not owned by Slack. For example, if Slack bought 80% of XYZ Co three years ago, all of XYZ Co’s assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and cash flows would be included in Slack’s consolidated financials. The outstanding 20% of XYZ Co - not owned by Slack - would be included in Slack’s balance sheet as noncontrolling interest. </p>
<p>Noncontrolling interest is included as a debt-like item in the build from equity to enterprise value. It’s treated like debt, because it represents a claim on Slack’s consolidated net operating assets that is not included in Slack’s equity value. Remember, the noncontrolling interest is the portion <strong>NOT</strong> owned by Slack and, therefore, not indirectly owned by Slack’s shareholders.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>More theory - what does enterprise value represent?</strong><br>This concept is often poorly explained. I’ll try to do a better job here. Enterprise value represents the aggregate value of a business, or collection of assets, irrespective of capital structure.</p>
<p>For example, when you buy a house, you fund the purchase using some combination of debt and down payment. The enterprise value for the house is the total amount of money transferred to the seller. Enterprise value ignores capital structure - it is purely a measure of aggregate value.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="4-Searching-the-Financials"><a href="#4-Searching-the-Financials" title="4) Searching the Financials"></a>4) Searching the Financials</h2><p>Now the fun begins. Reading and searching a company’s financials deserves its own (lengthy) article series. We’ll do our best to cover the essentials below.</p>
<h3 id="SEC-Filings"><a href="#SEC-Filings" title="SEC Filings"></a>SEC Filings</h3><p>Since we’re evaluating a US-listed company (Slack), we’ll go to the SEC’s website to pull the filings. A lot of people are intimidated by the SEC website, due to its slightly clunky interface, but once you get the hang of it, it’s fast and easy. Personally, I feel more comfortable pulling filings directly from the source - and in the US, that’s EDGAR, the SEC’s filings website.</p>
<p>I never remember the website URL, so I always just google “SEC EDGAR.” The first result is the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">correct link</a>. On the left side of the EDGAR webpage, you should see a search box labeled <strong>Company and Person Lookup</strong>. That’s where you enter the ticker. So let’s type in Slack’s ticker, <strong>WORK</strong>, and we’ll get going.</p>
<p>You should now be on Slack’s EDGAR page, and you should see “Slack Technologies, Inc.” at the top (here’s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?CIK=1764925&amp;owner=exclude" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the link</a> in case you want to double-check).</p>
<p>Filings are listed in reverse chronological order (most recent filings at the top), and the number-and-letter symbols in the leftmost column represent filing types. You’ll mainly be interested in <strong>10-K</strong>s (annual financials), <strong>10-Q</strong>s (quarterly financials), and <strong>8-K</strong>s (periodic investor updates), but here’s a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/info/edgar/forms/edgform.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complete list of filing types</a>. I wouldn’t recommend reading this list, unless you have an unanswered question. For example, if you see an unusual form code and want to know what it is, try google first. If you can’t find a succinct answer quickly, then pop open <a href="https://www.sec.gov/info/edgar/forms/edgform.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this list</a> and <strong>CNTL</strong> + <strong>F</strong>.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and 8-Ks are where you’ll spend most of your time. 10-Ks provide the most comprehensive information, and they’re filed annually. You can think of 10-Qs as leaner, less filling versions of the 10-K. 10-Qs are filed quarterly. <a href="https://www.sec.gov/fast-answers/answersreada10khtm.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This guide on how to read a 10-K</a>, provided by the SEC, is pretty thorough without making your eyes bleed (at least mine didn’t). If you’re new to filings research, it’s a good place to start.</p>
<p>When building a PMO, you want to locate the latest 10-Q or 10-K, which should have all of the information you need. Ideally, the latest 10-Q or 10-K will be one of the first filings listed, as is the case here (as of November 25, 2020). See below:</p>
<p><img src="https://multipleexpansion.com/2020/11/25/standalone-model-public-market-overview/4-first-10-q.png"></p><p>It’s better (for you) if the latest 10-Q / 10-K is near the top of the list, because then you have to check fewer filings to ensure nothing material has changed. Remember - 8-Ks contain investor updates, so sometimes you can run into situations, in which an important 8-K is released <em>after</em> the latest 10-Q / 10-K. By default, you should check every filing above the latest 10-Q / 10-K, and it’s also a good idea to check any 8-Ks directly below the latest 10-Q / 10-K. You don’t want to miss something important. Anyways, we’re in luck. No subsequent 8-Ks, and the latest 10-Q should have everything we need.</p>
<h3 id="10-Q-and-Exhibits"><a href="#10-Q-and-Exhibits" title="10-Q and Exhibits"></a>10-Q and Exhibits</h3><p>Let’s click on that top <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1764925/000176492520000570/0001764925-20-000570-index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10-Q</a>. You should see this menu:</p>
<p><img src="https://multipleexpansion.com/2020/11/25/standalone-model-public-market-overview/5-latest-10-q-menu.png"></p><p>The first link in the table (here, it says “10-Q”) is the main filing. We’ll go to that in a second.</p>
<p>The exhibits listed below the filing contain various legal documents. You can ignore these unless you’re hunting for something specific. For example, the first …</p></div></div>

                    <p>Pay up -- or we’re pulling the plug. </p><p>That’s the approach the news industry should take when it comes to Google and Facebook: Pay for our journalism or we’re banning it from your platforms. </p><p>For too long, journalists have given away their stories for free in exchange for distribution by the duopoly. At best, a story may go viral (rare) or hit the SEO lottery and experience a one-off traffic surge (unsustainable). </p><p>And for that, newsrooms have willingly handed over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/09/business/media/google-news-industry-antitrust.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share">billions of dollars</a> in ad revenue to the tech giants that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/03/facebooks-siren-call/">threaten</a> their very existence. (Google and Facebook are No. 1 and No. 2 <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/facebook-ad-revenue-2019-2020">ad platforms</a> in the U.S., respectively).</p><p>The news industry as a whole needs to come together and demand to be fairly compensated for their contributions. Until Facebook and Google agree to pay up, they are simply exploiting journalism under the pretext of democratizing information. </p><p>News drives habit. Habit drives frequency. And frequency drives time spent. In the attention economy (read: ad-driven), news content entices people to come back and stay in platforms’ carefully crafted ecosystems. </p><p>In short, platforms need news. </p><p>Mark Zuckerberg said it himself when Facebook launched its news tab in 2019 (its most recent olive branch to publishers). In a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/25/opinion/sunday/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-news.html">piece for the<em> New York Times</em></a>, the Facebook founder pledged to “support the news industry” and said that journalism today is “more important than ever.” But only <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/10/23/facebook-offer-news-tab-users-pay-some-publishers-their-work/">some of the 200+ publishers</a> involved in the news tab were actually paid for their contributions. &nbsp;</p><p>These platforms are simply using their high-minded mission statements (e.g. Facebook: To “give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together” and Google: To “organize the world’s information”) as a thuggish pretext for exploiting journalism. </p><p>Instead, they should pay a licencing fee or provide a sizable cut of ad revenue to newsrooms that are populating the platforms (Murdoch analogized this to a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/22/rupert-murdoch-facebook-should-pay-news-publishers">carriage fee</a>). &nbsp;</p><p>It’s not enough for them to attempt damage control by <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/06/google-paying-publishers-is-more-about-pr-than-the-needs-of-the-news-industry/">spinning up funds</a> claiming to help journalism or offering some – but not all – publishers fees for their contributions. (If you want to know how Google really feels about paying for news, see <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/google-news/google-to-shut-down-news-site-in-spain-over-copyright-fees-idUSL1N0TV0S520141211">how they treated publishers</a> in Spain).</p><p>That’s why we’re building <a href="https://www.forthapp.com/?utm_source=nillium&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=frontpage">Forth</a>, a news-first platform that pays journalists for their work and offers the audience concise updates with context -- from the reporters they trust. All revenue generated on Forth is shared with our news partners. </p><p>We only allow trusted and credible journalists (vetted by our editorial team) to publish to the platform. It's a one-stop shop for accurate information about what's happening right now. &nbsp;</p><p>It’s one thing for Facebook and Google to out-innovate a slow-to-adapt industry -- it’s another to profit off of the same industry's work with impunity. </p><p>Newsrooms should be mad as hell -- and they don’t have to take it anymore. </p><p>Let’s Go Forth, </p><p>-- Xana</p><p><br><em>Xana O'Neill is the Co-Founder of Forth, a platform for concise updates with context from the reporters you trust.</em></p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In the middle of an actual, like, actual workplace coup with secret meetings, purges, puppetmasters, frame-ups, leak investigations, and (rumored) slack DM surveillance, I was listening to the bombshell podcast and heard about this book about coup-proofing, and how it ruins teams.
I picked up a copy, and this year I read it.</p>

<p>The book (Caitlin Talmadge / <a href="https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501700293/the-dictators-army">The Dictator’s Army</a>) is about how coup fears hamstrung management in two wars:
Saddam Hussein’s 8-year failed invasion of Iran, and South Vietnam’s final defense against the North.
This article is about private sector leadership lessons I took from the book.</p>

<p>Writing about private sector leadership on the eve of a plausible military coup seems like peeing into the ocean, but it’s this or doomscrolling and holding in your pee can kill you.</p>

<p>Most management books are aspirational and map out success.
This one is about repeated failure, despite great funding, first-mover advantage and better equipment, through repeated mistakes, and in the public eye.
Nothing that I would know anything about cough.</p>

<p>Startups sub 30 people have a hard time accessing experienced hires who combine domain skill and the ability to work on a team.
There are real reasons for this, and some boil down to something like Saddam’s coup fears.
But if our society plans to continue airlifting cash into small companies, onboarding good middle managers earlier can make more of these bets pay off.</p>

<p>If you prefer a soundtrack, play this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thbICk05yPk">masterclass on management</a> (from GI Joe’s Cobra Commander) in the background.
It sometimes gets me through the week.</p>

<h2 id="despots-meddle">Despots meddle</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians, provided the end be their improvement, and the means justified by actually effecting that end.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Liberty, as a principle, has no application to any state of things anterior to the time when mankind have become capable of being improved by free and equal discussion.
– JS Mill</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By inference, if you’re not hiring barbarians and / or they don’t need improvement, or your team is capable of discussion, consider a lighter-weight leadership style.</p>

<p>‘Despot’ also means bronze age feudal landowners or the heir apparent of Byzantium, but we haven’t had those for a while.
Adaptive reuse of the term in revolutionary France gave the term its modern meaning:
an absolute ruler who governs without restraint by the law.
See also ‘frondeur’.</p>

<p>When growing teams take on more complex goals but don’t update their management, they encounter pathologies of delegation –
senior leadership who isn’t sure how to solve problems using middle managers, who give them the wrong length leash.
This is the 10 person to 30 person growth spurt.
Good companies outgrow it this <em>if</em> they survive.</p>

<p>Here’s what that looked like in Iraq:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>decision-making at the senior levels of the Iraqi military revolved more around the fear of what Saddam might do than what the Iranians might do.<sup id="fnref:senior-fear" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:senior-fear">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>by the middle of the war, Saddam was making a serious effort to inform himself about military matters in order to understand what was happening. However, Saddam was the only decision maker,<sup id="fnref:educate" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:educate">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Technocratic middle managers were spending most of their energy undoing their leader’s bad decisions, rather than fighting and winning.
There’s a spectrum between ‘own worst enemy’ and ‘annoying bandwidth bottleneck’, but new managers generally are on it somewhere.</p>

<p>Over-centralization of authority sends a message that people shouldn’t act on their own, which paralyzes your org.
Note that I’m not arguing against hierarchical authority or a clear chain of command, but rather against authority all concentrating at the top, making it impossible for middle managers to do their jobs.
In Vietnam:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>few officers who had come up in the Diem system were willing to do anything “in the absence of detailed orders.”<sup id="fnref:detailed" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:detailed">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Centralization also hamstrings the flexibility of a large team to adapt to new information.
Top leaders, often lacking domain skill or up-to-date information, are best at ‘do nothing without asking me’ orders that trap middle managers in bad positions.
In one case:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because Saddam had decreed that units were not allowed to cede any ground, the Iraqi defense was poorly coordinated and ineffective, eventually inducing panic.<sup id="fnref:panic" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:panic">4</a></sup> …
Iraqi officers in the field lacked the authority to redeploy forward troops or to call on reserves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And because the dictators aren’t an expert in any part of the organization, lack the attention to focus on everything at once, and aren’t accountable to anyone, they have zero memory.
In one case in Vietnam, President Thieu’s personal intervention not only disrupted the existing strategy, but he had forgotten by the next day that he’d given the order.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>sudden change in orders from an uninformed Thieu was a disaster, resulting in neither a robust defense of the city nor a clean withdrawal.<sup id="fnref:sudden-change" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:sudden-change">6</a></sup> … Amazingly … Hue’s abandonment apparently came as a surprise to President Thieu<sup id="fnref:abandonment" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:abandonment">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unaccountable, illogical plans from inexpert leaders create hills to die on, in some cases literally.
They also come through unusual channels (because hands-on leaders prioritize fast action).
Unusual channels = coordination and preparation impossible for middle managers.
In one case in South Vietnam, a general:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>personally interceded at all levels, sometimes going so far as to personally issue orders by radio to individual brigade commanders without notifying the division operations center. Both Giai and his division advisers often learned of new orders only as they were being carried out.<sup id="fnref:all-levels" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:all-levels">8</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>By comparison, the North Vietnamese had good delegation and sane command structures in place.
From an internal document, they valued:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“unanimity of thought from the top to the bottom regarding the opportunity we faced and the tactics to be employed” but significant room for commanders to execute their plans<sup id="fnref:unanimity" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:unanimity">9</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>After the American revolution, George III was having a conversation with his American portraitist Benjamin West; he heard Washington was going to resign his commission and ‘return to his farm’.
The King was like ‘ha pull the other one’, recognizing that giving up power is very hard, and said something like ‘<em>if</em> he does it I take back everything I said about the guy.’
The point is that accepting the limits to authority is hard, but also critical for good leaders.</p>

<h2 id="managing-up">Managing up</h2>

<p>One of the lessons of 2020 is probably that sometimes the only person in the room who can stop a bad outcome is a middle manager,
and often they can only do it by managing up, not through direct action.</p>

<p>Middle managers are frequently in situations where their domain skills are better than senior leadership –
either because they’re technocrats with domain skills,
or because they’re dealing with the problem day-to-day and have better information, or both.</p>

<p>We still get shouted down a lot, resulting in waste:
of money, of time, of resources, of opportunities, of morale.
In a war it can be lives.</p>

<p>We speak out a few times but eventually converge to inaction as your <a href="https://danluu.com/wat/">wtfs trail off</a>.
We give up because we’re tired, but that’s not all of it:
We stop arguing because when a leader experiences argument as dissent, their reactions are unpredictable and poison the team.</p>

<p>The way around this way of thinking is to
(1) make very sure that you’re very right when you pick a fight with your boss,
(2) fight for better delegation, not just a correct decision this one time.
And (3) remember that if you succeed, things get permanently better; these are hard fights but companies need them to grow.</p>

<p>Middle managers are the only people who have the authority and connections to fight these fights.
That’s why they leak, that’s why they manage up.
The organization will fail if we don’t.
Employees depend on companies to put food on the table; you do have a moral obligation to help your employer not fail (if you can) (barring circumstances like if <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn1VxaMEjRU">you’ve looked at these caps recently</a>).</p>

<p>I saw a <a href="https://twitter.com/FutureDocs/status/938173926953443328">JAMA article</a> about ‘professional silence’ by doctors.
Silence is not golden when an important argument is being suppressed.</p>

<p>Senior technocrats have a surprising amount of power when they align their story and band together. For Saddam, years into the war:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Iraqi generals blamed Saddam’s military organizational practices for both sets of losses, raising a serious danger of overthrow from within<sup id="fnref:blame" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:blame">10</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because his leadership style was in conflict with their technical skills.
He punished losses in ways that deterred ground commanders from requesting backup, creating a losing cycle:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Saddam put great pressure on Iraqi commanders on the ground to avoid losses, which led them not to report failures. Withholding losses from reports and thus not receiving reinforcements or other support left commanders in impossible combat conditions. However, this was better than reporting their failures and suffering execution.<sup id="fnref:pressure" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:pressure">11</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The command-and-control system was incapable of transmitting the true tactical situation. Senior Iraqi officers later noted that they often got more timely information from the media than they did from their own commanders at the front.<sup id="fnref:media" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:media">12</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Vietnam, General Phu, a technocrat middle manager who had been brought in to fix the South Vietnamese army’s problems, tried to use his authority to salvage a bad campaign and was talked down.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Phu, who previously had enjoyed an excellent reputation as commander of the 1st Division, expressed grave reservations about the operation to those around him, complaining that he had done it only because of Thieu’s order<sup id="fnref:reservations" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:reservations">13</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>President Thieu’s realtime intervention, leading to a bad loss, demoralized him and he was never able to lead again:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thieu’s absurd order to withdraw immediately from the Central Highlands essentially caused another corps commander, General Phu, …</p></blockquote></div></article></div></div></div>
