November 19, 2020 | https://www.rubypigeon.com/posts/my-beef-with-rubocop/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.rubypigeon.com/posts/my-beef-with-rubocop/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Consider a hypothetical class that filters out unsafe HTML elements:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>SanitizingFilter</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>HTMLFilter</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>render_element</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>attrs</span><span>,</span> <span>content</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>safe?</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>attrs</span><span>)</span>
      <span>super</span>
    <span>else</span>
      <span>nil</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The default RuboCop settings would have us change it to this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>SanitizingFilter</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>HTMLFilter</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>render_element</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>attrs</span><span>,</span> <span>content</span><span>)</span>
    <span>super</span> <span>if</span> <span>safe?</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>attrs</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let us feast on a three-course meal of opinion about why this is
worse.</p>

<h2 id="that-nil-was-written-for-a-purpose">That <code>nil</code> Was Written For A Purpose</h2>

<p>My first beef — the hors d’oeuvre, if you will — is that
<code>Style/EmptyElse</code> wants us to change from an <em>explicit</em> <code>nil</code> return
value to an <em>implicit</em> one. It says there is a “redundant
else-clause”. I’ll tell you what’s redundant: the <code>Style/EmptyElse</code>
cop.</p>

<p>This cop would prefer that the <code>else</code> clause did not exist, like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>SanitizingFilter</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>HTMLFilter</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>render_element</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>attrs</span><span>,</span> <span>content</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>safe?</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>attrs</span><span>)</span>
      <span>super</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In terms of behaviour at runtime, this is exactly the same. In terms
of readability, it is not.</p>

<p>The explicit <code>nil</code> in the original implementation implies that the
method is being called for its return value — that it’s probably
functional, with inconsequential side effects.</p>

<p>Making the <code>nil</code> implicit says that <em>the return value is not
important</em>. This method now reads like it’s implemented by avoiding
side effects within <code>super</code>.</p>

<p>So which one is it? Is the filter supposed to work by returning <code>nil</code>,
or does it work by avoiding the side effects in the <code>super</code> call?
These are very different behaviours, and RuboCop just changed the
human interpretation from the correct one to the wrong one.</p>

<p>Bad cop. No doughnut.</p>

<h2 id="its-not-a-guard-clause">It’s Not A Guard Clause</h2>

<p>My other beef (the main course) is with <code>Style/GuardClause</code>. This cop
takes conditionals and turns one of the branches into a guard clause
— something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>SanitizingFilter</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>HTMLFilter</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>render_element</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>attrs</span><span>,</span> <span>content</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>nil</span> <span>unless</span> <span>safe?</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>attrs</span><span>)</span>

    <span>super</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Again, the runtime behaviour is identical, but the cop makes it less
readable.</p>

<p>Guard clauses are for bailing out early when you know that it’s not
necessary to run the rest of the method. They are usually trivial in
comparison to the <em>real</em> work done by the rest of the method. For
example, if we were implementing a sorting algorithm, then we could
have a guard clause for inputs with one element or less — there is
no need to run a sorting algorithm when there is nothing to sort.</p>

<p>Except in this case, we’re not “guarding” the rest of the method from
being run. That conditional is the <em>entire raison d’être of the
class</em>. It’s the most important part. The whole purpose of a filter is
to decide what elements stay in, and what elements get filtered out.</p>

<p>RuboCop has taken the most important part of the class and turned it
into a trivial-looking guard clause.</p>

<p>Bad cop. No doughnut.</p>

<h2 id="branching-should-look-like-branching">Branching Should Look Like Branching</h2>

<p>My final qualm (is there such a thing as dessert beef?) is with
<code>Style/GuardClause</code> removing the obvious indenting of the two
branches, making it look like straight-line procedural code.</p>

<p>Most of the time, developers don’t so much <em>read</em> code as they do
<em>scan</em> code. We don’t read from left to right, top to bottom, as if
the codebase were the world’s most boring novel. We skim over code,
navigating by the colours of syntax highlighting and the shapes
made by indentation.</p>

<p>So when we’re skimming over the original code, trying to find the
conditional — which we’ve already established as being the most
important part of the class — we will find two landmarks: a line
that starts with a brightly coloured <code>if</code> keyword, and indentation
that suggests a conditional.</p>

<p>But skimming over the guard-clause-enhanced code we see neither of
these landmarks. Instead, we find indentation that suggests
<em>procedural</em> code: a series of statements that run from top to bottom.
RuboCop has taken an obvious conditional and reshaped it to look like
there is no conditional.</p>

<p>The <code>Style/GuardClause</code> cop is double bad, and misses out on two
doughnuts.</p>

<h2 id="disclaimerconclusion">Disclaimer/Conclusion</h2>

<p>I don’t dislike RuboCop. It’s well made, and a useful tool.</p>

<p>The problem starts when it is viewed not as a tool, but as a set of
divine commandments. Thou shalt not make implicit <code>nil</code>s explicit.
Thou shalt not write long-form conditionals. Thus saith the RuboCop.</p>

<p>This is not necessarily a problem with RuboCop itself — it’s a
problem with how people sometimes use RuboCop. One could argue that
the defaults aren’t great, but they are not a problem until someone
hooks them up to CI.</p>

<p>My only aim here is to disabuse readers of the notion that RuboCop can
only make code better. It’s a tool, and whether it helps or hurts
depends on how it’s used. Don’t be afraid to disable cops if you can’t
see how they benefit the team.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__next"><div><article><p><span><p><em>In for the TLDR? Find the <a href="https://twitter.com/mxmzb/status/1329106639258087428">Twitter thread version here</a>.</em></p><p>A friend of mine is convinced that if you have a lot of followers on an arbitrary social media platform, you are in a much better spot to launch your product than without an audience. He points at people like Gary Vee, and Tai Lopez, implying that they are selling products purely on the back of their popularity. And although he has a point, I think this is extreme cherry-picking. In my opinion, it works for them for specific and unique reasons. </p><p>As I noticed, building an audience <strong>before having a product/service</strong> seems to be an evolving trend, even in the indie maker community. In my effort to find clearness, I've compiled a list of founders and influencers running businesses with differently sized audiences. I hope the examples will shed light on the correlation between large audiences and entrepreneurial success.</p><p>Before we start looking into this: You'll notice that when I write "audience", I <em>usually</em> refer to the Twitter following of a founder. That doesn't mean an audience can't be built on another platform, but it's what most tech founders associate with "audience". </p><p>Further, I will be referring to various sizes of audiences and grades of (routinely presumed) economic success. Those lines are blurry and defined by my intuition of what is what for the average indie maker.</p><h2>Large audience but little to no success</h2><p><em>A large audience in this context leans towards 50k and goes up infinitely. Little to no success means that the project/founder can not self-sustain or the project has died.</em></p><p>You have 50k followers on the platform of your choice. Will you be able to make your next startup successful with that many people behind your back?</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/tjholowaychuk">TJ Holowaychuk</a> has 47k followers on Twitter (and 44k are occasionally seeing his contributions on GitHub). If you're a developer working with Node.js a lot, there is a good chance you've been using his code, or at least, code impacted by TJ.</p><p>TJ runs a software business called <a href="https://apex.sh/">Apex</a>, which offers monitoring/logging/uptime. I ran across it a few years ago and ever since haven't seen it build up a lot of momentum. Then, two months ago, I found <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/holy-heck-this-is-hard-8ebe864174?commentId=-MF0nsQqF-pLhijfLpgm">a comment by TJ on Indie Hackers</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Congrats! It's definitely tricky, even with my reasonably rare ~50k Twitter community it's still difficult, startups have it so easy in comparison.</p><p>-- <cite>TJ Holowaychuk</cite></p></blockquote><p>Maybe 50k is not enough. How about 2.6m? In May 2019, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190528072150/https://www.instagram.com/arii/">Instagram influencer Arii</a> failed <a href="https://www.tyla.com/news/celebrity-instagram-influencer-with-26m-followers-struggles-to-sell-36-t-shirts-20190528">to sell 36 T-Shirts</a>. The story has been torn apart by media shortly after, with various theories on what had gone wrong. Fake followers, wrong audience, no marketing strategy, lousy product. I'm convinced it's everything except fake followers. Sure, she probably has many, but at 2.5m total, I am confident a few hundred thousand legitimate ones rule this out as the sole reason for failure.</p><p>Do you remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beme">Beme</a>? The social app to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mixsze6uJPg">record videos when you hold it up to your chest</a>? This was an endeavor by Casey Neistat, who had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150809013605/https://www.youtube.com/user/caseyneistat">~1m YouTube subscribers</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150705203923/https://twitter.com/CaseyNeistat">~135k followers on Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150813225907/https://instagram.com/caseyneistat/">~400k on Instagram</a> back at the time. Despite accumulating millions of new fans of his own on all platforms ever since and CNN buying Beme in 2016, it eventually shut down in 2018.</p><p>Beme wasn't the only project by Casey that went down. There is also <a href="https://www.368.nyc/about">368</a>, a <em>"place where professional gamers, internet creators and cultural icons meet and create"</em>. Although it is open and operating, it's safe to say it's not what Casey had envisioned for it by far.</p><blockquote><p>[...]<!-- --> building a business is a really slow, really painful process <!-- -->[...]</p><p>-- <cite><a href="https://youtu.be/a49xvHviVds?t=123">Casey Neistat</a></cite></p></blockquote><p>Not convinced yet? Let's reduce the audience down to its purpose: Attention and somewhat targeted reach.</p><p>With this in mind, we can look at the products, which have been spun up and <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">eventually killed by yours truly, Google</a>.</p><p>Although Google isn't a person, I think it's a potent example that a social audience isn't tied to a projects' success. Google has millions of followers on all major social media platforms (don't expect me to link the accounts up).</p><p>For emphasis: This is a <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">collection of &gt; 200 diverse products</a> by big G itself, an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21069458/google-alphabet-trillion-dollar-market-cap-apple-microsoft">ex-1-trillion-net-worth</a> company that made 160 billion in revenue in 2019.</p><p>Each of those products has been likely in development for at least a year, with a dedicated and motivated group of brilliant people working on it. Furthermore, many of those products have been rolled out to Googles' existing audience by integrating them seamlessly into the user experience (Picasa, Google+, Google Reader, Google Video, etc.) or otherwise promoting them with the help of Googles' ecosystem and a bag of serious cash.</p><h2>Medium audience but immense success</h2><p><em>A medium audience in this context ranges from approximately 5-45k. Immense success means that the project is alive and healthy, and the founders can live far beyond their needs, with an ample surplus.</em></p><p>This is a selection of folks with a following that you wouldn't deem overwhelming but still have more to nurture their projects from than the average indie maker. To provide these particular examples significance, I made sure that they had a disproportionate amount of success. I also would like you to pay attention to how their followings became vast <em>after</em> (or should I say <em>while</em>?) building their businesses.</p><p>Probably you didn't expect someone like <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio">Pieter Levels</a>, who now has an impressive following (currently ~92k on Twitter) and is popular in the industry of online entrepreneurship, to be in this category. However, if you look closely, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/remote-ok">at the time Pieter launched RemoteOK</a> in 2015, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150129205450/https://twitter.com/levelsio">had about 9k followers</a>. I'm not saying that's irrelevant, but I am having trouble to justify <a href="https://remoteok.io/">RemoteOK's</a> success from solely that. <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nomad-list">Pieter launched Nomad List</a>, the second startup he is known for, even earlier, in August 2014, when he barely had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140813033726/https://twitter.com/levelsio">4k followers</a> on Twitter. That didn't hinder him to get significant press coverage early on by such as <a href="https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/the-best-cities-in-the-world-for-digital-nomads.html">Inc.com</a> or <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/how-to-find-the-best-places-to-live-when-you-work-remotely/articleshow/39427000.cms">Business Insider India</a>.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/yongfook">Jon Yongfook</a> (~18k followers) not only has somewhat of a celebrity status in Singapore, but he also has a noteworthy <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yongfook/">Instagram following</a> (~14k followers). Jon created <a href="https://www.bannerbear.com/">Bannerbear</a> and <a href="https://www.bannerbear.com/open/">discloses his numbers openly</a>. Before Bannerbear, <a href="https://twitter.com/yongfook/status/1304212610204577792">he has "failed"</a> a lot of times, both with <a href="https://twitter.com/yongfook/status/1171311476222464001">zero revenue</a> projects and projects that had <a href="https://blog.yongfook.com/don-t-fail-because-your-marketing-sucks.html">millions raised and hundreds of employees</a>.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shl">Sahil Lavignia</a>, who has accumulated even more followers than Pieter by now (~143k), <a href="https://sahillavingia.com/reflecting">can tell a bizarre story</a> about his company <a href="https://gumroad.com/">Gumroad</a>. He had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120130074352/https://twitter.com/shl">~9k followers</a> when he got funded in the millions around 2011-2012. Although I have been on Twitter at that time I fail to remember how influential numbers like this were back then. In the darkest hours of Gumroad, around November 2015, Sahil had grown his audience to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151129034039/https://twitter.com/shl">~17k followers</a>. Another three years later, in November 2018, he had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180208231910/https://twitter.com/shl">~20k followers</a> when Gumroad slowly <a href="https://sahillavingia.com/reflecting">started to rehabilitate from its prior downturn</a>.</p><p>Nowadays, you can't browse Twitter even for a minute without seeing a Gumroad link popping up somewhere. But Sahil jumped from success to failure and back with each transition taking years and rather moderately growing his Twitter audience. I'd argue his Twitter presence never played a critical role in his business' following success: To this date, his followers presumably view him more as the daily source of wise life advice than as the CEO of Gumroad.</p><h2>Little to no audience but great success</h2><p><em>Little to no audience in this context is everything less than ~5k followers. Great success means that the project is alive and healthy, and the founders can at least sustain their life financially from the project alone. Note that I did not research how many followers the founders in this category had at launch time because they fell into the given range even at the time of writing. But, naturally, you can assume it was even less.</em></p><p>On the other side, there are those who have no large audience and succeeded at their business. These folks are laser-focusing on building their business, not on building an audience for their business.</p><p>Because it's easy to find successful products of founders who don't have a large audience (hint: Look for cool products, the founders are almost always small on social media), here are more examples:</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/arichaprasad">Richa Prasad</a> (~40 followers) and <a href="https://twitter.com/lucygliang">Lucy Liang</a> (~450 followers) offer online weight loss coaching on <a href="https://www.coachviva.com/">Coach Viva</a> and have recently hit $10k monthly average. I love how they've managed to get a common idea to work <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/interview/the-long-road-to-10k-in-30-days-414169d6b8">with smart, sequential marketing efforts</a>. For example, they started out with their personal network, made adjustments to the product itself based on feedback, cemented their authenticity with reviews, and eventually landed on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQjOVgcoZvC6-EK0xgankpQ">YouTube</a>.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/brettwill1025">Brett Williams</a> is virtually non-existent on social media but has had tremendous success building <a href="https://www.designjoy.co/">designjoy.co</a>), a productized service where he sells web design on a monthly subscription. With that, Brett is <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/hue">reporting to make $26k MRR</a> and has recently crossed <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/hit-400k-as-a-solo-founder-designjoy-update-35af18ab82">$400k in total revenue</a>.

Although Canny has <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/canny/1m-arr-milestone--MFew44ybD_39HOGO_N7">recently hit $1m ARR</a>, neither Sarah nor Andrew have an exceptional social media following. <a href="https://canny.io/blog/how-we-built-a-1m-arr-saas-startup/">They found success in strategies</a> like content marketing, cold outreach, and putting effort into a great launch on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/canny-3">Product Hunt</a>.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/linuz90">Fabrizio Rinaldi</a> (~4k followers) and <a href="https://twitter.com/frankdilo">Francesco Di Lorenzo</a> (~2,5k followers) are building <a href="https://mailbrew.com/">Mailbrew</a>, an all-in-one email digest for all your favorite news and updates in one place.

It just launched in beta today, and you can sign up at <a href="https://jam.dev/wand">jam.dev/wand</a>.</p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SXjlHrFlWNQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Jam Wand is the tool <a href="https://twitter.com/_irtefa">Irtefa</a> and I wished we had when we were product managers at Cloudflare. We used to spend too much engineering time changing copy. We felt bad asking engineers for yet another copy change, and engineers felt bad because checking out yet another copy-fixes branch is time consuming and boring. It was a lose-lose.</p><p>We wished changing copy on a website was as easy as changing copy in a Google Doc. That was the goal for building Jam Wand.</p><p>With Jam Wand, any non-technical member of the team - without dealing with code or git - can make copy changes to their live website. It opens up pull requests to the codebase, so all engineers have to do is review and merge, and the copy change is live. </p><p>We know it’s cheesy, but we used to be PMs, we love building products and our dream is to help product teams work better together and build better products, faster. </p><p>We think collaborative teams where everyone can contribute what they do best -- where customer support can update in-product help text, marketing can update landing page copy, dev rel can update developer docs, sales can update CTA text, and so on, leads to better products - which makes teams happy, users happy, it is a win-win.</p><h2 id="how-jam-wand-has-changed-our-workflow"><strong>How Jam Wand has changed our workflow</strong></h2><p>We built the Jam Wand website using Jam Wand (I know, you are very surprised). But it actually changed our workflow -- we didn’t have to have copy ready for engineering before they built the site. Instead, an engineer created the website scaffold with some placeholder text, and then deployed it, and once it was live, I could go in and write in the copy, right from the live website.</p><h2 id="a-new-way-to-build-and-maintain-documentation"><strong>A new way to build and maintain documentation</strong></h2><p>What we experienced at Cloudflare and what Jam users tell us, is that while all website copy is a challenge to update, developer documentation sites are a special challenge.</p><p>It’s too hard to suggest a fix to documentation (just explaining where the change should be in the docs site takes effort), and then to make the change, it has to be Jira-ed and scheduled into an engineering sprint. And so, many changes to docs that would improve the developer experience often aren’t made because there is too much overhead.</p><p>Jam transforms your developer documentation site into a collaborative workspace, like a Google Doc. And now, with Jam Wand, you can even change the copy right from the page, making it so that anyone can help improve your developer documentation. We’re excited for what that means for docs especially.</p><h2 id="can-t-wait-to-hear-what-you-think"><strong>Can’t wait to hear what you think</strong></h2><p>You can sign up for the beta at <a href="https://jam.dev/wand">jam.dev/wand</a>.</p><p>There’s a queue, but we want to prioritize bringing in people who care about collaboration and no-code workflows, who can help us shape the future of the product. You’ve read all the way to the end here, so it’s likely that’s you 😁 -- DM us <a href="https://twitter.com/scoopsofjam">@scoopsofjam</a> your waitlist # and we will try to bring you in early!</p><p>And lastly - Jam Wand was built by <a href="https://twitter.com/_cichocinski">Tomasz Cichociński</a>, and designed by <a href="http://gloriayanli.com/">Gloria Li</a>. Just wanted to give them a little shout here 🤩 &nbsp;go Tomasz and Gloria!<br></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blog">
                    <h2>Knowing who is in control</h2>
<p>There are too many writers that want to please their audience too much. </p>
<p>They try to come up with the topics that the reader would click on in the newsletter. They come up with words and sentences that put the writer in a good light. They do everything not to be judged and to be respected and envied.</p>
<p>This is a prevalent trend you see all around the internet. It applies to the small bloggers that have grown just a little bit, and also it applies to huge bloggers that have understood that real people are reading your writing on the other side.</p>
<p>This does not only apply to writing. It applies to public speaking, videos on topics, ADs campaigns and ever software.</p>
<h2>Software to please</h2>
<p>Most of the people when choosing what side project to build go through ups and downs and turns in their mind before starting to work. It is a gad damn rollercoaster.</p>
<p>One of the things the developer decides is, how will he be judged when he presents this product. Would he be congratulated and told how awesome this product is, or would he be booed and shamed for making such an app?</p>
<p>You might not realise, but that is the main factor that stops some amazingly bright folks from building things.</p>
<h2>Where it all started</h2>
<p>One of the indications of how successful you are right now is how many followers you have on each social network and how much engagement do your posts get.</p>
<p>That is a very slippery slope.</p>
<p>Do you that also base your social interactions subconsciously on this understand what are likes and how they are acquired?</p>
<p>You have users, and these users have interests. These interests are determining who they follow based on the content of the different profiles. This content is liked, shared and saved if it fills other peoples area of interest.</p>
<p>So what are trying to do when posting there? Trying to please others interest and boost their well being.</p>
<p>I think it is evident what this means to normal humans, right? It means that we get programmed that we need to please others to get social approval. We are becoming more and more, just like in the old tribe days. Get accepted with followers or likes, or die as an outcast doing something that no-one agrees and understands.</p>
<p><img alt="like vs you image heart" src="https://i.gyazo.com/fec32c0e74acb32eb7bca4b52a4c1e74.png"></p>
<h2>Going forward</h2>
<p>It is very interesting how will the world change with the outcomes coming from Covid, but one thing certain is that we got even more integrated with social networks. When you are scared of leaving your home, and by nature, we still require social interactions, you seek some enjoyment out from social networks. So guess what? You get even more addicted to it.</p>
<p>None of this is good or healthy. No way that people can switch off from the mentality they got while socially living in social networks every day, for most of the day.</p>
<p>One way that the world can change if more limits are put on to social networks in general. Once that is done, the social norm and acceptance of the hole social networks market can go down just a little bit. That should be enough to get early adopters onto other platforms that have no likes and other things that get you trapped in a vicious cycle.</p>
<p>Once those vocal adopters get in, it is only a matter of time until the world changes again. It has happened before, and there is no way for history to be different now.</p>
<p>My personal hope is that we all stop doing content and work for others and start doing it for ourselves. That will help us produce higher quality and very personal work. That way, humanity can grow, not degrade.</p>
<p>As always you can try right now, no-one is stopping you:</p>
<p>Start now. Get perfect later</p>

<p>To keep things streamlined with WordPress, I had to implement this hack the other day, where I wanted to disable tag links on just 1 page.</p>
<p>Instead of fiddling with a new plugin, I found it easier, in this case, to disable the link in the template engine with pure CSS.</p>
<p>The magic to remove the link feature lies in <code>pointer-events</code> while the rest ensures it doesn't look like one.</p>
<pre><code><span>a</span><span>.disabled</span> {
  <span>pointer-events</span>: none;      
  <span>text-decoration</span>: none;
  <span>cursor</span>: default;  
  <span>text-decoration</span>: none;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The semantics might be up for discussion, but the performance is possibly better than using Javascript.</p>
<p>This approach is available to all major browsers:  <a target="_blank" href="https://caniuse.com/pointer-events">CSS pointer-events (for HTML)</a> </p>

					<div><p>How do you make the mundane magical?&nbsp; Imagine if your contacts magically stayed up-to-date with no effort on your part.&nbsp; Or if the great photos you have of your friends got sent to them automatically. What if you never forgot another birthday?</p>

<p>The impossible is now possible. Smartphones have connected the world and put the entire internet into our pockets. We can get whatever we want delivered to our home whenever we want, sometimes by flying drone. With the rise of artificial intelligence, dreams of virtual assistants, self-driving cars and global facial recognition are no longer that far-fetched. However, despite transformational advances in technology, there are still tons of mundane, time-consuming tasks that we all do (or just don’t do) daily.<br><span><br><b>Sunshine’s technology will make the mundane effortless, free up your time, and make it easier to be thoughtful.</b></span></p>
<p><span>Every day, we muddle through tasks with technology that is “good enough” – contacting friends with stale information that may or may not reach them; searching through email for phone numbers and addresses that we know we have somewhere; manually and painstakingly creating group distribution lists for every occasion; scheduling time to get together with friends using a hodge-podge of calendar, email, and text; pinching and zooming through photos to find one with everyone’s eyes open. We’re used to the mess, and we’ve come to accept the friction.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>No more.&nbsp; Everyday things should <b>just work</b>, and that’s Sunshine’s mission. We’re creating technology to address practical, everyday pain points in the basic, foundational tools that connect us with the people we care about. Ultimately, Sunshine will remove complexity in things like contact management, scheduling, event organization, and group communication so you can spend time more meaningfully.</p>

<p>We want to put the focus back on people, and let technology advance in its sophistication and fade into the background.</p>

<p>Today, we’re launching Sunshine Contacts (see our announcement here). Leveraging the power of artificial intelligence, Sunshine Contacts finds, deduplicates, and organizes your contacts. Using a variety of sources, we ensure your contact list is in one place, organized, always complete, and up-to-date.&nbsp; Sunshine Contacts makes your contacts <b>just work</b>.</p>

<p>Sunshine Contacts is our foundation. When your contacts are organized and truly work, they create a flywheel where scheduling, planning, organizing, and being thoughtful about your relationships becomes infinitely easier. When your contacts are complete, comprehensive, and accurately reflect relationships, you can spend your time building meaningful connections and shared experiences. Our future suite of products will make it effortless to keep in touch with the people in your life on a personal and professional level in a thoughtful way.</p>

<p>This is just the beginning.&nbsp; Sunshine is building a suite of services to solve the common pain points that modern technology hasn’t addressed.</p>

<p>At Sunshine, we strive to make the mundane magical. Our vision is to support your day-to-day life – to eliminate time spent on “technology” and simply make things better.&nbsp; Easier.&nbsp; If this means you save some “screen time” and give more thought to the most important people in your life, then we’ll know we’ve done it right.</p>

<p>We can’t wait to show you what’s next.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        
        <small>2020-11-18</small>
        <p>I’ve been mostly happy using a Mac since I got myself my first computer earned with programmer money. I believe it was a mid 2009 15" MacBook Pro. That was a computer I used at least until 2016 which I consider very decent usable life. At that point I had replaced the hard-drive with an SSD, upgraded the RAM and switched a battery that was worn out. I stopped using it when it just straight died some time in 2016.</p>
<h2 id="my-history-with-the-mac">My history with the Mac</h2>
<p>So what was that computer to me? It was an extremely well-built and solid-feeling piece of aluminium. A cool keyboard backlight. The magsafe charger and a bunch of USB ports. The keyboard and touchpad were best in class. The build quality was better than any laptop I had owned before. Partly because I had only bought the cheap ones before but also because they really were a step above at the time.</p>
<p>I got it primarily on recommendation from a friendly hacker who’s recommendations had never lead me wrong before. He spoke well of the underlying UNIX and the experience of using it. Fast, clean and visually pleasing. I think he mostly really liked the backlit keyboard, very hackerly. His recommendation held true, this computer was very good to me.</p>
<p>I’ve also been the admin on an Xserve server. That was wild. Neat UIs but buggy and finicky as all hell.</p>
<p>Since then I’ve used the second generation Macbook Air (I believe 2nd, first wedge version) at 11". That was a cool little machine and did what it did very nicely.</p>
<p>Hardware aside, MacOS in it’s earlier incarnations on these computers was always a snappy and competent experience. A polished surface which did a bunch of stuff under the hood that generally made it work better than the different Ubuntu desktop environments and various Windows versions I’ve had before. Things like Wifi and even Bluetooth felt good in a way they never had before.</p>
<p>A lot of it was the visual polish and the extremely snappy UI. But in total the experience was just great. Spotlight was glorious. I think my first upgrade was Snow Leopard which was generally a very good update as it focused on performance and stability.</p>
<p>As a developer’s machine it was fast enough, competent enough, got out of the way and the UNIX underpinnings meant I didn’t miss Linux at all. I’ve never been able to really connect with the equivalent powershell stuff in Windows. I guess I just like UNIX.</p>
<p>The only bad thing I can say about my early years of MacBook Pro usage was that the trackpad and the Magic Trackpad I got eventually are probably some of the biggest culprits in some of the RSI-style hand pain I’ve been dealing with. Trackpads are just murder on my hands and I worked loads off of that setup for a number of years. Took a while before I realized that it was trackpad-related.</p>
<p>Beyond that I’ve had some refurb Macs for my wife and assorted family, some 13" MBP for work at one point and then a 15" butterfly touchbar MBP for work. I think that was when I started to feel that Apple was diverging from my preferences in the MBP line.</p>
<h2 id="my-current-experience">My current experience</h2>
<p>That’s the same computer I have and work on now and it is.. fine? Maybe just OK. Not great. I’ve had some keys getting stuck but fixable with canned air. I don’t like the touchbar, it has been between useless and an actual hindrance. The TouchID power button is good though. I don’t like living in dongle-town though I mostly like USB C in the long run.</p>
<p>The reason it has been mostly fine for me is that I keep it on tray mounted on a VESA arm, dangling dongles like a technical octopus and I use external peripherals for input.</p>
<p>It gets really hot and loud and then it performs incredibly poorly. So I guess this is one of the throttliest generations. I think I had the “don’t charge it on the wrong side” problem as well. Some of the CPU shenanigans have calmed down as I installed the Turbo Boost Switcher tool to just disable the Turbo Boost, removing performance for peace and quiet.</p>
<p>As I’ve been using these devices it has become increasingly annoying to figure out how to install “unknown” apps. I need some non-discoverable terminal incantation to get the option to accept installing things that are unsigned. There’s always a new piece getting locked down. And while I think that’s often to the benefit of the average consumer, I’m not that. And I just get more annoyed.</p>
<p>I’ve been frustrated about the uninspiring performance delivered for the incredible brand markup that Apple charges. I don’t mind the computer being expensive if the experience is good and the hardware reasonable. The experience feels like it is slipping, especially for my needs and the hardware has just been getting less impressive to me.</p>
<h2 id="the-hardware">The hardware</h2>
<p>My gaming computer has a Ryzen. For a while I did my dev on that as we had just moved to our house and the office wasn’t finalized. Woof, aside from running Windows as a dev environment which I didn’t enjoy there was some serious upside on that machine.</p>
<p>On the Mac my options are very limited. I can’t get a Ryzen, I can’t get anything modern with Intel or meaningfully upgradable at all. The Mac Pro doesn’t count. It comes underspeced at hilarious prices. I like some of the design decisions but the price-point doesn’t make any kind of sense for me and what I do. I can’t buy an interesting Mac from a performance standpoint.</p>
<p>Or can I? Well, they just announced the M1 chip and ARM Macs are now a fact. I think I might get one at some point. For a travel laptop I don’t think the rest of the industry is ready to fight Apple. Battery life and good bang for buck power might actually keep a Mac in my life for that. But I feel like the general trend is away from what I want. Or I might just use my iPad Pro for that use-case.</p>
<p>I think the M1 will be quite impressive when the benchmarks roll in. I’m sure it will suit many people for real-world use-cases as well. However, from the first presentation on it and the first batch of Macs I don’t feel like the direction is for me. IO was heavily sacrificed. Upgradability is pretty much out the window. These things can be fine for a travel device for me where battery and weight are primary concerns. In that regard the new Air looks pretty good.</p>
<h2 id="the-software">The software</h2>
<p>Beyond that the coming OS, Big Sur, is taking MacOS in a direction I dislike. Catalina was quite messy and felt like it took steps toward walling off the Mac. Big Sur seems even more heavy-handed in that area and finally the M1 can push that even further if Apple feels like it. My trust is eroding on letting Apple set the tone for my computing life.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I think their approach to this transition is incredibly neat with Rosetta2 and how they are using the bytecode stuff with the App Store and whatnot. And the possibility to run iOS and iPad apps natively could be very useful. But none of this really moves the needle for me.</p>
<h2 id="so-whats-next">So what’s next?</h2>
<p>With my office in the garage as my primary work location I’m looking to transition to a desktop computer with lots of power. It will run Linux. Marking my first major return to desktop linux as a daily driver in a bundle of years. And it will run as light a desktop environment as I can stomach. I just wanted a stupid amount of performance to offset som of the UX niceties I know I will miss or have to customize  on my own.</p>
<p>I’m excited about exercising my development tools on a strong modern CPU rather than the throttled mess my current laptop offers. But I’m not thrilled about this move beyond the hardware aspect. I liked MacOS but I just don’t feel like Apple gives much of a care for the things I care about. And I feel like the software side on the Mac is slipping, consistently.</p>
<p>If they released an expandable Mac that wasn’t ridiculously expensive they would really make me think twice. But that feels unlikely.</p>
<p>So I’ll build myself a monstrous machine that can compensate in raw power for the potential lack of elegance and which offers unbounded flexibility rather than a poorly tended garden that someone keeps trying to wall in.</p>
<p>I’m not happy about it. I’ve generally enjoyed using my Macs. But when someone says “we’ll give you the full experience”, settling into that requires trust. And my trust that Apple and me are in alignment keeps fading.</p>
<p>Also, I’m developing a lot with heavily concurrent workloads. So I really look forward to exercising more cores. 2021, year of the Linux desktop (for me).</p>
<p>If you have thoughts, comments or a hell yeah you want to share about this topic or maybe you want me to cover some specific part of my transition here, let me know either via <a href="mailto:lars@underjord.io">lars@underjord.io</a> or on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/lawik">@lawik</a>. My first thoughts and my build might just show up first on my newsletter, so consider signing up for that below. It don’t track. Thanks for reading.</p>

        <div id="post-body"><p>To say that Lars (a.k.a <a href="https://twitter.com/lawik">@lawik</a>) is only, as he describes himself, an “Elixir consultant with too much enthusiasm” will be an understatement. The guy is all over the place, writing software, helping businesses move forward, writing <a href="https://underjord.io/the-beam-marches-forward.html">inspiring stories</a> about the future of the BEAM, and co-hosting <a href="https://devchat.tv/podcasts/elixir-mix/">an Elixir podcast.</a> That is how I first got to know Lars. </p><p>Based in Sweden, Lars started his programming journey by building websites with Notepad, then learning PHP and eventually taking his hobby pro through contract work, a failed startup, a couple of product teams and onward into independent consulting. He lives along the west coast of Sweden - a little way out of the city, where he attempts to grow vegetables with his wife and baby. The baby is terrible at growing vegetables.</p><p>In 2016 Lars discovered Erlang/Elixir, and this changed his view on developing software.</p><h2 id="what-brought-you-to-elixir">What brought you to Elixir?</h2><p><strong>Lars:</strong> At first, it was a bit of hype. I had a colleague who was quite a good talker and he went on at length about the legendary resilience of Erlang and hot updates for buried telephone switches. He spoke very well of Ecto changesets and was generally, very positive about Elixir. I ended up looking at talks about Phoenix. This was when <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/channels.html">Channels</a> was the new hotness and just before <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Presence.html">Presence</a> took the keynote stage. Looking at what the community was putting out made me give Elixir a try. When I went into business for myself, I was expecting to do a lot of Python, but I intended to try and get into Elixir.</p><p>I enjoy toying around with Raspberry Pi, so it was just a matter of time before I started playing with <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves</a>. I wanted to use the <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/inky-what?variant=21214020436051">Inky eInk</a> display with Nerves but the library was only available for Python. So, I decided to make a pure Elixir reimplementation. It proved to be a rabbit hole, but the Nerves community was very welcoming and helpful, and I was sold on Elixir for good. Love that crew!</p><p>I feel like I’ve written <a href="https://underjord.io/why-am-i-interested-in-elixir.html">at</a> <a href="https://underjord.io/why-am-i-still-excited-about-elixir.html">least</a> <a href="https://underjord.io/more-than-one-thing-at-a-time.html">four</a> <a href="https://underjord.io/the-beam-marches-forward.html">blog posts</a> about why I remain interested in and excited by Elixir and the BEAM. I like Python. I understand why people like Node.js but I can’t quite get excited about it. Either you go higher level on top of good abstractions, as the BEAM has, or you go lower level for unconstrained performance and flexibility.</p><h2 id="elixir-and-erlang-differ-significantly-from-other-mainstream-programming-languages-what-did-you-find-most-challenging-when-starting-with-the-stack">Elixir and Erlang differ significantly from other mainstream programming languages. What did you find most challenging when starting with the stack?</h2><p><strong>Lars:</strong> Immutability and the functional programming paradigm. Much of my early code did nothing or only did things by accident because I expected that the Map functions would mutate the map, not return a new one. Grasping map, reduce and all of their derivatives in the Enum module took me a bit. It was an adaptation process.</p><p>I guess it has also taken a while to disentangle <em>use</em>, <em>require</em>, <em>import</em> and <em>alias</em>. I still wouldn’t take bets on my understanding of <em>require</em> ;)</p><p>I’ve found the community incredibly welcoming at every step. I’ll call out <a href="https://twitter.com/nyaray">Emilio Nyaray</a> for helping me with some major refactoring and absorbing idiomatic Elixir. I hope everyone has such a good reception and it feels like the general feel of the community is very positive.</p><h2 id="tell-us-a-bit-about-your-most-recent-project-why-did-you-choose-elixir-for-it">Tell us a bit about your most recent project. Why did you choose Elixir for it?</h2><p><strong>Lars:</strong> A little while ago I made <a href="https://underjord.io/live-server-push-without-js.html">a very silly thing</a>. It is a way to show live information on a web page without using Javascript. Instead, it uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_JPEG">MJPEG</a> video protocol to deliver a new frame whenever the state changes. I used it to implement a live counter.</p><p>I used Plug and some code I found that the Nerves people had put together. The state is managed by a GenServer which keeps track of the connections as they come in, asking for the ”image”. It would add them to the list, render a new frame with some text on it, and send it to everyone connected. &nbsp;That would have been incredibly finicky in most runtimes. In my case, the biggest challenge was hitting the front page of Hacker News, where my Nginx config became a bottleneck for concurrent connections. I might have also needed to tweak my Plug a bit. It all maxed out at 450 or so concurrent connections, and I think it should be able to do way more.</p><p>I am about to add some upgrades to the <a href="https://beambloggers.com/">Beambloggers Webring</a> soon that follow the same vein. I don’t like running a database if I don’t need one. So the MJPEG thing is just in-memory data and a temporary state. I restart it, the connections are gone, and start building up again. Similarly, I want Beambloggers to bring in some fresh information about the different blogs. So I’ll have it run a GenServer that pulls in RSS feeds and parses out some recent items that I can link to. In-memory, background work.</p><p>Such use cases are something I’d hesitate to do in Python, for example. If I build something stateful in Python, I feel like it is bound to leak somewhere. Elixir and Erlang have abstractions that allow me to do such things with confidence.</p><h2 id="you-also-do-elixir-consulting-what-kinds-of-applications-do-your-clients-choose-the-beam-for-as-opposed-to-other-tech-stacks"><br>You also do Elixir consulting. What kinds of applications do your clients choose the BEAM for, as opposed to other tech stacks?</h2><p><strong>Lars: </strong>Distributed applications that run indefinitely. Those line up with the absolute majority of work I’ve ever done. Servers, services, and web applications. If I were building large amounts of CLI tooling, I wouldn’t pick it. If I needed native desktop bindings, I wouldn’t pick it. But generally, I’m in the web application world.</p><p>As the cultural successor to Ruby on Rails, I am seeing Phoenix being used all over the place and quite popular with startups. I have seen a lot of companies picking up Elixir without necessarily knowing much about OTP. I think this is fine, and mostly speaks to the maturity of Phoenix and Ecto that people don’t need to.</p><h2 id="in-the-era-of-kubernetes-and-microservices-where-do-you-see-monolithic-beam-applications-fit-into-the-picture">In the era of Kubernetes and Microservices, where do you see monolithic BEAM applications fit into the picture?</h2><p><strong>Lars:</strong> It is interesting. The way Erlang structures things in multiple <em>applications</em> on a <em>node</em> as part of a <em>cluster</em> brings in some infrastructure concerns. I think some people worry that this unconventional approach is a problem when working in a polyglot environment, for example. I don’t think so. Lots of people put the BEAM in their containers and ship it out to the Kubernetes cluster in the same way as every other stack. Microservices tend to be about the contracts you expose, not the internals of how the application runs. Therefore, the fact you run a BEAM application or even a cluster of BEAM applications as one service is perfectly fine.</p><p>Where I believe much of the power of BEAM is though, is if you don’t rely on microservices and a polyglot-heavy environment. You might then be able to cut off a lot of dead weight. Or at least, manage the complexity using tools you know, rather than write YAML until it goes away. Some of the tools are there by design; others are perhaps, what we should be building in the future. I’ve gotten into it to some extent in my blog post <a href="https://underjord.io/the-beam-marches-forward.html"><em>The BEAM marches forward.</em></a></p><p><br>For an in-between path, I would take a look at <a href="https://www.nomadproject.io/">Nomad</a> which seems to be a slightly lighter Kubernetes competitor that can run things without containers. I think it suits the BEAM very well, as Elixir releases handle many of the perks of containerization. I haven’t tried it but if you do, let me know. I am curious about how Nomad differs from Kubernetes.</p><h2 id="as-someone-listening-to-podcasts-for-over-15-years-i-can-t-help-but-ask-how-does-one-get-the-courage-to-host-a-podcast">As someone listening to podcasts for over 15 years, I can’t help but ask. How does one get the courage to host a podcast?</h2><p><strong>Lars:</strong> I don’t think I’m particularly brave. You should see how uncomfortable I am on ladders.</p><p>I think I picked up a habit of pressing through discomfort partly in my teens and partly running a startup with a mentor of mine. When I was around 14, my dad passed away, essentially a heart attack out of the blue. That experience totally shifted my threshold for pain or discomfort and deeply changed how I approached life. That change in attitude was probably part of why I was keen to do the startup. And the startup led to everything else. Turns out that running a business when I barely knew what I was doing as a technical lead was a constant exercise in being okay with discomfort.</p><p>I don’t recommend overworking. I don’t recommend burning yourself out on a startup. Yet, the discomfort is part of the learning sometimes. If you spend a lot of time outside your comfort zone, you are likely to learn more. Being aware that you are choosing discomfort and staying with it is powerful.</p><p>Oh, a podcast? Well, you get asked on as a guest and enjoy it. And then, when the OG host goes off to start a new one, you get contacted as one of the potential new hosts. And since you try not to worry too much and are willing to tackle discomfort, you fret about it for a bit, ask too many questions, and then give it a shot.</p><p><strong>Lars:</strong> It might feel daunting at first. Don’t feel pressure to understand the BEAM, Erlang, OTP, and all of that good stuff right away. If you are an inexperienced developer, any language can seem imposing. We all end up being beginners when we move over to a new ecosystem. I think we will all be happier if we concede that we will not master everything and will only learn a portion of it. What one should focus on instead is building software well.</p></div>

        <div><p>We periodically update our Terms of Service to make sure they are clear, easy to understand and meet the needs of our partners, advertisers and viewers. Starting today, we’re rolling out an updated Terms of Service in the United States. These new terms will be effective in countries outside of the United States in mid-year 2021. Please read through the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/t/terms">updated terms</a> carefully, they include the following changes.</p><p>First, our Terms of Service already expressly state that you are not allowed to “collect or harvest any information that might identify a person (for example, usernames), unless permitted by that person.” This has always included facial recognition data, and with today’s updated Terms of Service, we are making that explicitly clear.</p><p>Second, ads can now appear on videos from channels not in the YouTube Partner Program (YPP), and we will begin gradually placing ads on brand safe videos. This is part of our ongoing investments in new solutions, like Home Feed ads, that help advertisers responsibly tap into the full scale of YouTube to connect with their audiences and grow their businesses. Advertisers will continue to have full access to our brand suitability controls. Over the past three years, we improved our ability to identify appropriate placements for advertisers, in part by working closely with our advertising partners and <a href="https://wfanet.org/knowledge/item/2020/09/23/WFA-and-platforms-make-major-progress-to-address-harmful-content">industry organizations</a>. Because these channels are not in YPP, there is no creator revenue share, but creators can still apply to YPP once they hit the <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/72851?hl=en">eligibility criteria</a>, which remains the same.</p><p>Finally, for U.S. creators in YPP, our updated Terms state that any revenue payments from YouTube will now be treated as royalties from a U.S. tax perspective, and that Google will withhold taxes from these payments if it is required by law. U.S. creators will generally be unaffected by these withholding taxes as long as they provide valid tax documentation in <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/2490070?hl=en">Adsense</a>. For creators outside of the U.S., we will provide more details in 2021 as the terms become available in their countries.</p><p>You can view the previous Terms of Service and how it compares with this update in our <a href="https://yt.be/help/ToS20">help forum</a>.</p></div>

	<img src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/thumb.png" alt="FrontPage: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly thumbnail">
	
	

	<p>PLEASE don't use FrontPage for modern web development! It's filled with security vulnerabilities and obsolete standards. The goal of this is not to convince you otherwise. The newest version came out almost two decades ago!</p>

<p>Microsoft FrontPage. The mere mention of that name is making most (if not all) of you seasoned web devs groan. "FrontPage was utter rubbish from dark ages of GeoCities" you say. "Everything it touched was ruined with horrific output and proprietary nonsense!" And yes, it was.</p>
<p>But... FrontPage as a concept. As a dream of what could have been, and a window into what <em>was</em>. Letting the typical home user at the time create websites, express creativity, and conquer the world by storm, all without being forced to learn HTML or CSS or JavaScript... In that regard, FrontPage couldn't be beat.</p>
<p>Let's talk about why Microsoft FrontPage was for a brief period of time the ultimate content creation tool of the Internet, and why it later fell from grace.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before we can talk about goodness and ugliness, we need to talk about carphones and business meetings. Because this was 1994, when the Internet was still really new. At that point in time most internet chatter occured on Usenet groups (think something like Reddit) or BBS systems (think something like <a href="https://invisibleup.com//articles/5/">old AOL</a>; example pictured below). If you needed buisness stuff, like stocks or the such, you had to log onto the BBS of whoever had what you needed. This was kind of a pain.</p>
<p><img alt="A picture of a BBS (tilde.town) as of today" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/BBS.png"></p>
<p>Enter Randy Forgaard and Charles H. Ferguson. Ferguson, renowned computer industry consultant, contacted MIT graduate Forgaard (over carphone, in case you were wondering) to discuss starting a new, internet-based company.</p>
<p>His idea was that many corporations such as the Dow Jones, Bloomberg, Apple, etc. were sinking millions into building their own, completely incompatible dial-in Internet services. Therefore, they should create a standardized, completely open server/client combo to replace all the independent efforts. This hopefully would reduce the cost of development for those corporations, and provide a market for growth by making buisnesses <em>want</em> to have an Interent presence.</p>
<p>The two decided to found their own company, Vermeer Technologies, Inc. A month later, still in the planning stages, they caught wind of the brand new World Wide Web out of CERN. It was decentralized, open, and even more robust than they were planning. It was just about perfect. The only issue was that it was rather a pain to make websites if you were just some lowly advertising manager or whoever. The web needed an authoring tool for websites.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage 1.0a, taken from WinWorldPC.com" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-1.0.png"></p>
<p>So, somehow, they managed to hire many professional coders for no salary whatsoever to work on FrontPage. (Early start-up culture, perhaps?) Evidently it worked, as FrontPage was released (only!) a week behind schedule on October of 1995. By then the World Wide Web was exploding, with a 20% increase in sites <em>per month</em>. FrontPage also managed to explode, receiving many awards and positive reviews. In fact, it was so good that Microsoft ended up buying them out. According to them, not only did it feel like a native Office application, it was perfect for their ongoing plan to become more internet centric.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage 97, taken from WinWorldPC.com" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-97.png"></p>
<p>FrontPage over the years got integrated into the Office suite and made a flagship product for Microsoft productivity products. By Office 2000, FrontPage had more Office integration than you should shake a stick at; nailing down the Office user interface and allowing imports and exports across the whole suite. There's... other stuff as well, but let's stay positive for now.</p>
<p>I'll be covering FrontPage 2002, as that's the version I own, and the one I have the most experience with.</p>
<h2>The Good</h2>
<p>The interface... is (in my opinion) one of the best interfaces for any program ever. No hyperbole. I think only the other Microsoft applications of the era like PowerPoint and Visio can top it. I can <em>see</em> why it won awards.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage's start screen with no webs open" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Start.png"></p>
<p>Like any other Microsoft Office XP program, there's the sidebar on the right with common tasks. What you'll probably want to do is, of course, make a new site.</p>
<p>FrontPage's equivalent to "projects" are called "Webs". These Webs contain the files (all your HTML, CSS, images, etc.) and preferences (such as which web server to sync up with or what compatibility settings to use) for that website.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage's template selector" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-NewWeb.png"></p>
<p>Start by selecting a new "Empty Web". Up pops a bunch of templates, including the "Empty Web" template. A bit odd, but sure.</p>
<p><img alt="The &quot;Personal Homepage&quot; template in action" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Template.png"></p>
<p>If you <em>were</em> to choose a template, it would give you a pre-populated fill-in-the-blanks site ready for your words and pictures. It takes some of the layout work and design originality out of it, but that <em>is</em> the purpose of a template after all. (Although, as a word of advice, <em>don't use these.</em> They're rather awfully designed from a web standards point of view. You can see it barely fitting in my window there. Imagine that on a smartphone.)</p>
<p><img src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-BlankWeb.png" alt="FrontPage open to a new blank web. Folder list and Views bar are visible."></p>
<p>Anyways, once you open your blank web, you get... nothing! (That's what you asked for, isn't it?) No worries. Really, if you think about it, it would be rather silly to start making a page off the bat. You see, FrontPage takes a <em>project oriented</em> approach to things. While you easily <em>could</em> just sit down and start banging stuff out, that's really not the way FrontPage wants you to go.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage Navigation editor with some pages created and linked up." src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-NavView.png"></p>
<p>Here's probably my favorite FrontPage feature: the Navigation editor. Here you create blank pages and link them together in a logical hierarchy. This closely resembles the process you'd usually take on paper when designing a website.</p>
<p><img alt="Navigation bar settings dialog" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Navbar.png"></p>
<p>With this hierarchy, you can automatically create a navigation bar in all your pages that are properly linked. If you decide to make a new top-level page, for instance, every page on your site will be updated to feature that page. (To replicate that feature on this site, I had to use some pretty tricky template scripting with my custom Flask server. I'd vastly prefer something like this.)</p>
<p>This feature is also nice because it forces you to <em>think about your site</em>. You can't just sit down like it's Microsoft Word and bang out some pages. You need a coherent plan. Before you can even start, you need to sit down with your client/team/self and ask "What do you want on your website?" To most people it's obvious that you need a website. Everybody has a website. What's significantly less obvious is <em>what</em> needs to be on the website. And FrontPage's web editor allows you to play around with hierarchies and layouts before commiting to anything.</p>
<p><img alt="PowerPoint Slide Sorter mode&quot;" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/PPT-SlideSorter.png"></p>
<p>One thing that's intersting is that Word, PowerPoint and Access all (vaguely) follow a similar model. Word has the Outline editor, PowerPoint has the Slide Sorter mode (pictured above, showing an interactive game I made when I was 11), and Access, being a typical database program, requires you to declare your tables before you can work on them.</p>
<p>What's even more interesting is that, with the exception of Access (which not many people used, mostly due to its cost and relative rarity), you were never <em>required</em> to have a plan before starting. Most people I've seen use Word just do straight typing, or perhaps work off another document with an outline. But the option was there! One could do their outline <em>in their document</em> and flesh out around that. Likewise with PowerPoint, as well.</p>
<p><img alt="Highlighted template include code" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-TemplateInclude.png"></p>
<p>Another common task in web design is defining a "template" page where you fill all your content into. For example, every page on this site you're reading on now has the same header and footer, and every article has the same sort of thumbnail image at the top. That was all scripted using template features.</p>
<p>FrontPage, being an Office product, supports templates. The implementation admittedly is <em>super</em> janky, but it's there. You can include pages within other pages just fine, it's just a little tricky to set up. (FYI, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint do templates too. It's one of their lesser-known features, IMHO.)</p>
<p><img alt="Report view window" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Reports.png"></p>
<p>Another really neat feature: reports. Like a compiler in an IDE, FrontPage produces warnings, errors, and statistics for your site. At a glance I can view all broken links, orphaned pages, oversized images, etc. This is a <em>fantastic</em> feature, something that modern web dev software just <em>doesn't</em> have.</p>
<p><img alt="Hyperlinks view window" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Links.png"></p>
<p>In the same vein as the Reports, you can see at a glance what links to what. It's a lot like the call chart in a software development IDE. I can see quickly every site linked from any page (shown here is <a href="https://invisibleup.com//articles/24/">the Sonic R color fix article</a>) and any subpages.</p>
<p><img alt="Tasks view, showing a task labeled &quot;Write FrontPage article&quot;" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Tasks.png"></p>
<p>Last feature, although this isn't nearly as useful in the year 2020. In the tasks view, you can put up a list of tasks that needs to be accomplished. Already that seems rather nice for keeping track of what you need to do. It's a lot like GitHub or GitLab's issue tracker, in a sense.</p>
<p>However, if you connect to a server with FrontPage Web Extensions (I'll get to that...), you can share this task list with other people. You can (again, like an issue tracker) put up a task to be done by someone else and work on a task that somebody else put up. It's a <em>very</em> nice feature for web development, but nowadays this is normally handled by source control providers like GitHub or GitLab.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage editing the Sonic R color mod article" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Editor.png"></p>
<p>And, of course, there's the webpage editor. This works almost exactly like Microsoft Word, with some web-flavored spice. You type words and they appear in the page. You make those words blue, they're blue. <em>That said</em>, when you edit elements like that, it inserts an HTML 3.2 style <code>&lt;FONT&gt;</code> tag instead of trying to match it to a CSS rule. There's ways around this, but you have to be very diligent in doing so. This is mostly just due to FrontPage being a product of its time, though.</p>
<p>FrontPage is a program about planning, executing, and reviewing. Take the Navigation editor. You plan out the content of your site. You sketch up the layout. Then you reflect on if your layout matches your requirements. Or the Reports. Create content, check reports. Or the Tasks. Plan out what you need to do, do that, and then check if the task is complete. That, right …</p></article></div>

<p>Sometimes I find these AI / programming hobby projects that I just wished I had thought of… </p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/willstedden/"><strong>Will Stedden</strong></a> combined OpenAI’s <strong><a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/">GPT-2</a></strong> deep learning text generation model with another deep-learning language model by Google called <strong><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/bert-explained-state-of-the-art-language-model-for-nlp-f8b21a9b6270">BERT</a></strong> (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and created an elaborate architecture that had one purpose: <strong><em>posting the best replies on Reddit.</em></strong></p>



<p>The architecture is shown at the end of this post — copied from Will’s original blog<em> <a href="https://www.bonkerfield.org/2020/02/combining-gpt-2-and-bert/">here</a></em>. Moreover, you can read&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bonkerfield.org/2020/02/reddit-bot-gpt2-bert/">this post</a>&nbsp;for details regarding the construction of the system. But let me see whether I can explain you what it does in simple language. </p>



<p>The below is what a Reddit comment and reply thread looks like. We have <em>str8cokane </em>making a comment to an original post (not in the picture), and then <em>tupperware-party</em> making a reply to that comment, followed by another reply by <em>str8cokane</em>. Basically, Will wanted to create an AI/bot that could write replies like <em>tupperware-party</em> that real people like <em>str8cokane</em> would not be able to distinguish from “real-people” replies.</p>



<p>Note that with 4 <strong>points</strong>, <em>str8cokane</em>‘s original comments was <em><strong>“liked”</strong></em> more than <em>tupperware-party</em>‘s reply and <em>str8cokane</em>‘s next reply, which were only <strong><em>upvoted </em></strong>2 and 1 times respectively.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.bonkerfield.org/assets/images/2020/tupperware-party3.png" alt="gpt2-bert on China"><figcaption>Example reddit comment and replies (via <a href="https://www.bonkerfield.org/2020/02/combining-gpt-2-and-bert/">bonkerfield.org/</a>)</figcaption></figure>



<p>So here’s what the final architecture looks like, and my attempt to explain it to you.</p>



<ol><li>Basically, we start in the upper left corner, where Will uses a database (i.e. <em>corpus</em>) of Reddit comments and replies to fine-tune a standard, pretrained GPT-2 model to get it to be good at <strong>generating (red: “fake”) realistic Reddit replies</strong>. </li><li>Next, in the upper middle section, these fake replies are piped into a standard, pretrained BERT model, along with the original, real Reddit comments and replies. This way the BERT model sees both real and fake comments and replies. Now, <strong>our goal is to make replies that are undistinguishable from real replies</strong>. Hence, this is the task the BERT model gets. And we keep fine-tuning the original GPT-2 generator until the BERT discriminator that follows is no longer able to distinguish fake from real replies. Then the generator is “fooling” the discriminator, and we know we are generating fake replies that look like real ones! <br><em>You can find more information about such generative adversarial networks <a href="https://paulvanderlaken.com/2017/10/30/generative-adversarial-networks-gan-explained/">here</a>.</em></li><li>Next, in the top right corner, we fine-tune another BERT model. This time we give it the original Reddit comments and replies along with the amount of times they were upvoted (i.e. sort of like likes on facebook/twitter). Basically, we train a BERT model to <strong>predict for a given reply, how much likes it is going to get</strong>.</li><li>Finally, we can go to production in the lower lane. We give a real-life comment to the GPT-2 generator we trained in the upper left corner, which produces several fake replies for us. These candidates we run through the BERT discriminator we trained in the upper middle section, which determined which of the fake replies we generated look most real. Those fake but realistic replies are then input into our trained BERT model of the top right corner, which predicts for every fake but realistic reply the amount of likes/upvotes it is going to get. Finally, <strong>we pick and reply with the fake but realistic reply that is predicted to get the most upvotes!</strong></li></ol>



<figure><p><a href="https://www.bonkerfield.org/assets/images/2020/gpt2_bert_workflow.png"><img src="https://www.bonkerfield.org/assets/images/2020/gpt2_bert_workflow.png"></a>
</p><figcaption>What Will’s final architecture, combining GPT-2 and BERT, looked like (via <a href="https://www.bonkerfield.org/2020/02/combining-gpt-2-and-bert/">bonkerfield.org</a>)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The results are astonishing! Will’s bot sounds like a real youngster internet troll! Do have a look at <a href="https://www.bonkerfield.org/2020/02/combining-gpt-2-and-bert/">the original blog</a>, but here are some examples. Note that <em>tupperware-party</em> — the Reddit user from the above example — is actually Will’s AI. </p>



<figure><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sciencefiction/comments/evqiti/dune_logo_unveiled_at_event_copyright_claimants/fg44yzw/?context=3"><img src="https://www.bonkerfield.org/assets/images/2020/tupperware-party1.png" alt="COMMENT: 'Dune’s fandom is old and intense, and a rich thread in the cultural fabric of the internet generation' BOT_REPLY:'Dune’s fandom is overgrown, underfunded, and in many ways, a poor fit for the new, faster internet generation.'"></a></figure>



<figure><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/ep6pyq/playa_lung/feilsjn/?context=8&amp;depth=9"><img src="https://www.bonkerfield.org/assets/images/2020/tupperware-party2.png" alt="bot responds to specific numerical bullet point in source comment"></a></figure>



<p>Will ends his blog with <a href="https://www.bonkerfield.org/2020/02/reddit-bot-gpt2-bert/">a link to the tutorial</a> if you want to build such a bot yourself. Have a try!</p>



<p>Moreover, he also notes the ethical concerns:</p>



<blockquote><p>I know there are definitely some ethical considerations when creating something like this. The reason I’m presenting it is because I actually think it is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/company-wants-billions-make-ai-safe-humanity/">better</a>&nbsp;for more people to know about and be able to grapple with this kind of technology. If just a few people know about the capacity of these machines, then it is more likely that those small groups of people can abuse their advantage.</p><p>I also think that this technology is going to change the way we think about what’s important about being human. After all, if a computer can effectively automate the paper-pushing jobs we’ve constructed and all the bullshit we create on the internet to distract us, then maybe it’ll be time for us to move on to something more meaningful.</p><p>If you think what I’ve done is a problem feel free to&nbsp;email me&nbsp;, or publically shame me on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/bonkerfield">Twitter</a>.</p><cite>Will Stedden via <a href="https://www.bonkerfield.org/2020/02/combining-gpt-2-and-bert/">bonkerfield.org/2020/02/combining-gpt-2-and-bert/</a></cite></blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>10.</p><div id="text">
				
				<p>We cycled the Swiss part of the Rhine Cycleway last week, with our <a href="https://www.bikefriday.com/bicycles/touring/1248">folding</a> <a href="http://airnimal.eu/products/chameleon/performance-sport/">bikes</a> neatly stowed in suitcases for the flight. A combination of <em><a href="http://cycle.travel/">cycle.travel</a></em> (natch), the Cicerone guide, and the excellent <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/mapout/id477094081?l=en&amp;mt=8">MapOut</a> app guided us safely along the way: a very modern combination of mapping styles.</p><p>Wandering around Zürich, waiting for our flight home, I was intrigued by this cycle map in the window of a (closed) antiquarian bookstore:</p><p><img src="http://blog.systemed.net/images/original/strassenprofilkarte_1.jpg"></p><p>And if that isn’t clear enough from the pic snatched through a window, here’s a better excerpt from <a href="http://www.ak-ansichtskarten.de/shop/ak/46/back4684588/Rueckseite-Deutsche-Strassenprofilkarte-fuer-Radfahrer-Strassburg-und-Umgebung-Naumann-s-Fahrraeder-Seidel-Naumann-Dresden.jpg">an example</a> I found online:</p><p><img src="http://blog.systemed.net/images/original/strassenprofilkarte_2.jpg"></p><p>On major climbs, rather than strictly following the two-dimensional curves of the route as a conventional map would do, the map shows a miniature gradient profile for that particular hill.</p><p>Bending geometry to show a subjective view of space is nothing unusual. The Tube map (and its many imitators) famously do it, as do the one-dimensional strip maps that Laurence Penney has <a href="http://www.youshouldliketypetoo.com/blog/misc/one-dimensional-maps/">lovingly curated</a>&nbsp;(and, indeed, one of Laurence’s maps has a <a href="http://www.youshouldliketypetoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/one-dimensional-maps-14.jpg">passing resemblance</a> to these German sheets). But I’ve never seen quite this approach taken before. It’s a recognition that – just as distance is immaterial to the Tube passenger – to the cyclist, hills are as much part of the ‘distance travelled’ as are the ticking miles on the cycle computer.</p><p>Not that the Radfahrer in question would have had cycle computers, of course. There appear to have been 80 of these sheets, published by&nbsp;Mittelbach's Verlag of Leipzig with the co-operation and support of the national German cycling organisations <em>(unter Mitwirkung der Gauverbände des Deutschen Radfahrerbundes und der Konsulate der Allgemeinen Radfahrer-Union)</em>. They seem to date from the beginning of the 20th century, and are not yet collectable, if the <a href="http://www.abebooks.co.uk/Deutsche-Strassenprofilkarte-Radfahrer-Mitwirkung-Gauverb%C3%A4nde-Deutschen/6461038791/bd">prices on Abebooks</a> are anything to go by.</p><p>And in one of those curious coincidences…</p><p>I originally finished this post with “<span>I don’t expect to see a revival any day soon”, but the day after I posted this, Sustrans Midlands retweeted a link to <a href="https://twitter.com/Lunto_Sustrans/status/496934542880833536">exactly such a map</a>. This ‘Accessible Map’ of Queenstown, New Zealand, was particularly intended for wheelchair users and other people who find steep slopes challenging:</span></p><p><img src="http://blog.systemed.net/images/original/modern_elevation_map.jpg"></p><p><span>You can download the full map as a PDF from drcqueenstown.co.nz. The cartographer, Toby Eglesfield, has also written an <a href="http://www.tobyeglesfield.com/a-map-showing-the-steepness-of-streets/">extensive, well-illustrated blog post</a> explaining the design choices he made – and&nbsp;in the comments, two people raise the idea of generating such a map from OpenStreetMap data.

        <p>The Internet of Things is one of the areas that is hugely benefiting from miniaturization of semiconductor technologies, as more computing power can be encapsulated into increasingly smaller devices. Shrinking in size and requiring less power, various devices - including AI-capable ones - are applied in ways that were not possible a few years ago. One of the new and exciting developments in this space is the emergence of <a href="https://etronamerica.com/products/rpc-dram/">RPC (reduced pin-count) DRAM</a> - a small form factor memory, for which Antmicro has developed support in the open source memory controller, LiteDRAM. Our contribution, already made available on <a href="https://github.com/antmicro/litedram/tree/rpc-dram-support">GitHub</a> is being polished and undergoing final tests, and will be mainlined shortly.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-rpc-dram">What is RPC DRAM</h3>

<p>Standard modern DRAM chips, with their small but not miniscule footprints and rather high I/O requirements, are impossible to use in space-constrained applications. By using a large number of pins in the device they connect to, they can also push the envelope of the device itself even more, requiring larger and more expensive packages of the FPGA or SoC used. <br>
And while many edge devices could easily do with a smaller amount (e.g. sub-1Gb) of RAM than what modern memory parts offer, it is impossible to cut a RAM chip in half and get less memory capacity. Well, at least until now - kind of.</p>

<p>The so-called RPC (Reduced Pin Count) DRAM - a new technology from Etron - has the potential to profoundly impact the AI, IoT and VR/AR markets. It is a tiny memory chip family which can get as small as 1.96mm x 4.63mm, offering 256Mbits and high bandwidth (the same as DDR3) using only 10% of the DDR3 PCB area and only half of the SoC or FPGA pins that the DDR3 memory takes up. Its clock speed can go up to 1200MHz, with bandwidth of up to 4800 Mb/s.</p>

<p><img src="https://antmicro.com/blog/images/LiteDRAM_with_RPC_RAM_blog-note.png" alt="DDR RAM and RPC DRAM comparison"></p>

<p>RPC DRAM is ideal for space-constrained edge AI applications that locally process data such as video, audio or image, where, apart from space saving, low power consumption is critical. The small number of pins used by RPC DRAM leaves more available resources for other system functionalities, while the possibility of stacking multiple RPC DRAM chips on top of one another for further layout optimization makes the technology even more appealing. It also enables interesting scenarios like <a href="https://antmicro.com/blog/2020/10/open-chiplet-initiative/#future-developments">embedding in a chiplet-based SiP</a>, or even bare-die integration with small FPGAs for a powerful, Linux-capable device. But to use the memory with FPGAs, you need to interface with it using a DRAM controller - and that is where our latest work with LiteDRAM comes in.</p>

<h3 id="litedram-and-open-source-ip-ecosystem">LiteDRAM and open source IP ecosystem</h3>

<p>LiteDRAM is a configurable memory controller that is part of LiteX, an open source SoC builder that we are developing and using to design FPGA-based systems. By creating support for RPC DRAM in LiteDRAM we have enabled the miniscule memory to be added to products that we build and to the whole LiteX ecosystem. This enables our customer’s devices to run more compute-hungry applications or full-fledged operating systems such as Linux in dedicated SoCs created by Antmicro on demand.</p>

<p>We use and contribute to LiteDRAM, LiteX and other open source IP to develop unique designs interfaced with DDR memories for high-bandwidth video and other data processing systems; and RPC DRAM support is just one example of the enablement work we are performing in the ecosystem. Combined with the exciting work related to open source we are performing as part of <a href="https://antmicro.com/blog/2020/07/swerv-cores-tools-ecosystem/">CHIPS Alliance</a>, <a href="https://antmicro.com/blog/2020/06/skywater-open-source-pdk/">SkyWater PDK</a> and the fantastic enregy catalyzed by the open <a href="https://antmicro.com/technologies/risc-v/">RISC-V</a> CPU architecture (which is an obvious candidate for combining with RPC RAM both in soft- and hard CPU contexts), future is looking bright for tiny, open, ML-capable systems.</p>

<h3 id="antmicros-open-source-fpga-ip">Antmicro’s open source FPGA IP</h3>

<p>We often use FPGAs to build a wide array of configurable systems for our customers, leveraging the flexibility and customizability that this technology offers. We create open source FPGA IPs that are reusable across various designs and platforms without any licensing restrictions imposed on our customers. Antmicro’s open source IP cores portfolio includes MIPI CSI, MIDI, PCIe, USB, Ethernet etc.</p>

<p>The FPGA systems that we build consist of modern, vendor-neutral components that ensure future-proofness and give our clients full control over the product. Reach out to us at <a href="mailto:contact@antmicro.com">contact@antmicro.com</a> if you’d like to get a specialized FPGA-based system performing complex tasks.</p>

        <p>A wrongful death lawsuit tied to COVID-19 infections in a Waterloo pork processing plant alleges that during the initial stages of the pandemic, Tyson Foods ordered employees to report for work while supervisors privately wagered money on the number of workers who would be sickened by the deadly virus.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the family of the late Isidro Fernandez sued the meatpacking company, alleging Fernandez was exposed to the coronavirus at the Waterloo plant where he worked. The lawsuit alleges Tyson Foods is guilty of a “willful and wanton disregard for workplace safety.”</p>
<p>In a written statement issued Thursday afternoon, Tyson Foods’ president and chief executive officer, Dean Banks, said: “We are extremely upset about the accusations involving some of the leadership at our Waterloo plant. Tyson Foods is a family company with 139,000 team members and these allegations do not represent who we are, or our core values and team behaviors. We expect every team member at Tyson Foods to operate with the utmost integrity and care in everything we do.</p>
<p>“We have suspended, without pay, the individuals allegedly involved and have retained the law firm Covington &amp; Burling LLP to conduct an independent investigation led by former Attorney General Eric Holder. If these claims are confirmed, we’ll take all measures necessary to root out and remove this disturbing behavior from our company.</p>
<p>“Our top priority is and remains the health and safety of our team members.”</p>
<p>Fernandez, who died on April 20, was one of at least five Waterloo plant employees who died of the virus. According to the Black Hawk County Health Department, more than 1,000 workers at the plant — over a third of the facility’s workforce — contracted the virus.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges that despite the uncontrolled spread of the virus at the plant, Tyson required its employees to work long hours in cramped conditions without providing the appropriate personal protective equipment and without ensuring workplace-safety measures were followed.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was recently amended and includes a number of new allegations against the company and plant officials. Among them:</p>
<ul>
<li>In mid-April, around the time Black Hawk County Sherriff Tony Thompson visited the plant and reported the working conditions there “shook [him] to the core,” plant manager Tom Hart organized a cash-buy-in, winner-take-all, betting pool for supervisors and managers to wager how many plant employees would test positive for COVID-19.</li>
<li>John Casey, an upper-level manager at the plant, is alleged to have explicitly directed supervisors to ignore symptoms of COVID-19, telling them to show up to work even if they were exhibiting symptoms of the virus. Casey reportedly referred to COVID-19 as the “glorified flu” and told workers not to worry about it because “it’s not a big deal” and “everyone is going to get it.” On one occasion, Casey intercepted a sick supervisor who was on his way to be tested and ordered him to get back to work, saying, “We all have symptoms — you have a job to do.” After one employee vomited on the production line, managers reportedly allowed the man to continue working and then return to work the next day.</li>
<li>In late March or early April, as the pandemic spread across Iowa, managers at the Waterloo plant reportedly began avoiding the plant floor for fear of contracting the virus. As a result, they increasingly delegated managerial authority and responsibilities to low-level supervisors who had no management training or experience. The supervisors did not require truck drivers and subcontractors to have their temperatures checked before entering the plant.</li>
<li>In March and April, plant supervisors falsely denied the existence of any confirmed cases or positive tests for COVID-19 within the plant, and allegedly told workers they had a responsibility to keep working to ensure Americans didn’t go hungry as the result of a shutdown.</li>
<li>Tyson paid out $500 “thank you bonuses” to employees who turned up for every scheduled shift for three months — a policy decision that allegedly incentivized sick workers to continue reporting for work.</li>
<li>Tyson executives allegedly lobbied Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds for COVID-19 liability protections that would shield the company from lawsuits, and successfully lobbied the governor to declare that only the state government, not local governments, had the authority to close businesses in response to the pandemic.</li>
</ul>
<p>While Tyson has yet to file a formal response to the new allegations, it has said in previous court filings that it “vigorously disputes” the plaintiffs’ claims and has “invested millions of dollars to provide employees with safety and risk-mitigation equipment.”</p>
<p>The lawsuit claims that while Tyson has repeatedly claimed that its operations needed to remain open to feed America, the company increased its exports to China by 600% during the first quarter of 2020.</p>
<p>The lawsuit is seeking unspecified damages for fraudulent misrepresentation and gross negligence.</p>
<p>The case was initially filed in state court, claiming violations of Iowa law. At Tyson’s request, the case was moved to federal court, with the company claiming it had remained open during the pandemic “at the direction of a federal officer” — President Donald Trump, who, on April 28, invoked his authority under the <a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2020/05/04/trumps-critics-warn-his-order-to-keep-meat-plants-open-imperils-workers/">Defense Production Act</a> and ordered meat and poultry processing companies to continue operating.</p>
<p>The nonprofit organization Public Citizen has filed an amicus brief in the case, supporting the Fernandez family’s efforts to remand the action back to state court. In its brief, Public Citizen has said that neither the Defense Production Act nor the executive order signed by President Trump had “directed” Tyson to do anything.</p>
<p>The Waterloo facility is Tyson’s largest pork plant in the United States. The facility employs approximately 2,800 workers who process approximately 19,500 hogs per day.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-content-area">
<p><img src="https://www.cloudsavvyit.com/thumbcache/0/0/48301387cddb344c254ee94cde7f04d7/p/uploads/2020/11/db6591d4-1.png" alt="" width="700" height="313"></p>
<p>With the rising demand for HPC and AI-powered cloud applications comes a need for very powerful datacenter GPUs. Usually NVIDIA is the king of this field, but AMD’s latest MI100 GPU presents some serious competition.</p>
<h2 role="heading" aria-level="2">A Card For The HPC Market</h2>
<p>The card is fast, seriously fast. NVIDIA’s high end A100 GPU peaks at&nbsp;9.7 TFLOPS in FP64 workloads. The new “AMD Instinct MI100” leaps past that at 11.5 TFLOPS.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.cloudsavvyit.com/thumbcache/0/0/2f6292f97a12046b544017f07246a4f8/p/uploads/2020/11/8d6e8097.png" alt="" width="700" height="312"></p>
<p>Of course, NVIDIA’s cards support other speedup techniques for AI-specific workloads in different number formats, such as the TensorFloat-32 precision format and<a href="https://www.cloudsavvyit.com/4796/nvidias-new-ampere-gpu-is-a-game-changer-for-artificial-intelligence/"> fine-grained structured sparsity</a>. For AI and Machine Learning workloads, NVIDIA is still king, as their cards are built specifically for tensor-based operations.</p>
<p>But, for general purpose High Performance Computing, the MI100 takes the crown for raw compute power. Plus, it’s nearly half the price, and is much more efficient per watt.</p>
<p>On top of the other improvements, the new architecture also brings mixed-precision improvements, with their “Matrix Core” technology delivering 7x greater FP16 performance compared to their prior generation of cards.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.cloudsavvyit.com/thumbcache/0/0/6588bb99d6c97c60163b08630e9b8d86/p/uploads/2020/11/292c692b.png" alt="" width="700" height="216"></p>
<p>AMD CPUs and Instinct GPUS are <a href="https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/frontier/">both powering two of the US Department of Energy’s exascale supercomputers</a>. The “Frontier” supercomputer is planned to be built next year with current Epyc CPUs and MI100s, and will deliver more than 1.5 exaflops of peak computing power. The “El Capitan” supercomputer is planned to be built in 2023 on next gen hardware, and will deliver more than 2 exaflops of double precision power.</p>
<h2 role="heading" aria-level="2">Can ROCm Live Up to CUDA?</h2>
<p>Of course, all of this power is useless if the software doesn’t support it. It’s no secret that NVIDIA has managed to make machine learning a bit of a walled garden.</p>
<p>NVIDIA’s compute framework is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA">CUDA</a>, or&nbsp;Compute Unified Device Architecture. It’s proprietary, and only works with their cards. But since their cards have historically been the fastest, many applications are only built with CUDA support first and foremost.</p>
<p>There are cross-platform programming models, most notably OpenCL, which AMD supports very well <a href="https://rocmdocs.amd.com/en/latest/">with their ROCm platform</a>. Both NVIDIA cards and AMD cards support OpenCL, but because NVIDIA only supports it by transpiling to CUDA, it’s actually slower to use OpenCL with an NVIDIA card. Because of this, not all applications will support it.</p>
<p>Ultimately, you’ll need to do your own research and see if the application you intend to run can be run on AMD cards, and maybe be prepared for some tinkering and bug fixing. NVIDIA GPUs on the otherhand are mostly plug and play, so even if AMD is faster, NVIDIA can continue to hinder them with closed-source software.</p>
<p>However, this situation is getting better—AMD is committed to open sourcing everything and creating an open environment. Tensorflow and PyTorch, two very popular ML frameworks, both support the ROCm ecosystem.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.cloudsavvyit.com/thumbcache/0/0/03aae3c52689bd7fd58e8278df8fefac/p/uploads/2020/11/301c98b9.png" alt="" width="697" height="479"></p>
<p>Hopefully the raw specs of AMD’s latest offerings can push the industry to a more competitive environment. After all, they’re being put to use in supercomputers</p>

<div id="running-pip">
<h2>Running pip<a href="#running-pip" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>pip is a command line program. When you install pip, a <code><span>pip</span></code> command is added
to your system, which can be run from the command prompt as follows:</p>
<div>
<p><label for="tab-set--0-input--1">Unix/macOS</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>python -m pip &lt;pip arguments&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><code><span>python</span> <span>-m</span> <span>pip</span></code> executes pip using the Python interpreter you
specified as python. So <code><span>/usr/bin/python3.7</span> <span>-m</span> <span>pip</span></code> means
you are executing pip for your interpreter located at /usr/bin/python3.7.</p>
</div>
<p><label for="tab-set--0-input--2">Windows</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>py -m pip &lt;pip arguments&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><code><span>py</span> <span>-m</span> <span>pip</span></code> executes pip using the latest Python interpreter you
have installed. For more details, read the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#launcher">Python Windows launcher</a> docs.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="installing-packages">
<h2>Installing Packages<a href="#installing-packages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>pip supports installing from <a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPI</a>, version control, local projects, and
directly from distribution files.</p>
<p>The most common scenario is to install from <a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPI</a> using <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_install/#requirement-specifiers"><span>Requirement Specifiers</span></a></p>
<div>

</div>
<div id="basic-authentication-credentials">
<h2>Basic Authentication Credentials<a href="#basic-authentication-credentials" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>pip supports basic authentication credentials. Basically, in the URL there is
a username and password separated by <code><span>:</span></code>.</p>
<p><code><span>https://[username[:password]@]pypi.company.com/simple</span></code></p>
<p>Certain special characters are not valid in the authentication part of URLs.
If the user or password part of your login credentials contain any of the
special characters
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding#Percent-encoding_reserved_characters">here</a>
then they must be percent-encoded. For example, for a
user with username “user” and password “he//o” accessing a repository at
pypi.company.com, the index URL with credentials would look like:</p>
<p><code><span>https://user:he%2F%2Fo@pypi.company.com</span></code></p>
<p>Support for percent-encoded authentication in index URLs was added in pip 10.0.0
(in <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/3236">#3236</a>). Users that must use authentication
for their Python repository on systems with older pip versions should make the latest
get-pip.py available in their environment to bootstrap pip to a recent-enough version.</p>
<p>For indexes that only require single-part authentication tokens, provide the token
as the “username” and do not provide a password, for example -</p>
<p><code><span>https://0123456789abcdef@pypi.company.com</span></code></p>
<div id="netrc-support">
<h3>netrc Support<a href="#netrc-support" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If no credentials are part of the URL, pip will attempt to get authentication credentials
for the URL’s hostname from the user’s .netrc file. This behaviour comes from the underlying
use of <a href="https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/authentication/#netrc-authentication">requests</a> which in turn delegates it to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/netrc.html">Python standard library</a>.</p>
<p>The .netrc file contains login and initialization information used by the auto-login process.
It resides in the user’s home directory. The .netrc file format is simple. You specify lines
with a machine name and follow that with lines for the login and password that are
associated with that machine. Machine name is the hostname in your URL.</p>
<p>An example .netrc for the host example.com with a user named ‘daniel’, using the password
‘qwerty’ would look like:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>machine example.com
login daniel
password qwerty
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>As mentioned in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/netrc.html">standard library docs</a>,
only ASCII characters are allowed. Whitespace and non-printable characters are not allowed in passwords.</p>
</div>
<div id="keyring-support">
<h3>Keyring Support<a href="#keyring-support" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>pip also supports credentials stored in your keyring using the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/keyring/">keyring</a>
library. Note that <code><span>keyring</span></code> will need to be installed separately, as pip
does not come with it included.</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>pip install keyring
<span>echo</span> your-password <span>|</span> keyring <span>set</span> pypi.company.com your-username

<h2>Using a Proxy Server<a href="#using-a-proxy-server" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When installing packages from <a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPI</a>, pip requires internet access, which
in many corporate environments requires an outbound HTTP proxy server.</p>
<p>pip can be configured to connect through a proxy server in various ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>using the <code><span>--proxy</span></code> command-line option to specify a proxy in the form
<code><span>[user:passwd@]proxy.server:port</span></code></p></li>
<li><p>using <code><span>proxy</span></code> in a <a href="#config-file"><span>Config file</span></a></p></li>
<li><p>by setting the standard environment-variables <code><span>http_proxy</span></code>, <code><span>https_proxy</span></code>
and <code><span>no_proxy</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>using the environment variable <code><span>PIP_USER_AGENT_USER_DATA</span></code> to include
a JSON-encoded string in the user-agent variable used in pip’s requests.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="requirements-files">
<h2>Requirements Files<a href="#requirements-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>“Requirements files” are files containing a list of items to be
installed using <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_install/#pip-install"><span>pip install</span></a> like so:</p>
<div>
<p><label for="tab-set--2-input--1">Unix/macOS</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p><label for="tab-set--2-input--2">Windows</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Details on the format of the files are here: <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_install/#requirements-file-format"><span>Requirements File Format</span></a>.</p>
<p>Logically, a Requirements file is just a list of <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_install/#pip-install"><span>pip install</span></a> arguments
placed in a file. Note that you should not rely on the items in the file being
installed by pip in any particular order.</p>
<p>In practice, there are 4 common uses of Requirements files:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Requirements files are used to hold the result from <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_freeze/#pip-freeze"><span>pip freeze</span></a> for the
purpose of achieving <a href="#repeatability"><span>repeatable installations</span></a>.  In
this case, your requirement file contains a pinned version of everything that
was installed when <code><span>pip</span> <span>freeze</span></code> was run.</p>
<div>
<p><label for="tab-set--3-input--1">Unix/macOS</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>python -m pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p><label for="tab-set--3-input--2">Windows</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>py -m pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Requirements files are used to force pip to properly resolve dependencies.
pip 20.2 and earlier <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/988">doesn’t have true dependency resolution</a>, but instead simply uses the first
specification it finds for a project. E.g. if <code><span>pkg1</span></code> requires
<code><span>pkg3&gt;=1.0</span></code> and <code><span>pkg2</span></code> requires <code><span>pkg3&gt;=1.0,&lt;=2.0</span></code>, and if <code><span>pkg1</span></code> is
resolved first, pip will only use <code><span>pkg3&gt;=1.0</span></code>, and could easily end up
installing a version of <code><span>pkg3</span></code> that conflicts with the needs of <code><span>pkg2</span></code>.
To solve this problem, you can place <code><span>pkg3&gt;=1.0,&lt;=2.0</span></code> (i.e. the correct
specification) into your requirements file directly along with the other top
level requirements. Like so:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>pkg1</span>
<span>pkg2</span>
<span>pkg3</span><span>&gt;=</span><span>1.0</span><span>,</span><span>&lt;=</span><span>2.0</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Requirements files are used to force pip to install an alternate version of a
sub-dependency.  For example, suppose <code><span>ProjectA</span></code> in your requirements file
requires <code><span>ProjectB</span></code>, but the latest version (v1.3) has a bug, you can force
pip to accept earlier versions like so:</p>

</li>
<li><p>Requirements files are used to override a dependency with a local patch that
lives in version control.  For example, suppose a dependency
<code><span>SomeDependency</span></code> from PyPI has a bug, and you can’t wait for an upstream
fix.
You could clone/copy the src, make the fix, and place it in VCS with the tag
<code><span>sometag</span></code>.  You’d reference it in your requirements file with a line like
so:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>git</span><span>+</span><span>https</span><span>:</span><span>//</span><span>myvcs</span><span>.</span><span>com</span><span>/</span><span>some_dependency</span><span>@sometag</span><span>#egg=SomeDependency</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If <code><span>SomeDependency</span></code> was previously a top-level requirement in your
requirements file, then <strong>replace</strong> that line with the new line. If
<code><span>SomeDependency</span></code> is a sub-dependency, then <strong>add</strong> the new line.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s important to be clear that pip determines package dependencies using
<a href="https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#declaring-dependencies">install_requires metadata</a>,
not by discovering <code><span>requirements.txt</span></code> files embedded in projects.</p>

</ul>
</div>
<div id="constraints-files">
<h2>Constraints Files<a href="#constraints-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Constraints files are requirements files that only control which version of a
requirement is installed, not whether it is installed or not. Their syntax and
contents is nearly identical to <a href="#requirements-files"><span>Requirements Files</span></a>. There is one key
difference: Including a package in a constraints file does not trigger
installation of the package.</p>
<p>Use a constraints file like so:</p>
<div>
<p><label for="tab-set--4-input--1">Unix/macOS</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>python -m pip install -c constraints.txt
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p><label for="tab-set--4-input--2">Windows</label></p><div>
<div><div><pre><span></span>py -m pip install -c constraints.txt
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Constraints files are used for exactly the same reason as requirements files
when you don’t know exactly what things you want to install. For instance, say
that the “helloworld” package doesn’t work in your environment, so you have a
local patched version. Some things you install depend on “helloworld”, and some
don’t.</p>
<p>One way to ensure that the patched version is used consistently is to
manually audit the dependencies of everything you install, and if “helloworld”
is present, write a requirements file to use when installing that thing.</p>
<p>Constraints files offer a better way: write a single constraints file for your
organisation and use that everywhere. If the thing being installed requires
“helloworld” to be installed, your fixed version specified in your constraints
file will be used.</p>
<p>Constraints file support was added in pip 7.1. In <a href="#resolver-changes-2020"><span>Changes to the pip dependency resolver in 20.3 (2020)</span></a> we did a fairly comprehensive overhaul, removing several
undocumented and unsupported quirks from the previous implementation,
and stripped constraints files down to being purely a way to specify
global (version) limits for packages.</p>
</div>
<div id="installing-from-wheels">
<h2>Installing from Wheels<a href="#installing-from-wheels" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>“Wheel” is a built, archive format that can greatly speed installation compared
to building and installing from source archives. For more information, see the
<a href="https://wheel.readthedocs.io/">Wheel docs</a> , <span id="index-0"></span><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0427"><strong>PEP 427</strong></a>, and <span id="index-1"></span><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0425"><strong>PEP 425</strong></a>.</p>
<p>pip prefers Wheels where they are available. To disable this, use the

<p>If no satisfactory wheels are found, pip will default to finding source
archives.</p>
<p>To install directly from a wheel archive:</p>
<div>
<p><label for="tab-set--5-input--1">Unix/macOS</label></p><div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Researchers at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health have investigated whether occupational groups with frequent contact with customers, students, users or patients have an increased risk of COVID-19. Data are retrieved from health registries and other registries.</p>
<p>“We see that healthcare personnel and drivers were most exposed in the first period of the epidemic in the winter and spring of 2020. This autumn, we did not find more cases of COVID-19 among healthcare personnel than among other groups. The risk may have been higher this autumn for employees that meet many customers, such as bartenders and waiters,” says Karin Magnusson, researcher at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health and first author of the study.</p>
<h2>The most important findings</h2>
<h3>Period February-July</h3>
<p>The results are preliminary and show that in the period from February to mid-July 2020 there were:</p>
<ul>
<li>2.3 COVID-19 cases per 1 000 people in their working age (20-70 years) in Norway.</li>
<li>Among health professionals such as physiotherapists, dentists, nurses and doctors, there were 3.5 to 6.5 cases per 1 000, which is 1.5 to 3 times more than in the rest of the population of working age.</li>
<li>Among taxi drivers, bus drivers and tram drivers, there was a similar increase: from 3.4 to 5.5 cases per 1 000.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Period July-October</h3>
<p>In the period from mid-July to mid-October 2020 there were:</p>
<ul>
<li>2.6 COVID-19 cases per 1000 people of working age in Norway, which is higher than in the first period.</li>
<li>Most vulnerable in the second period were employees in the catering industry, such as bartenders and waiters, as well as flight attendants and boat stewards. The number of COVID-19 cases ranged from 6.2 to 8.9 per 1 000.</li>
<li>Among healthcare personnel, the number in the second period was lower or at the same level as among others of working age.</li>
<li>Among bus drivers and tram drivers, there were similar levels as among other people of working age, however there were more cases among taxi drivers (4.2 per 1000).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Results per occupational group</h3>
<p>The results are divided by occupational group. Among teachers, there were no more COVID-19 cases when compared to everyone in their working age, this applies to both periods.</p>


        <figure>

                <a href="https://www.fhi.no/contentassets/33240a54e1df42dda18cdc299408b1c7/occupations-eng.png" data-lightbox="image-gallery">

                </a>


        </figure>



<p>The number of confirmed COVID-19 per 1000 working people in different occupations in Norway, before and after 18 July 2020. Vertical lines show the proportion of confirmed cases for everyone of working age (20-70 years) for the two periods.</p>
<h2>Test criteria can explain differences between periods</h2>
<p>“The difference between the first and second wave may be due to changes in the test criteria. In the first wave, there was a shortage of test equipment, and patients, risk groups and healthcare personnel were prioritised for testing. In the second wave, close contacts and people with mild symptoms could also be tested. Another explanation may be infection control measures, including the fact that fewer people went abroad on holiday,” says Magnusson.</p>
<p>“The high proportion of doctors who were infected in the first period may, for example, have been infected on holiday in Italy, and not in Norway at the doctor's office. However, we do not know this, so one explanation could therefore also be better protection of healthcare personnel. In future studies, we can put several possible explanatory factors together and learn more about the risk of infection in different settings,” she adds.</p>
<h2>Hospital admissions</h2>
<p>There were no differences between occupational groups for severe COVID-19 disease and admissions to hospital. Dentists were the exception, with more hospital admissions than other occupational groups. This raises the question of whether infection with a large dose of virus from individuals increases the risk of more serious disease, but the numbers are low and therefore uncertain.</p>
<h2>About the study</h2>
<p>The purpose was to study whether the risk of COVID-19 and admissions to hospital increased among workers in occupations with a lot of direct contact with other people, compared with others of working age.</p>
<p>The study includes more than 3.5 million inhabitants of working age, between 20 and 70 years. The average age was 44 years, and there was an equal distribution between men and women. Each occupational group was compared with the rest of the working population of working age, and the risk was adjusted for age, gender and country of birth.</p>
<p>Data about COVID-19 were retrieved from the <a href="https://www.fhi.no/sv/smittsomme-sykdommer/corona/norsk-beredskapsregister-for-covid-19/">Beredt-19</a> registry at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. This registry combines data from, among others, the Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases (MSIS), the Norwegian Patient Registry, the National Population Register and NAV's employer and employee register.</p>
<p>As far as the researchers are aware, this is the first national study on occupational activity and COVID-19 risk. The methods used are identical to those described in the reference (Magnusson <em>et al</em>., 2020), with updated data including November 3rd 2020.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
      <p>Many indoor growers wonder if they can use any old LED light as a grow light. They thought these two types of LED lights had no difference as they can both emit human visible light.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0278/2330/8909/files/grow_light_vs_regular_led_light.jpg?v=1605679235" alt="medic grow led grow light vs regular led light"></p>
<div><p>However, we cannot use a regular LED light as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grow_light" target="_blank" title="grow light" rel="noopener noreferrer">grow light</a>, because they are not created equally.</p><p>Regular lights only provide illumination; that is to say, they are engineered as an artificial light source in order to lighten your dark spaces. They are comprised of narrow spectral wavelengths and usually do not have the proper spectrum of light to support photosynthesis.</p></div>
<div><p>On the other hand, grow lights are specifically designed to generate the right amount of light so plants can photosynthesize.</p><p>We've listed several areas where you can differentiate normal bulbs from grow lights:</p><p><strong>Spectrum</strong></p></div>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0278/2330/8909/files/different_colors_effects_on_plants.jpg?v=1605683978" alt="different colors effects on plants"></p>
<div><p>Many LED grow light manufacturers perform numerous experiments and study thousands of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6524371/" target="_blank" title="light spectrums" rel="noopener noreferrer">scientific reports about the specific light color wavelengths</a> so that they can produce perfect grow lights with several wavelength colors that plants need. They are: red and infrared, blue and ultraviolet, and green.</p><p>Among these colors, blue and red wavelengths are the most important to plants. Blue is responsible for leafy growth and the red for flowering and budding. To start the seeds, grow lights should produce a lot of blue light which is the most important factor during the early growth stages. And when it's time to bloom, LED lights begin to emit red spectrum to promote plant growth.</p><p>Ultraviolet light guides the plants to flower and it helps sterilization. Green is less liked by plants, so grow lights have less of a green element, but it could improve the rate of leaf expansion and stem elongation, which in turn results in higher biomass accumulation (yield).</p></div>
<div><p>Infrared is not visible to the eyes. It is less effective than red and blue, but it will penetrate deeper and through the leaf, which increases cell expansion so you will get numbers of leaves and increase branch sizes in the end.</p><p><strong>Efficiency</strong></p></div>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0278/2330/8909/files/grow_light_efficiency.jpg?v=1605686310" alt="grow light efficiency"></p>

<div><p>Regular LED bulbs have a low light output per watt, which means that it takes more energy to produce the same light. Standard fluorescent lights are twice as efficient as normal bulbs, while LED grow lights are about five times more efficient than similar regular bulbs.</p><p><strong>Heat Dissipation</strong></p></div>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0278/2330/8909/files/grow_light_feat_dissipation.png?v=1605686876" alt="grow light feat dissipation"></p>
<div><p>Many regular lights produced much heat and should be hung no closer than 24 inches to avoid burning the plant. They also require a ventilation system to remove the heat from the room. Grow lights stay much cooler and can be placed about four inches above plants for maximum effectiveness. Moreover, modern LED lights are now engineered to give off heat passively, either by use of a heat sink or by diverting heat away from the diodes.</p><p><strong>Life Expectancy</strong></p></div>
<div><p>Regular lamps only have an average lifespan of 750 hours, but many good-quality <a href="https://medicgrow.com/products/medic-grow-led-grow-light-ez-6" target="_blank" title="long lifespan led grow light" rel="noopener noreferrer">LED grow lights</a> last approximately 50,000 hours, depending on wattage. That's a big difference!</p></div>
<h2><strong>How Many Hours a Day Should Grow Lights be on?</strong></h2>
<div><p>Every plant will require different types and amounts of light. Some do better in colder and less sunny areas than others. Plants that will produce fruits and vegetables will likely need more light. Plan on keeping your LED light on for at least 14-16 hours per day. Keep them on a timer if possible to ensure they operate on a 14-16 cycle.</p></div>
<h2><strong>Should I Turn off the Light at the Night?</strong></h2>
<p>Yes you should, plants need to rest too. Night gives plants time to eat, rest, and store enough energy. While photosynthesis ceases, plants begin to respire.</p>
<p>During the day time, plants absorb enough light and nutrients to supply plant cells. At night, this process continues but slowly turns the energy into carbohydrates which plants store for later use.</p>
<div><p>So basically, the lack of light allows plants to reset themselves and move the nutrients to where they'll be used when light arrives the next day.</p></div>
<h2><strong>Can Too Much Light Kill a Plant?</strong></h2>
<p>Well, if your plants are in the vegetative stage, it’s okay to keep your grow light on for 24 hours. Even though 24 hours of light is not recommended, it won’t kill your plants.</p>
<div><p>However, when it comes to flowering phase, too much light will prevent them entering the blooming stage even if it has started budding.</p></div>
<h2><strong>What LED Grow Light Should I Buy?</strong></h2>
<p>Although LED grow lights perform better than traditional lights, you should buy a grow light equipped with a perfect wavelength combination for your plants.</p>
<div><p><a href="https://medicgrow.com/blogs/news/how-to-pick-a-best-led-grow-light" target="_blank" title="led grow light wavelengths" rel="noopener noreferrer">As discusse</a><a href="https://medicgrow.com/blogs/news/led-grow-light-distance-chart-how-far-should-i-hang-the-grow-light-from-my-plants" target="_blank" title="plants different stages" rel="noopener noreferrer">d</a><a href="https://medicgrow.com/blogs/news/how-to-pick-a-best-led-grow-light" target="_blank" title="led grow light wavelengths" rel="noopener noreferrer"> earlier</a>, wavelengths facilitate various phases of plant growth, such as germination, vegetation, or flowering. For example, LEDs that are perfect for growing tomatoes may not be as effective with cannabis.</p><p>Many LED grow light manufacturers bring out an adjustable full spectrum LED grow light which produces different wavelengths to stimulate plants at different stages.</p></div>
<div><p>So if the LEDs are needed to take care of your indoor plant at different stages, there is a good option of purchasing a full spectrum LED grow light or an adjustable one.</p></div>

        <h2>SaaS Revenue Forecasting</h2>
      </p>

      <!-- DESKTOP -->
      

      <!-- MOBILE -->
      
      

      

      <div><p>
        There are many reasons you might want to create a financial forecast, most of which boil down to either 1) helping you manage the business and understand its dynamics better, or 2) telling the story of the company to others (whether the internal team, senior management, the board, investors, or prospective investors).
        </p><p>
        Here we’ll show you how to forecast revenue (and associated key metrics) for a subscription SaaS business.
        </p></div>

      <div><p>
        If you'd like to follow along in Excel, here's the file we'll be walking through (though you'll still be able to follow along without it):
        </p><a href="#" type="application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" rel="nofollow" onclick="download_file(event)">
          <p><i></i>Download the Example Model
          </p>
        </a>
      </div>



      

      <div><p>
        We’ll start first by forecasting our number of active subscribers. To do this, we forecast two key components: The number of new subscribers in a given month, and the number of canceled subscriptions (or “churn”).
        </p><p>
        To begin with a simple illustration, we’ll assume that we win 10 new subscribers per month. We’ll also assume that these subscriptions are cancellable any time, and that 10% of existing subscribers choose to cancel each month.
        </p><p>
        The beginning # of active subscribers in any period equals the ending number from the prior month. We refer to this method of forecasting as a “screw”.
        </p></div>

      <div>
        <div>
          <!-- <img class="card-img-top" src="/assets/blog/saas-revenue/saas-rev-1.png"> -->
          <p><img src="https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/modeloptic-public/blog/saas-revenue-forecasting/saas-rev-1.png" data-enlargeable=""></p><p>
              <span>
                A basic subscriber forecast.
              </span>
            </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        As a quick aside, there are many other ways to go about forecasting churn, like analyzing cohort behavior over time, to potentially get to a more accurate projection. Our view is that it’s only worth getting into that level of detail once the company has reached a certain level of maturity, likely in the range of several thousand subscribers. Before then though, the simpler monthly churn rate is the approach we most often recommend because it’s easier to calculate, easier to forecast, and it prevents you from getting bogged down in unnecessary detail and drawing conclusions from too sparse of data.
        </p>

      

       <div>
        <!-- <br /><br /> --><p>
        So now we have a simple framework for forecasting our number of active subscribers for any period. Next we add in our assumption on revenue per month, and multiply that by our # of active subscribers to get total revenue per month.
        </p><p>
        We'll add in a calculation for ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) here as well by simply multiplying monthly revenue by 12.
        </p></div>

              <span>
                Monthly Subscription Revenue = [ Ending # of Active Subscribers ] * [ Avg Revenue / Subscriber ]
              </span>
            </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        We’ve now accomplished our goal of forecasting subscription revenue for our SaaS business. 
        </p>

      

      <div>
        <!-- <br /><br />
        We’ve now accomplished our goal of forecasting subscription revenue for our SaaS business. Next, let's say we charge some consulting fees to implement our product any time we get a new subscriber, and let's say that charge is $5k.
        <br /><br /> --><p>
        Next, let's say we charge some consulting fees to implement our product any time we get a new subscriber, and let's say we charge $5k. You can see that logic added in below, and we've also totaled up these two revenue lines (Subscription Revenue and Implementation Revenue) to get Total Revenue. 
        </p></div>

        <div>

              <span>
                Note that our ARR calculation here does not include the new non-recurring services revenue.
              </span>
            </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      

      <div>
        <!-- <br /><br /> --><p>
        We could also get a bit more sophisticated about how we forecast our number of new customers each month instead of simply hard-coding our new customer count at 10 per month. Let’s say our primary customer acquisition method is converting visitors from our website. For any set of website visitors, some of them contact us to become a lead, and then some of those leads convert into paying customers.
        </p><p>
        For starting baseline assumptions, let's say we get 1,000 website visitors per month, 2% of those convert into leads, 20% of our leads convert into paying customers, and our marketing efforts drive an increase in website visitors by 1,000 per month.
        </p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<p>Let me tell you a pet peeve of mine. It’s folks citing how many Amazon Prime Video subscribers Amazon has.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Because they don’t know.</p>
<p>What you know, or have been told once, is how many Amazon Prime subscribers there are. With Prime comes access to Prime Video. We don’t know how many members actually use that service or, more importantly, know how many value the service enough to pay for it on a recurring basis. (What a subscription is, by definition.)</p>
<p>But here’s what’s crazier: we don’t even know how many Amazon Prime subscribers there are by country. They could have 50 million US Prime members…or 125 million. Literally know one knows. (In fact, we haven’t gotten an update on Prime membership since January.)</p>
<p>This is indicative of a larger phenomenon of the “streaming wars”. The streamers have barely told us how well they are doing. By my estimates, only 4 of the 12 biggest streamers have shared actual US subscriber numbers! (Hulu, ESPN+, HBO Max and Starz)</p>
<p>That’s right, due to non-disclosure, global-only numbers, or definitional craziness, we really can’t compare the streamers to each other in the United States.</p>
<p>Well no more!</p>
<p>I’ve decided to fix this glaring mistake. What I’m going to do is provide the EntStrategyGuy Definitive Estimate for all the major streamers US subscriber base. Today, I’ll provide my table, chart and some notes, then tomorrow I’ll provide the longer, gory details. First, here’s the chart:</p>

<p><b>About That Headline</b></p>
<p>If the internet weren’t a cesspool of clickbait, I could have just explained what this article is, “My estimate of US subscribers for the streamers.” But that doesn’t get the clicks. A flashy headline on Netflix? That does.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, like I will say multiple times, is where I’ll really provide insights into this process and data. For now, though, if you have one takeaway, it should be that the streaming wars are messy. They are filled with nuance. The more that someone online pushes a simplistic narrative (Netflix has already won; Disney+ will kill Netflix; TV is dead) the less you should listen. There are no simple narratives.</p>
<p>So my headline is 100% true, and building this chart makes that clear. When it comes to one single streamer in the United States, Netflix is about twice as far ahead as its nearest competitors. Really, they are in the first tier by themselves. Then there is a second tier of services with about 35 million subscribers (Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max and Prime Video). Then a third tier of folks trying to break into that second tier (Apple, Peacock, Starz, CBS, Showtime, maybe AMC+).<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Yet, this look is in many ways a backwards looking view. The three oldest services happen to be the three oldest. The difficulty is forecasting what comes next. If we’re looking at growth, Netflix at the top was flat last quarter and down earlier in the year. And likely would have stayed that way all year in America except for Covid. Meanwhile, can the new streamers add subscribers? I think they can.</p>
<p>At least now, we/I have a common fact set to evaluate the United States performance of the streamers.</p>
<p><b>Quick FAQs</b></p>
<p>– What about global? I’m just focusing on the United States since many of these streamers are US-only. And we have the best data for this country. As the streaming wars continue, though, I’ll do a similar look for worldwide. (Though comparing global numbers to US only numbers is not a good method to do that.)</p>
<p>– How did you get that Amazon number? It’s an estimate of an estimate of an estimate, which makes it a guess. I’ll explain tomorrow.</p>
<p>– Why didn’t “smaller streamer TBD” make the list? I set the cut off at roughly 2 million subscribers. Anything smaller would have made the chart difficult to read. Again, I’ll explain my rules tomorrow.</p>
<p>– What if you disagree? Well, tomorrow I’ll explain how I calculated each one, so if you want to adjust the estimates you can. That will allow you to disagree, but within the right zone of possible answers.</p>
<p>– [From Corporate PR] You got our numbers all wrong! One, if you don’t put them out, then no I didn’t. If any company wants to correct my math, send me three years of financial data and I’ll happily provide an exclusive update.</p>

November 18, 2020 | https://ncona.com/2020/11/monetizing-a-jekyll-blog-with-adsense/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ncona.com/2020/11/monetizing-a-jekyll-blog-with-adsense/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I’ve been writing this blog for a while and I recently thought it would be nice if it could help pay for the servers I use for my other projects. At the time of this writing, this blog gets around 25,000 views per month, which is not much, but might be enough to pay for a couple of virtual machines (Hopefully. I’ll know more after I have ads running for some time).</p>

<p>Since this blog is built with Jekyll, I’m going to show how to add Adsense to similar blogs.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-site-in-adsense">Creating a site in Adsense</h2>

<p>Before we can start adding ads to our site, we need to tell Google that the site is ours. To do that we need click <code>Add site</code> on the <code>Sites</code> section:</p>

<p><a href="https://ncona.com/images/posts/adsense-add-site.png"><img src="https://ncona.com/images/posts/adsense-add-site.png" alt="Adsense add site"></a></p>

<p>We will then get a code that we should put in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of our website. The code looks something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre><span>&lt;script </span><span>data-ad-client=</span><span>"ca-pub-12345678987654321"</span> <span>async</span> <span>src=</span><span>"https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<!--more-->

<p>Depending on the Jekyll theme we are using, we might have different layouts for different types of pages. For example, I have a layout for my main page and a different one for a single article page. We need to add the code above to all the pages where we want to show ads.</p>

<p>After adding the code, we need to wait a few days for the registration to complete.</p>

<h2 id="auto-ads">Auto Ads</h2>

<p>Adsense has an <code>Auto ads</code> feature that let’s Google choose the best places to show ads in a page. This option is easy to implement but might result in showing ads in places that are very disruptive for users.</p>

<p>To enable it, we need to <code>edit</code> our site:</p>

<p><a href="https://ncona.com/images/posts/adsense-edit-site.png"><img src="https://ncona.com/images/posts/adsense-edit-site.png" alt="Adsense edit site"></a></p>

<p>This takes us to a page where we can customize the ads we want to show for both desktop and mobile:</p>

<p><a href="https://ncona.com/images/posts/adsense-auto-ads.png"><img src="https://ncona.com/images/posts/adsense-auto-ads.png" alt="Adsense auto ads"></a></p>

<p>There are 3 types of ads offered at the time of this writing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In-page - Shows mixed with the page content</li>
  <li>Anchor - Pop-up that can be dismissed</li>
  <li>Vignette - Full screen ad shown when transitioning between pages</li>
</ul>

<p>By looking at where the ads would be placed I decided I didn’t like having Google decide where to put the ads. If you decide to go for this option, I suggest to stick to <code>in-page</code> ads since the other 2 are very disruptive.</p>

<p>After enabling <code>auto ads</code>, it might take a couple of hours to start working on our site.</p>

<h2 id="ad-units">Ad units</h2>

<p>A way to have more control over where we put our ads is by using <code>ad units</code>:</p>

<p><a href="https://ncona.com/images/posts/adsense-by-ad-unit.png"><img src="https://ncona.com/images/posts/adsense-by-ad-unit.png" alt="Adsense by ad unit"></a></p>

<p><code>Display ads</code> are a good option that works for both mobile and desktop. To create a unit we just need to give it a name, choose the orientation and click <code>Create</code>:</p>

<p><a href="https://ncona.com/images/posts/adsense-create-unit.png"><img src="https://ncona.com/images/posts/adsense-create-unit.png" alt="Adsense create unit"></a></p>

<p>We will then be given a piece of code similar to the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
</pre></td><td><pre><span>&lt;script </span><span>async</span> <span>src=</span><span>"https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;!-- ncona-ad-unit --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;ins</span> <span>class=</span><span>"adsbygoogle"</span>
     <span>style=</span><span>"display:block"</span>
     <span>data-ad-client=</span><span>"ca-pub-12345678987"</span>
     <span>data-ad-slot=</span><span>"1234567897"</span>
     <span>data-ad-format=</span><span>"auto"</span>
     <span>data-full-width-responsive=</span><span>"true"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;script&gt;</span>
     <span>(</span><span>adsbygoogle</span> <span>=</span> <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>adsbygoogle</span> <span>||</span> <span>[]).</span><span>push</span><span>({});</span>
<span>&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can then create an include for this snippet (<code>_includes/adsense.html</code>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
</pre></td><td><pre>{% if jekyll.environment == "production" %}
<span>&lt;script </span><span>async</span> <span>src=</span><span>"https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;!-- ncona-ad-unit --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;ins</span> <span>class=</span><span>"adsbygoogle"</span>
     <span>style=</span><span>"display:block"</span>
     <span>data-ad-client=</span><span>"ca-pub-12345678987"</span>
     <span>data-ad-slot=</span><span>"1234567897"</span>
     <span>data-ad-format=</span><span>"auto"</span>
     <span>data-full-width-responsive=</span><span>"true"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;script&gt;</span>
     <span>(</span><span>adsbygoogle</span> <span>=</span> <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>adsbygoogle</span> <span>||</span> <span>[]).</span><span>push</span><span>({});</span>
<span>&lt;/script&gt;</span>
{% endif %}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then add this include wherever we want to show an ad. This is how my post layout looks:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

 <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>

  <span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>"entry"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    {{ content }}
  <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>

  <span>&lt;span&gt;</span>[
    {% for tag in page.tags %}
      {% capture tag_name %}{{ tag }}{% endcapture %}
      <span>&lt;a</span> <span>href=</span><span>"/tag/{{ tag_name }}/"</span><span>&gt;&lt;code</span> <span>class=</span><span>"highligher-rouge"</span><span>&gt;&lt;nobr&gt;</span>{{ tag_name }}<span>&lt;/nobr&gt;&lt;/code&gt;</span><span>&amp;nbsp;</span><span>&lt;/a&gt;</span>
    {% endfor %}
  ]<span>&lt;/span&gt;</span>

  {% include adsense.html %}
  {% include share-bar.html %}
  {% include related-posts.html %}
  {% include disqus.html %}
<span>&lt;/article&gt;</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ads don’t have any margins by default, so they look a little crowded.</p>

<p><a href="https://ncona.com/images/posts/adsense-no-margin.png"><img src="https://ncona.com/images/posts/adsense-no-margin.png" alt="Adsense no margin"></a></p>

<p>We can add some margins with css (<code>style.scss</code>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre><span>.adsbygoogle</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="paginate">Paginate</h2>

<p>I use <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/">jekyll-paginate</a> to generate a paginated listing of all my posts. My index page looks something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

  <span>&lt;/article&gt;</span>
  {% endfor %}
...
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I want to show ads on this page, but I don’t want to show an ad for each post.</p>

<p>Since each of my pages contains a maximum of 10 posts, I’m going to show an ad after the second post and another one after the sixth:</p>

<p>Because I’m using the same snippet (<code>adsense.html</code>) in both places, they will always show the same ad. To add a little variety we can create a new ad unit from the Google Adsense console and create a new snippet for it. We can then use a different snippet for each position:</p>

    {% include adsense-2.html %}
    {% endif %}

  <span>&lt;/article&gt;</span>
  {% endfor %}
...
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We will now see a different ad on each position.</p>

<h2 id="adstxt">Ads.txt</h2>

<p>In our adsense console we might be getting a message talking about <code>ads.txt</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>Earnings at risk - You need to fix some ads.txt file issues to avoid severe impact to your revenue.
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This basically means that we need to create an <code>ads.txt</code> file and upload it to our site. This file tells the browser which advertisers are allowed to show content on our site. If we click the <code>Fix it</code> link next to the alert, we will have the option to download a file. We need to upload this file and make it available at <code>&lt;ourdomain&gt;/ads.txt</code>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this article I showed how we can start showing ads in a Jekyll site to make some money from a blog. I personally don’t like having Google choose where to put ads, so I showed how to place our ads manually using <code>ad units</code>.</p>

	<h4>A programmer named <a href="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/chrome-google.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeff Johnson</a> recently discovered that enabling the “Clear cookies and site data when you quit Chrome” meant Google Search and YouTube cookies were not deleted, and exempt from this rule.</h4>
<p>He found that the only way to include Google and YouTube cookies for clearing is to specifically add <code>google.com</code> and <code>youtube.com</code> to <em>sites that can never use cookies</em> – it is not made obvious to the user that Google’s own services are exempt from the cookie clearing rule by default. <em>(<a href="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/chrome-google.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a>)</em></p>
<p>Furthermore, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/google-privacy-chrome-youtube-search-bug-b1180705.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Independent</em></a> investigated this issue and found similar results.</p>
<p>Google was made aware of this issue, and a Google spokesperson issued the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are aware of a bug in Chrome that is impacting how cookies are cleared on some first-party Google websites. We are investigating the issue, and plan to roll out a fix in the coming days.” (<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/10/19/google_cookie_wipe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a>)<em><br>
</em></p></blockquote>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Author’s Note:</strong> Google has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_concerns_regarding_Google" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">long history of privacy violations</a>, which is one of the primary reasons I recommend finding ways to become less reliant on their services. A good first step would be to replace Chrome with <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/?redirect_source=firefox-com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firefox</a>, and from there, looking to replace Google Search with <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DuckDuckGo</a> or <a href="https://startpage.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Startpage</a>.</em></p>

But the reasons why have not been entirely clear.</p><p>To help understand how smoking affects SARS-CoV-2 infection on a cellular and molecular level, Dr. Brigitte Gomperts partnered with co-senior authors Vaithilingaraja Arumugaswami, an associate professor of molecular and medical pharmacology, and Kathrin Plath, a professor of biological chemistry, to recreate what happens when the airways of a current smoker are infected with SARS-CoV-2. </p><p>The team utilized a platform known as an air–liquid interface culture, which is grown from human airway stem cells and closely replicates how the airways behave and function in humans. The airways, which carry air breathed in from the nose and mouth to the lungs, are the body’s first line of defense against airborne pathogens like viruses, bacteria and smoke.</p><p>“Our model replicates the upper part of the airways, which is the first place the virus hits,” said Gomperts, a professor pulmonary medicine and member of the <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fcancer.ucla.edu%2F&amp;t=ZWVkYjg3NGQxODQ0ZjcyYTgyNzg1NTI5YjllNGJiNWZjZmVjNjE4NCxUUDc3ZTRVMQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F635162930879594496%2Fsmoking-and-covid19&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1605961704">UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>. “This is the part that produces mucus to trap viruses, bacteria and toxins and contains cells with finger-like projections that beat that mucus up and out of the body.”</p><p>The air–liquid interface cultures used in the study were grown from airway stem cells taken from the lungs of five young, healthy, nonsmoking tissue donors. To replicate the effects of smoking, the researchers exposed these airway cultures to cigarette smoke for three minutes per day over four days.</p><p>“This type of model has been used to study lung diseases for over a decade and has been shown to mimic the changes in the airway that you would see in a person who currently smokes,” said Gomperts, who is also vice chair of research in pediatric hematology-oncology at the <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uclahealth.org%2Fmattel%2Fcdi%2Fabout-ucla-childrens-discovery-and-innovation-institute&amp;t=MDhiOWFkYjk0OWI5ZDBjNmI2NThmZDFkNWZjZWQ4YzZmZjY1ZmM1YSxUUDc3ZTRVMQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F635162930879594496%2Fsmoking-and-covid19&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1605961704">UCLA Children’s Discovery and Innovation Institute</a>.</p><figure data-orig-width="1152" data-orig-height="768"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/23a2b89187c156f902af6da92869f5a3/de893e45c0e70294-11/s1280x1920/024d373e1326ec10e438a7c252972f0b998c1464.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1152" data-orig-height="768" width="1152" height="768"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;Microscopic images of human stem cell–derived airway tissue models with cell nuclei (blue) and SARS-CoV-2–infected cells (green); tissue exposed to cigarette smoke (right) had 2 to 3 times more infected cells than non-exposed tissue (left).

Interferons play a critical role in the body’s early immune response by triggering infected cells to produce proteins to attack the virus, summoning additional support from the immune system, and alerting uninfected cells to prepare to fight the virus. Cigarette smoke is known to reduce the interferon response in the airways.</p><p>“If you think of the airways like the high walls that protect a castle, smoking cigarettes is like creating holes in these walls,” Gomperts said. “Smoking reduces the natural defenses and that allows the virus to set in.” </p><p>–</p><p><b>Source: <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsroom.ucla.edu%2Freleases%2Fhow-smoking-worsens-covid-infection&amp;t=ZjRkMzgxNTU3ZWNjOWEwMTNjNzI3NmUxNTNlN2I1MmI2MzQwNjRiMCxUUDc3ZTRVMQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F635162930879594496%2Fsmoking-and-covid19&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1605961704">UCLA Health</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“Direct exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and cigarette smoke increases infection severity and alters the stem cell-derived airway repair response”, <i>Cell Stem Cell</i>.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1016%2Fj.stem.2020.11.010&amp;t=Y2UyM2MxZTgyNjRjZjEzNjYyZGMwZjQyYmMyOWY2ZmEzYmIxMTI2MCxUUDc3ZTRVMQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F635162930879594496%2Fsmoking-and-covid19&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1605961704">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stem.2020.11.010</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/632175500576653312/blood-test-covid19-infection-prediction">Novel blood test predicts which COVID-19 patients will develop severe infection</a></p>

  <article>
	<p>From <em><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/11/apple-announces-app-store-small-business-program/">Apple announces App Store Small Business Program</a></em> (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apple today announced an industry-leading new developer program to accelerate innovation and help small businesses and independent developers propel their businesses forward with the next generation of groundbreaking apps on the App Store. The new App Store Small Business Program will benefit the vast majority of developers who sell digital goods and services on the store, providing them with a reduced commission on paid apps and in-app purchases. <strong>Developers can qualify for the program and a reduced, 15 percent commission if they earned up to $1 million in proceeds during the previous calendar year.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is certainly an improvement over the current state of affairs (where Apple takes 30% off the top from everybody¹). However, the revenue limit that Apple has set for this program seems pretty arbitrary and pretty low. A million dollars sure seems like a lot of money at first blush and I’m sure that’s why they chose it. Indeed, it certainly is a lot to a solo indie developer or a very small team. However, it is surely not a lot of money for a small business that employs more than a few people to build software.</p>

<p>A software company in the US with one million dollars in annual gross revenue would struggle to support 10-12 employees outside of major tech markets. In places like San Francisco, New York City, or Austin, it would be closer to 5-7 employees. That’s hardly a big business that is in a position to fork over another 15% of its revenue in platform taxes to a company worth some <em>two trillion dollars</em> ².</p>

<p>Apple should just cut their tax for everyone. Taking even a 15% cut from developers whose products create enormous value for iOS—and therefore Apple’s highly lucrative hardware products—is pretty egregious. I’m not sure a change this anemic is going to do much to tamp down the growing developer discontent Apple is confronting.</p>

<hr>

<ol>
<li>Well, everybody who isn’t important enough to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206400/apple-tax-amazon-tv-prime-30-percent-developers">negotiate special terms</a>. The “standard” 30% cut will now only apply to the App Store middle class: too successful for this new program, too small to negotiate a special deal.</li>
<li>About $2,010,000,000,000 as I write this.</li>
</ol>

<p>A framework for building Modern Web Apps in ClojureScript. It leverages React, via <a href="http://reagent-project.github.io/">Reagent</a>.</p>
<p>McCoy might report "It's MVC, Jim, but not as we know it".  And you would respond 
"McCoy, you trouble maker, why even mention an OO pattern? 
re-frame is a <strong>functional framework</strong>."</p>
<p>So, it is about <code>data</code>, and the <code>functions</code> 
which transform that data.  And, because it is a <strong>reactive framework</strong>, <code>data</code> coordinates 
<code>functions</code>, not the other way around.</p>
<p>Indicatively, re-frame's tag line is: <strong>derived values, flowing</strong>. </p>
<h2 id="why-should-you-care">Why Should You Care?<a href="#why-should-you-care" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Perhaps:</p>
<ol>
<li>You want to develop a modern web application using ClojureScript.</li>
<li>You want to maximise developer productivity by writing <a href="https://medium.com/dailyjs/a-realworld-comparison-of-front-end-frameworks-2020-4e50655fe4c1">fewer lines of code</a>. You want a simple dynamic process that you can simulate in your head. And you want a clean approach to effects and state management.</li>
<li>You are curious about the benefits of <strong><em>data-oriented design</em></strong>.</li>
<li>You are a refugee from technical churn, seeking stability and productivity.
    For six years, ClojureScript, Reagent and re-frame have barely changed. No need. Still cutting edge.</li>
<li>You want to see how <code>reactive programming</code>, <code>functional programming</code> and <code>immutable data</code>
    combine in a language that genuinely embraces those paradigms.</li>
<li>You're taking a <a href="http://www.eli.sdsu.edu/courses/fall15/cs696/index.html">Functional Design and Programming course</a> at San Diego State University
    and you have a re-frame assignment due.  You've left the reading a bit late, right?</li>
<li>You seek a better Redux, Elm, Cycle.js or Pux. In this space, re-frame is very old, 
    hopefully in a Gandalf kind of way.
    Designed in late 2014, it slightly pre-dates the official Elm Architecture,
    although thankfully we picked up <code>foldp</code> ideas from early Elm games. 
    Our main inspiration was the
    Clojure projects <a href="https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal-app">Pedestal App</a>, <a href="http://hoplon.io/">Hoplon</a> and <a href="https://github.com/swannodette/om">Om</a>. Since then,
    re-frame has pioneered ideas like event handler middleware,
    coeffect accretion, and de-duplicated signal graphs.</li>
<li>
<p>Which brings us to the most important point: <strong>re-frame is impressively buzzword compliant</strong>. It has reactivity,
    unidirectional data flow, pristinely pure functions,
    interceptors, coeffects, conveyor belts, algebraic effects, statechart-friendliness 
    and claims an immaculate hammock conception. All while being both simple and easy. There's also a charming
    xkcd reference (soon) and a hilarious, insiders-joke T-shirt,
    ideal for conferences (in design).  </p>
<p>What could possibly go wrong?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="it-is-mature">It Is Mature<a href="#it-is-mature" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>re-frame was released in early 2015, and has since 
<a href="https://www.fullcontact.com/">been</a> successfully
<a href="https://www.nubank.com.br/">used</a> by
<a href="http://open.mediaexpress.reuters.com/">many</a> a 
<a href="https://rokt.com/">companies</a> and
individuals to build complex apps, many running beyond 40K lines of
ClojureScript.</p>
<p><img src="https://day8.github.io/re-frame/images/scale-changes-everything.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>Scale changes everything.</strong> Frameworks
are just pesky overhead at small scale - measure them instead by how they help
you tame the complexity of bigger apps, and in this regard re-frame has
worked out well. Some have been effusive in their praise.</p>
<p>And, yes, re-frame is fast, straight out of the box. And, yes, it has 
a good testing story (unit and behavioural). And, yes, it works with 
tools like figwheel or shadow-cljs to create
a powerful hot-loading development story. And, yes, it has 
fun specialist tooling, and a community,
and useful 3rd party libraries.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>For decades, developers were able to create and distribute their software, whether free or for a fee, to anyone with a PC or laptop. There was no gatekeeper deciding who was in or out, and there was no requirement that they hand over a significant percentage of their revenue to the device maker.</p>
<p>Video game consoles were the obvious exception to this, with the claim that they were specialized devices and, therefore, closed ecosystems. But personal computing was open, and that was an important catalyst for innovation for a long time.</p>
<p>That changed with the introduction of Apple's app store on iOS. Developers had to be approved by Apple, and had to agree to use Apple as their sole payment processor, to the tune of $99/year and 30% of their revenue. For contrast, payment processors at the time were charging around 2.9% and $0.30/transaction. That's a massive difference in and of itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 30% number was based on what video game consoles were charging developers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="apples-original-rationale">Apple's original rationale</h2>
<p>Apple's argument for the iPhone being a closed ecosystem was that a phone is a specialized device because its primary function is to make phone calls, and that primary function must be protected against rogue software that may disrupt its ability to make those calls.</p>
<p>Apple's argument that the 30% fee was fair was that it takes manpower to review and approve apps to be listed on their store.</p>
<h2 id="ripples-into-other-app-stores">Ripples into other app stores</h2>
<p>The issue grew bigger as Google implemented similar requirements and fee structures on the Android app store, and pretty much every app store from Steam to Samsung Galaxy followed suit.</p>
<p>Now that Microsoft and Apple have introduced app stores on Windows and macOS, they plan to slowly erode our freedom on PCs too so that they can reap the same financial benefits on our labour on all computing platforms (save for open source operating systems like Linux). Apple has since added warning messages discouraging users not to install third party software that hasn't paid for Apple's signature of approval. These warnings are getting more and more alarming with each OS upgrade, causing users to fear installing third party software through other, traditional means.</p>
<p>This needs to be stopped now because device makers are making the case that future devices like VR and AR headsets are also specialized devices and so they too should be subject to the same closed ecosystem and payment processing restrictions, which is simply untrue.</p>
<p>If an AR device replaces your PC, it's a generalized computing device, plain and simple.</p>
<h2 id="phones-are-not-specialized-computing-devices">Phones are not specialized computing devices</h2>
<p>Making phone calls was the sole function of a telephone, but a mobile phone is a powerful computer that can perform a wide range of functions. The new iPhone 12 Pro has built-in Lidar, a total of 4 cameras, GPS, and many other features that extend far being making phone calls.</p>
<p>What was once a primary feature is now just one of thousands, and potentially one of its least important features as we have dozens or more options for voice, video, and text-based messaging available to us. Many young people would probably be just fine on an iPod Touch that doesn't make calls at all, and many probably wouldn't know the difference.</p>
<p>Phones are general computing devices, and as such, should not be maintained as closed ecosystems. This doesn't benefit users, many of whom are also developers themselves, because it limits our freedom on both sides of the equation. General computing platforms should be protected from such predatory practices by manufacturers through strong government regulations.</p>
<h2 id="the-fee-isnt-the-issue-the-requirement-to-pay-is">The fee isn't the issue, the requirement to pay is</h2>
<p>Tying your right distribute an app that you developed independently of the hardware maker to the requirement to use their payment processor is anti-competitive because it means that every developer benefits the hardware maker while the hardware maker provides little more than a gatekeeper function and a small amount of file storage for their release builds.</p>
<p>How can any indie developer hope to compete with the likes of Apple or Google or Microsoft when every sale they make gives 15% of their profits over to their competition? And if they make more than $1m, it goes back up to 30%. That's a huge disparity that serves to protect the interests of the hardware maker at the expense of businesses everywhere.</p>
<p>If there was a hard cost for Apple and others to review and approve apps, then that should be charged up-front and not as a percentage of profit. Developers should be free to choose the payment processing service that best serves their needs, whether that's Stripe or Paypal or Apple's built-in offering. Apple's payment processor should be chosen because it's better, not because you have no other choice.</p>
<h2 id="disproportionate-profits">Disproportionate profits</h2>
<p>Since the cost of the review process and hosting are the justification for the payment processing fees, a good way to tell if they're in line with each other is to look at Apple's profits on the app store. In 2019, Apple generated about <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/07/apple-app-store-had-estimated-gross-sales-of-50-billion-in-2019.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$50bn in sales on the iOS app store</a>, with their take being about <strong>$15bn in profit</strong>.</p>
<p>Does it really cost Apple anywhere close to $15bn/year to maintain the app store's review process and hosting infrastructure?</p>
<h2 id="this-makes-some-business-models-unfeasible">This makes some business models unfeasible</h2>
<p>Some business models, like establishing a marketplace for content creators to share their work with each other, become unfeasible when 15-30% off the top goes straight to the device maker. Many businesses operate with profit margins well under 30% or even 15%. Amazon is widely known for maintaining a 1% profit margin across their entire business as a strategic advantage to be able to undercut everyone else.</p>
<p>Other payment processors are essentially locked out of these ecosystems entirely, which is unfair and anti-competitive against them. I bet Stripe would love to be able to provide a better mobile payment option – their core business – without Apple being such a significant portion of the sale, thereby negating any benefit that Stripe on its own can differentiate itself with.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-not-just-a-problem-for-developers">This is not just a "problem for developers"</h2>
<p>I've seen many comments on sites like Hacker News and MacRumours that this isn't a problem users should care about and that developers should essentially stop whining or take their software elsewhere. But this also limits the choices users have, and it limits the types of apps they get to benefit from. This limitation won't be felt directly, because you don't feel the absence of something you never knew you could have. <em>You don't know what you don't know.</em></p>
<p>Stifling innovation isn't good for anyone, and as more and more people become software developers, this really just hurts the small guys. The indies who are more similar in size and need to average consumers than the likes of tech giants like Apple or Google. Indie developers need protection from monopolistic and anti-competitive practices from larger players in the market through strong government regulation, not a discount on their first $1m in sales.</p>
<h2 id="this-model-is-being-replicated-in-vr-and-ar">This model is being replicated in VR and AR</h2>
<p>It's no secret that I work in Virtual Reality. In fact, writing this gives me some anxiety because my company could be targeted and harmed for me saying things that don't benefit the VR headset makers. <em>But this needs to be said.</em> In fact, I'd say this is one of the most important fights in the software industry today because it will determine whether future platforms are open or closed.</p>
<p>VR headsets have already been set up to be <a href="https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/walled-garden" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">walled gardens</a>, and although Oculus has turned a blind eye for the time being to third party app stores like <a href="https://sidequestvr.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SideQuest</a>, they could still decide to cut it off at any point in the future with little or no recourse.</p>
<p>Whether third party app stores are the solution also remains to be seen, but gauging by how difficult device makers make it for average users to install them, and what little percentage market share they have on each respective platform, I'd say they don't go far enough to solve this problem.</p>
<p>The ability to easily <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sideloading" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">sideload</a>, aka install software directly onto a device that you own and not through any given app store, is paramount to maintaining free access to today's as well as tomorrow's computing platforms. And we should have the ability to do so without navigating a maze of warnings discouraging the average user from doing so.</p>
<h2 id="pcs-will-become-headsets-which-are-general-computing-devices">PCs will become headsets, which are general computing devices</h2>
<p>Augmented Reality is still in its infancy and isn't a general computing platform yet, not because it's specialized but because the technology isn't of sufficient quality yet. But it's improving rapidly, and one day it will be good enough to overtake both PCs and phones as the dominant computing platform of the future.</p>
<p>When it does, it will be critical to indie developers everywhere that we maintain the same level of freedom on these future platforms that we enjoy today on PCs, and stop the current erosion of those freedoms by big tech companies. Failure to do so will close off all software that isn't blessed by device makers, which will further increase the financial divide between indie developers and the companies who will control the platforms of the future, whether that's Apple, Google, Microsoft, or Facebook. <em>We can't let that happen.</em></p>
<h2 id="whats-the-solution">What's the solution?</h2>
<p>The solution is simple and threefold:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mobile phones and headset-based computing devices should be classified as general computing platforms in the eyes of the law.</li>
<li>General computing platforms should have the legal requirement that developers can distribute their software however they see fit, so long as it doesn't harm users (malware, spyware, etc.).</li>
<li>Choice of payment processors should not be forced on developers in exchange for the ability to distribute software on any general computing platform.</li>
</ol>
<p>Only when the above rights have been won in the eyes of the law will our fight be over on this front, but there will always be other …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

      <!--<div>-->
              
            <p>Canada’s privacy legislation is about to go through major changes. Earlier today, the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, Navdeep Bains, introduced a <a href="https://parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/43-2/bill/C-11/first-reading">bill</a> for the replacement of Canada’s federal privacy legislation for the private sector (the <em>Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act</em> or “<strong>PIPEDA</strong>”) with the new <em>Consumer Privacy Protection Act</em> (“<strong>CPPA</strong>”) and the <em>Personal Information and Data Protection Tribunal Act </em>(“<strong>PIDPT</strong>”). The new regime draws inspiration from PIPEDA, including the Model Code principles, guidance from the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (the “<strong>Commissioner</strong>”), and the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“<strong>GDPR</strong>”).</p>

<p>Key changes introduced by the CPPA and PIDPT include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>A New Tribunal that can Impose Significant Penalties and Fines </strong>– Organizations that violate the CPPA can face administrative monetary penalties of up to the greater $10,000,000 and 3% of the organization’s gross global revenue, and organizations that knowingly commit certain offences under the CPPA can face fines up to the greater of $25,000,000 and 5% of the organization’s gross global revenue. However, penalties will not be issued by the Commissioner. The Commissioner will instead recommend penalties to the Personal Information and Data Protection Tribunal (the “<strong>Tribunal</strong>”), which has the right to impose penalties. Other orders of the Commissioner can be appealed to the Tribunal.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Private Right of Action</strong> –The CPPA contains a private right of action for individuals. Before an individual can make a claim, the organization must have been convicted of an offence under the CPPA or there must be a final determination by the Commissioner or the Tribunal that the organization contravened the CPPA. The individual can claim damages for loss or injury that the individual has suffered as a result of the offence or contravention. It appears that an organization could be subject to the maximum administrative monetary penalty and still face claims under the private right of action.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Enhanced Consent </strong>– In order to obtain valid consent, an organization must provide certain information to the individual at or before the time of collection (or before the use or disclosure when seeking consent regarding personal information already in the organization’s custody). The information that organizations must provide includes the purpose(s) of the collection, use and disclosure, the “reasonably foreseeable consequences of the collection, use or disclosure”, the types of personal information involved, and the “names of any third parties or types of third parties to which the organization may disclose the personal information”. Implied consent will be acceptable in certain circumstances, taking into account the individual’s reasonable expectations and the sensitivity of the personal information.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>New Grounds of Processing without Consent </strong>– Like the GDPR, the CPPA permits organizations to lawfully collect, use and disclose personal information without consent for other valid reasons, including as necessary to provide a product or service requested by an individual, as part of due diligence to prevent or manage commercial risk, for security and safety purposes, and where obtaining consent would be impracticable due to the lack of a direct relationship. However, organizations must only do so where a reasonable person would expect it and may not do so for the purpose of influencing the individual’s behavior or decisions.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Enhanced Rights of Individuals</strong> – Individuals will have the right to data portability (the right to obtain their personal information in a useable format from an organization), the right of erasure (the limited right to have their personal information deleted by an organization) and other new privacy rights, all subject to some prescribed limitations. In the case of data portability, the right will be subject to the applicability of a data mobility framework under the yet-to-be-published regulations.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Transparency Regarding Trans Border Transfers</strong> – The CPPA permits organizations to store and access personal information outside of Canada, but it does require that organizations make information available about “whether or not the organization carries out any international or interprovincial transfer or disclosure of personal information that may have reasonably foreseeable privacy implications”.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>AI/Automated Decision Systems</strong> – The CPPA introduces the concept of “automated decision systems”, which is “technology that assists or replaces the judgment of human decision-makers using techniques such as rules-based systems, regression analysis, predictive analytics, machine learning, deep learning and neural nets.” As part of the openness and transparency requirements, organizations need to provide a “general account” of their “use of any automated decision system to make predictions, recommendations or decisions about individuals that could have significant impacts on them”. Individuals also have a right to “an explanation of the prediction, recommendation or decision and of how the personal information that was used to make the prediction, recommendation or decision was obtained.”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>De-Identification of Personal Information </strong>– The CPPA provides an express right to use personal information without an individual’s knowledge or consent to de-identify the information. While specific requirements are not stipulated, the CPPA states that the organization “must ensure that any technical and administrative measures applied to the information are proportionate to the purpose for which the information is de-identified and the sensitivity of the personal information”. Further, the proposed law includes a prohibition on using de-identified information, alone or in combination with other information, to identify an individual.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>At this stage, the bill to enact the CPPA, PIDPT and the other related legislative amendments is at first reading. It will likely go to second reading and then to a committee for further study and amendment.</p>

<p><strong>Sources of Inspiration</strong></p>

<p>This new regime must be viewed through a long lens of legislative history, including the federal government’s introduction of a <a href="https://www.mccarthy.ca/en/insights/blogs/snipits/canadian-government-announces-new-digital-charter">Digital Charter</a> seeking to promote the digital economy while addressing its privacy and AI-related challenges, the GDPR-focused parliamentary committee report,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mccarthy.ca/en/insights/blogs/snipits/parliamentary-committee-recommends-substantial-revisions-pipeda-part-1-overview-and-context">Towards Privacy by Design</a>,&nbsp;and the consultation,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/062.nsf/eng/h_00107.html">Strengthening Privacy for the Digital Age</a>, which explains some of what animates the CPPA and PIDPT. Key briefs and oral testimony of witnesses are available <a href="https://www.ourcommons.ca/Committees/en/ETHI/StudyActivity?studyActivityId=9213226">here</a>. The background also includes position papers and recommendations from the Commissioner, such as the November 12, 2020 position paper, <a href="https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/about-the-opc/what-we-do/consultations/completed-consultations/consultation-ai/reg-fw_202011/">A Regulatory Framework for AI</a> (explicitly aimed at providing “Recommendations for PIPEDA Reform”), and the <a href="https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/about-the-opc/what-we-do/consultations/completed-consultations/consultation-on-transfers-for-processing/">Consultations on Transfers for Processing</a> and <a href="https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/collecting-personal-information/consent/gl_omc_201805/">Guidelines for Obtaining Meaningful Consent</a>.</p>

<p>What also remains to be seen is how the new federal legislation will interact with provincial legislation. While&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mccarthy.ca/en/insights/blogs/techlex/bill-64-overhaul-quebecs-privacy-law-regime-implications-business">Quebec is the furthest along in reforming its legislation</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/consultation-strengthening-privacy-protections-ontario">Ontario recently closed its consultation on producing its own law</a>, Alberta recently proposed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.assembly.ab.ca/assembly-business/bills/bill?billinfoid=11885&amp;from=bills">amendments to its&nbsp;<em>Health Information Act</em></a>, and British Columbia recently dissolved a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mccarthy.ca/en/insights/blogs/techlex/special-committee-begins-consultations-changes-bcs-personal-information-protection-act">special committee considering changes to the&nbsp;<em>Personal Information Protection Act</em></a> for an election. Harmonizing these various draft bills will be a complex but important undertaking in the time to come.</p>

<p><strong>What Organizations Should Do Now</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Stay Aware of Changes </strong>– In the coming weeks and months, members of our<a href="https://www.mccarthy.ca/en/services/cyberdata/cyberdata"> Cyber/Data Group</a> will be publishing posts exploring the proposed law in depth. We will cover the topics above, as well as other topics that are relevant to organizations operating in Canada or otherwise processing the personal information of Canadian residents. We will also provide updates as the draft legislation moves through various stages.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Prepare for the Changes </strong>– While the Minister suggested there will be a transition period, it is unclear how long the transition period will be. There is a substantial list of new obligations, including with respect to privacy notices, policies and procedures, record retention, and accommodating individual rights.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Prepare for Consultations</strong> – Organizations should be considering the impact the legislation will have on them and, if appropriate, the value of advocating for improvements and clarifications.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<li><span>You may have heard the saying, “God gave you two ears and one mouth for a reason.”&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li><span>“In startups, how many problems could be discovered if we spoke less and listened more to our users. You can’t offer solutions until you know what is the problem.” — Holly Liu</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>When talking to users, avoid “would” questions. People are bad at predicting what they would do in the future. Asking about the past is better and draws out more specifics.</span></li>
<li><span>Because you want to encourage users to talk more, asking open-ended questions helps accomplish that.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>“People will tell you anything, but what they DO is more important.” — Holly Liu</span>
<ul>
<li><span>In a pandemic especially, it’s important to have users show you their screen to see how they interact with your product. Obviously, with a physical product, it may be a bit different.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Always ask if you’re able to record the session. Permission is the most important part. These recordings can be used to help with collaboration amongst your team or for reference when tweaking/building your product.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>“Avoid talking about your solution. In order to find as much as possible without influence, it would be better for you to not talk about what you are building…Otherwise, you will arrive at the same conclusion as Henry Ford, ‘If I asked my users what they wanted, they would say they want a faster horse’ and render a useless solution.” — Holly Liu</span></li>

								<p><span>Talking to your users can be messy. To limit the messiness of it, put processes in place to filter the complexities. The conversation/viewing itself seems a bit daunting, but after reading Holly’s piece, it seems like you can’t go wrong with listening more than you talk and asking open-ended questions. And asking permission to record, don’t forget! </span></p>

<p>As a creator, you’ll need to wear different hats depending on the problem at hand. Today I want to introduce you to two of my favorite creative mindsets.</p>



<p><strong>The DJ’s Mindset</strong></p>



<figure><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1601418059872-2ac6d694946d?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1030&amp;q=80" alt=""><figcaption><em>Picture by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@samvbussel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@samvbussel</a></em></figcaption></figure>



<p>DJs operate under a powerful creative principle: remixing. They curate existing music and records, and combine them to create a brand-new piece.</p>



<p>But you can apply this principle far beyond music. You can use it in business, design, writing, architecture, fashion, and all sorts of creative endeavors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DJs understand that few things are truly original — most new ideas are a combination of two old ones. By remixing, they leverage the work put into existing things to create more value.</p>



<p><strong>The Chef’s Mindset</strong></p>



<figure><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1577106263724-2c8e03bfe9cf?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1050&amp;q=80" alt=""><figcaption><em>Picture by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@sebastiancoman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@sebastiancoman</a></em></figcaption></figure>



<p>People often use the words “chef” and “cook” as synonyms, when in reality they couldn’t be more different.</p>



<p>Cooks are operators. They follow instructions. Chefs, on the other hand, are first-principle thinkers. They are the ones creating new recipes from scratch. Some of them even reinvent the whole dining experience.</p>



<p>To think like a chef you need to ask tons of questions, and challenge long-held beliefs and assumptions. After carefully deconstructing the status quo, you can find more elegant, simple or efficient alternatives.</p>


<p><em>This piece is part of a series of 30 atomic essays where I explore what it means to be a&nbsp;<a href="https://rationalcreatives.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rational creative</a>&nbsp;and the different aspects of being a creator online.

Here is the full text of an open letter which over 200 Facebook content moderators from across the world have just addressed to Facebook’s leaders:</em></p><p><strong>November 2020</strong></p><p><strong>Mark Zuckerberg <br>Sheryl Sandberg <br>Anne Heraty (CEO, CPL/Covalen) <br>Julie Sweet (CEO, Accenture) <p>Via email and posting on Facebook’s Workplace channels </p></strong></p><div><p><strong>Open letter from content moderators re: pandemic <br></strong><br>Dear Mr. Zuckerberg, Ms. Sandberg, Ms. Heraty, Ms. Sweet </p><p>We, the undersigned Facebook content moderators and Facebook employees, write to express our dismay at your decision to risk our lives—and the lives of our colleagues and loved ones—to maintain Facebook’s profits during the pandemic. </p></div><p>After months of allowing content moderators to work from home, faced with intense pressure to keep Facebook free of hate and disinformation, you have forced us back to the office. Moderators who secure a doctors’ note about a personal COVID risk have been excused from attending in person.[1] Moderators with vulnerable relatives, who might die were they to contract COVID from us, have not. </p><p>The pandemic has been good for Facebook. More than 3 billion people have now joined Facebook services, creating more demand for our work than ever.[2] Mr. Zuckerberg nearly doubled his fortune during the crisis.[3] He is now worth well over $100 billion. It has been good for Facebook’s contractors, too: CPL, one of the main European contractors, is due to be sold for €318m.[4] </p><p>Despite vast sums flowing to each of you as corporate executives, you have refused moderators hazard pay. A content moderator at Accenture’s office in Austin, Texas generally earns $18/hour[5]. </p><p>Before the pandemic, content moderation was easily Facebook’s most brutal job. We waded through violence and child abuse for hours on end. Moderators working on child abuse content had targets increased during the pandemic, with no additional support. </p><p>Now, on top of work that is psychologically toxic, holding onto the job means walking into a hot zone. In several offices, multiple COVID cases have occurred on the floor.[6] Workers have asked Facebook leadership, and the leadership of your outsourcing firms like Accenture and CPL, to take urgent steps to protect us and value our work. You refused. We are publishing this letter because we are left with no choice. </p><p>Stop Needlessly Risking Moderators’ Lives </p><p>It is important to explain that the reason you have chosen to risk our lives is that this year Facebook tried using ‘AI’ to moderate content—and failed.[7] </p><p>At the start of the pandemic, both full-time Facebook staff and content moderators worked from home. To cover the pressing need to moderate the masses of violence, hate, terrorism, child abuse, and other horrors that we fight for you every day, you sought to substitute our work with the work of a machine. </p><p>Without informing the public, Facebook undertook a massive live experiment in heavily automated content moderation. Management told moderators that we should no longer see certain varieties of toxic content coming up in the review tool from which we work— such as graphic violence or child abuse, for example. </p><p>The AI wasn’t up to the job. Important speech got swept into the maw of the Facebook filter—and risky content, like self-harm, stayed up. </p><p>The lesson is clear. Facebook’s algorithms are years away from achieving the necessary level of sophistication to moderate content automatically. They may never get there. </p><p>This raises a stark question. If our work is so core to Facebook’s business that you will ask us to risk our lives in the name of Facebook’s community—and profit—are we not, in fact, the heart of your company? </p><p>Without our work, Facebook is unusable. Its empire collapses. Your algorithms cannot spot satire. They cannot sift journalism from disinformation. They cannot respond quickly enough to self-harm or child abuse. We can. </p><p>Facebook needs us. It is time that you acknowledged this and valued our work. To sacrifice our health and safety for profit is immoral. </p><p>These are our demands. </p><p>1. Keep moderators and their families safe. At the moment, only individual content moderators with a doctors’ note indicating that they are high risk are excused from working in the office. Even this is not offered in some workplaces. Those who live with an at-risk person – who have, for example, a child with epilepsy – have been forced to come in. All content moderators who are high risk or who live with someone who is high risk for Covid should be permitted to work from home indefinitely. </p><p>2. Maximize at-home working. Work that can be done from home should continue to be done from home. You have previously said content moderation cannot be performed remotely for security reasons. If that is so, it is time to fundamentally change the way that the work is organized. There is a pervasive and needlessly secretive culture at Facebook. Some content, such as content that is criminal, may need to be moderated in Facebook offices. The rest should be done at home. </p><p>3. Offer hazard pay. If you want moderators to risk their lives to maintain ‘community’ and profit, you should pay. Moderators who are working in the office on high-risk material (eg, child abuse) should be paid hazard pay of 1.5x their usual wage. </p><p>4. End outsourcing. There is, if anything, more clamor than ever for aggressive content moderation at Facebook. This requires our work. Facebook should bring the content moderation workforce in house, giving us the same rights and benefits as full Facebook staff. </p><p>5. Offer real healthcare and psychiatric care. Facebook employees enjoy various benefits, including private health insurance and visits to psychiatrists. Content moderators, who bear the brunt of the mental health trauma associated with Facebook’s toxic content, are offered 45 minutes a week with a ‘wellness coach’. These ‘coaches’ are generally not psychologists or psychiatrists and are contractually forbidden from diagnosis or treatment. And they generally cannot build a relationship of trust with moderators, since workers know that Facebook management (and Accenture/CPL management) ask ‘coaches’ to reveal confidential details of counselling sessions. Moderators deserve at least as much mental and physical health support as full Facebook staff. </p><p>The current crisis highlights that at the core of Facebook’s business lies a deep hypocrisy. By outsourcing our jobs, Facebook implies that the 35,000 of us who work in moderation are somehow peripheral to social media. Yet we are so integral to Facebook’s viability that we must risk our lives to come into work. </p><p>It is time to reorganize Facebook’s moderation work on the basis of equality and justice. We are the core of Facebook’s business. We deserve the rights and benefits of full Facebook staff. We look forward to your public response. </p><p>Very sincerely yours, </p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Andrea</p></li><li><p>Angela De Hoyos Hart</p></li><li><p>Ani Niow</p></li><li><p>Audrey Martin</p></li><li><p>Aune Mitchell</p></li><li><p>Azer Gueco</p></li><li><p>Baris Aytan</p></li><li><p>Brady Bennett</p></li><li><p>Cam Herringshaw</p></li><li><p>Carlin Scrudato</p></li><li><p>Carlos Ancira</p></li><li><p>Charles Maxwell</p></li><li><p>Chris Chan</p></li><li><p>Christopher Glenn</p></li><li><p>Claire Sexton</p></li><li><p>Crystal Chan</p></li><li><p>Danica Michaels</p></li><li><p>Daniel Baxley</p></li><li><p>Daniel Finlayson</p></li><li><p>Daniel Rezende Fuser</p></li><li><p>Danille Sindac</p></li><li><p>Diego Ramirez</p></li><li><p>Dominick Martinez</p></li><li><p>Douglas Hart</p></li><li><p>Erin Donohue</p></li><li><p>Fletcher West</p></li><li><p>Hua Hoai Nam</p></li><li><p>James J.

                        <p>‌</p><blockquote> The following text is an open letter from Pau Escrich and the rest of the Vocdoni Team to <code>"Going from Bad to Worse: From Internet Voting to Blockchain Voting"</code> draft paper published on November 6th, 2020 by The Digital Currency Initiative of MIT Medialab.<br>Retrieve it here: <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/pubs/PSNR20.pdf">https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/pubs/PSNR20.pdf</a></blockquote><p>Dear Neha, Sunoo, Michael, Ronald,</p><p>Vocdoni is a Free and Libre open source project building a digital voting infrastructure that is universally verifiable, decentralized, scalable and anonymous.</p><p>This project represents a new paradigm for digital voting as compared to existing solutions which rely solely on a blockchain for vote traceability, employ closed-source software and even operate as a centralized service.</p><p>When reading your recent paper [1], we found that it addresses many of the very important problems and challenges that many e-voting solutions have. We believe, however, that the paper is missing some recent and crucial developments to the field of digital voting, such as those proposed by Vocdoni.</p><p>We have designed a decentralized voting platform [2] that is not only attack-resistant and universally-verifiable but also enables voter anonymity with the use of zk-SNARKs technology. We believe our design would solve some of the most important problems listed in the paper.</p><p>Regarding Zero Knowledge, the paper states the following:</p><blockquote>First, a digital-only solution does nothing to prevent physical monitoring by coercers or vote buyers. Secondly, zero-knowledge proofs are designed for a setting where the party with secret information wants to keep it secret (that’s why they’re using zero-knowledge proofs) — they generally do not prevent that party from revealing information voluntarily.</blockquote><p>At Vocdoni we are working on a series of developments that overcome these concerns.</p><p>In its current development stage, our system anonymizes voters' census inclusion proofs which are submitted with their votes. The content of each vote, however, is still publicly available and verifiable. This means the choices on each ballot can be known, but an outsider cannot link this ballot to any individual voter. (It's important to note that, in addition to the vote anonymity, the sense of the vote might be temporarily encrypted with a set of cryptographic keys revealed at the end of the election).</p><p>With regards to coercion attacks, our current zk-SNARKs circuit [3] already reduces the attack surface by leveraging the following methods:</p><ol><li>When an election ends, a set of keys (commit and reveal keys in the circuit schema) is revealed by multiple trusted parties. Using these keys, anyone can generate a valid ZK-proof, which would be indistinguishable from a legitimate voter's proof. This secondary proof could only be used to manipulate an election in the case that all trusted keyholding parties collaborated maliciously.</li><li>During an election, users can replace their vote as many times as they wish.</li></ol><p>These measures do not altogether rule out the possibility of an attack; before the election ends, a user could still exhibit their vote to a third party in exchange for a bounty. A buyer would need this user to prove that their vote is associated with a given nullifier on the Vochain. Such a vote-buying system would be complex, but feasible, to scale.</p><p>In order to achieve complete anti-coercion while keeping our design principles, we visualize two possile schemes for digital vote anonymity in the not-so-distant future:</p><h3 id="zk-rollups">Zk-Rollups</h3><p>As ZK-Rollups become computationally viable, they could also be used to achieve ballot content anonymization.</p><p>In this scenario a voter would send their vote to a private network rather than a public Blockchain. A private ZK-Rollup service(s) connected to this network would aggregate user ZK-Proofs and votes, and compute a valid cryptographic proof to verify:</p><ul><li>the list of vote nullifiers</li><li>the election Process identifier</li><li>the census Root Hash</li><li>the results of the vote batch</li></ul><p>The ZK-Rollup proof would then be sent to a public ledger containing the batch data. Any voter would be able to validate the inclusion of their vote by querying their own nullifier. The individual ballot's content would never be publicly available, but the result (computed inside the zk-SNARKs circuit) would be verifiable (otherwise the ZK-Proof would be invalid).</p><p>More details on the ZK-Rollup proposal can be found here [4].</p><h3 id="homomorphic-encryption">Homomorphic encryption</h3><p>Another alternative would be the use of homomorphic encryption on top of zk-SNARKs, anonymizing the vote content in addition to the already anonymized census inclusion proof.</p><p>In this scenario, the content of a ballot would be encrypted and directly added to the last currently encrypted result aggregation (without decrypting). Some homomorphic schemas also allow for verification that an encrypted ballot is valid for a set of rules (i.e not larger than N).</p><p>These are only small pieces of the paradigm shift we're trying to trigger for digital voting. If you feel engaged by following the discussion with us, we would be delighted to continue the conversation.</p><p>[1] <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/pubs/PSNR20.pdf">https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/pubs/PSNR20.pdf</a><br>‌‌[2] <a href="https://docs.vocdoni.io/">https://docs.vocdoni.io</a>‌‌<br>[3] <a href="https://docs.vocdoni.io/#/architecture/protocol/franchise-proof">https://docs.vocdoni.io/#/architecture/protocol/franchise-proof</a><br>‌‌[4] <a href="https://docs.vocdoni.io/#/architecture/protocol/franchise-proof?id=zk-rollups-proposal-for-anti-coercion-scalable-and-deterministic-execution">https://docs.vocdoni.io/#/architecture/protocol/franchise-proof?id=zk-rollups-proposal-for-anti-coercion-scalable-and-deterministic-execution</a></p><hr><p>To join the conversation and know more about Vocdoni <a href="https://docs.vocdoni.io/">check our Technical Architecture</a>, follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/vocdoni">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://discord.gg/sQCxgYs">join our Discord Server</a>.</p>

						How Moving From Batch To Real Time Improves The Customer Experience	</h2>
						
<p>Over time, the typical business acquires more and more applications. Some will be bespoke, some off the shelf, some cloud hosted SaaS tools and some in the data centre.</p>



<p>Frequently, business requirements will arise where these applications need to be integrated. For instance, every time an order is placed on our eCommerce website, a customer record should be created in the CRM system, the marketing system, and the ERP system.</p>



<p>As companies add more and more of these integrations, they end up with a spaghetti of bespoke interconnections and data exchanges which looks something like this:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="846" src="https://timeflow.systems/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/map-1024x846.png" alt="" srcset="https://timeflow.systems/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/map-1024x846.png 1024w, https://timeflow.systems/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/map-300x248.png 300w, https://timeflow.systems/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/map-768x634.png 768w, https://timeflow.systems/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/map.png 1057w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>These integration points have historically been developed in one of three ways:</p>



<ol><li>API Integration – When the e-commerce system records a new customer, the ERP and marketing systems are called in real time to create the record. This is the gold standard for moving data around in real time, but it does couple the systems together very tightly, so we have to worry about keeping APIs compatible so that we do not break upstream and downstream systems.</li><li>Batch Data Integration – Because of the complexity and effort involved in developing and managing point to point APIs, most information is exchanged between applications as batches. Every 24 hours or so, information is extracted from one system, uploaded to another as a data file, and imported into the destination. This is referred to as extract, transform and load.</li><li>Message Based Integration – As things happen in the source system, messages are transferred from the source to destination over an intermediary message queue. This is almost real time, and does decouple the systems somewhat, so is probably the optimal solution as of today, though it does have implications for how your source and destination systems are designed and built.</li></ol>



<p>Though event based architecture and messaging platforms such as Kafka are the solution to this mess, the problem is that most businesses are built on batch integration and unreliable point to point APIs. Though it’s hard to know, I would say the split is 70% batch, 20% point to point APIs and 10% messaging in the large enterprises that I am familiar with.</p>



<p>The problem is that when we run too many integration jobs with delayed and unreliable foundations, this leaks through to impact the customer experience. Take these frustrating interactions with your bank for instance:</p>



<ul><li>Online banking being slow to update as you make transactions;</li><li>Delays before a requested statement is sent out or a letter issued;</li><li>Delays in opening accounts and being onboarded as a customer;</li><li>Being passed between different call centre departments and having to explain your request over again;</li></ul>



<p>Slow and unreliable batch data exchange is likely to be at the heart of these frustrating experiences.</p>



<p>Now compare this to the Neo Banks who have experiences such as the below, where push notifications arrive on your phone the instant you swipe your debit card in a store:</p>



<p>This shows that the payment event is instantly flowing through the system and immediately enhancing the user experience with no batch processing. This still makes me smile now as I know the amount of technology required to make it happen. I think the fact that startup banks can do this seemingly simple thing should be concerning for the incumbents as it demonstrates that they are built on real time foundations.</p>



<p>To build these user experiences, companies need to implement an event driven architecture and move away from batch integration, point to point APIs towards real time streaming. This does go deeper than just modernising how you implement your applications, as discussed in this video.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>I believe that the move to event driven architectures and real time messaging are absolutely at the heart of the transformation that enterprises need to make. If we are building on batch integration, it is very hard to build personalised and responsive customer experiences, and hard to introduce intelligent automation and proactive use of data into business processes.</p>

    <div><div><div><p><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~Gray/">Jim Gray</a>, a Turing award winning computer science researcher at Microsoft Research, has used a "20 questions" methodology to gather data management requirements from scientists in <a href="http://www.sdss.org/">Astronomy</a>, <a href="http://lifeunderyourfeet.org/en/default.asp">Ecology</a>, <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/research/pubs/view.aspx?msr_tr_id=MSR-TR-2005-49">Materials Engineering</a>, and <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~Gray/">more</a>.  Each of these efforts led to very successful projects.</p>
<p>The idea is this:  You all, collectively, provide 20 science questions about your data that are difficult or cumbersome to answer using existing software.  I take those 20 questions and your data and design an online system that can answer each one.</p>
<p>For example, for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey project, the astronomers provided the following questions about their telescope data (among others):</p>
<ol>
<li>Find all galaxies without unsaturated pixels within 1' of a given point of ra=75.327, dec=21.023</li>
<li> Find all galaxies with blue surface brightness between and 23 and 25 mag per square arcseconds, and -10<super galactic="" latitude="" (sgb)="" <10,="" and="" declination="" less="" than="" zero.<="" li="">
</super></li><li>Find all galaxies brighter than magnitude 22, where the local extinction is &gt;0.75. </li>
<li>Find galaxies with an isophotal surface brightness (SB) larger than 24 in the red band, with an ellipticity&gt;0.5, and with the major axis of the ellipse having a declination of between 30” and 60”arc seconds.</li>
<li> Find all galaxies with a deVaucouleours profile (r¼ falloff of intensity on disk) and the photometric colors consistent with an elliptical galaxy.  The deVaucouleours profile </li>
<li>Find galaxies that are blended with a star, output the deblended galaxy magnitudes. </li>
<li> Provide a list of star-like objects that are 1% rare.</li>
<li> Find all objects with unclassified spectra. </li>
<li> Find quasars with a line width &gt;2000 km/s and 2.5<redshift<2.7. <="" li="">
</redshift<2.7.></li><li> Find galaxies with spectra that have an equivalent width in Ha &gt;40Å (Ha is the main hydrogen spectral line.) </li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p><strong>Royal Navy Hostages In Iran</strong>– <strong>What Really Happened</strong> is an event that at the time in 2007 was global news. From my perspective as Her Majesty’s Consul to Iran at the time, it was a hopelessly frustrating and humiliating experience. As a proud maritime nation, it was also not exactly one of our finest moments.</p><p>Now I had a saying at the time that whenever the Iranians got twitchy or felt threatened, they would take hostages. They had form for this and in this case they didn’t let me down.</p><p>In fact this 2007 incident was not the first time they had detained British military personnel.</p><p>In June 2004, three small vessels and eight<strong> Royal Navy</strong> personnel were detained by Iranian forces after they allegedly entered Iranian waters on the Shatt al-Arab river without permission. At the time, the story was broken when the capture was announced on state-run Iranian television. British officials only stated that they had “lost contact” with the boats, before confirming their detention.</p><p>On that occasion the men were later released unharmed, but only after being paraded blindfolded on Iranian TV and made to apologise for their role in the incident. The equipment was not returned.</p><p>So now fast forward to Friday March 23rd 2007:</p><p>Fifteen British Royal Navy and Royal Marine personnel were captured by Iranian authorities, more specifically the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) at gunpoint in the Persian Gulf just off the Iraqi coast that morning.</p><p>The Royal Navy insisted that they were operating legitimately in Iraqi waters the Iranians said they were in fact in Iranian waters. This inside/outside argument went on for the duration and long after the crisis with both sides providing information showing they were in the right.</p><p>Geographically, the incident occurred near the Shatt al-Arab (Arvandrud) waterway, which forms the southern border between Iran and Iraq. Territorial and navigational control over the waterway has been a constant source of friction between the two countries that helped to spark the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s.</p><p>What is not disputed is the fact that the sailors and marines, from the Type 22 frigate HMS <i>Cornwall</i>, had been inspecting, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1723, a ship that was believed to be smuggling cars into Iraq, though it was subsequently cleared by the boarding team after inspection.</p><p>The Ministry of Defence reiterated this by putting out a bulletin late in the day stating that the Royal Navy personnel had been <i>“engaged in routine boarding operations of merchant shipping in Iraqi territorial waters”</i> and had finished their search of the suspect vessel when they were surrounded by Iranian forces and taken into captivity</p><p>My first inkling of this event was seeing it at home on Iranian TV that same evening!</p><p>Needless to say my phone started ringing and I was summoned to the embassy for a crisis meet with the Ambassador and other colleagues from the political and public affairs sections.</p><p>Bottom line, get hold of the Iranian officials at their Foreign Ministry and find out exactly what was going on and request access to the captured personnel. While I would be doing this, the Ambassador would be talking to the powers that be in London.</p><p>Now, I should have been granted access to the hostages under the terms of Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, to which 170 nations are party which ” <em><strong>requires a nation arresting or detaining a foreign national to afford the detainee access to his or her consulate and to notify the foreign national of the right of consular access”</strong></em></p><p>In this case, Iran (which was a signatory) completely ignored the Convention. I was denied access despite repeated requests and it was not until the day of their release that I finally got to meet up with the sailors and marines at Tehran airport.</p><p>Several fruitless meetings at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs got me nowhere. They were not listening. At one stage I even showed them my warrant set out on parchment and signed personally by the Queen appointing me as Her Majesty’s Consul to Iran promising to protect the rights of British citizens in Iran. No reaction at all from the officials.</p><p>Because of this, the situation very quickly escalated upwards to levels way above my pay grade, and it fell to the Ambassador to quite rightly now take the lead on this.</p><p>From that point onwards, the whole sorry saga then slowly dragged on. It was humiliating to see the hostages paraded on Iranian TV almost every night. The Iranians were pulling out all their propaganda tools. The hostages were being shown happily playing board games, having slap up meals and on a couple of occasions one of them would be standing in front of a map of the disputed waterway explaining how they had intruded into Iranian waters.</p><p>If this was not bad enough, we than had to deal with the usual regime sponsored Basij rentamob being whipped up into a frenzy and stoning the embassy on the 1st April demanding that the hostages be put on trial.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Ambassador was doing his level best to gain some traction with the Iranians and I was left to deal with the foreign press who had flooded into Tehran to cover the story. Quite frankly, they would have been better off staying in London where this whole event was now being played out at Ministerial and Prime Minister/Presidential level.</p><p>I had nothing to tell them of any relevance or substance and they soon got bored with me.</p><p>Then, out of the blue Iran’s President Ahmadinejad on 4th April held a press conference to announce the release of the captives as a “gift” to the British people. They would be released the following day. At last!</p><p>Time to put repatriation logistics in place.</p><p>Fortunately, London had also got its act together and had chartered a British Airways plane to bring them back to the UK. I also learnt that the plane would also be bringing back a large number of the British media who had been encamped in Tehran for the story.</p><p>Therefore, it was decided that I and two of my colleagues from the embassy would escort the freed hostages back to the UK. My primary task was to keep the journalists at bay and away from them on the plane as obviously they needed to be debriefed officially back in the UK first.</p><p>The next day, we drove to Tehran airport and it was here that I finally got to meet the now freed hostages. They were decked out in shiny new suits (apart from the only female) and all clutching plastic carrier bags full of Iranian goodies….pistachio nuts, CD’s, Persian candles, books and a host of other Iranian treats.</p><div id="gallery-1"><figure><p><a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/mydiplomaticlifethetruestories/images-2/#main"><img width="510" height="286" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/images-2.jpg?fit=510%2C286&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" alt="Iran" aria-describedby="gallery-1-1391" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/images-2.jpg?w=510&amp;ssl=1 510w, https://i0.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/images-2.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/images-2.jpg?fit=510%2C286&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "></a></p><figcaption id="gallery-1-1391"> RN hostages just after release in Tehran</figcaption></figure></div><p>They all looked fit and well and were looking forward to going home although rather nervous as to what people would think of their actions during captivity. They asked me my thoughts, I gave no answer.</p><p>Then after much farewell bidding between the hostages and the various Iranian functionaries who were accompanying them, we boarded the plane. The party occupied the front (first/business class) section of the plane, then a curtain was drawn across the aisle to keep them from the view of the journalists at the back who were very noisy and shouting at me for access.</p><p>Also on the plane that had travelled out from the UK were a couple of military people loaded down with mysterious large duffel bags. What was in these bags became clear once we were airborne. They contained uniforms!</p><p>As we left Iranian airspace, the order went out to the sailors and marines from one of the military types that they were to get out of their shiny new suits and back into uniform before landing in UK. They all looked rather startled by this and I think the reality of their situation was beginning to finally dawn on some of them.</p><p>Whatever they felt, they all dutifully got back into uniform. It was hard to believe that each and every uniform fitted them like a glove and they all had the appropriate rank badges. Impressive. Obviously someone back in the UK had done their homework on measurements.</p><p>At last, the plane approached Heathrow much to my relief. I had managed to have a chat with all of them on the flight but myself and my two colleagues had one hell of a job restraining the journalists in the back of the plane. Throughout the flight, they kept on shouting questions and camera lens would be poked through the dividing curtain to try and get the money shot…but their efforts were all in vain.</p><p>Finally, after a smooth landing, the aircraft taxied to the heavily cordoned-off VIP area. The whole party then disembarked from the plane and off they went for their debrief, medicals and reunions with families. Myself and my two colleagues remained on the plane and then left when things had quietened down.</p><p>All manner of things happened after this. The Captain of HMS Cornwall was relieved of his command. An enquiry was set up to look into the affair but it’s conclusions were neither here nor there.</p><div id="gallery-2"><figure><p><a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/british-naval-hostages-in-iran-the-backstory/thumbnail-5/#main"><img width="192" height="335" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/thumbnail-5.jpg?fit=192%2C335&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" alt="Royal Navy Hostages In Iran - What Really Happened" aria-describedby="gallery-2-1523" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/thumbnail-5.jpg?w=192&amp;ssl=1 192w, https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/thumbnail-5.jpg?resize=172%2C300&amp;ssl=1 172w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 192px) 100vw, 192px" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/thumbnail-5.jpg?fit=192%2C335&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "></a></p><figcaption id="gallery-2-1523"> RN Hostages In Iran</figcaption></figure></div><p>Rumours of a deal involving 5 Iranian detainees held by the US in Iraq and a freed Iranian diplomat abounded. Did George W do a favour for his old pal Yo Blair? we will never know. Of course any rumours of a deal were vehemently denied in London.</p><p>Then (in my opinion) came the disgraceful episode of one of the hostages being permitted to sell their story to a national newspaper for a reputed Â£100,000.</p><p>Personally, I was just thankful it was all over at my end in Tehran. Of course we would continue to protest to the Iranians about their disregard of the Vienna Convention, using the hostages as propaganda tools, the aggression of the IRGC, but knowing that at the end of day. nothing would change in the end.</p><p>So I will just leave this particular story here with a quote from British Admiral Jonathon Band who said at the time “it was not our finest hour”</p><p>Harking back to my saying about Iranians taking hostages when feeling twitchy. With this latest incident, they had now embarrassed the UK twice within the space of a few years. Then in 2016, a similar scenario was played out, this time the seizing of 10 US …</p></div></div>

He tells me he’s “moving soon.”</p><p>Rabois revealed his decision to decamp during our conversation at <a href="https://meridian.stellar.org/index.html">Meridian Conference</a>, an event organized by the Stellar Development Foundation group focused on cryptocurrency.  (Rabois, an investor in Stripe, joined Stellar’s board of directors after Stripe invested in Stellar six years ago.)</p><p>“I think San Francisco is so poorly run and managed that it’s impossible to stay here,” Rabois said.  He believes he’s not the only one abandoning the Bay Area, a place he’s called home for two decades.  He cited anecdotal evidence of many people leaving his social circles and noted, “COVID kind of masks that stuff.  It is not as obvious where people are moving and whether they have actually moved since everyone is working remotely.</p><p>Rabois is one of the many forsakers in the Bay Area.  His planned departure follows the theft of Peter Thiel, Rabois’ former Stanford buddy and PayPal partner, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-peter-thiel-20180215-story.html">in Los Angeles in 2018</a>.  (Rabois joined the venture capital firm of Thiel Founder’s Fund last year.) In a widely read IPO prospectus this year, Alex Karp, CEO of Palantir, a PayPal spinout and Rabois investment, also stated that he was <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/denver/news/2020/08/19/palantir-peter-thiel-alex-karp-headquarters-denver.html?ana=e_den_bn_breakingnews_breakingnews&amp;j=90524545&amp;t=Breaking%20News&amp;mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWVRBek1HSTVabVpoTlRNMyIsInQiOiI4WEMzeGcrYStNT3dpK2NpZTBLNVwvZERWUzdBYzhWZkhFenY0K3VlNGxOeUpwdFh4ZHJ6WDFRZkxCZndDT1NVankxWW5hbFdibHl6cHJNd2tYNW9CWDRMb1c0STB1WGRxODlYaGppclFyRk5EZGllQ1JOejZVRTFTUUtUVFpwK3AifQ%3D%3D">company relocation to Colorado</a> after breaking into the valley’s tech companies, calling them unpatriotic for <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/08/26/palantirs-filing-to-go-public-invokes-patriotism-and-attacks-silicon-valley/">military contracts poo-poo</a>.  And Jack Dorsey, CEO of <a href="https://fortune.com/company/twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> and Square, where Rabois worked as director of operations for three years, planned to settle in Africa <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/05/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-reconsidering-africa-move-on-coronavirus-fears.html">before the pandemic hits</a>.</p><p>Add Rabois to the list of emigrants.  He said COVID had helped show that the perceived disabilities in leaving California were “more psychological than real.”</p><p>Data from Opendoor (which Rabois co-founded) and competing companies like Zillow reveal a trend.  “Rental searches in the Bay Area are in free fall, down 30%,” said Rabois.  In big cities like New York and Los Angeles, rental searches are also dropping like crazy, as people recognize “all the downsides” of city living – a higher cost of living and closer neighborhoods – with a few. – some of the mostly social benefits, he said.</p><p>“It’s very clear right now, people are massively changing their preferences,” said Rabois.  He added, however, that it remains to be seen whether the trend will continue once a vaccine is widely distributed and cities are able to reopen.</p><p>So where is Rabois going?  Just in time to avoid a winter on the west coast, he buys a house in the sun.  “Miami is an incredibly beautiful, cosmopolitan city, has an interesting mix of New Yorkers, Latin Americans and Europeans,” Rabois said of his future home.  Oh, and “There is no state income tax.</p><p>“Living in the Bay Area for 20 years is like, everything you wish you had,” Rabois said.  “I’m a fan of the hot weather and the water, so it feels like I’m going on vacation.”</p><p>How many will follow?</p><p>***</p><p>PS I don’t mean <em>I told you</em> for now, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/15/macos-big-sur-update-bricking-some-macbook-pros/">this first report</a> new MacOS computers, as Aaron pointed out yesterday, seems to confirm my theory that the deployment of Apple’s new technology <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/11/10/apple-new-mac-chips-cpu/">would not go as planned</a>.</p><p><strong>Robert hackett</strong></p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/rhhackett">@rhhackett</a></p><p><a href="mailto:robert.hackett@fortune.com">robert.hackett@fortune.com</a></p><nav role="navigation" aria-label="Continue Reading"><h2>Continue Reading</h2></nav></div></div></article></main></div></div></div></div>]]>

<blockquote>
<p>Privacy is a fundamental human right. At Apple, it’s also one of our core values. Your devices are important to so many parts of your life. <strong>What you share from those experiences, and who you share it with, should be up to you. We design Apple products to protect your privacy and give you control over your information.</strong> It’s not always easy. But that’s the kind of innovation we believe in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We could not agree more. That’s why we created Little Snitch in the first place, 18 years ago.</p>
<p>It is your right to know where your computer connects to. To whom it talks. It’s your right to see these connections. It’s your right to allow them. And it’s your right to deny them.</p>
<p>That’s our philosophy. You should always be able to see what’s going on and to make informed decisions.</p>
<p>When we first discovered that Apple’s new Network Extension Framework — that all third party firewalls are now required to use on macOS Big Sur<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> — didn’t report network traffic during some large software update download, we reported this bug to Apple on July 1 (FB7839544), hoping it would be fixed in the final version of Big Sur.</p>
<p>But it came worse. Three months later we realized, that a number of other Apple services like App Store, Maps or FaceTime also showed this strange behavior of acting invisibly, bypassing the new filter API. So we reported our new findings again on October 1 (FB8762834).</p>
<p>As it turned out, this behavior is on purpose. There’s an <a href="https://www.obdev.at/support/littlesnitch/245914647368270">explicit whitelist</a> that allows certain macOS services to bypass any third party firewalls and to communicate on the Internet without being even noticed by the user. A hole in the wall.</p>
<p>It is understandable, that some network connections are essential for a secure and smooth system operation. It makes sense to <a href="https://blog.jacopo.io/en/post/apple-ocsp">check the validity of signing certificates</a> to effectively protect against malware attacks. It makes sense to download critical security updates in a timely fashion to prevent malware from exploiting vulnerabilities that have already been fixed. Blocking such connections would usually cause more harm than good.</p>
<p>But hiding these connections completely from the user makes no sense. It contradicts the idea of a transparent and trustworthy system and undermines the user’s trust in that system.</p>
<p>We’ve been facing similar challenges in Little Snitch as well. If we allow users to block each and every network connection, they might inadvertently render their computer unusable, causing DNS lookups to hang, preventing users from logging into their accounts and more.</p>
<p>How did we solve it? By being transparent and informative. By telling users about the possible consequences that the denial of certain connections might have, and in some cases recommending them not to do so. By providing default firewall rules to allow a few essential connections, but still letting users opt out. By developing the <a href="https://obdev.at/iap/">Internet Access Policy</a> that also gives third party developers the possibility to explain, which connections their apps are about to make, and whether it’s OK or not to deny them.</p>
<p>But the final decision whether to accept the possible consequences should always be left to the user, to you.</p>
<p>In the light of the recent public discussions that this topic has triggered we are extremely confident that Apple stands by their word to give users control over their information and will therefore eliminate this kind of whitelisting in a future macOS update.</p>
<p>Just yesterday Apple announced their willingness to address such privacy concerns by improving the way how online certificate checks are performed, and even <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491">adding the possibility to completely opt out of these security protections</a>.</p>
<p>Until then we won’t be restless either. We are already working on an alternative technique how to make even those currently hidden connections visible again in Little Snitch in one of our next updates. Looks very promising so far!</p>
<p>So stay tuned and protect your privacy. It’s yours, after all.</p>

The problem is that people are gated to information about their own bodies with complex and expensive barriers. The future of medicine is empowering people with their own biometrics, and Levels is the first company doing that in a meaningful way.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>–Dr. Anthony Gustin, Founder of Perfect Keto</span></p><blockquote><p><span>We have real-time data and metrics on the stuff we own: the mileage of our cars, the usage of water in our house, the performance of our 401k retirement accounts, etcetera. Yet, with our most important asset — our own health — we’re stuck in the stone ages without any access to our metabolic metrics and data.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-v-f94c7cca=""> <!----> <div data-v-0cf44990="" data-v-f94c7cca=""><div><p>A former front-end student of mine (Zoe*) recently emailed me, and honestly wanted to understand why is it that I chose to code <a href="http://swimm.io/">Swimm</a>, with Vue.Js and not React:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I just have one question for you: Why Vue?[...] I hope you're not rolling your eyes thinking - “ah no, another question about Vue”. Although knowing you and your passion, I'm sure you have a pretty strong opinion that could swallow me into becoming a Vue fan without even knowing it.”</p>

<p>Vue.js gained a reputation in recent years as an edgy must-know framework, but developers often question what the hype is about, how it relates to them and what web framework they should choose for their product.</p>
<p>While there might be some over-hype around the expected <a href="https://madewithvuejs.com/blog/vue-3-roundup#:~:text=Vue%203%20release%20date,2020%2C%20according%20to%20the%20roadmap.">Vue 3 release due in Q3 2020</a>, Vue has been gaining traction for a few years now, and it was just a matter of time for <a href="https://www.netguru.com/blog/13-top-companies-that-have-trusted-vue.js-examples-of-applications">bigger companies</a> like Netflix, Behance, Grammarly, Alibibaba, GitLab and others, to pick it up. Yet according to <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-web-frameworks-wanted2">Stackoverflow’s 2020 developer</a> React.js is still the most wanted web framework (Vue.js coming in second).</p>
<h3>Vue.js vs React In a Nutshell</h3>
<p>I first used Vue at <a href="https://www.imcreator.com/">IM Creator</a>, a product I co-built originally with JQuery, and Vue was a breath of crisp air in my face. It was user friendly and progressive as it enabled me to use the framework for specific parts each time, without huge migrations. I could then for example create a menu in Vue, while the rest remained in legacy JQuery. What’s there not to like?</p>
<p>With Swimm (a new dev tool product) it wasn't even a question. I started our PoC with Vue.js and continued since then to our Beta self-served version. Several benefits should speak volumes to Startups these days especially compared to React:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vue is Lightweight and Flexible</strong>. It means it's a framework that feels more like a library than a framework at all. You can try it out first in small use cases in your app before going all-in.</li>
<li><strong>Vue is less intrusive than React</strong> and much easier to onboard. Project components and structure in Vue are similar whie projects in React each vary in architecture and implementation. I find that you can recognize Vue structures easily which is what speeds up onboarding time for any developer learning a new codebase. Vue becomes easier to maintain. This is especially true for smaller products.</li>
<li><strong>Readability is key</strong> - Vue is based on the most basic principles of the Web and is more readable than React. The html/css and JS are separate while in React everything is in JS.</li>
<li><strong>Indie at its core</strong>. While it’s my personal opinion, many developers appreciate tools that are not backed by tech giants (for example React backed by Facebook, and Angular by Google), but rather grows from a community and that is why it is highly oriented to developer needs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>When does React Trump Vue.js:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>React is still most wanted by the industry</strong>. That can be a problem for new coders. From my recent experience recruiting for Swimm’s growing dev team, Vue is still harder to recruit for because of React’s persistent popularity. <strong>By the same token</strong>, even if many of the larger companies are picking it up, it’s still part of side projects and not the main product. This is why for the <a href="https://www.itc.tech/">ITC.tech</a> web-dev Bootcamp, I created a React-based curriculum.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility in some aspects</strong>. React still has the ability to split between the visibility of a component and maintenance of the component - and still provides more flexibility.</li>
<li><strong>Docs are light years ahead</strong>. The features Release in React is fast paced and as React docs are extensive and elaborate. [Try skimming through all of the 500 pages of questions on React on Stackoverflow].</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>To Sum it Up: A Note to Zoe</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“ Hi Zoë,</p>
<p>I chose Vue for many reasons.</p>
<p>It is easy to integrate into existing projects (That was my need the first time I used Vue)</p>
<p>It is has a more readable syntax</p>
<p>It's really reactive (no need to explicitly call the set function)</p>
<p>It is not maintained by a big company (Facebook / Google)[...]</p>
<p>Give it a try :)”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course there is always a trade-off. These lessons learned reflect my personal views, insight gained from working in various startups and alongside numerous tech clients. As always, <a href="https://www.mindk.com/blog/react-vs-vue/">in depth research</a> is required to make sure which framework best suits your business case. But if you’re looking for a flexible  non-enterprise solution, Vue has proved easy to learn, scalable, user-friendly backed by a solid community that caters to other developers.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
       <p>Lambda School is a coding bootcamp that only charges tuition if you get a job. Founder/CEO Austen Allred frequently takes to Twitter, defending his bootcamp against <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/lambda-schools-job-placement-rate-is-lower-than-claimed.html">allegations of fraud</a>, and rebutting critics with case after case of student success.</p>
<p>I was initially excited about Lambda School, but have slowly grown disillusioned over time. So when they released their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lambdaschool.com/reports/2019-outcomes-report#fast-facts">2019 H1 Outcomes Report</a>, I was excited to finally access a ground truth and put an end to all the speculation.</p>
<p>Instead, I found a consistent pattern of deception.</p>
<p>In the rest of this piece, I’ll walkthrough a number of examples, in which Allred:</p>
<ul>
<li>Claims a job placement rate of 86%, when the actual number is as low as 55%, and at least as bad at 70%</li>
<li>Misrepresents graduate salaries on Twitter, despite claiming a random sample</li>
<li>Calls regulatory approval a “significant endorsement”, despite a troubled history of bans</li>
<li>Lies about having been homeless</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these are blatant and explicit, some are more subtle. I’ve done my best to present the facts fairly, and leave the rest up to your judgement.</p>
<h3 id="1-Allred-Misrepresents-Student-Outcomes"><a href="#1-Allred-Misrepresents-Student-Outcomes" title="1. Allred Misrepresents Student Outcomes"></a>1. Allred Misrepresents Student Outcomes</h3><p>In early 2019, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/austen/status/1082815326960533504?lang=en">Allred took to Twitter</a> to share student outcomes, listing the following salaries:</p>
<ol>
<li>J: $80,000+</li>
<li>S: $80k</li>
<li>D: $110k base, ($130k total)</li>
<li>C: $130k</li>
<li>T: $90k</li>
<li>L: $140k</li>
<li>J: $85k</li>
<li>L: $89k</li>
<li>A: $85k</li>
<li>R: $75k</li>
<li>S: $70k</li>
</ol>
<p>A year later, when the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lambdaschool.com/reports/2019-outcomes-report#fast-facts">Outcomes Report</a> was released, it cited a median salary of just $70,000. In stark contrast, Allred’s 11 Tweets report exactly 0 students making less than $70,000. Statistically, that’s like flipping a coin and getting 11 heads in a row (probability .00049).</p>
<p>This seems bad, but whatever, Allred is just highlighting a few heartwarming anecdotes right? Surely he doesn’t actually claim that this is a randomly selected sample?</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/Austen/status/1082818077132091393">Except he absolutely does:</a><br><img src="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/images/allred-tweet.png"></p>
<p>To see just how poorly Allred’s claims line up against the official <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lambdaschool.com/reports/2019-outcomes-report#fast-facts">Outcomes Report</a>, we can plot the histograms side by side:<br><img src="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/images/lambda-outcomes.png"></p>
<p>Allred claims that his examples were randomly selected, but his own statements are contradicted by the official outcomes report.</p>
<h3 id="2-Allred-Repeatedly-Misrepresents-Job-Placement-Rates"><a href="#2-Allred-Repeatedly-Misrepresents-Job-Placement-Rates" title="2. Allred Repeatedly Misrepresents Job Placement Rates"></a>2. Allred Repeatedly Misrepresents Job Placement Rates</h3><p>Earlier this year, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/lambda-schools-job-placement-rate-is-lower-than-claimed.html">New York Magazine reported</a> that Lambda school had marketed itself as having an 86% job placement rate, but then released an investor memo reporting a much lower rate of just 50%.</p>
<p>Allred took to podcasts, explaining in an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osrytvuiU8Y&amp;t=3m20s">interview with Jason Calacanis</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we talk to investors, we talk in terms of enrolled students… of those students who were enrolled, X% were hired. Whereas when schools speak publicly, they speak in terms of graduated students. So obviously those two numbers are always going to be different.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to clarify:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That 86% was somewhat out of date… so we quickly put together what the real numbers would have been, which was 78%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, so that seems reasonable enough. Case closed?</p>
<p>But then the official <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lambdaschool.com/reports/2019-outcomes-report#fast-facts">Outcomes Report</a> was released, and contradicted Allred’s own statements: </p>
<ul>
<li>Of the 448 students in the cohort, only 318 graduated</li>
<li>Of those 318, only 284 graduated on time</li>
<li>Of 284 graduates, Lambda could only reach 255</li>
<li>Of those 255, only 201 had jobs</li>
<li>Of those 201, Lambda “did not have salary data… due to our data collection methods”, giving us data for 178 students</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The job placement rate for enrolled students is 201 out of 448, or 45%. The job placement rate for graduated students is 201/318, or 63%.</strong></p>
<p>It actually gets worse. The original Lambda School claim was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>86% of Lambda School graduates are hired within 6 months and make over $50k a year</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But according to the outcomes report, 26 of the placed graduates are making under $50,000. <strong>The actual placement rate for graduates making over $50,000 is just 55%</strong>. That’s a far cry from the 86% they claim, and much closer to the 50% reported by New York Magazine.</p>
<p>To be clear about timing, the New York Magazine article was published February 19th 2020, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osrytvuiU8Y&amp;t=3m20s">interview</a> was on March 3rd, and the Outcomes Report was <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/lambdaschool/status/1244054419471302664">published March 28th 2020</a>. So these should all be about the same cohort, or at least a similar set of students.</p>
<p>So where does the 78% come from? Following article, Allred published a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/note-outcomes-data-lambda-school-austen-allred?articleId=6637802701117882368">note on LinkedIn</a> with the following chart:<br><img src="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/images/lambda-flow.png"></p>
<p>So 78% is what you get if you ignore students who graduated late, ignore students who have yet to graduate,  ignore the “graduated and disengaged” students, and pretend everyone is making over $50,000.</p>
<p>To his credit, Allred does provide another table which includes disengaged sudents and reports a 70% placement rate. Not only is this a far cry from the 86% originally reported, it also includes the 15% of placed students making under $50,000.</p>
<p>Although it may seem fair to count late graduates in the H2 report, note that this is a misrepresentive sample. Students who graduate late will likely have worse results later on, and underperform students who graduated on time. If Lambda wanted to account for this, they could have included 2018 H2 late graduates in the 2019 H1 report, but they neglected to do so.</p>
<h3 id="3-Allred-Misrepresents-Legal-Action-Against-Lambda-School"><a href="#3-Allred-Misrepresents-Legal-Action-Against-Lambda-School" title="3. Allred Misrepresents Legal Action Against Lambda School"></a>3. Allred Misrepresents Legal Action Against Lambda School</h3><p>In March 2019, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19374417">Allred wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Regulators love us</strong> - they’re sick of for profit schools promising a lot and delivering little except debt. [emphasis mine]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>December the same year, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/sandofsky/status/1211717254712135680?lang=en">it was revealed</a> that Lambda was actually operating illegally, with no approval from regulators.</p>
<p>Okay, so this looks bad, but it doesn’t mean Allred is lying. It’s entirely possible that he thought regulators loved Lambda in March, and wasn’t corrected until a $75,000 fine hit the following month.</p>
<p>When Lambda finally did get approval to operate in California, Allred <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lambdaschool.com/the-commons/baby-steps-incentive-aligned-higher-education-job-training">wrote</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the past year, Lambda School worked to advance an ambitious goal: become the first online school approved by California regulators to offer ISAs. <strong>We achieved a major victory when state regulators licensed us as a school in August, representing a significant endorsement</strong> for our all-online, career-focused education model. However, in order to secure this approval, we made the difficult decision to stop offering our ISA option to students in California.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be clear, none of this is an outright lie, but it is a dishonest representation of the regulatory environment. To recap:</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19374417">March 2019</a>: Allred claims “Regulators love us”</li>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/sandofsky/status/1211717254712135680">April 2019</a>: Regulators fine Lambda $75,000</li>
</ul>
<p>Then Lambda applies for approval, leading to this saga in which:</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/sandofsky/status/1211786705428086784">July 2019</a>: Regulators deny the application, ordering Lambda to cease operations</li>
<li>Lambda continues operations anyway</li>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/sandofsky/status/1211793179831177216">December 2019</a>: Lambda re-applies for approval, is told to cease operations</li>
<li>Lambda continues operations anyway</li>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lambdaschool.com/the-commons/an-update-on-lambda-school-and-isas-in-california">June 2020</a>: Lambda submits another application, regulators say they cannot use ISAs</li>
<li>Lambda finally agrees to stop using ISAs in California</li>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lambdaschool.com/the-commons/baby-steps-incentive-aligned-higher-education-job-training">October 2020</a>: Allred calls regulator approval a “major victory” and “significant endorsement”</li>
</ul>
<p>As best I can surmise, those are the facts of this case. You can decide for yourself if you think Allred is acting with integrity.</p>
<h3 id="Bonus-Allred-Lies-about-Experiencing-Homelessness"><a href="#Bonus-Allred-Lies-about-Experiencing-Homelessness" title="Bonus: Allred Lies about Experiencing Homelessness"></a>Bonus: Allred Lies about Experiencing Homelessness</h3><p>This has nothing to do with Lambda School, and is admitadely somewhat gratuitous. But it does point to continued dishonesty on the part of Allred, and is too blatant to ignore.</p>
<p>In 2017, Allred <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/Austen/status/940658401209491456">tweeted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was homeless, had no skills, no degree, just $300 and a laptop, but that’s all you need.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17938403">2018 Hacker News comment</a>, he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m also formerly homeless…. I know how hard it is to focus on getting a job when you’re just trying to survive</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://bagholderreport.substack.com/p/lambda-school-is-the-culmination">article</a> includes a screenshot of an Allred’s reply to a tweet which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have been homeless, slept on those same streets [1]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The arc from homeless to multi-millionaire founder would be inspiring, except that it isn’t actually true.</p>
<p>In a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6758165">2013 Hacker News comment</a>. Allred writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I lived in a Honda Civic this summer as I was getting a startup off the ground… and <strong>I had a half dozen people offer to let me stay at their place or crash on their couch rent-free.</strong></p>
<p>….As a result, <strong>I wasn’t living in a car for lack of other options</strong>, but rather out of belief that I could create something by sheer will-power, and that I was going to do that come hell or high water. My homelessness was a matter of seeking something greater than myself, not being lost to poverty. [emphasis mine]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, in a now-deleted blog post titled <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://archive.is/OqxKP">Voluntary Homeless in Silicon Valley</a> Allred writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Candidly, living in a car in Silicon Valley had much more appeal to me than a single bed and a shared bathroom… Much more than money, what fuels me is obsession with minimalism, reading way too much Thoreau, and trying to continually see life from a different angles…&nbsp; It’s about questioning society at its fundamentals, and seeing what a life not tied down by a foundation really feels like. And so far I love it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So again, Allred’s claims are… not technically a lie? I mean he did sleep out of a car, but he did it voluntarily. You’re free to make your own judgements, but when I hear “I have been homeless, slept on those same streets”, I do not think of someone with half a dozen offers of free housing. That isn’t poverty, it’s cosplay.</p>
<h3 id="Conclusion-Why-does-any-of-this-matter"><a href="#Conclusion-Why-does-any-of-this-matter" title="Conclusion: Why does any of this matter?"></a>Conclusion: Why does any of this matter?</h3><p>Am I just piling onto an already heavily criticized company? Am I guilty of being a critic rather than a creator?</p>
<p>I initially wrote about this purely using Lambda School as an example to illustrate a broader point about incentive alignment. But the more I read, the clearer it became that they were just consistently dishonest. Not outright fraudulent, but just really misleading about everything from student outcomes, to regulatory pressure, to the founder’s own history.</p>
<p>Still, why does any of this matter if Lambda is genuinely educating and helping students?</p>
<div><p>First of all, despite the outcomes report, we still have no idea what the median outcome actually is! They’re reporting data for 178 out of 448 enrolled students, which is just 40%. According to the report, the other 60% of enrolled students either:</p></div>
<ul>
<li>Remain unemployed (54 students, 12% of cohort)</li>
<li>Graduated late or not at all (164 students, 37%, of cohort)</li>
<li>Became mysteriously …</li></ul></div></div>

<h2>What Does DocOnce Look Like?<a href="#what-does-doconce-look-like" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>DocOnce text looks like ordinary text (much like Markdown <a href="#markdown-input" id="id1">[1]</a>),
but there
are some almost invisible text constructions that allow you to control
the formating. Here are some examples.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li>Bullet lists automatically arise from lines starting with <code><span>*</span></code>,
or <code><span>o</span></code> if the list is to be enumerated.</li>
<li><em>Emphasized words</em> are surrounded by <code><span>*</span></code>. <strong>Words in boldface</strong>
are surrounded by underscores.</li>
<li>Words from computer code are enclosed in backticks and
then typeset <code><span>verbatim</span> <span>(in</span> <span>a</span> <span>monospace</span> <span>font)</span></code>.</li>
<li>Section headings are recognized by special
decorating characters <code><span>=</span></code> before and after the heading, e.g.,
<code><span>=====</span> <span>Here</span> <span>is</span> <span>a</span> <span>subsection</span> <span>heading</span> <span>=====</span></code>.</li>
<li>The abstract of a document starts with <em>Abstract</em> as paragraph
heading, and all text up to the next heading makes up the abstract,</li>
<li>Blocks of computer code are surrounded by
<code><span>!bc</span></code> (begin code) and <code><span>!ec</span></code> (end code) tags on separate lines.
Blocks of computer code can also be imported from source files.</li>
<li>Blocks of LaTeX mathematics are surrounded by
<code><span>!bt</span></code> (begin TeX) and <code><span>!et</span></code> (end TeX) tags on separate lines.
Inline mathematics is surrounded by dollar signs: <code><span>$a=b$</span></code>.</li>
<li>Comment lines start with <code><span>#</span></code> and are not visible in the output document.</li>
<li>Comments to authors can be inserted throughout the text with a
syntax like <code><span>[**name</span> <span>1**:</span> <span>comment...]</span></code> and made visible or invisible as desired.</li>
<li>Title, author, date, figures, and movies are written on one line,
starting with a keyword: <code><span>TITLE:</span></code>, <code><span>AUTHOR:</span></code>, <code><span>DATE:</span></code>, <code><span>FIGURE:</span></code>,
and <code><span>MOVIE:</span></code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Write DocOnce documents in a text editor with monospace font</p>
<p>Some DocOnce constructions are sensitive to whitespace (indentation in
lists is a primary example), so you <em>must</em> use a text editor with
monospace font (also known as verbatim text). Never use fonts like
Arial or Helvetica.
Other popular markup languages such as Sphinx and Markdown are also
sensitive to whitespace and require a monospace font.</p>

<h3>What Can DocOnce Be Used For?<a href="#what-can-doconce-be-used-for" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>LaTeX is ideal for articles, thesis, and books, but the PDF files does
not look fresh and modern on tablets and phones or big computer
screens. For the latter type of media you need HTML-based documents
with strong support for nice layouts. Tools like Sphinx, Markdown, or
plain HTML with Bootstrap are then more appropriate than LaTeX, but
involves a very different syntax.  DocOnce lets you write one text in
one place and then generate the most appropriate language for the
media you want to target.  DocOnce also has many extra features for
supporting large documents with much code and mathematics, not found
in any of other publishing tool.</p>

own favorite LaTeX packages. DocOnce is a much simpler format and
corresponds to writing in quite plain LaTeX and making the ascii text
look nice (be careful with the use of white space!). This means that
although DocOnce has borrowed a lot from LaTeX, there are a few points
LaTeX writers should pay attention to. Experience shows that these
points are so important that we list them <em>before</em> we list typical
DocOnce syntax!</p>
<p>Any LaTeX syntax in mathematical formulas is accepted when DocOnce
translates the text to LaTeX, but if output in the <code><span>sphinx</span></code>, <code><span>pandoc</span></code>,
<code><span>mwiki</span></code>, <code><span>html</span></code>, or <code><span>ipynb</span></code> formats is also important, one should
follow the rules below.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li>AMS LaTeX mathematics is supported, also for the <code><span>html</span></code>, <code><span>sphinx</span></code>,
and <code><span>ipynb</span></code> formats.</li>
<li>If you want LaTeX math blocks to work with <code><span>latex</span></code>, <code><span>html</span></code>, <code><span>sphinx</span></code>,
<code><span>markdown</span></code>, and <code><span>ipynb</span></code>, it is recommended to use only
the following equation environments: <code><span>\[</span> <span>...</span> <span>\]</span></code>,
<code><span>equation*</span></code>, <code><span>equation</span></code>, <code><span>align*</span></code>, <code><span>align</span></code>. <code><span>alignat*</span></code>, <code><span>alignat</span></code>.
Other environments, such as <code><span>split</span></code>, <code><span>multiline</span></code>, <code><span>gather</span></code> are
supported in modern MathJax in HTML and Sphinx, but may face
rendering problems (to a larger extent than <code><span>equation</span></code> and <code><span>align</span></code>).
DocOnce performs extensions to <code><span>sphinx</span></code>, <code><span>ipynb</span></code>,
and other formats such that
labels in <code><span>align</span></code> and <code><span>alignat</span></code> environments work well.
If you face problems with fancy LaTeX equation environments in
web formats, try rewriting with plain <code><span>align</span></code>, <code><span>nonumber</span></code>, etc.</li>
<li>Do not use comments inside equations.</li>
<li>Newcommands in mathematical formulas are allowed, but not in
the running text. Newcommands must be defined in files with names
<code><span>newcommands*.tex</span></code>. Use <code><span>\newcommands</span></code> and not <code><span>\def</span></code>.
Each newcommand must be defined on a single line.
Use Mako functions if you need macros in the running text.</li>
<li>Use labels and refer to them
for sections, figures, movies, and equations only.
MediaWiki (<code><span>mwiki</span></code>) does not support references to equations.</li>
<li>Spaces are not allowed in labels.</li>
<li>There is just one <code><span>ref</span></code> command (no <code><span>\eqref</span></code> for equations) and references to
equations must use parentheses. Never use the tilde ``&nbsp;`` (non-breaking
space) character before references to figures, sections, etc., but
tilde is allowed for references to equations.</li>
<li>Never use <code><span>\pageref</span></code> as pages are not a concept in web documents
(there is only a <code><span>ref</span></code> command in DocOnce and it refers to labels).</li>
<li>Only figures and movies are floating elements in DocOnce, all other elements
(code, tables, algorithms) must appear <em>inline</em> without numbers or labels
for reference <a href="#exception" id="id2">[2]</a> (refer to inline elements by a section label).
The reason is that floating elements are in general
not used in web documents, but we made an exception with figures
and movies.</li>
<li>Keep figure captions shorts as they are used as references in the
Sphinx format. Avoid inline mathematics since Sphinx will strip it
away in the figure reference.
(Many writing styles encourage rich captions that
explains everything about the figure, but this will work well
only in the HTML and LaTeX formats.)</li>
<li>You cannot use <code><span>subfigure</span></code> to combine several image files in one
figure, but you can combine the files to one file using
the <code><span>doconce</span> <span>combine_images</span></code> tool. Refer to individual image files
in the caption or text by (e.g.) “left” and “right”, or
“upper left”, “lower right”, etc.</li>
<li>Footnotes can be used as usual in LaTeX, but some HTML formats are not
able to display mathematics or inline verbatim or other formatted
code (emphasis, boldface, color) in footnotes - have that in mind.</li>
<li>Use plain <code><span>cite</span></code> for references (e.g., <code><span>\citeauthor</span></code> has no counterpart
in DocOnce). The bibliography must be prepared in the Publish format,
but import from (clean) BibTeX is possible.</li>
<li>Use <code><span>idx</span></code> for index entries, but put the definitions between paragraphs,
not inside them (required by Sphinx).</li>
<li>Use the <code><span>\bm</span></code> command (from the <code><span>bm</span></code> package, always included by DocOnce)
for boldface in mathematics.</li>
<li>Make sure all ordinary text starts in column 1 on each line. Equations
can be indented. The <code><span>\begin{}</span></code> and <code><span>\end{}</span></code> directives should start
in column 1.</li>
<li>If you depend on various LaTeX environments for your writings, you have
to give up these, or implement <em>user-defined environments</em> in DocOnce.
For instance, examples are normally typeset as subsections in DocOnce,
but can also utilize a user-defined example environment.
Learn about the exercise support in DocOnce for typesetting
exercises, problems, and projects.</li>
<li>Learn about the preprocessors Preprocess and Mako - these are smart
tools for, e.g., commenting out/in large portions of text and creating
macros.</li>
<li>Use <em>generalized referenes</em> when referring to companion documents
that may later become part of this document (or migrated out of this document).</li>
<li>Follow <a href="https://github.com/hplgit/setup4book-doconce">recommendations for DocOnce books</a> if you plan to write a book.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<table id="exception">
<colgroup><col><col></colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr><td><a href="#id2">[2]</a></td><td>There is an exception: by using <em>user-defined environments</em>
within <code><span>!bu-name</span></code> and <code><span>!eu-name</span></code> directives, it is possible to
label any type of text and refer to it. For example, one can have
environments for examples, tables, code snippets, theorems, lemmas, etc.
One can also use Mako functions to implement enviroments.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<div>
<p>Use the preprocessor to tailor output</p>
<p>If you really need special LaTeX constructs in the LaTeX output
from DocOnce, you may use use preprocessor if-tests on
the format (typically <code><span>#if</span> <span>FORMAT</span> <span>in</span> <span>("latex",</span> <span>"pdflatex")</span></code>) to
include such special LaTeX code. With an else clause you can easily
create corresponding constructions for other formats. This way
of using Preprocess or Mako
allows advanced LaTeX features, or HTML features for the HTML formats,
and thereby fine tuning of the resulting
document. More tuning can be done by automatic editing of the
output file (e.g., <code><span>.tex</span></code> or <code><span>.html</span></code>) produced by DocOnce using
your own scripts or the <code><span>doconce</span> <span>replace</span></code> and <code><span>doconce</span> <span>subst</span></code> commands.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Autotranslation of LaTeX to DocOnce</p>
<p>The tool <code><span>doconce</span> <span>latex2doconce</span></code> may help you translating LaTeX files
to DocOnce syntax. However, if you use computer code in floating
list environments, special packages for typesetting algorithms,
example environments, <code><span>subfigure</span></code> in figures,
or a lot of newcommands in the running text, there will be need for
a lot of manual edits and adjustments.</p>
<p>For examples, figure environments can be translated by the program
<code><span>doconce</span> <span>latex2doconce</span></code> only if the label is inside the caption and
the figure is typeset like</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>\begin</span><span>{</span>figure<span>}</span>
  <span>\centering</span>
  <span>\includegraphics</span><span>[width=0.55\linewidth]</span><span>{</span>figs/myfig.pdf<span>}</span>
  <span>\caption</span><span>{</span>This is a figure. <span>\labe</span><span>{</span>myfig<span>}}</span>
<span>\end</span><span>{</span>figure<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If the LaTeX is consistent with respect to placement of the label, a
simple script can autoedit the label inside the caption, but many
LaTeX writers put the label at different places in different figures,
and then it becomes more difficult to autoedit figures and translate
them to the DocOnce <code><span>FIGURE:</span></code> syntax.</p>
<p>Tables are hard to interpret and translate, because the headings and
caption can be typeset in many different ways. The type of table
that is recognized looks like</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>\begin</span><span>{</span>table<span>}</span>
<span>\caption</span><span>{</span>Here goes the caption.<span>}</span>
<span>\begin</span><span>{</span>tabular<span>}{</span>lr<span>}</span>
<span>\hline</span>
<span>\multicolumn</span><span>{</span>1<span>}{</span>c<span>}{</span><span>$</span><span>v_</span><span>0</span><span>$</span><span>}</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>\multicolumn</span><span>{</span>1<span>}{</span>c<span>}{</span><span>$</span><span>f_R</span><span>(</span><span>v_</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>$</span><span>}</span><span>\\</span>
<span>\hline</span>
1.2 <span>&amp;</span> 4.2<span>\\</span>
1.1 <span>&amp;</span> 4.0<span>\\</span>
0.9 <span>&amp;</span> 3.7
<span>\hline</span>
<span>\end</span><span>{</span>tabular<span>}</span>
<span>\end</span><span>{</span>table<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Recall that table captions do not make sense in DocOnce since tables
must be inlined and explained in the surrounding text.</p>

<p>A few months ago, the company I co-founded&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://money.yahoo.com/oyster-acquires-carrom-accelerate-global-100000172.html">Carrom, was acquired by Oyster</a>. I joined Oyster to build the employment platform. It was officially my first time in a product role. Although I have been creating products for a good part of my life, I felt I lacked a lot of basic product management wisdom.</p>



<p>Over the past few months, I’ve been learning about the missing pieces with guidance from a few great mentors. I have curated a list of blog posts, books, and videos I’ve consumed along the way.</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="311" data-permalink="https://sooraj.io/screenshot-2020-11-18-at-20-36-01-1/" data-orig-file="https://soorajio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/screenshot-2020-11-18-at-20.36.01-1.png" data-orig-size="1562,868" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="screenshot-2020-11-18-at-20.36.01-1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soorajio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/screenshot-2020-11-18-at-20.36.01-1.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://soorajio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/screenshot-2020-11-18-at-20.36.01-1.png?w=640" src="https://soorajio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/screenshot-2020-11-18-at-20.36.01-1.png?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://soorajio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/screenshot-2020-11-18-at-20.36.01-1.png?w=1024 1024w, https://soorajio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/screenshot-2020-11-18-at-20.36.01-1.png?w=150 150w, https://soorajio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/screenshot-2020-11-18-at-20.36.01-1.png?w=300 300w, https://soorajio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/screenshot-2020-11-18-at-20.36.01-1.png?w=768 768w, https://soorajio.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/screenshot-2020-11-18-at-20.36.01-1.png 1562w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>







<p>The above is not an exhaustive list of things you have to learn. But this can help you get started.</p>



<p><strong>These are very superficial.</strong> It might also work for non-engineers. But I might have taken some things for granted that I already know. Hence the title Product Management for Engineers.</p>



<p>I will keep updating the list as I discover more quality content. You can follow me on&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/soorajchandran_" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>&nbsp;if you are interested.</p>

<p>Shaarif Ansari got the call on 11 November at around 9 in the morning. On the phone was a police officer from Powai police station, in the suburbs of Mumbai. “Ansari please come to the police station,” said the officer. “We have received a complaint from your employer WhiteHat Jr. The company officials are here at the station already. We are waiting for you.”&nbsp;</p>


<p>Ansari was taken aback. It is not everyday that you have a police officer call you. Almost immediately he clarified that he did not work at WhiteHat Jr anymore. That he was fired by the company in the first week of September and had had no contact with them since, so what was all this about? The person was in no mood to explain or chat. He cut Ansari off, and asked him to turn up at the station immediately. Caught completely by surprise and with no idea about what was in store for him, Ansari said he was on his way.</p>

                <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>


<p>Late 2019, I presented at an internal Azimuth Security conference some work on hacking Chrome through it's JavaScript engine. </p>
<p>One of the topics I've been playing with at that time was deoptimization and so I discussed, among others, vulnerabilities in the deoptimizer. For my talk at <a href="https://www.infiltratecon.com/conference/briefings/attacking-chrome-in-2020-a-journey-through-v8s-optimizing-compiler.html">InfiltrateCon 2020</a> in Miami I was planning to discuss several components of V8. One of them was the deoptimizer. But as you all know, things didn't quite go as expected this year and the event has been postponed several times. </p>
<p>This blog post is actually an internal write-up I made for Azimuth Security a year ago and we decided to finally release it publicly.</p>
<p>Also, if you want to get serious about breaking browsers and feel like joining us, we're currently looking for experienced hackers (US/AU/UK/FR or anywhere else remotely). Feel free to reach out on <a href="https://twitter.com/__x86">twitter</a> or by <a href="mailto:jf@[company][dot]com">e-mail</a>.</p>
<p>Special thanks to the legendary <a href="https://twitter.com/mdowd">Mark Dowd</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hzon">John McDonald</a> for letting me publish this here.</p>


<p>For those unfamiliar with TurboFan, you may want to read an <a href="https://doar-e.github.io/blog/2019/01/28/introduction-to-turbofan/">Introduction to TurboFan</a> first. Also, <a href="https://benediktmeurer.de/publications/">Benedikt Meurer</a> gave a lot of very interesting talks that are strongly recommended to anyone interested in better understanding V8's internals.</p>

<h3 id="long-story-short">Long story short</h3>
<p>This vulnerability is a bug in the way the simplified lowering phase of TurboFan deals with <code>FrameState</code> and <code>StateValues</code> nodes. Those nodes are related to deoptimization. </p>
<p>During the code generation phase, using those nodes, TurboFan builds deoptimization input data that are used when the runtime bails out to the deoptimizer.</p>
<p>Because after a deoptimizaton execution goes from optimized native code back to interpreted bytecode, the deoptimizer needs to know where to deoptimize to (ex: which bytecode offset?) and how to build a correct frame (ex: what ignition registers?). To do that, the deoptimizer uses those deoptimization input data built during code generation.</p>
<p>Using this bug, it is possible to make code generation incorrectly build deoptimization input data so that the deoptimizer will materialize a fake object. Then, it redirects the execution to an ignition bytecode handler that has an arbitrary object pointer referenced by its accumulator register.</p>
<h2 id="internals">Internals</h2>
<p>To understand this bug, we want to know: </p>
<ul>
<li>what is ignition (because we deoptimize back to ignition)</li>
<li>what is simplified lowering (because that's where the bug is)</li>
<li>what is a deoptimization (because it is impacted by the bug and will materialize a fake object for us)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ignition">Ignition</h3>
<h4 id="overview">Overview</h4>
<p>V8 features an interpreter called Ignition. It uses TurboFan's macro-assembler. This assembler is architecture-independent and TurboFan is responsible for compiling these instructions down to the target architecture.</p>
<p>Ignition is a register machine. That means opcode's inputs and output are using only registers. There is an accumulator used as an implicit operand for many opcodes.</p>
<p>For every opcode, an associated handler is generated. Therefore, executing bytecode is mostly a matter of fetching the current opcode and dispatching it to the correct handler.</p>
<p>Let's observe the bytecode for a simple JavaScript function.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>let</span> <span>opt_me</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>o</span><span>,</span> <span>val</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>value</span> <span>=</span> <span>val</span> <span>+</span> <span>42</span><span>;</span>
  <span>o</span><span>.</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>value</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>opt_me</span><span>({</span><span>x</span><span>:</span><span>1.1</span><span>});</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Using the <code>--print-bytecode</code> and <code>--print-bytecode-filter=opt_me</code> flags we can dump the corresponding generated bytecode.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>Parameter count 3

<p>Disassembling the function shows that the low level code is merely a trampoline to the interpreter entry point. In our case, running an x64 build, that means the trampoline jumps to the code generated by <code>Builtins::Generate_InterpreterEntryTrampoline</code> in <code>src/builtins/x64/builtins-x64.cc</code>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>d8&gt; %DisassembleFunction(opt_me)

<p>This code simply fetches the instructions from the function's <code>BytecodeArray</code> and executes the corresponding ignition handler from a dispatch table.</p>

<p>Below is the part of <code>Builtins::Generate_InterpreterEntryTrampoline</code> that loads the address of the dispatch table into the <code>kInterpreterDispatchTableRegister</code>. Then it selects the current opcode using the <code>kInterpreterBytecodeOffsetRegister</code> and <code>kInterpreterBytecodeArrayRegister</code>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>Today, the CNCF Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) voted to promote <a href="https://buildpacks.io/">Cloud Native Buildpacks</a> to incubation from the CNCF sandbox. Since joining CNCF in 2018, the Cloud Native Buildpacks project has added more than 15 new <a href="https://github.com/buildpacks/community/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md">production users</a>, new committers from more organizations, and defined an <a href="https://github.com/buildpacks/community/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md">open governance process</a> and a clear <a href="https://github.com/buildpacks/community/blob/main/ROADMAP.md">project roadmap</a>.</p>



<p>The goal of the Cloud Native Buildpacks (CNB) project is to translate source code into container images with a focus on developer productivity, container security, and operations involving containerized applications at scale. The project also aims to unify the buildpack ecosystems of the past with a well-defined contract ideal for modern cloud native platforms.</p>



<p>“Cloud Native Buildpacks enable developers to work at whichever layer of abstraction is most productive for them while solving big problems like vulnerable dependencies and slow builds,” said Emily Casey, Buildpacks maintainer and staff engineer at VMware. “The project’s robust specification and tools have helped facilitate an ecosystem of composable buildpacks that interoperate with diverse platforms. We are excited to continue to grow the community as Buildpacks moves to incubation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Heroku (Salesforce) open sourced the original Buildpacks project in 2012 with the hope that they would spread beyond the Heroku platform,” said Terence Lee, Buildpacks co-creator and principal engineer at Salesforce. “In 2018, Heroku and Pivotal (VMware) came together to start Cloud Native Buildpacks as a CNCF Sandbox project. With the move from the CNCF Sandbox to Incubation, Buildpacks are now fulfilling that vision while using OCI Image standards, increasing transparency, and building our community. We look forward to working with the community on new features and even more adoption.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cloud Native Buildpacks were accepted into the CNCF Sandbox in October 2018. Buildpacks are used in production by end user organizations, including Greenhouse, Salesforce, and VMware; in cloud native open source software <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-for-k8s/blob/master/README.md#purpose">Cloud Foundry on K8s</a>, <a href="https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold/tree/master/examples/buildpacks">Google Skaffold</a>, <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/announcing-waypoint">Hashicorp Waypoint</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/pivotal/kpack">kpack</a>; and in commercial offerings including <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/app-platform/concepts/buildpack/">DigitalOcean App Platform,</a> <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/google-cloud-now-supports-buildpacks">Google Cloud</a>, <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/2019/11/introducing-salesforce-evergreen.html">Salesforce Evergreen</a>, and <a href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/build-service">VMware Tanzu Build Service</a>.</p>



<p>“HashiCorp Waypoint was built from day one with buildpacks in mind. We wanted a way for developers to go from code to deploy as quickly and easily as possible and Cloud Native Buildpacks provided the standard, technology, and community to achieve that goal,” says Mitchell Hashimoto, founder of HashiCorp “We look forward to continue investing in and improving our buildpack usage.”</p>



<p>“Developers shouldn’t have to think about how to package their applications for deployment, so I’m excited to see Cloud Native Buildpacks promoted to a CNCF incubation project,” said James Ward, developer advocate, Google Cloud. “At Google Cloud, we’ve open sourced our Buildpacks and added support for them into numerous products, including Cloud Build, Cloud Run, App Engine, Cloud Functions, Cloud Code, Cloud Shell, and Skaffold. Now going from source to running on the cloud is even easier.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Main Buildpacks Features:</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Specification</strong> – a formal-language <a href="https://github.com/buildpacks/spec">specification</a> that describes the platform-to-buildpack contract.</li><li><strong>Implementation</strong> –&nbsp; robust lifecycle tooling necessary for platforms to add support for building images using buildpacks.</li><li><strong>Platform</strong> – components that provide a developer experience directly to end users, including integrations with popular build tools and cloud platforms.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>Notable Milestones:</strong></p>



<ul><li>6 maintainers from Salesforce and VMware</li><li>20 committers&nbsp;</li><li>More than 2k contributions</li><li>Almost&nbsp; 5k commits</li><li>Over 1,200k GitHub Stars</li><li>15 contributors</li></ul>



<p>The Cloud Native Buildpacks project is complementary to other CNCF projects, including Helm, Harbor, and Kubernetes. Cloud Native Buildpacks produce Open Container Initiative (OCI) images managed by Helm, stored in Harbor, and deployed to Kubernetes. The project’s overarching goal is to provide a reliable, safe, modular, and fast way to build OCI images from source or input artifacts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Cloud Native Buildpacks provide a reliable and seamless way to turn code into containers,” said Chris Aniszczyk, CTO of Cloud Native Computing Foundation and executive director of OCI. “This lowers the barrier for developers to take advantage of cloud native technology and improves the developer experience for a segment of developers and cloud native platforms.”</p>



<p>“Users need a simple way to package, provision, and manage cloud native applications. Buildpacks – originally used by Heroku or Cloud Foundry – have now gone fully cloud-native, embracing key patterns popularized by Kubernetes.” said Alexis Richardson, CEO Weaveworks and former CNCF TOC member, “Those are the same key patterns that are at the core of GitOps, and used in combination they provide Weaveworks customers the ability to upgrade and patch their application deployments.”</p>



<p>As a CNCF-hosted project, joining incubating technologies Argo, CloudEvents, CNI, Contour, Cortex, CRI-O, Dragonfly, etcd, Falco, gRPC, Linkerd, NATS, Notary, OPA, OpenTracing, Operator Framework, Rook, SPIFFE, SPIRE, Thanos, and KubeEdge, Cloud Native Buildpacks is part of a neutral foundation aligned with its technical interests, as well as the larger Linux Foundation, which provides governance, marketing support, and community outreach. For more information on maturity requirements for each level, please visit the <a href="https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/process/graduation_criteria.adoc">CNCF Graduation Criteria</a>.</p>

The maintainers will be hosting <a href="https://kccncna20.sched.com/event/focW?iframe=no">office hours</a> during <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/">KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America Virtual 2020</a> to answer any questions about the project.

        <section>
            <div><p>Falco is an open source tool that peeks into the internals of your system to detect and report on syscall and network activity. It was originally built at <a href="https://sysdig.com/">Sysdig</a> and later donated to the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">CNCF</a> where it's doing well as an Incubator project with an active community.</p>
<p>My understanding of Falco from <a href="https://twitter.com/lorisdegio">Sysdig's CTO</a> is that it's designed to be the last-line of defence in systems where the focus is usually put on preventative measures. Falco stands in to report on anomalies and unexpected behaviour.</p>
<p>When running <a href="https://k3s.io/">k3s</a> at an edge location, it may be difficult to gain physical access to servers, and there may be partial connectivity available.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>By default there are three possible event sources for Falco:</p>
<ul>
<li>The kernel and a number of syscalls</li>
<li><a href="https://ebpf.io/">eBPF</a> - faster than kernel access, but not available everywhere</li>
<li>Userland using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html">PTRACE(2)</a> - for potential use with SaaS products like AWS Lambda</li>
</ul>
<p>These events can be sent to a webhook such as an <a href="https://www.openfaas.com/">OpenFaaS function</a> for remediation at the edge, or alerting and decision-making in a centralised action-centre in the cloud. As a generic event-sink, data can be ingested directly from the Kubernetes API, but a smart device such as a door-lock could also send data such as the current temperature, or unexpected motion picked up from an accelerometer.</p>

<p>Conceptual architecture: event detection from the Kernel, eBPF, the k3s API with alerting and remediation via <a href="https://www.openfaas.com/">OpenFaaS</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this guide I'll show you how to configure Falco to run at the edge with k3s on an ARM64 host such as the <a href="https://amperecomputing.com/emag/">Ampere eMAG®</a> provided by <a href="https://blog.equinix.com/blog/2020/10/06/equinix-metal-metal-and-more/">Equinix Metal</a> (Equinix provide credits for open source projects hosted by the CNCF), an AWS Graviton instance, or a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/">Raspberry Pi 4</a>.</p>
<h2 id="tutorial">Tutorial</h2>
<p>We'll start off by flashing Ubuntu Linux to the SD card, then adding k3s, finally we'll install Falco and configure k3s to send it events.</p>
<h3 id="downloadtheoperatingsystem">Download the Operating System</h3>
<p>You will need a Raspbery Pi 4. I am using a device with 4GB of RAM, but 2GB will also work.</p>
<p>Download the Ubuntu 20.04.01 image using the link for the Raspberry Pi 4.</p>
<p>You can get the image here: <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi">https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi</a></p>
<p>Now use <a href="https://etcher.io/">Etcher.io</a> or <code>dd</code> to write the server OS image to your Raspberry Pi's SD card.</p>
<h3 id="firstboot">First boot</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Unlike with RaspiOS, SSH is enabled by default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Boot up the machine and find it on your network using <code>nmap</code>:</p>
<pre><code>nmap -sP 192.168.0.0/24
</code></pre>
<p>Log in and change the password from <code>ubuntu</code> to whatever you like:</p>
<pre><code>ssh ubuntu@192.168.0.101
</code></pre>
<p>Next, copy over your SSH key:</p>
<pre><code>ssh-copy-id ubuntu@192.168.0.101
</code></pre>
<h3 id="preparefork3s">Prepare for k3s</h3>
<p>Edit <code>/firmware/boot/cmdline.txt</code> and add to the first line, don't add any line-breaks:</p>
<pre><code>cgroup_enable=cpuset cgroup_memory=1 cgroup_enable=memory
</code></pre>
<p>This enables cgroups which are required to set limits for containers. The step is taken from my tutorial for Raspbian: <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/test-drive-k3s-on-raspberry-pi/">Will it cluster? k3s on your Raspberry Pi</a></p>
<p>Reboot your RPi:</p>
<pre><code>sudo reboot
</code></pre>
<h3 id="installk3swithk3sup">Install k3s with k3sup</h3>
<p>Use my k3sup tool to your workstation to install k3s over SSH. Do not run this on the RPi itself.</p>
<pre><code>curl -sLS https://get.k3sup.dev | sudo sh
</code></pre>
<p>Now install via <code>k3sup install</code>:</p>
<pre><code>k3sup install --ip 192.168.0.101 --user ubuntu \
  --channel latest
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>--channel</code> command installs Kubernetes 1.19.</p>
<h3 id="installfalcoanditsdependencies">Install Falco and its dependencies</h3>
<p>Log back into the RPi via SSH.</p>
<p>A fork of the upstream project is required to run on 64-bit ARM at present, but I expect these changes to be merged back in soon. A maintainer has provided a .deb file:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get -y install linux-headers-$(uname -r) dkms
</code></pre>
<p>DKMS is required to build a Kernel module. This is one of the ways that Falco can instrument your system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can also build from source using the <code>build/aarch64</code> branch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Install Falco's binary and let it build its kernel module:</p>
<pre><code>wget https://fs.fntlnz.wtf/falco/aarch64-builds/falco-0.26.1-48%2Bf82d905-aarch64.deb

sudo dpkg -i ./falco-0.26.1-48+f82d905-aarch64.deb
</code></pre>
<p>Silence some errors in the falco config file.</p>
<p>Edit <code>/etc/falco/falco.yaml</code> and replace the following:</p>
<pre><code>syscall_event_drops:
  actions:
    - log
    - alert
  rate: .03333
  max_burst: 10
</code></pre>
<p>With:</p>
<pre><code>syscall_event_drops:
  actions:
    - ignore
  rate: .03333
  max_burst: 10
</code></pre>
<p>This turns off some noise that I was seeing from the ARM-64 version.</p>
<p>Enable it upon boot-up:</p>
<pre><code>sudo systemctl enable falco \
  &amp;&amp; sudo systemctl start falco
</code></pre>
<p>You can find the various pre-loaded rules for falco at <code>/etc/falco/rules/</code></p>
<pre><code>ls /etc/falco/rules/

falco.yaml
falco_rules.local.yaml
falco_rules.yaml
k8s_audit_rules.yaml
</code></pre>
<h3 id="simulateafalcoevent">Simulate a Falco event</h3>
<p>Before configuring Kubernetes to send events to Falco, we can send a sample event that will trigger one of the built-in alerts.</p>
<pre><code>cat &gt;&gt; sample-event.json &lt;&lt;EOF
{"kind":"Event","apiVersion":"audit.k8s.io/v1beta1","metadata":{"creationTimestamp":"2018-10-25T13:58:49Z"},"level":"Request","timestamp":"2018-10-25T13:58:49Z","auditID":"841d3e6d-90d2-43df-8da4-684738bee3d5","stage":"ResponseComplete","requestURI":"/api/v1/namespaces","verb":"create","user":{"username":"system:anonymous","groups":["system:masters","system:authenticated"]},"sourceIPs":["192.168.99.1"],"objectRef":{"resource":"namespaces","name":"foo","apiVersion":"v1"},"responseStatus":{"metadata":{},"code":201},"requestObject":{"kind":"Namespace","apiVersion":"v1","metadata":{"name":"foo","creationTimestamp":null},"spec":{},"status":{"phase":"Active"}},"requestReceivedTimestamp":"2018-10-25T13:58:49.730588Z","stageTimestamp":"2018-10-25T13:58:49.736141Z","annotations":{"authorization.k8s.io/decision":"allow","authorization.k8s.io/reason":""}}
EOF
</code></pre>
<p>Invoke the event via Falco's REST API:</p>
<pre><code>curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/k8s-audit --data-binary @sample-event.json -H "Content-Type: application/json"
</code></pre>
<h3 id="triggeraneventfromk3s">Trigger an event from k3s</h3>
<p>An additional source we can add is the events from the Kubernetes audit log. This feature has to be turned on via the k3s systemd definition.</p>
<p>Create a folder for audit events:</p>
<pre><code>sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/rancher/audit
</code></pre>
<p>Download <code>audit-policy.yaml</code> to <code>/var/lib/rancher/audit</code></p>
<pre><code>wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/falcosecurity/evolution/master/examples/k8s_audit_config/audit-policy.yaml
sudo cp audit-policy.yaml /var/lib/rancher/audit/
</code></pre>
<p>Create a webhook config file:</p>
<pre><code>export IP=192.168.0.23

cat &lt;&lt; EOF | sudo tee /var/lib/rancher/audit/webhook-config.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Config
clusters:
- name: falco
  cluster:
    server: http://$IP:8765/k8s-audit
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: falco
    user: ""
  name: default-context
current-context: default-context
preferences: {}
users: []
EOF
</code></pre>
<p>Edit <code>/etc/systemd/system/k3s.service</code> and add these lines to the end:</p>
<pre><code>        '--kube-apiserver-arg=audit-log-path=/var/lib/rancher/audit/audit.log' \
        '--kube-apiserver-arg=audit-policy-file=/var/lib/rancher/audit/audit-policy.yaml' \
        '--kube-apiserver-arg=audit-webhook-config-file=/var/lib/rancher/audit/webhook-config.yaml' \
</code></pre>
<p>Now reload:</p>
<pre><code>sudo systemctl daemon-reload &amp;&amp; \
 sudo systemctl restart k3s
</code></pre>
<p>My favourite use-case from the docs was detecting AWS secret keys stored in ConfigMaps. Of course, we all know confidential data belongs inside Vault or Kubernetes Secrets which can be encrypted at rest.</p>
<p>Let's try it out?</p>
<p>Run this from your laptop:</p>
<pre><code>kubectl create configmap aws-creds \
  --from-literal aws_access_key_id=AKES20LNOA
</code></pre>
<p>Now check the logs from Falco:</p>
<pre><code>sudo journalctl -u falco --lines 100

Oct 13 16:55:42 ubuntu falco[89818]: 16:55:24.207932928: Warning K8s configmap with private credential (user=system:admin verb=create configmap=aws-creds-1 config={"aws_access_key_id":"AKES20LNOA"})
</code></pre>
<p>You can find this example under <a href="https://falco.org/docs/event-sources/kubernetes-audit/">"Kubernetes Audit Rules" in the Falco docs</a>.</p>
<h3 id="expandthek3scluster">Expand the k3s cluster</h3>
<p>You can add additional nodes into the k3s cluster by installing Ubuntu as we did for the first node, then running the <code>k3sup join</code> command.</p>
<pre><code>k3sup join --ip $IP -user ubuntu \
  --server-ip 192.168.0.101
</code></pre>
<p>k3s also supports High-Availability and fail-over of the master nodes using a SQL backend or an embedded version of etcd.</p>
<h2 id="wrappingup">Wrapping-up</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Full disclosure: Sysdig is a client of <a href="https://www.openfaas.com/consulting/">OpenFaaS Ltd</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We now have Ubuntu 20.04.01, Kubernetes with k3s and Falco all built for 64-bit ARM running on our Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>It's now over to you to <a href="https://falco.org/">explore Falco more</a>, and to fine-tune your Kubernetes rules.</p>
<p>I also want to give a shout out to my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/fntlnz">fntlnz</a> who is the Falco maintainer that helped me get a working build of Falco on 64-bit ARM. It took us several days to get here.</p>
<h3 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h3>
<p>It took me quite a while to figure out how to get this to work, but it was nice when everything clicked into place. So be warned, the Falco documentation still refers to "Dynamic Auditing" which was removed and deprecated in Kubernetes and the upstream instructions don't cover k3s yet, or any release newer than 1.13.</p>
<p>I hope to see the team at Sysdig spend some time updating the documentation and examples for newer Kubernetes releases and for an official 64-bit ARM binary to be made available soon.</p>
<h3 id="takingitfurther">Taking it further</h3>
<p>The easier way to get security and other insights, just like the open source Falco project is to use Sysdig's paid product. You can find a step-by-step tutorial by Dan here: <a href="https://sysdig.com/blog/k3s-sysdig-falco/">K3s + Sysdig: Deploying and securing your cluster… in less than 8 minutes!</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__next"><div><article><div><div><p>Have you ever find yourself replacing a tool in your stack because it can't grow with your needs?
Not every app designed to scale well. Sometimes you ran into issues what one app can't solve. So you add another tool to the stack. But now your data in two different places and you have to learn a new app with a new UI. This is time-consuming and your data is scattered across apps.</p>
<h2>Introducing MeshX</h2>
<p>MeshX is a platform to build scalable tools and processes for your team. The purpose is to provide you with the building blocks and grant you full control. We think that one tool can replace the many others. How we achieve this? Let me explain.</p>
<h2>Building Blocks</h2>
<p>All of your apps that you use probably has 3 components:</p>
<ol>
<li>It needs to store your data structured somewhere.</li>
<li>A way to view and interact with the data.</li>
<li>And it has some magic ✨ rules that make it work.</li>
</ol>
<h3>1. Custom domain</h3>
<p>So you first need data. This data usually has some schema to it probably one of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hardcoded domain</strong>: The most common way to handle the problem. E.g. in JIRA you have your issues, bugs, backlog, ideas, releases. This design by its nature is not extendable. The developers of the app needs to support the features you need. There is no way to define domains on your own.</li>
<li><strong>Generic domain</strong>: Okay, so let's abstract away the schema into generic domains. E.g. in Wrike you have tasks, projects, folders. You can model many things this way, it's extensible. But the solution is not native. At larger scale it easily becomes out of control. This schema has hierarchical relations, which is not intuitive for some use cases.</li>
<li><strong>Domain-less</strong>: No relation, no schema for your data. Trello works this way. You have boards, lists and cards, then you can decide what you want to store. It's flexible, but don't scale well. A lot of company using Trello in early stages but later they need to swap because this type not work well with growing needs.</li>
<li><strong>Custom domain</strong>: Custom domain combine the advantages of the above solutions. It let you define your custom <strong>types</strong> and relation between them. Of course this comes with complexity. But for that you get endless scalability and extensibility.</li>
</ol>
<p>I believe that custom domain is the future. It has a lot of potential and match really well with agile companies.</p>
<p><img src="https://mesh-x.com/images/type.jpg" alt="Custom schema" title="Custom Schema"></p>
<h3>2. Unified UI</h3>
<p>Secondary you need a way to <strong>view</strong> and interact with your data. Many apps using UI components like: <em>Tables</em>, <em>Boards</em>, <em>Calendars</em>, <em>Documents</em>, <em>Graphs</em>. Similar UI patterns but differ in the use and feel. Basically need to learn the same thing again and again. Unifying these components is speed up the learning curve of new tools and save you and your team time. Imagine you can use your bug tracker using the same UI as your CRM.</p>
<p><img src="https://mesh-x.com/images/table.jpg" alt="Table View" title="Table View">
<img src="https://mesh-x.com/images/board.jpg" alt="Board View" title="Board View"></p>
<h3>3. Custom Workflows</h3>
<p>And finally the apps has some logic. The software code that make it work behind the scenes. In the past you have two choices:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Use a prebuild tool with fixed functionality (hard to extend and it's not customized)</em></li>
<li><em>Use a custom software built for your needs (its cost a lot of money and time)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>But today there are other options, that gained more popularity in the last years. Low-code and no-code solutions.
In MeshX the rules in your apps can be defined using a low-code/no-code editor. The idea for this actually came from the game industry where visual programming tools are used for a long time. It enabled non-technical users like 3D artists and designers to create custom logic in games. That gave me the idea that it would be a great fit for agile businesses. These <strong>flows</strong> enable you to build tools that replace manual processes and automatize most of your work without need to write a single line of code.</p>
<p><img src="https://mesh-x.com/images/flow.jpg" alt="Flow Editor" title="Flow Editor"></p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>So to wrap this up we have a custom domain for flexibility, unified UI for easy use and custom workflows for custom business needs. Together these blocks are the foundation for all the tools that you can use to run your business. This is the grand vision of MeshX. One tool to rule them all.</p>
<p>If you like the idea to have all of your tools and data organized and automatized, you can sign up for a beta access.
I am also happy to answer your questions in <a href="mailto://roland@mesh-x.com">email</a>.</p>
<p><em>In the next post I'm going to show you an example how to use MeshX to build a simple social media automation tool.</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>So it’s November, and <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> season is in the air! It’s time for everyone’s favorite Santa-based light hearted learn-to-program-or-a-new-language holiday season programming challenge series. Every year a bunch of us gather around the fireplace, roast chestnuts, and brainstorm all of the interesting ways we can solve these cute themed puzzles every day. These puzzles are designed to accessible enough for most new programmers, but deep enough to provide entertainment for experienced ones. I’ve <a href="https://blog.jle.im/entries/tagged/advent-of-code.html">written many blog posts</a> on some of the interesting insight some of the puzzles have yielded, and I also <a href="https://github.com/mstksg/advent-of-code-2019/blob/master/reflections.md">post my reflections on as many puzzles I can</a> while solving them in Haskell. And if you’re solving things in Haskell, I also published an <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/advent-of-code-api">open-sourced rate-limited API library</a> so you can fetch and submit answers from the comfort of your command line.</p>
<p>To kick off the season, I’ve decided to write about one of my favorite puzzles from Advent of Code 2019 – <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/22">Day 22: Slam Shuffle</a>. To me, it stands out because it’s a perfect example of how Haskell’s approach to mathematical abstraction nudges you into the direction of an efficient solution — in a way that other languages would obscure or make less obvious.</p>
<p>So, let’s dive in! In the end, hopefully this post can get you excited for this wonderful season, and maybe also shed some insight into what it means when we say that Haskell can help you leverage math to find good solutions to your real problems.</p>
<p>Of course, this post has spoilers for Advent of Code 2019 Day 22, if you are planning on trying to figure it out from yourself. If you haven’t tried it, I recommend you give it a shot and come back after! :D</p>
<h2 id="slam-shuffle">Slam Shuffle</h2>
<p>If you haven’t already, take some time to <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/22">read through the problem statement</a>. The basic idea is that we are given a series of operations to “shuffle” a deck of 10007 cards, such as:</p>
<pre><code>deal with increment 7
deal into new stack
deal into new stack
... etc</code></pre>
<p>After performing all of the many operations, the question then asks about the card at a given position (the 2019th card in the deck).</p>
<p>Part 2, which you might not be able to see if you haven’t submitted an answer yet for Part 1, involves the same process with a deck of 119315717514047 cards, and repeating the entire shuffling sequence 101741582076661 times. It then asks you to find the card that ends up at index 2020.</p>
<p>In this problem, it seems we have a list of “shuffles” that we want to run on a deck of cards. However, let’s think about this in a more data-driven approach: instead of thinking about successive shufflings of cards, let’s imagine the specification of a “shuffle” itself as our main data, and how we can combine shuffle operations together into new shuffle operations.</p>
<p>We are looking for “take shuffle A and shuffle B, and return a new shuffle that represents doing B, then A”. This is “shuffle composition”, or “permutation composition” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation">permutation</a> being the mathematical word for “shuffling” here, basically)</p>
<p>Since we’ve identified that we want to begin implementing a way of composing/combining permutations together, we can do a bit of reading to learn that one of the most famous properties of permutation composition is that they form a “group”, which means they can be composed (associatively), have an identity, and can be inverted. This means that if you have two permutations, you can “squish” them to create a new permutation, and work with that <em>new</em> permutation.</p>
<p>I’ve talked about <a href="https://blog.jle.im/entry/alchemical-groups.html">using group theory</a> principles before in this blog to help guide us towards solutions and optimizations — the main principle is that if we express our program in terms of group operations, then we can take advantage of the large body of knowledge built up over centuries to understand, analyze, and potentially optimize our program.</p>
<p>The <em>first</em> big advantage in this situation is that we can treat our transformations <em>as data</em>, and not as functions. And that if we have two transformations, we can always create a new one (just a normal data type value) that represents the composition of the two original ones.</p>
<h2 id="now-youre-thinking-with-groups">Now You’re Thinking With Groups</h2>
<p>Knowing permutations are a group, it means that once we settle on our representation of them, <code>Perm</code>, we can write an instance of <code>Perm</code> for <code>Semigroup</code>, <code>Monoid</code>, and <code>Group</code>, abstractions in Haskell that many types are already instances of. Abstractions like <code>Semigroup</code> and <code>Monoid</code> are pretty much an everyday thing in Haskell, so this fits in quite nicely. <code>Group</code> comes from the <em><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/groups">groups</a></em> package, which also provides some nice applications of group theory.</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span>data</span> <span>Perm</span> n <span>=</span> <span>...</span> <span>-- let's figure out the implementation later, where n is the number of cards</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In Haskell, we express things like “<code>Perm</code> is a Semigroup/Monoid/Group” by saying that they are instances of <em>typeclasses</em>, which (for this purpose) are like interfaces in languages like Java.</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1"></a><span>-- | An instance m can be "combined" using `x &lt;&gt; y`</span></span>

<p>This means that if <code>Perm</code> is an instance of <code>Group</code> (which has superclasses <code>Semigroup</code> and <code>Monoid</code>), we can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compose permutations using <code>x &lt;&gt; y</code>, which means “shuffle with strategy <code>y</code>, then with strategy <code>x</code>”</li>
<li>Summon an “identity permutation” where <code>x &lt;&gt; mempty == x</code> (the identity permutation, which is “leave things alone”).</li>
<li>Invert any shuffling (if we have <code>x</code>, we can reverse its effect with <code>invert x</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the standard libraries also give us a useful function <code>stimes</code></p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a><span>stimes ::</span> <span>Semigroup</span> m <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> m <span>-&gt;</span> m</span></code></pre></div>
<p>which lets us compose <code>x</code> with itself (<code>stimes 5 x == x &lt;&gt; x &lt;&gt; x &lt;&gt; x &lt;&gt; x</code>), but can do it in <em>log(n)</em> time using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring">repeated squaring</a>. It’s extremely efficient in a lot of circumstances (more on that later) — more so than the naive compose-it-n-times implementation. This will definitely become useful in part 2, where we have to do 101741582076661 compositions.</p>
<h2 id="our-gameplan">Our Gameplan</h2>
<p>Just <em>knowing</em> that permutations form a group naturally guides us to these abstractions — we already know what <em>interface</em> our type will have, even before we write any code. We know that no matter <em>what</em> our implementation of permutation will be, we will have <code>(&lt;&gt;)</code>, <code>stimes</code>, <code>mempty</code>, <code>invert</code> available to us to use. So, let’s do just that! We’ll use a stub data type <code>Perm</code> to represent our permutation and “pretend” we have that interface on it. We’ll write our functions first and then fill in the interface later!</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1"></a><span>-- | Represents a permutation of n cards</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2"></a><span>data</span> <span>Perm</span> n <span>=</span> <span>....</span></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb5-4"><a href="#cb5-4"></a><span>-- | Given a permutation, find the place where a given index ends up.</span></span>
<span id="cb5-5"><a href="#cb5-5"></a><span>runPerm ::</span> <span>Perm</span> n <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Finite</span> n <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Finite</span> n</span>
<span id="cb5-6"><a href="#cb5-6"></a></span>
<span id="cb5-7"><a href="#cb5-7"></a><span>-- | Parse a string line into the permutation it represents</span></span>
<span id="cb5-8"><a href="#cb5-8"></a><span>parsePerm ::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Perm</span> n</span>
<span id="cb5-9"><a href="#cb5-9"></a></span>
<span id="cb5-10"><a href="#cb5-10"></a><span>-- | Given a permutation list, find the place where 2019 ends up</span></span>
<span id="cb5-11"><a href="#cb5-11"></a><span>part1 ::</span> [<span>Perm</span> <span>10007</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Finite</span> <span>10007</span></span>
<span id="cb5-12"><a href="#cb5-12"></a>part1 perms <span>=</span> runPerm bigPerm <span>2019</span></span>
<span id="cb5-13"><a href="#cb5-13"></a>  <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb5-14"><a href="#cb5-14"></a>    bigPerm <span>=</span> <span>mconcat</span> perms</span></code></pre></div>
<p>(<code>mconcat perms</code> composes all of the permutations one after another: <code>mconcat [x,y,z] = x &lt;&gt; y &lt;&gt; z</code>)</p>
<p>And…that’s it! For the actual “logic” of our part 1! All we need to do is implement <code>runPerm</code> and <code>parsePerm</code>.</p>
<p>Here, I’m using <code>Finite n</code> from the great <em><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/finite-typelits">finite-typelits</a></em> library, where <code>Finite 100</code> represents “an index between 0 and 99”, etc. It’s just exactly the right “shape” to represent the index of a deck of cards. <em>finite-typelits</em> wasn’t designed with group theory in mind, but it’s still a great tool here — which is a testament to how flexible these abstractions can actually be :)</p>
<p>For example, it means that for a <code>Perm 10007</code> (a permutation of 10007 cards), the type of <code>runPerm</code> is <code>Perm 10007 -&gt; Finite 10007 -&gt; Finite 10007</code>, and the type of <code>parsePerm</code> is <code>String -&gt; Perm 10007</code>.</p>
<p>We can plan out our part 2 as well:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1"></a><span>-- | Given a permutation list, find the index that will end up at 2020</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2"></a><span>part2 ::</span> [<span>Perm</span> <span>119315717514047</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Finite</span> <span>119315717514047</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3"><a href="#cb6-3"></a>part2 perms <span>=</span> runPerm (invert biiigPerm) <span>2020</span></span>
<span id="cb6-4"><a href="#cb6-4"></a>  <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb6-5"><a href="#cb6-5"></a>    bigPerm   <span>=</span> <span>mconcat</span> perms</span>
<span id="cb6-6"><a href="#cb6-6"></a>    biiigPerm <span>=</span> stimes <span>101741582076661</span> bigPerm</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Part 2, I think, is where the group theory really shines.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>We take advantage of <code>stimes</code>, which uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring">repeated squaring</a>. That means that to compute <code>stimes 8 x</code>, instead of using</p>
<pre><code>x &lt;&gt; x &lt;&gt; x &lt;&gt; x &lt;&gt; x &lt;&gt; x &lt;&gt; x &lt;&gt; x</code></pre>
<p>it does</p>
<pre><code>let x2 = x &lt;&gt; x
    x4 = x2 &lt;&gt; x2
in  x4 &lt;&gt; x4</code></pre>
<p>essentially cutting down the number of multiplications exponentially. This means that to compute <code>stimes 101741582076661</code>, we only need to do about 47 multiplications (log base 2), and not 101741582076661.</p>
<p>This is only possible because we know that permutation composition is associative, so it doesn’t matter how we associate our parentheses. It is only “safe” to use repeated squaring if you <em>know</em> that your operation is associative. Having a semigroup abstraction <em>in the first place</em> guides us to this efficient solution — in a way that is pre-built just for us! This is made all the more powerful because <em>semigroup</em> is a ubiquitous abstraction in Haskell, so we “think about” it all the time.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember how <code>runPerm p 2019</code> gives us the index that <code>2019</code> is sent to? Well, we want something else in this case. We basically want the index that <em>will be sent to</em> <code>2020</code>. So, we want to <em>reverse the function</em>. Luckily, since our function is just a permutation, it is easy to reverse this: just <code>invert</code> the permutation!</p>
<p>The idea that we can simply invert a permutation instead of having to write a whole new permutation representation just to do “backwards indexing” is something that we are <em>guided to</em>, just by recognizing that permutations form a group.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="a-first-guess-at-implementation">A first guess at implementation</h2>
<p>Now, time to do what we have been putting off and actually write our permutation representation – the definition of <code>Perm n</code>. A good <em>first guess</em> might be to write our permutation as an actual function — a function from index to index, <code>Finite n -&gt; Finite n</code>. Then, we can just use function composition as our permutation composition.</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1"></a><span>data</span> <span>Perm</span> n <span>=</span> <span>Perm</span> (<span>Finite</span> n <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Finit…</span></span></code></pre></div></div></div>

Engineers and designers use them in their daily work. Here’s a simple guide to these terms to clarify what they really mean.</p><h2>UI &amp; UX in simple words</h2><p>Imagine that your digital product — a website or an app — is a house. The code is the foundation and frame that shape it.</p><p>In a house, the walls, rooms, doors, and windows define the User Experience (UX). Once upon a time, someone left an opening in a wall so it would be brighter in the house and so they could see anyone approaching and enter the house. Later, someone decided it was better to walk through a door, and thus the door was designed.</p><p>Then someone’s wife decided to make the house more cozy and arranged its furnishings — the User Interface (UI). The UI determines the house’s appearance and convenience for its residents.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5f6ccb886b98300f8672abfa_5cf66e2c714334807254a77f_ux.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Photo credit: Charles Deluvio</figcaption></figure><h2>UX makes the interface user-friendly</h2><p>UX design is the process of identifying and solving problems to make an interface user-friendly.

<p>
<a href="https://samy.pl/webscan">webscan</a> is a browser-based network IP scanner and local IP detector. It detects IPs bound to the user/victim by listening on an RTP data channel via WebRTC and looping back to the port across any live IPs, as well as discovering all live IP addresses on valid subnets by monitoring for immediate timeouts (TCP RST packets returned) from <a target="_new" href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/">fetch()</a> calls or hidden <i>img</i> tags pointed to valid subnets/IPs. Works on mobile and desktop across all major browsers and OS's. Beta version is extensible to allow the addition of multiple techniques.
</p><p>
webscan takes advantage of the fact that non-responsive img tag sockets can be closed to prevent browser &amp; network-based rate limiting by altering the src attribute to a non-socket URI (removing from DOM ironically does not close the socket), or by using fetch()'s signal support of the <a target="_new" href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-abortcontroller">AbortController()</a> interface.

<pre id="content"></pre>



<p>webscan works like so</p>

<ol>
<li>webscan first iterates through a list of common gateway IP addresses</li>
<li>for each IP, use fetch() or img tag to make fake HTTP connection to http://common.gateway.ip:1337</li>
<li>if a TCP RST returns, the fetch() promise will be rejected or img tag onerror will trigger before a timeout, indicating a live IP</li>
<li>to prevent browser or network rate limiting, non-responsive fetch() sockets are closed via AbortController() signal while img-tags have the src redirected to non-socket URI, closing the socket</li>
<li>when live gateway detected, step 1-3 reran for every IP on the subnet (<i>e.g. 192.168.0.[1-255]</i>)</li>
<li>a WebRTC data channel is opened on the browser, opening a random port on the victim machine</li>
<li>for any IPs that are found alive on the subnet, a WebRTC data channel connection is made to that host</li>
<li>if the WebRTC data channel is successful, we know we just established a connection to our own local IP</li>
</ol>


<p>Tested on</p>
<ul>
  <li>Chrome 87.0.4280.47 (macOS)</li>
  <li>Edge 86.0.622.63 (Windows)</li>

<p>“BERT Ensemble – MBGA Optimization” is a new entrant to two leader-boards natural language understanding tasks on the the Allen AI Leader-boards. Without trying to sound clickbaity, I audibly gasped when I read its results.</p>



<div><p>It scored 97.6% on the ARC reasoning challenge (Easy set). The previous high score was 92.6%, i.e. it reduced by two thirds the error rate. The ARC-Easy set, despite the name, contains both the hard and easy questions from the ARC challenge task (the hard version on the other hand excludes the easy questions). In the words of Allen AI:</p><p>“The ARC dataset contains 7,787 genuine grade-school level, multiple-choice science questions, assembled to encourage research in advanced question-answering.”</p></div>



<p>In other words, it’s a standardized school science test. Here are some examples of the questions:</p>



<p id="a36d"><em>1.Which equipment will best separate a mixture of iron filings and black pepper? (1) magnet (2) filter paper (3) triplebeam balance (4) voltmeter</em></p>



<p id="9797"><em>2. Which form of energy is produced when a rubber band vibrates? (1) chemical (2) light (3) electrical (4) sound</em></p>



<p id="966a"><em>3. Because copper is a metal, it is (1) liquid at room temperature (2) nonreactive with other substances (3) a poor conductor of electricity (4) a good conductor of heat</em></p>



<p id="6d70"><em>4. Which process in an apple tree primarily results from cell division? (1) growth (2) photosynthesis (3) gas exchange (4) waste removal</em></p>



<p> While a jump of 5% might not seem enormous, what’s so important about this is that it has reduced by two thirds the number of mistakes of the previous model, suggesting a huge leap in power.</p>



<div><p>The second result is far, far more impressive still. The OpenBookQA task is:</p><p>“[A] new kind of question-answering dataset modeled after open book exams for assessing human understanding of a subject. It consists of 5,957 multiple-choice elementary-level science questions (4,957 train, 500 dev, 500 test), which probe the understanding of a small “book” of 1,326 core science facts and the application of these facts to novel situations. For training, the dataset includes a mapping from each question to the core science fact it was designed to probe. <strong>Answering OpenBookQA questions requires additional broad common knowledge, not contained in the book.</strong> The questions, by design, are answered incorrectly by both a retrieval-based algorithm and a word co-occurrence algorithm. Strong neural baselines achieve around 50% on OpenBookQA, leaving a large gap to the 92% accuracy of crowd-workers</p></div>



<p>[Bolding not in original]</p>



<p><strong>It scored 100% on the OpenBookQA task.</strong> The previous best was 87.2% and the benchmark for human level performance by crowd-sourced workers is 91.7%. This test is intended to be an ecologically valid test of the human ability to reason over existing facts and apply them in novel situations- combined with background knowledge and understanding of the world. This program did not merely meet human level it seemingly exceeded it by a lot.</p>



<p>As for the model itself, we know very little about it beyond that it is:</p>



<p>“[An] Ensemble of BERT models with multi-metric Bayesian and genetic-algorithm based optimization.” It is by one “V. Agarwal” who I suspect- but do not know- is Vidhan Agarwal of Carnegie Mellon University.</p>



<p>Assuming these scores aren’t a mistake (and we can’t rule that out) this represents progress that I, as someone who had been -admittedly amateurishly- watching these task scoreboards for years- hadn’t expected for several years. In the case of OpenBookQA, maybe even five to ten years.</p>



<p>You can check out the results here: <a href="https://leaderboard.allenai.org/">https://leaderboard.allenai.org/</a></p>



<p>I will email Agarwal about his achievement and ask him about his methodology and if there are any plans to apply his model to other tasks. Depending on what he says I might simply update this post, or if there’s anything really interesting make a new one.</p>

<p>Multi-agent interacting systems are prevalent in the world, from purely physical systems to complicated social dynamic systems. The interactions between entities / components can give rise to very complex behavior patterns at the level of both individuals and the multi-agent system as a whole. Since usually only the trajectories of individual entities are observed without any knowledge of the underlying interaction patterns, and there are usually multiple possible modalities for each agent with uncertainty, it is challenging to model their dynamics and forecast their future behaviors.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>In many real-world applications (e.g. autonomous vehicles, mobile robots), an effective understanding of the situation and accurate trajectory prediction of interactive agents play a significant role in downstream tasks, such as decision making and planning. We introduce a generic trajectory forecasting framework (named EvolveGraph) with explicit relational structure recognition and prediction via latent interaction graphs among multiple heterogeneous, interactive agents. Considering the uncertainty of future behaviors, the model is designed to provide multi-modal prediction hypotheses. Since the underlying interactions may evolve even with abrupt changes over time, and different modalities of evolution may lead to different outcomes, we address the necessity of dynamic relational reasoning and adaptively evolving the interaction graphs.</p>

<p>
<img src="https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/evolvegraph/figure2.png" width="80%">
<br>
<i>Figure 2. An illustration of a typical urban intersection scenario.</i>
</p>

<p>We use an urban intersection scenario with multiple interacting traffic participants as an illustrative example to elaborate on the major challenges of the multi-agent behavior prediction task.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>First, there may be heterogeneous agents that have distinct behavior patterns, thus using a homogeneous dynamics / behavior model may not be sufficient. For example, there are different constraints and traffic rules for vehicles and pedestrians. More specifically, vehicle trajectories are strictly constrained by road geometry and their own kinematic models; while pedestrian behaviors are much more flexible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Second, there may be various types of interaction patterns in a multi-agent system. For example, the inter-vehicle interaction, inter-pedestrian interaction, and vehicle-pedestrian interaction in the same scenario present very different patterns.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Third, the interaction patterns may evolve over time as the situation changes. For example, when a vehicle is going straight, it only needs to consider the behavior of the leading vehicle; however, when the vehicle plans to change lanes, the vehicles in the target lane are also necessary to be taken into account, which leads to a change in the interaction patterns.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last but not least, there may be uncertainties and multi-modalities in the future behaviors of each agent, which leads to various outcomes. For example, in an intersection, the vehicle may either go straight or take a turn.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In this work, we took a step forward to handle these challenges and provided a generic framework for trajectory prediction with dynamic relational reasoning for multi-agent systems. More specifically, we address the problem of</p>

<ul>
  <li>extracting the underlying interaction patterns with a latent graph structure, which is able to handle different types of agents in a unified way,</li>
  <li>capturing the dynamics of interaction graph evolution for dynamic relational reasoning,</li>
  <li>predicting future trajectories (state sequences) based on the historical observations and the latent interaction graph, and</li>
  <li>capturing the uncertainty and multi-modality of future system behaviors.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<img src="https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/evolvegraph/figure3.png" width="60%">
<br>
<i>Figure 3. An illustration of the observation graph and interaction graph.</i>
</p>

<p>The multi-agent interacting system is naturally represented by a graph, where agents are considered as nodes and their relations are considered as edges. We have two types of graphs for different purposes, which are introduced below:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Observation Graph</strong>: The observation graph aims to extract feature embeddings from raw observations, which consists of N agent nodes and one context node. Agent nodes are bidirectionally connected to each other, and the context node only has outgoing edges to each agent node. Each agent node has two types of attributes: self-attribute and social-attribute. The former only contains the node’s own state information, while the latter only contains other nodes’ state information.</li>
  <li><strong>Interaction Graph</strong>: We use different edge types to represent distinct interaction patterns. No edge between a pair of nodes means that the two nodes have no relation. The interaction graph represents interaction patterns with a distribution of edge types for each edge, which is built on top of the observation graph.</li>
</ul>

<p>

<br>
<i>Figure 4. A high-level graphical illustration of EvolveGraph.</i>
</p>

<h3 id="dynamic-interaction-graph-learning">Dynamic Interaction Graph Learning</h3>

<p>In many situations, the interaction patterns recognized from the past time steps are likely not static in the future. Moreover, many interaction systems have multi-modal properties in nature. Different modalities afterwards are likely to result in different interaction patterns and outcomes. Therefore, we designed a dynamic evolving process of the interaction patterns.</p>

<p>As illustrated in Figure 4, the encoding process is repeated every τ (re-encoding gap) time steps to obtain the latent interaction graph based on the latest observation graph. A recurrent unit (GRU) is utilized to maintain and propagate the history information, as well as to adjust the prior interaction graphs. More details can be found in <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020/hash/e4d8163c7a068b65a64c89bd745ec360-Abstract.html">our paper</a>.</p>

<h3 id="uncertainty-and-multi-modality">Uncertainty and Multi-Modality</h3>
<p>Here we emphasize the efforts to encourage diverse and multi-modal trajectory prediction and generation. In our framework, the uncertainty and multi-modality mainly come from three aspects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>First, in the decoding process, we output Gaussian mixture distributions indicating that there are several possible modalities at the next step. We only sample a single Gaussian component at each step based on the component weights which indicate the probability of each modality.</li>
  <li>Second, different sampled trajectories will lead to different interaction graph evolution. Evolution of interaction graphs contributes to the multi-modality of future behaviors, since different underlying relational structures enforce different regulations on the system behavior and lead to various outcomes.</li>
  <li>Third, directly training such a model, however, tends to collapse to a single mode. Therefore, we employ an effective mechanism to mitigate the mode collapse issue and encourage multi-modality. During training, we run the decoding process d times, which generates \(d\) trajectories for each agent under specific scenarios. We only choose the prediction hypothesis with the minimal loss for backpropagation, which is the most likely to be in the same mode as the ground truth. The other prediction hypotheses may have much higher loss, but it doesn’t necessarily imply that they are implausible. They may represent other potential reasonable modalities.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="experiments">Experiments</h2>
<p>We highlight the results of two case studies on a synthetic physics system and an urban driving scenario. More experimental details and case studies on pedestrians and sports players can be found in <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020/hash/e4d8163c7a068b65a64c89bd745ec360-Abstract.html">our paper</a>.</p>

<h3 id="case-study-1-particle-physics-system">Case Study 1: Particle Physics System</h3>

<p>We experimented with a simulated particle system with a change of relations. Multiple particles are initially linked and move together. The links disappear as long as a certain criterion on the particle state is satisfied and the particles move independently thereafter. The model is expected to learn the criterion by itself and perform both edge type prediction and trajectory prediction. Since the system is deterministic in nature, we do not consider multi-modality in this task.</p>

<p>We predicted the particle states at the future 50 time steps based on the observations of 20 time steps. We set two edge types in this task, which correspond to “with link” and “without link”. The results of edge type prediction are summarized in Table 1, which are averaged over 3 independent runs. “No Change” means the underlying interaction structure keeps the same in the whole horizon, while “Change” means the change of interaction patterns happens at some time. It shows that the supervised learning baseline, which directly trains the encoding functions with ground truth labels, performs the best in both setups and serves as a “gold standard”. Under the “No Change” setup, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04687">NRI (dynamic)</a> is comparable to EvolveGraph (RNN re-encoding), while EvolveGraph (static) achieves the best performance. The reason is that the dynamic evolution of the interaction graph leads to higher flexibility but may result in larger uncertainty, which affects edge prediction in the systems with static relational structures. Under the “Change” setup, NRI (dynamic) re-evaluates the latent graph at every time step during the testing phase, but it is hard to capture the dependency between consecutive graphs, and the encoding functions may not be flexible enough to capture the evolution. EvolveGraph (RNN re-encoding) performs better since it considers the dependency of consecutive steps during the training phase, but it still captures the evolution only at the feature level instead of the graph level. EvolveGraph (dynamic) achieves significantly higher accuracy than the other baselines (except Supervised), due to the explicit evolution of interaction graphs.</p>

        <div>
            <p>Securing containers is a complex task.  The problem space is broad, vendors are on fire, there are tons of checklists and best practices and it’s hard to prioritize solutions. So if you had to <strong>implement a container security strategy</strong> where would you start?</p>

<p>I suggest to start from the basics: understanding <strong>what container security is about</strong> and build a model to navigate risks.</p>

<h2 id="follow-the-devops-life-cycle">Follow the DevOps Life Cycle</h2>

<p>Every security initiative is eventually constrained by where security controls can be implemented, so I find practical to just follow the standard DevOps life cycle to <em>surface patterns™</em> and <em>unlock synergies™</em>.</p>

<p>The DevOps Lifecycle is an infinite iteration of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Plan</li>
<li>Code</li>
<li>Build</li>
<li>Test</li>
<li>Release</li>
<li>Deploy</li>
<li>Operate</li>
<li>Monitor</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://cloudberry.engineering/devops-lifecycle.jpg" alt="DevOps Lifecycle - source: ryadel.com"></p>

<p>Containers are included in the application in the form of a Dockerfiles but are not really part of it. As such they don’t interest the planning and coding phase.</p>

<p><em>(no, writing Dockerfiles is not coding.)</em></p>

<p>Every other step is in scope from a security point of view, and I would group them like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Build Time</strong>: build, test and release.</li>
<li><strong>Container Infrastructure</strong>: deploy and operate.</li>
<li><strong>Runtime</strong>: monitor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why? Every security strategy is only effective if it can be implemented. And every step in each group share a common facility where security controls can be injected without adding much friction:</p>

<ul>
<li>Build Time: The CI/CD infrastructure, the container registry</li>
<li>Container Infrastructure: the container orchestrator</li>
<li>Runtime: the production environment</li>
</ul>

<p>Now we have three macro areas we can use as a starting point to do our risk assessments.</p>

<h2 id="security-at-build-time">Security at Build Time</h2>

<p>At build time we have in input a bunch of source files and a Dockerfile, and we get as output a Docker image.</p>

<p>This is where most vendors tend to cluster while trying to sell you the narrative of the importance of scanning container images and calling it a day.  Container security scanning is important, yes, but it’s not enough.</p>


<div>
<p><strong>This stage goal</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>minimize the risk of supply chain attacks.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3 id="container-images-hygiene">Container Images Hygiene</h3>

<p>First, decide how your images should look like, with a focus on how software dependencies are introduced:</p>

<ul>
<li>what base images are developers allowed to use?</li>
<li>are software dependencies pinned? From where are they pulled?</li>
<li>are there any labels that are needed to simplify governance and compliance?</li>
<li>lint the Dockerfile</li>
<li>follow <a href="https://cloudberry.engineering/article/dockerfile-security-best-practices/">Docker security best practices</a> when writing Dockerfiles</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these checks are static and can be implemented for cheap as a step in the build pipelines.</p>

<h3 id="container-images-scanning">Container Images Scanning</h3>

<p>Then we can move into scanning the container image.</p>

<p><strong>Do not scan the image as a step in the build pipeline</strong>, instead setup continuous scanning in the container registry.</p>

<p>Why? Vulnerabilities are continuously discovered while your services are not necessarily continuously built. Secondly, builds are additive: every build will generate a new image. So, assuming  your container orchestrator trust your registry, every tag you publish can always be deployed and need to be assessed.</p>

<p><em>(It’s also very slow to scan at build time)</em></p>

<p>This is where you start thinking about defining <strong>patch management</strong> and <strong>shelf life</strong> processes:</p>

<ul>
<li>patch management: results from the scanning will feed a patching process that will result in a new version of the image</li>
<li>shelf life: unpatched/old/unsafe images are deleted from the registry</li>
</ul>

<p><em>(next article will be about how to choose a container scanning solution, if you are facing the dilemma right now feel free to <a href="mailto:hello@clouberry.engineering">ping me</a>)</em></p>

<h2 id="container-infrastructure-security">Container Infrastructure Security</h2>

<p>The container infrastructure is comprised of all the moving parts that are in charge of pulling your images from the registry and run them as containers in production.</p>

<p>It’s mostly going to be the container orchestrator – <em>*cough* kubernetes *cough*</em>.</p>


<div>
<p><strong>This stage goals</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid platform misconfigurations with security implications</li>
<li>Minimize the <strong>breadth</strong> of an attack from a compromised container</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3 id="security-of-the-infrastructure-misconfigurations">Security OF the Infrastructure: Misconfigurations</h3>

<p>Container orchestrators are complex, Kubernetes in particular. As of now they fail the promise of DevOps and I think we are still an abstraction layer (or two) away from being a mainstream solution without too much operational overhead.</p>

<p>Every complex platforms is prone to be misconfigured, and this is the part you want to focus on.</p>

<p>You have to threat model your infrastructure to <strong>ensure it can’t be abused</strong>.
This particular thread model should focus on every actor but a compromised container (we will cover that next).</p>

<p>I can’t go into details here, because it really depends on what you are running. For Kubernetes a good starting point for threat modelling is <a href="https://www.marcolancini.it/2020/blog-kubernetes-threat-modelling/">this</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you are not doing it yet, this is also a <strong>good argument in favour of using a managed platform</strong>: the complexity is reduced if you can leverage a shared responsibility model with your (trusted) provider.</p>

<h3 id="security-in-the-infrastructure-lateral-movements">Security IN the infrastructure: Lateral Movements</h3>

<p>Next we can talk about what happens when a container is compromised.</p>

<p>You want to minimize the <a href="https://cloudberry.engineering/article/lateral-movement-cloud/">attacker’s ability to move laterally</a>, focusing on these two layers:</p>

<ul>
<li>The network layer</li>
<li>The Identity and Access management (IAM) layer</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The network should not be flat</strong>. You can start by brutally segment everything into subnetworks and work your way up to a full fledge service meshes.</p>

<p>On the IAM layer work your way toward having a <strong>single identity for each container</strong> in order to fine tune the authorization grants. This is particularly important in multi tenant platforms: without granular identities it’s impossible to achieve least privilege.</p>

<p><em>(Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) has a nifty feature for this called <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity">Workload Identity</a>)</em></p>

<p>Finally, since they are supposed to be immutable, a wonderful strategy would be to <strong>reduce the amount of time containers can run</strong>: the window of opportunity for attackers to move laterally and gain persistence is as long as the container running lifetime. Continously shut down and spin up your containers.</p>

<p>And this final consideration allow me to smoothly move into the next area.</p>

<h2 id="runtime-security">Runtime Security</h2>

<p>The last piece of the puzzle is the security of your running workloads.
At this point most of the hardening is done and here is when we move into the realm of reactive security controls, the grim land of <strong>post-fail</strong>.</p>


<div>
<p><strong>This stage goal</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>is to minimize the <strong>impact</strong> of an attack from a compromised container.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3 id="detection-and-incident-response">Detection and Incident Response</h3>

<p>The best way to control the impact of an attack is to minimize the time between the breach to when the security team is alerted.</p>

<p>Detecting an ongoing breach is another area where vendors are scrambling to find a silver bullet. There are many approaches, most of them will require side cars and/or daemon sets actively monitoring pod’s traffic and system calls.</p>

<p>Most solutions will provide some value but my advice is to start simple and iterate: use your existing SIEM, ingest your platform, application and audit logs.</p>

<p><strong>Incidents will happen</strong>, and it’s fine: have an incident response process.</p>

<p>The first bullet point of every post-mortem should be: <em>“how can we detect this quicker next time?”</em> answering will allow you to identify your blind spots, which you can then use to understand what signals you are missing and what makes sense to buy.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Container security is a broad problem and it is not just about scanning images.</p>

<p>This is the model I built and used to reason about container risks and solutions. It’s very high level and of course, as with every model, <strong>it’s not necessarily the right one</strong>.</p>

<p>We all know that in reality each infrastructure is a snowflake: so start with your own threat model and use this one <strong>as an inspiration</strong>.</p>

Known as Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancements (STEVEs), these luminous light-purple sky ribbons may resemble regular auroras, but recent research reveals significant differences. A STEVE's great length and unusual colors, when measured precisely, indicate that it may be related to a subauroral ion drift (SAID), a supersonic river of hot atmospheric ions thought previously to be invisible.  Some STEVEs are now also thought to be accompanied by green picket fence structures, a series of sky slats that can appear outside of the main auroral oval that does not involve much glowing nitrogen. The featured wide-angle composite image shows a STEVE in a dark sky above Childs Lake, Manitoba, Canada in 2017, crossing in front of the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-5408" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork" itemscope="itemscope"> <div>  <div itemprop="text"> <p>As you build out forms for the web, getting the semantics, accessibility, and styling right is a lot of work. If you can get all those right, you’re doing quite well for yourself. However, there are still some thing we can do to make life better for the folks filling out our forms. </p> <p>In this article, we’ll look at some of the do’s and don’ts about HTML form user experience (UX). And if you are looking for a refresher on the previous steps mentioned above, take a look at the other articles in this series.</p> <ul><li><a href="https://austingil.com/how-to-build-html-forms-right-semantics/">Part 1: Semantics</a></li><li><a href="https://austingil.com/how-to-build-html-forms-right-accessibility/">Part 2: Accessibility</a></li><li><a href="https://austingil.com/build-html-forms-right-styling/">Part 3: Styling</a></li><li><strong>Part 4: User Experience</strong></li><li>Part 5: Security</li></ul> <h2>Content</h2> <h3>Request the least amount of information</h3> <p>As a user of the internet, I can speak from experience when I say that entering more data than necessary into a form is annoying. So if you really only need an email, consider not asking for first name, last name, and phone number. By creating forms with fewer inputs, you will improve the user experience. Some studies have even shown that smaller forms have higher conversion rates. That’s a win for you. Plus, reducing the data you collect has a chance of reducing your privacy concerns, although this depends greatly on the data.</p> <h3>Keep it simple</h3> <p>It can be tempting to bring your creativity into form design. However, it’s easy to go overboard and make things confusing. By sticking to simple designs that use standard input types, you are creating a more cohesive experience, not only across your site, but across the internet. This means users are less likely to get confused by some fancy and novel input. Stick to the classics. And remember that selection inputs like checkboxes (allows multiple selected items) generally use boxed inputs, and radios (allows only a single selection) use circles.</p> <h3>Semantics are good for a11y and UX</h3> <p>I covered semantics in much more detail in <a href="https://austingil.com/how-to-build-html-forms-right-semantics/">a previous article</a>, but the short version is that choosing the right input types improves the experience on many levels: semantics, accessibility, and user experience. Folks are used to the way inputs work across the web, so we can take advantage of that by using the same inputs for the same things. Not to mention that by using the right inputs, we get a lot of things for free like keyboard navigation support and validation.</p> <h3>Put country selector before city/state</h3> <p>This is a simple rule for anyone adding locales to their forms. If you are going to ask for a user’s country, put that before the city &amp; state fields. The reason is, usually the city and state will be populated based on the country. So if your country selection defaults to the United States, and the user lives in Oaxaca, Mexico, they will need to skip past the city &amp; state fields, select the country of Mexico, then go back and fill in their city and state once the list is updated. By putting the country first, you maintain the flow of the form, which is especially nice for users that use the keyboard to navigate.</p> <h3>Paginate long forms</h3> <p>This relates to my first point in that ideally you don’t have too much data. However, in some cases it cannot be helped. In those cases, it might make sense to paginate a form so that the information is not overwhelming. If you choose to paginate the form, my best advice is to show the user some sort of UI about their progress in the form, and the option to remove the pagination and show the form in it’s entirety.</p> <h2>General Functionality</h2> <h3>Prevent browser refresh/navigation</h3> <p>Have you ever been filling out a long form and accidentally refreshed the page, losing all your work? It’s the worst. Fortunately, the browser provides us with the <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/beforeunload_event" rel="noopener">beforeunload</a></code> event that we can use to inform the user they are about to lose any unsaved work.</p> <p>We can setup a variable to track whether the form has any unsaved changes, and we can attach a handler to the <code>beforeunload</code> event which will prevent the browser navigation if any changes have been made.</p> <pre><code>// You'll need some variable for tracking the status. We'll call it hasChanges here.

window.addEventListener("beforeunload", (event) {
  if (!hasChanges) return;

  event.preventDefault();
  event.returnValue = "";
})

form.addEventListener('change', () =&gt; {
  hasChanges = true;
});

form.addEventListener('submit', () =&gt; {
  hasChanges = false;
})</code></pre> <p>The gist of this snippet is that we are tracking some variable called <code>hasChanges</code>. If <code>hasChanges</code> is <code>false</code> when the <code>beforeunload</code> event fires, we can allow the browser to navigate away just fine. If <code>hasChanges</code> is <code>true</code>, the browser will prompt the user letting them know they have unsaved changes and ask if they want to continue away or stay on the page. Lastly, we add appropriate event handlers to the form to update the <code>hasChanges</code> variable.</p> <p>Your implementation may look slightly different for the <code>hasChanges</code> variable. For example, if you are using a JavaScript framework with some state management. And if you are creating a single page application, then this solution will not be quite enough because the <code>beforeunload</code> event does not fire on single page app navigation. For more details on that, please check out my article “<a href="https://austingil.com/prevent-browser-refresh-url-changes-route-navigation-vue/">How to prevent browser refresh, URL changes, or route navigation in Vue</a>“.</p> <h3>Store unsaved changes</h3> <p>Along the same lines as the previous point, there are times when we accidentally lose all our work on a long form. Fortunately, we can avoid causing this grief to our users by taking advantage of browser features like <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage" rel="noopener">sessionStorage</a></code>. Let’s say, for example, that we wanted to store all the data in a form any time a change event occurs. We can use <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData" rel="noopener">FormData</a></code> to capture the form and all it’s current values, then store the data as a <code>JSON</code> string in <code>sessionStorage</code>.</p> <pre><code>const form = document.querySelector('form')

form.addEventListener('change', event =&gt; {
  const formData = new FormData(form);
  sessionStorage.setItem('your-identifier', JSON.stringify(formData));
});</code></pre> <p>With the data saved, the user can refresh all they want and the data is not lost. The next step is to check <code>localStorage</code> on page load to see if we have any previously saved data to pre-fill the form with. If we do, we can parse the string into an object, then loop over each key/value pair and add that saved data to it’s respective input. It’s slightly different for different input types.</p> <pre><code>const previouslySavedData = sessionStorage.getItem('form-data');

if (previouslySavedData) {
  const inputValues = JSON.parse(savedData);

  for(const [name, value] of Object.entries(inputValues)) {
    const input = form.querySelector(`input[name=${name}]`);
    switch(input.type) {
      case 'checkbox':
        input.checked = !!value;
        break;
      // other input type logic
      default:
        input.value = value;
    }
  }
}</code></pre> <p>The last thing to do is to make sure that once the form is submitted, we clean up any previously saved data. This is also part of the reason we used <code>sessionStorage</code> instead of <code>localStorage</code>. We want our saved data to be somewhat impermanent.</p> <pre><code>form.addEventListener('submit', () =&gt; {
  sessionStorage.removeItem('form-data');
});</code></pre> <p>The last thing to say about this feature is that it’s not right for all data. Any private or sensitive data should be left out of any <code>localStorage</code> persistence. And some input types just plain won’t work. For example, there would be no way to persist a file input. With those caveats understood, however, it can be a great feature to add to almost any form. Especially any longer forms.</p> <h3>Do not prevent copy/paste</h3> <p>One of the most annoying things I’ve experienced recently was on the IRS website. They asked me for my bank account number and bank routing number. These are not short numbers, we’re talking like 15 characters. On most websites, it’s no problem, I copy the numbers from my bank’s website and paste it into the input field. On the IRS website, however, they chose to disable pasting into the inputs which meant I had to manually fill in the details for each number…twice. I have no idea why they did this, but it’s very frustrating for users, and actually increases the likelihood of errors. Please don’t do this.</p> <h2>Input Functionality</h2> <h3>inputmode</h3> <p>If you have not heard about <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/inputmode" rel="noopener">inputmode</a></code> before, then let me turn you on to it now. <code>inputmode</code> is an HTML input attribute that let’s you tell the browser the input format. This may not be immediately clear, and if you are on your desktop computer then you won’t notice it, but for mobile users it makes a huge difference. By selecting different input modes, the browser will present the user with a different virtual keyboard to input their data. </p> <p>You can greatly improve the user experience of filling out a form for mobile users by simply adding a different input mode. For example, if you are asking for numeric data like a credit card number, you can set the <code>inputmode</code> to <code>numeric</code>. That makes it easier for the user to add numbers. The same for emails, <code>inputmode=email</code>. </p> <p>Available values for <code>inputmode</code> are <code>none</code>, <code>text</code>, <code>tel</code>, <code>url</code>, <code>email</code>, <code>numeric</code>, <code>decimal</code>, and <code>search</code>. For more examples, check out <a href="https://inputmodes.com/" rel="noopener">inputmodes.com</a> (ideally on a mobile device).</p> <h3>autocomplete</h3> <p>Along with <code>inputmode</code>, the <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete" rel="noopener">autocomplete</a></code> attribute is a built in feature that can greatly improve the user experience of your forms. Many, many website use forms to request the same information from users: email, address, phone, credit cards, etc. And a very nice feature that is built into the browsers is the ability for users to save their own information so that it can be auto-completed across different forms and sites. <code>autocomplete</code> lets us tap into this.</p> <p>The autocomplete attribute is valid on any text or numeric input as well as <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> elements. There are way to many available values to use for me to list here, but some that stand out are <code>current-password</code>, <code>one-time-code</code>, <code>street-address</code>, <code>cc-number</code> (and various other credit card options), and <code>tel</code>. </p> <p>Providing these options can make a nicer experience for many users, and don’t worry about this being a security concern because the information only exists on the users machine, and they have to allow their browser to implement it.</p> </div></div></article></div>

<p>At Mono, we’ve used Bootstrap for quite a while. I think the first time I used Bootstrap myself it was at version&nbsp;2.</p>



<p>While we like the freedom of being able to create a custom design and implementing it from scratch, there are undeniably many situations where a battle-tested framework can save you time. It allows you to not reinvent the&nbsp;wheel.</p>



<p>One of the situations where Bootstrap shines is when you are doing the design for a backoffice type of application, where a custom visual design is not the highest&nbsp;priority.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="599" src="https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/spark2-1024x599.png" alt="" srcset="https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/spark2-1024x599.png 1024w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/spark2-300x176.png 300w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/spark2-768x450.png 768w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/spark2-1536x899.png 1536w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/spark2-2048x1199.png 2048w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/spark2-500x293.png 500w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/spark2-3840x2248.png 3840w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/spark2-2560x1499.png 2560w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/spark2-2160x1264.png 2160w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/spark2-1920x1124.png 1920w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/spark2-1650x966.png 1650w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/spark2-1280x749.png 1280w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/spark2.png 4100w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Example of a backoffice design we created that was implemented using Bootstrap. To be fair, it has its own design customizations, but there is also a lot of Bootstrap code under the hood.</figcaption></figure>



<h3>Release status</h3>



<p>Bootstrap 5 is currently in its 3rd alpha release. The plan seems to be to release Bootstrap 5 to the public as a final version near the end of the year. In one of our recent projects we already went ahead with using it, anticipating that the underlying logic wouldn’t change that much from now until the&nbsp;release.</p>



<p>So let’s talk about some of the most important changes in Bootstrap&nbsp;5.</p>



<h3>What’s changed?</h3>



<h4>A more approachable migration</h4>



<p>First of all, not really a feature but more of a logic change: the<strong> migration from v4 to v5 is much more approachable</strong> than before (from v3 to&nbsp;v4).</p>



<p>For those thinking about switching from Bootstrap 4 to 5, the good news is that in terms of CSS and default components, not much has changed. The classes and logic are quite similar from 4 to&nbsp;5.</p>



<p>The Bootstrap team seems to have settled on a “stable API” i.e. to not change class names too much from one release to the&nbsp;other.</p>



<p>This is great news for many applications that want to make the move and were <em>not</em> looking forward to the kind of class-change move that a Bootstrap v3 to v4 migration made you&nbsp;do.</p>



<h4>No jQuery</h4>



<p>Next, there is the <strong>removal of jQuery as a&nbsp;dependency.</strong></p>



<p>The JS logic for JS plugins like toggles and modals is now written in vanilla JS. There is still the possibility to use jQuery if you really want to (see <a href="https://v5.getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/javascript/#still-want-to-use-jquery-its-possible">this docs&nbsp;entry</a>).</p>



<p>The JS files are even available as ESM modules, which allows you to use Bootstrap directly as a module in your browser, if your browser supports it. However, the plugins that depend on <a href="https://popper.js.org/">Popper</a> do not yet work this&nbsp;way.</p>



<p>This move removes a dependency, and it modernizes Bootstrap. jQuery is a thing from the past, it was a real big help, but it has served its purpose. jQuery doesn’t belong in a development project launched in&nbsp;2020.</p>



<p>However, I wonder if I will actually encounter this code in practice, as the logic for handling modals, popups etc. is probably contained in the Javascript framework used in the project. Many Javascript frameworks have a re-implementation of Bootstrap specific for that framework (like <a href="https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/" &nbsp;title="https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/">ng-bootstrap</a>).</p>



<p>I believe the source files will mostly be used as a reference for the intended functionality. I don’t there are that many development situations where you would use them&nbsp;directly.</p>



<h4>CSS custom properties for quick customizations</h4>



<p>Internet Explorer support has been dropped, paving the way to use newer CSS features like <strong>CSS custom&nbsp;properties</strong>.</p>



<p>In practice, this allows you to customize Bootstrap without a compilation step. If an aspect of the design uses CSS custom properties, you can simply drop in code to override it, without going through the dance of setting up a Sass-based workflow where you override the framework&nbsp;variables.</p>



<p>For&nbsp;example:</p>



<pre><code lang="css">.table {
  --bs-table-bg: #FFF;
  --bs-table-striped-bg: #EFF1F7;
}</code></pre>



<p>I imagine this can be useful when you quickly want to tweak some colors. The way it works is demonstrated in this Svelte <a href="https://svelte.dev/repl/0a9a77c7809b4c2eb679d1b4944b1fdf?version=3.29.4">REPL</a> where a table is customized to have some other&nbsp;colors.</p>



<h4>Bootstrap icons</h4>



<p>Bootstrap now comes with its own icon set. You can view this set <a href="https://icons.getbootstrap.com/">here</a>. I am not sure if I am a fan of the style, but it’s good that there is a focus on this area. No UI framework is complete without a way to handle&nbsp;icons.</p>



<p>We’re likely to use our own <a href="https://icons.mono.company/">Mono Icons</a> as a default choice in our projects; in the recent project we customized Bootstrap 5 to work together with our icon&nbsp;set.</p>



<h4>New/revised components: accordion, file input etc.</h4>



<p>In Alpha 3, the Bootstrap team added a new <a href="https://v5.getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/accordion/">Accordion</a> component.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="599" src="https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acc-1024x599.png" alt="" srcset="https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acc-1024x599.png 1024w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acc-300x176.png 300w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acc-768x450.png 768w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acc-1536x899.png 1536w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acc-2048x1199.png 2048w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acc-500x293.png 500w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acc-3840x2248.png 3840w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acc-2560x1499.png 2560w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acc-2160x1264.png 2160w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acc-1920x1124.png 1920w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acc-1650x966.png 1650w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acc-1280x749.png 1280w, https://mono.company/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/acc.png 4100w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Inspecting the code, it uses an SVG as a <code>data-image</code>, directly in the&nbsp;CSS.</p>



<p>If we were to use Mono icons, this creates a design problem where there are 2 different icon styles in the&nbsp;project.</p>



<p>I can already see the work we’re going have to create a customized version of this component. And that is exactly the problem that you have with Bootstrap sometimes: if you don’t use it as-is, you are sometimes setting yourself up for&nbsp;trouble.</p>



<p>Luckily, you can simply create a custom stylesheet where you don’t include certain elements. For example, we have never used the “<a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/jumbotron/">Jumbotron</a>” component in Bootstrap 4. We’ll be checking whether this component is useful or whether we will need to provide our own&nbsp;version.</p>



<h4>New utilities + new utility API</h4>



<p>I have a love-hate relationship with utility based CSS. I love it for quick prototyping, but I hate it when a high unelegant set of divs and classes lands in production and becomes maintenance&nbsp;hell.</p>



<p>In the Alpha 3 blog post, the Bootstrap talks about new utility classes and even a <a href="https://v5.getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/api/">whole API</a> to generate utility classes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is obviously Tailwind-inspired, and those who have been following me on Twitter or have been reading my personal blog know that I, ahem, am not a big&nbsp;fan.</p>



<p>In general, I am also not a big fan of making CSS too complex by using too many Sass features to generate code. I think it increases complexity. A design rarely needs 5 opacity classes like explained in the first example on the utilities API&nbsp;page.</p>



<pre><code lang="html">$utilities: (
  "opacity": (
    property: opacity,
    values: (
      0: 0,
      25: .25,
      50: .5,
      75: .75,
      100: 1,
    )
  )
 );</code></pre>



<p>This is probably a blog post in itself when I get to work with this code.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Conclusion</h3>



<p>This blog post talks about the most important changes in Bootstrap 5 (in my humble opinion). If you want to dive into the exact details, you can reference these&nbsp;posts:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2020/11/11/bootstrap-5-alpha-3/">Alpha 3 release post</a> (Nov 11)</li><li><a href="https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2020/09/29/bootstrap-5-alpha-2/">Alpha 2 release post</a> (Sep 29)</li><li><a href="https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2020/06/16/bootstrap-5-alpha/">Alpha 1 release post</a> (June 16)</li></ul>



<p>Bootstrap 5 is a modernized version of Bootstrap 4. The API surface is similar, making it easier to migrate to the newest&nbsp;version.</p>



<p>For us, Bootstrap remains a solid choice as a technical base for web applications, especially for projects with limited&nbsp;resources.</p>



<p>We typically extend Bootstrap with some customizations to make it to our liking. We find that there is a lot of value in using a known framework that is actively being&nbsp;maintained.</p>



<p>When we can start design work from a base that contains common design patterns, we can then spend our time on figuring out the exact needs of the design project at hand instead of constantly reinventing the&nbsp;wheel.</p>



<p>We’re looking forward to using Bootstrap 5 in practice in more&nbsp;projects.</p>

And the outcomes are often delusion, sadness and stress.</p><hr><h2>Cut your losses</h2><p>You might get <em>emotionally</em> attached to your projects.</p><p>Your idea "is awesome!", yet your <strong>expectations</strong> are not met by others.</p><p>You can't possibly understand why your project doesn't do as well as you have <strong>hoped</strong>.</p><p>You spent the last month <em>contacting potential clients, shipped v1/v2/v3/Beta1 and Beta2, optimized your landing page to maximize conversions</em>.</p><p>Yet nobody gives <em>a flying fuck</em> about your project, although your research and feedback received.</p><p><strong>This is when you should cut your losses.</strong></p><h2>Move on</h2><p>It's perfectly normal to feel stressed/disappointed when you need to cut your losses and move on.</p><p><strong>But you need to realize it.</strong></p><p>If you don't realize it, or realize it too late, <em>you get burned</em>.</p><p><strong>You get burned by your own emotional decisions, which should have been rational all along.</strong></p><p><strong>It's business decision making after all.</strong></p><blockquote><p>It's not kindergarten where you just cry out loud and a nanny comes to cheer you up and console you.</p></blockquote><p><em>Just move on.</em></p><p>It seemed a good idea in theory, but people have better things to do than to <em>feel pity over your failure</em>.</p><p><strong>And you do too.</strong></p><h2>Learn from your mistakes</h2><p>You have nothing left to do than to learn from what you did <strong>wrong</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>Write it down.</p><p>Visualize the process you followed.</p><p>Maybe it wasn't that good after all.</p></blockquote><p>Did you first of all understood that there was a real <em>value</em> for your potential customers, or you just thought <em>people would donate you money</em> because you spent months on your pretty project?</p><p>As you might have noticed, <strong>You</strong> is mentioned quite a few times in this post.</p><p><em>This should make you reflect.</em></p><p>It's not about you, but about <strong>market, niches, interests, potential clients, value proposition, communication, marketing, connections, content.</strong></p></div></div>]]>

Chang’e-5 consists of an ambitious four spacecraft fleet—a propulsion module to bring the vehicles into lunar orbit, a lander to collect samples, an ascent vehicle to carry the samples into orbit, and a return module that will receive the samples via orbital rendezvous and bring them to Earth. The lander is targeting the Mons Rümker formation on the near side of the Moon to collect relatively young (~1.21 billion years old) volcanic samples during one lunar daytime (14 Earth days—it can’t stay longer since it doesn’t have radioisotope heater units like Chang’e-4). To bleed off speed, <a href="https://spacenews.com/china-is-quietly-preparing-for-november-launch-of-the-change-5-lunar-sample-return-mission/" target="_blank">the return vehicle will use a ‘skip reentry’</a> in which it bounces off the upper atmosphere once, as tested in the 2014 Chang’e-5-T1 test mission. It’s sibling, Chang’e-6, was built at the same time and will either serve as a backup if Chang’e-5 fails, or be repurposed for a south pole landing in a couple of years.

Eg: headphones, headsets, earbuds, etc.</li><li><strong>Host</strong>: Refers to a machine capable of connecting to a peripheral. Eg: phones, tablets, laptops, etc.</li></ol><p><img src="https://elvischidera.com/ab54ddefd78ccee213ba59f61935f8d2/hosts_and_periherals.svg" alt="Hosts &amp; Peripherals"></p><h2>Overview</h2><p><strong>PCAS (Peripheral Connection Augmentation System)</strong> artificially augments a Bluetooth peripheral maximum number of concurrent connections. Based on user-initiated events and hardware configurations PCAS automatically connects/disconnects a profile on a peripheral. PCAS can also multiplex to a single sink: For example, on Android, this brings the theoretical maximum audio connections to 30 (<a href="https://groups.google.com/g/android-platform/c/_tmA8DRg8q4">the maximum allowed AudioTrack instances</a>).</p><p>A single user with multiple hosts no longer has to manually connect/disconnect each peripheral. PCAS does this automatically. This works even on cheap peripherals that don't support multiple concurrent connections natively. Example scenarios:</p><ol><li>When a call comes in on your phone while watching a movie on your tablet. The movie is automatically paused and your phone is connected.</li><li>When playing music from multiple devices, the output could be muxed to the same audio sink in realtime.</li><li>Putting your laptop to sleep while powering on your desktop will connect your keyboard/mouse to your desktop.</li></ol><p>...</p><p><img src="https://elvischidera.com/87eedac11aaec69de64cf478122ec310/multiplatform_modules.svg" alt="Multiplatform modules"></p><h3>Building</h3><ol><li><code>pcas-libs</code>: This is a KMP Gradle project.

A resilient multicast protocol is built on top of the transport layer. There are three types of messages:</p><ol><li><strong>Genesis</strong>: The first message a host sends, requesting other hosts to send their current blocks.</li><li><strong>Update</strong>: This is sent each time the blocks on a host changes.</li><li><strong>Heartbeat</strong>: This is periodically sent. After multiple missed heartbeats, a host is deemed dead by its peers and all its block could be independently deleted on each ledger.</li></ol><p>Each host maintains its local ledger. The network protocol guarantees that eventually, all ledgers will be consistent.</p><h5>Multicast Reliability</h5><p>Currently, only <strong>Update</strong> messages are classified as essential.</p><p><strong>Heartbeat</strong> messages are used as a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acknowledgement_(data_networks)">NACK</a>. A host detects synchronization issues from heartbeats and resends its current blocks.</p><p>While heartbeats are effective, the interval is too long to be relied on primarily for a highly interactive system like PCAS.</p><p>Reliable multicasting is an interesting problem. I explored two strategies:</p><h6>a. Using redundancy</h6><p>Blindly resend essential messages <code>x</code> times with a delay of <code>y + random jitter</code> on each attempt.</p><p>Let's consider a simple model. If the probability of successfully delivering a message is fixed at 0.50. Assuming each attempt is independent, there is a 0.97 probability that at least one message gets delivered in 5 attempts.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Napkin math</strong></p><p>Let b = 1 on success; 0 on failure</p><p>Pr(b = 1) = 0.50</p><p>Pr(b = 0) = 1 - Pr(b = 1) = 0.50</p><p>(b is a Bernoulli random variable)</p><hr><p>n = 5</p><p>z = n tries of b</p><p>(z is a Binomial random variable)</p><p><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi><mi>r</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>≤</mo><mi>z</mi><mo>≤</mo><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="true"><munderover><mo>∑</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi>n</mi></munderover><mrow><mo fence="true">(</mo><mstyle displaystyle="false" scriptlevel="0"><mfrac linethickness="0px"><mi>n</mi><mi>i</mi></mfrac></mstyle><mo fence="true">)</mo></mrow><mi>P</mi><mi>r</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><msup><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mi>i</mi></msup><mi>P</mi><mi>r</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn><msup><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>−</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></msup></mstyle></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">Pr(1 \leq z \leq n) = \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n \tbinom{n}{i} Pr(b = 1)^i Pr(b = 0)^{n - i}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></p><p>Could also be calculated as 1 - Pr(z = 0)</p></blockquote><p>In practice, delivery probabilities aren't fixed and attempts are not independent. Despite the shortcoming of this strategy, it has the following benefits:</p><ol><li>It isn't dependent on the size of the network. Whether there are 2 or 10,000 peers, a host will only send its messages at a rate of <code>c / second</code>.</li><li>Peers that are just entering the network could benefit from these redundant messages.</li></ol><h6>b. Using ACKs</h6><p>Essential messages have a monotonically increasing sequence number. The initial sequence number is <code>0</code>. All hosts are expected to send an <code>Ack</code> message with the sequence number of the essential message. Retries are done with a truncated exponential backoff with jitter.</p><p>This strategy only sends fewer messages (more efficient) than the redundant strategy when the number of peers in a network is less than <code>x</code>. Some issues with this strategy:</p><ol><li>Using <code>ACKs</code> like TCP isn't scalable and runs the risk of <a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse561/01sp/lectures/568.multicast2.pdf">ACKs implosion</a>.</li><li>The number of messages sent is dependent on the size of the network. A single rogue peer can cause the network to be spammed with ACKs and messages.</li><li>Figuring out which peer to expect ACKs from is complex.</li></ol><p>I initially went with ACKs but will be using the simple redundant strategy instead.</p><p>The network protocol data unit is a <code>Message</code>. Messages are marshaled to the <code>Protobuf</code> format and passed to the transport layer. The inverse happens when a message is received.</p><h3>Resource Allocation</h3><p>When two or more hosts use the same <code>3-tuple(service, profile, peripheral)</code>, a contention occurs. …</p></section></div>

<p><img src="https://makefastworkshop.com/hacks/pages/20160928/800wide.jpg" alt="" title="Data-Backed Methods for Weather Prediction of rain, storms, and sun."></p>
<p>We all like to think we're pretty good at <a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/the-battle-between-intuition-and-deliberation">building intuition</a> about the world around us. After all, that's something we as humans do best; we're great learners by nature.</p>
<p>But it's also healthy to challenge our assumptions from time to time. Let's not forget, for example, that humans used to think the Earth was both flat and the center of the universe. With a little data and an openness to new ideas, our forebears eventually saw beyond the most convenient way to consider the cosmos and accepted a different reality.</p>
<h3>Mining Data For Useful Generalizations</h3>
<p>Today, we have access to massive amounts of data to help us challenge our assumptions and keep each other honest. It's not just about Googling facts when an argument comes up at dinner; we can also use data to refine the day-to-day generalizations that help us make sense of the world and dictate how we spend our time.</p>
<p>We've realized that we make a lot of daily assumptions about the weather in particular. Sometimes those assumptions are informed (like checking a weather app when you wake up to decide what to wear or leveraging knowledge from the <a href="http://www.almanac.com/">Farmer's Almanac</a> for gardening), but more often, our assumptions are based on either folklore (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day">Groundhog Day</a>) or what data scientists call heuristics: broader first-hand observations and patterns we recognize over time.</p>
<p>There are plenty of <a href="http://www.jdnews.com/article/20140212/News/302129909">old wives' tales</a> about how to predict the weather via local observation (like <a href="http://farmersalmanac.com/weather/2009/06/08/can-leaves-predict-a-storm/">leaves turning over</a> before it rains or <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=curly+hair+humidity+meme&amp;tbm=isch">hairs curling up</a> when it's humid), but we can go beyond that to crunch some actual numbers, since there is detailed weather information stretching back decades for much of the world (from sources like the <a href="https://darksky.net/dev/">Dark Sky API</a>). How can we leverage those numbers to act on what we think we already know?</p>
<h2>Hack #1 - Clouds Before Rain</h2>
<p><img src="https://makefastworkshop.com/hacks/pages/20160928/CloudsBeforeRain.jpg" alt="" title="Clouds rolling in before a rain storm."></p>
<p>We can safely assume that it's cloudy while it rains. So first things first, let's double-check what we <em>think</em> we know and see what the data show us.</p>
<p><img src="https://makefastworkshop.com/hacks/pages/20160928/CloudCoverCC.png" alt="" title="Cross Correlation between cloud cover and precipitation intensity with time shifts +/-24 hours."></p>
<p>The graph above shows data from 10 cities across the US with varying climates, elevations, and geographic influences. With 5 years of data recorded hourly and 4x interpolation, that gives us over <strong>1.75 Million data points</strong> to work with (each of which contains 12-15 sensor values). Specifically, the graph shows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation">cross correlation</a> between cloud cover and precipitation intensity as time is shifted +/-24 hours.</p>
<p>Clearly there's a peak in the center, meaning that it is in fact cloudiest when it's raining. Success!</p>
<p>But clouds come and go all the time, so the more interesting insight is how quickly the clouds roll in before it rains. Let's consolidate all the information down to the average for all locations and look at the weighted cloud cover before it rains.</p>
<p><img src="https://makefastworkshop.com/hacks/pages/20160928/CloudCoverBeforeAvg.png" alt="" title="Cloud cover before and after it rains weighted by precipitation intensity +/-24 hours."></p>
<p>Now we're getting somewhere. Not only does it get cloudy when it rains, but the rate at which it gets cloudy (cloud acceleration) increases as the storm approaches. This is especially true in the 4-6 hours before rainfall.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip: When the cloud cover seems to accelerate, expect rain within 4-6 hours.</strong></p>
<h2>Hack #2 - Wind Before Rain</h2>
<p><img src="https://makefastworkshop.com/hacks/pages/20160928/WindBeforeRain.jpg" alt="" title="Ready for rain in the morning wind."></p>
<p>We can also look at wind speed before a storm, like we did with cloud cover. Since the magnitude and direction of wind is highly variable between storm fronts and geographic locations, we expect the data to be a bit more bumpy and scattered.</p>
<p><img src="https://makefastworkshop.com/hacks/pages/20160928/WindSpeedBefore.png" alt="" title="Wind speed before and after it rains weighted by precipitation intensity +/-24 hours."></p>
<p>If you squint, you can see that while each location has its own characteristics, there are some significant similarities in the overall shapes. Specifically, notice the small spike in wind speed shortly before it rains (at time = 0 on the x axis).</p>
<p><img src="https://makefastworkshop.com/hacks/pages/20160928/WindSpeedBeforeAvg.png" alt="" title="Average wind speed before and after it rains weighted by precipitation intensity +/-24 hours."></p>
<p>By averaging all of the locations, the emergent shape becomes much clearer. The mean wind speed picks up in the 4-8 hours ahead of a storm front, then quickly falls back down in the hour before it actually starts to precipitate.</p>
<p>We can also look at wind bearing (direction the wind is blowing) before and after it rains.</p>
<p><img src="https://makefastworkshop.com/hacks/pages/20160928/WindBearingBefore.png" alt="" title="Wind direction before and after it rains weighted by precipitation intensity +/-24 hours."></p>
<p>The direction the wind blows depends heavily on location, but in the US most wind blows west to east (180 degrees on this graph). Since all locations' dominant wind direction falls within +/-90 degrees of each other, we can average them to look for trends without introducing significant artifacts.</p>
<p><img src="https://makefastworkshop.com/hacks/pages/20160928/WindBearingBeforeAvg.png" alt="" title="Average wind direction before and after it rains weighted by precipitation intensity +/-24 hours."></p>
<p>The average wind direction before and after it rains rounds out our intuition about stormy air movement. Not only does the wind speed pick up prior to wet weather, but the wind direction also changes by roughly 30 degrees before and after a storm (usually toward the north). And it doesn't take anything fancy to detect wind direction; just <a href="http://www.education.com/activity/article/wind_vane_first/">pin a straw</a> to the top of a pencil or <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/266932/why-does-saliva-on-the-finger-give-correct-direction-of-wind">lick your finger</a> and hold it up in the air.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip: When it's been windy, then calms down and changes direction, expect rain within an hour.</strong></p>
<h2>Hack #3 - Temperature Before Rain</h2>
<p><img src="https://makefastworkshop.com/hacks/pages/20160928/CatTempWeather.jpg" alt="" title="Cat contemplating the effect of temperature on weather."></p>
<p>We also imagined that the temperature decreases when rain is on the way. But like curious cats (who, by the way, also have <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1330962/">fine temperature sensitivity</a>), we wondered: how much of that is <em>feeling</em> cold because of darker sky and increased wind, versus actual temperature change?</p>
<p><img src="https://makefastworkshop.com/hacks/pages/20160928/TemperatureBefore.png" alt="" title="Temperature before and after it rains weighted by precipitation intensity +/-24 hours."></p>
<p>The graph above shows the temperature change for 5 years of data across 10 locations in the 24 hours before and after it rains. Each location has different temperature norms, so we expect them to be at different levels, but once again we can combine them and focus on their shape to look for patterns.</p>
<p><img src="https://makefastworkshop.com/hacks/pages/20160928/TemperatureBeforeAvg.png" alt="" title="Average temperature before and after it rains weighted by precipitation intensity +/-24 hours."></p>
<p>The drop in temperature is significant, with steady cooling of around 4 degrees Fahrenheit in 4 hours (with roughly 2 degrees falling in the final hour or so). That's enough to feel a chill in the air, even without the wind and overcast skies. Also notice that there's typically a minor upswing in temperature in the 4-6 hours before the drop, amplifying the feeling of rapid temperature change.</p>
<p><img src="https://makefastworkshop.com/hacks/pages/20160928/TempAndDewBeforeAvg.png" alt="" title="Average temperature and dew point before and after it rains weighted by precipitation intensity +/-24 hours."></p>
<p>We can also see what the dew point is doing while the temperature fluctuates to get a sense of how humid or muggy it feels. Notice that the dew point rises up like a ramp before the rain and then steadily falls away. When the temperature and dew point come closer together, the humidity will be higher, as the air is increasingly saturated with water.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip: When the temperature quickly drops and the humidity rises, expect rain in the next couple of hours.</strong></p>
<h2>Hack #4 - Predicting Sunshine</h2>
<p><img src="https://makefastworkshop.com/hacks/pages/20160928/SunnyMorning.jpg" alt="" title="Sunny morning over the lake."></p>
<p>While it seems most helpful to use weather data to better predict precipitation, we can use the same approach to predict clear, sunny skies. To do this, we created an anti-precipitation metric called <em>clear sky intensity</em> that factors in both a lack of rain and cloud cover.</p>
<p>We looked at two major factors for sunny skies: temperature and wind speed.</p>
<p><img src="https://makefastworkshop.com/hacks/pages/20160928/TempBeforeClearAvg.png" alt="" title="Average temperature before and after clear skies weighted by clear sky intensity +/-24 hours."></p>
<p>Naturally, the temperature typically climbs once skies are clear, but there is also an interesting clue beforehand - the shallow dip. We expect the temperature to rise and fall more or less in sync with days and nights, but the data suggest that an increased low temperature value (the minimum for those 24 hours) can be used as a predictor of clear skies on the way.</p>
<p><img src="https://makefastworkshop.com/hacks/pages/20160928/WindBeforeClearAvg.png" alt="" title="Average wind speed before and after clear skies weighted by clear sky intensity +/-24 hours."></p>
<p>We were also able to see a marked change in wind speed before the skies cleared up. While the average effect is small (only about 0.3 MPH difference), the pattern is compelling, particularly when used alongside other information. As wind speed decreases over a 12-hour window, clouds are likely to subside with it.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip: When low temps increase and winds die down, expect clear skies in the next 3-6 hours.</strong></p>
<h2>Hack #5 - Leveraging Pressure</h2>
<p><img src="https://makefastworkshop.com/hacks/pages/20160928/OldBarometer.png" alt="" title="19th century analog barometer."></p>
<p>While most of the major weather data recorded can be easily seen or felt, there is one that stands out as more elusive and abstract - barometric pressure.</p>
<p>Barometers have been used for centuries because of their apparent ability to "know" more about the upcoming weather for a single location than anything else. That's because weather patterns move around in high and low pressure systems that often take days to pass over an area.</p>
<p>Being able to sense those tiny fluctuations in pressure means being able to tell when a change in weather is on the way.</p>
<p><img src="https://makefastworkshop.com/hacks/pages/20160928/PressureCC.png" alt="" title="Cross correlation between pressure and precipitation intensity with time shifts +/-24 hours."></p>
<p>Notice how a dip in pressure is correlated with the rain intensity above, though the magnitude and exact timing of the pressure change is dependent on location.</p>
<p><img src="https://makefastworkshop.com/hacks/pages/20160928/PressureBeforeAvg.png" alt="" title="Average pressure before and after it rains weighted by precipitation intensity +/-24 hours."></p>
<p>By taking the average across all locations and looking at the relationship between rain and the preceding pressure, we can get a much better picture of what's going on. Generally, there is a significant decrease in pressure 3-6 hours before the rain starts coming down.</p>
<p><img src="https://makefastworkshop.com/hacks/pages/20160928/PressureBeforeClearAvg.png" alt="" title="Average pressure before and after clear skies weighted by clear sky intensity +/-24 hours."></p>
<p>The opposite is also true; a significant increase in pressure is associated with warmer, clearer weather. The graph above illustrates this by showing the average pressure before clear weather.</p>
<p>So for the old-school weather aficionado, keeping tabs on a barometer's reading over time may be the best way to predict what's on the way, especially if the power goes out (or if you're entertaining sea captains!).</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip: When the barometric pressure dips quickly, expect rain in 3-6 hours. When it climbs steadily, look for sun in 6-24 hours.</strong></p>
<!--
  ## Meta Hack - Automating Analysis
  We've discovered (via more than a million data points, not just intuition!) that there are many ways to predict the upcoming weather using realtime, local information. This is the kind of data that can be easily measured with a little weather gadget in your kitchen or on your front porch, without needing to connect to the internet or put an app on your phone.
  But to make the most of the readings, we'd need to stay on top of the fluctuations and train ourselves to see the patterns in the data over time. So instead of making another graphical weather gadget that shows you specific values and how they evolve, we decided to build a circuit board that could do that for us. That's right, a *meta hack*.
  ![](./pages/20160928/LightNudgePCB.jpg "LightNudge circuit board with precision barometric sensor and realtime processing algorithm.")
  Our automated weather analysis device, called [LightNudge](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/makefast/lightnudge-a-modern-barometer), uses a precision digital barometer and then keeps track of how the pressure fluctuates over time. It outputs the resulting forecast as colored light so that you can see its prediction from across the room (without needing to take out your reading glasses or open an app).
  Because changes in pressure are smooth and slow compared to other local weather variables (temperature, wind speed, etc.), LightNudge can be used as a much more reliable source of local weather prediction, forecasting out twice as far as a standard barometer alone (6-12 hours instead of 3-6).
  To emphasize the simplicity of its data-driven output and prepare it to sit unobtrusively in primary living spaces, we encased the components in a wood-and-marble body shaped like a triangle (well, technically a prism). Read more about it in the link above if you're curious.

<p>In a staircase problem, you try to calculate the different ways to reach the n’th stair where you are allowed to take up to m steps at a time. Say you are given a staircase problem with 5 stairs to climb, and you can take 1 or 2 steps at a time. How would you solve this problem? This and its variants are the focus of this article. It is a great problem to demonstrate the properties of dynamic programming and how to solve problems with it. Due to this, staircase problem and its variants like unique paths problem are commonly used as programming interview questions.</p>

<p>In this article, you will find the solutions to the following questions, as well as their time and space complexities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Medium Difficulty: Staircase Problem - Different Ways to Reach the N’th Stair: Given n stairs, you can climb 1 or 2 stairs at a time. Count the number of different ways that you can reach the top.</li>
  <li>Medium Difficulty: Generalized Fibonacci-like Sequences: Same question but you can climb up to m steps at a time.</li>
  <li>Medium Difficulty: Generalized Fibonacci-like Sequences With Variable Steps: Same question but you can only climb 2, 3, 6 steps at a time.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Staircase problem is just a special case of “unique variations” questions like that of unique paths problem. I might make quick articles for those too, but you can apply the same methods that you will learn here to solve them also.</li>
  <li>You can identify variation finding questions if you are asked to find unique ways of doing XXX.</li>
  <li>Solutions to these problems are a subset of Dynamic Programming (the technique of solving a problem by dividing it into subproblems). We can solve them using recursion or iteration.</li>
  <li>Since solutions to these questions resemble Fibonacci Sequences, they are referred to as Fibonacci Puzzles, and they commonly appear in programming interviews and LeetCode. Especially the staircase problem!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="staircase-problem---different-ways-to-reach-the-nth-stair">Staircase Problem - Different Ways to Reach the N’th Stair</h2>
<p>Question:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Given n stairs, you can climb 1 or 2 stairs at a time. Count the number of different ways that you can reach to the top.</li>
</ul>

<p>Difficulty:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Medium.</li>
</ul>

<p>Requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There are no bounds specified for n.</li>
</ul>

<p>Analysis:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There is no upper bound to n so recursive solutions might blow up the call stack.</li>
  <li>There is no lower bound specified for n so users might try to put in zero as the parameter. Write a test for n=0 case.</li>
</ul>

<p>Formula:</p>

<p>To formulate a way to calculate all possible ways to reach a stair, think in reverse. What are the unique paths that lead to n’th stair. It is the sum of unique paths leading to n-1’th stair plus n-2’nd stairs.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>ways(n) = ways(n-1) + ways(n-2)</code></li>
  <li>ways(4) = ways(3) + ways(2)</li>
  <li>ways(3) = ways(2) + ways(1)</li>
  <li>…</li>
</ul>

<p>This is Fibonacci Sequence!</p>

<p>Tip: Visualize in a regular (forward) manner and trying to figure out a pattern/formula. If that does not work, try to think in reverse (i.e. reverse path in this question).</p>

<p>Calculate solution for n=4:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Remember the formula: <code>ways(n) = ways(n-1) + ways(n-2)</code></li>
  <li>ways(4) = ways(3) + ways(2)</li>
  <li>ways(3) = ways(2) + ways(1)</li>
  <li>ways(2) = ways(1) + ways(0)</li>
  <li>ways(1) = 1</li>
  <li>ways(0) = 1</li>
  <li>This is the iterative Fibonacci Solution!</li>
</ul>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Continue with stair 1:
    <ul>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Continue with stair 2:
    <ul>
      <li>ways(2) = ways(1) + ways(0) = 1 + 1 = 2</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Calculate consecutive ones via adding the previous two until you reach n (stair count).</li>

      <li>No extra variables allocated in mem per recursive call.</li>
    </ul>

  <li>Call Stack: O(n)
    <ul>
      <li>Depth of recursion tree will grow linearly.</li>

<h4 id="recursion-trees">Recursion Trees:</h4>

<p>Below illustration demonstrates how inefficient recursive solution is. Notice the duplicated branches. They are the source of inefficiency. Solution for this is to use memoization.</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/algorithms/dynamic-programming/staircase-problems/media/recursion_tree.png" alt="Recursion Tree"></p>

<p>Following is an illustration of how recursion tree is traversed in our <code>ways()</code> function with 5 steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If thinking in forward does not work, try to solve the problem backwards. Reverse thinking can help you find ways to utilize dynamic programming.</li>

<p>Question:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Given n stairs, you can climb up to m stairs at a time. Count the number of different ways that you can reach to the top.</li>
</ul>

<p>Difficulty:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Medium.</li>
</ul>

<p>Formula:</p>

<p>We generate our formula again using reverse thinking. We will start form the top and calculate unique paths leading to top from previous steps.</p>

<p>*<code> ways(n, m) = ways(n-1, m) + ways(n-2, m) + ... + ways(n-m, m)</code></p>
<ul>
  <li>If m=3 (which means you can take 1, 2, or 3 steps at a time):</li>
  <li>ways(4) = ways(3) + ways(2) + ways(1)</li>
  <li>ways(3) = ways(2) + ways(1) + ways(0)</li>
  <li>ways(2) = ways(1) + ways(0)</li>
  <li>This is a Fibonacci-like sequence!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="solution-iteration-fibonacci-like-sequences">Solution: Iteration (Fibonacci-like Sequences)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Start with stairs 0 and 1.</li>
  <li>Calculate consecutive ones via adding the previous m numbers.</li>

  <li>This is essentially using sliding windows technique to calculate Fibonacci-like sequence. (more info next)</li>

return stairs[-1]

<h2 id="tips-1">Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Fibonacci sequences can be calculated in O(logn) time using Matrix Exponentiation or directly with the Fibonacci formula. This is probably an overkill for interview situations though.</li>
  <li>Write tests if you have time. Especially for corner cases like n=0, n=1, etc.</li>
  <li>Like the Staircase Problem, there are many more possible interview questions that can utilize Fibonacci-like sequences: Unique Paths Problem, Decode Ways Problem, etc. I will write separate articles for them so follow me on my socials if you don’t want to miss them!</li>

<ul>
  <li>Medium.</li>
</ul>

<p>Formula:</p>

<p>Once again, we formulate our solution using top-to-bottom approach.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>ways(n, [x, y, z, ...]) = ways(n-x, [x, y, z, ...]) + ways(n-y, [x, y, z, ...]) + ways(n-z, [x, y, z, ...]) + ...</code></li>
  <li>If x=2, y=3, z=5:</li>

        <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>For some businesses, offering their users an app adds tremendous value to their users’ lives, while for some others, it only adds to users’ app fatigue.&nbsp;</p>
<!--more-->
<p>With observations like this come the burning questions — How can you tell where your business stands in this spectrum? How do you know if an app or website would serve your business better? How do they benefit businesses?</p>
<p>To help clear the mist, here’s a simplified guide to when you need an app, when you need a website, and when you need both.</p>
<h2><strong>When You Need an App</strong></h2>
<p>Apps are specifically designed to run mostly on smartphones and tablets. They require users to install and download updates in order to use a service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This might be a little work for your users especially if they’re already experiencing app fatigue with their existing apps — handing them another app to install might deter them from using your service at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compared to websites, apps also generally cost more and take longer to build because different versions for native apps need to be considered for different devices.</p>
<p>Despite that, having an app for your business can still be advantageous in many ways.</p>
<h3><strong>On the plus side, apps:</strong></h3>
<p>1. Can be discovered through app stores<br>2. Can leverage native device functionality<br>3. Allow for easier user behavior tracking<br>4. Allow for offline functions<br>5. Give your users a more customized experience, deepening existing relationships with users</p>
<h2><strong>An app might work for you if your platform:</strong></h2>
<p>1. Aims to engage with returning users<br>2. Requires personalization (e.g. push notifications, geolocation, etc.)<br>3. Needs to access device functionality (e.g. camera, microphone, contacts, etc.)</p>
<h2><strong>When You Need a Website</strong></h2>
<p>Just because apps are a “gold rush” for businesses these days doesn’t mean you necessarily need one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sure, websites may limit your customers to browsers, web-based notifications, and service that depends on network connection, but sometimes a mobile-friendly website with responsive design is all you need to up user satisfaction.</p>
<h3><strong>On the plus side, websites:</strong></h3>
<p>1. Cost less<br>2. Take less time to build<br>3. Can run on both mobile and desktop browsers<br>4. Are easier to discover through web searches<br>5. Are easier to share with links<br>6. Are instantly available and don’t require downloads or updates</p>
<h3><strong>A website might work for you if your platform:</strong></h3>
<p>1. Aims mainly to provide information<br>2. Requires minimal personalization<br>3. Doesn’t need to access device functionality</p>
<br>
<h2><strong>When You Need Both</strong></h2>
<p>You really don’t have to only choose one to stick to. It's extremely common for today’s businesses to combine a website with a mobile app. This combo allows them to not only welcome new customers, but also give their loyal returning customers a personalized experience with exclusive content and deals.</p>
<p>When your app and website work together to serve both new customers and existing ones, you get the best of both worlds. Other than giving your customers flexibility and choice, here are some other reasons the app+website combo is valuable to business owners.</p>
<h3><strong>To Gain Your Customers’ Trust</strong></h3>
<p>Typically, businesses start building awareness with a website before they launch an app. This is because websites are a great way to start new relationships with customers, while apps are great for deepening those existing relationships.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any business, new customers need to see the value of your service before they decide to become a regular. In this case, your users need to be convinced that the service you offer is important to them, before they hit the download button and give you a place on their phones.</p>
<h3><strong>To Market Your App Better</strong></h3>
<p>Websites also give business owners way more freedom in the way they want to market their app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you know you’re limited to only 4000 characters to pitch your app to users on app stores? There are also limitations on the size, quality, and number of screenshots and videos you can display on your app’s page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On your own website, you can give visitors a deeper dive into your app’s features with much more dynamic visuals.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Other Ways to Find Out&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>Looking at both objective and subjective clues is the best way to find the perfect solution. Aside from the checklists above, it never hurts to mix in your observations.</p>
<h3><strong>Look at Your Competitors</strong></h3>
<p>If you’re lost on what you should do next, study examples in your industry. Pick some of the businesses closest to what you envision yours to be, and ask these questions:&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are they doing?&nbsp;<br>How is their app or website helping them?&nbsp;<br>If you take a different route, how can you make up for what they’ve gained on their route?</p>
<h3><strong>Know Your Users</strong></h3>
<p>It’s also important to know your target market and their needs. Without analyzing data and paying attention to user behavior, you can end up with nothing but negative reception when you throw your users the opposite of what they want.</p>
<h3><strong>Get Help from an Agency</strong></h3>
<p>An alternative to figuring it out on your own is to find a good digital agency to help you out.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Can Little Snitch 4 be installed on macOS 11 Big Sur?</h3>
</label></p><div>
<p>Little Snitch 4 needs to install a <em>Network Kernel Extension</em> in order to perform its network traffic filtering. This kind of kernel extension is no longer supported on macOS Big Sur. The operating system now refuses to load such kernel extensions by default.</p>
<p>The latest <a href="https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/download.html">version 5 of Little Snitch</a> no longer uses this unsupported Kernel API. It uses the newer System Extension API provided by Apple and is therefore fully compatible with macOS Big Sur.</p>
<p>Alternatively, it’s currently still possible to manually approve the loading of particular kernel extensions. This requires to start up your computer from macOS Recovery and enter a Terminal command to grant the necessary permission. However, Apple may remove this possibility at any time with a future update of macOS Big Sur.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201314">Start up your computer from macOS Recovery</a>: Restart your computer and hold Command-R during startup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the Terminal application from the Utilities menu in the menu bar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter the following command and press Return:<br><code>spctl kext-consent add MLZF7K7B5R</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Restart your computer by choosing Restart from the Apple menu ().</p>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.obdev.at/support/littlesnitch/245914482614726">Uninstall Little Snitch 5</a> if it’s already installed on your computer.</li>
</ol>
<p>After this approval process you should be able to install Little Snitch 4.6.</p>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> Older versions of Little Snitch (prior to version 4.6) cannot be installed on macOS Big Sur, not even with this manual approval.</p>

17 Jan 2019

</span></p><p>A library that I work on often these days, <a href="https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer">meshoptimizer</a>, has changed over time to use fewer and fewer C++ library features, up until the current state where the code closely resembles C even though it uses some C++ features. There have been many reasons behind the changes - dropping C++11 requirement allowed me to make sure anybody can compile the library on any platform, removing <code>std::vector</code> substantially improved performance of unoptimized builds, removing <code>algorithm</code> includes sped up compilation. However, I’ve never quite taken the leap all the way to C with this codebase. Today we’ll explore the gamut of possible C++ implementations for one specific algorithm, mesh simplifier, henceforth known as <code>simplifier.cpp</code>, and see if going all the way to C is worthwhile.</p>

<!--more-->



<p>Mesh simplifier is an implementation of an edge collapse quadric based simplification algorithm with many tweaks to improve performance and quality of the result. The algorithm is still in development but has had a fair share of effort put into it. The details are really not that important, but it helps to understand the structure and size:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The entire algorithm is implemented in one standalone .cpp file that has almost exactly a thousand lines of code (1004 as of this writing), including comments, blank lines, lines with braces, etc.</li>
  <li>The algorithm almost exclusively uses heap-allocated arrays as data structures, using raw pointers for this</li>
  <li>The algorithm needs a hash table and a sorting routine, implemented from scratch</li>
</ul>

<p>We will look at several variations of the implementation, starting with one that uses C++ containers and algorithms that would be helpful for that algorithm, then remove one C++ feature at a time and measure compilation speed and runtime performance as we go on three compilers, gcc 7.3, clang 6 and msvc 2017 on Core i7-8700K running Windows 10 / Ubuntu 16.10. We’ll measure compilation performance by just compiling one .cpp file (with default options in debug and <code>-O2</code> optimization level in release), and measure runtime performance by simplifying <code>buddha.obj</code> (1M triangle mesh) to 25% of its size. After we reach the current implementation, we will explore the option of changing the code to pure C99.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that the way I arrived at these implementations is by taking the code you can see in the repository right now, and changing it to be more idiomatic Modern C++<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. However, these are generally very close to past versions of <code>simplifier.cpp</code> - the difference being that it’s possible to directly compare the variants now.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The version we’re starting with is the original <code>simplifier.cpp</code> from <a href="https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer/blob/c93ba0987baa84bd73b61edf1c0ba7ba2e48df4b/src/simplifier.cpp">current meshoptimizer master</a>, with the following modifications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All raw pointers changed to <code>std::vector</code></li>
  <li>Instead of a home-grown hash table we use <code>std::unordered_set</code></li>
  <li>Instead of a home-grown sorting routine we use <code>std::sort</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s the performance that we’re getting as a result:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>compiler/stl</th>
      <th>debug compile</th>
      <th>release compile</th>
      <th>debug run</th>
      <th>release run</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>gcc</td>
      <td>520 ms</td>
      <td>646 ms</td>
      <td>2273 ms</td>
      <td>572 ms</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>clang</td>
      <td>400 ms</td>
      <td>684 ms</td>
      <td>2356 ms</td>
      <td>566 ms</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>clang libc++</td>
      <td>400 ms</td>
      <td>725 ms</td>
      <td>1535 ms</td>
      <td>584 ms</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>msvc</td>
      <td>422 ms</td>
      <td>566 ms</td>
      <td>36317 ms</td>
      <td>579 ms</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This is a good starting point. We can see that performance is pretty solid in release - 0.6 seconds to decimate 1M triangle mesh is a good level of performance - generally more or less reasonable in debug with a notable exception of MSVC (the adverse behavior of MSVC STL in debug mode was one of the forcing functions to remove all STL use from meshoptimizer), and compile times generally vary but are uninspiring.</p>

<p>To put the compile times in perspective, Jonathan Blow recently posted a <a href="https://youtu.be/iD08Vpkie8Q?t=4984">video stream with compiler performance improvements</a>, where his game engine and game written in his new language compile and link in about a second (compilation itself takes about 0.9 seconds). That’s on a codebase that has 100K lines of code - our algorithm only has 1K lines of code (excluding STL, of course - it’s not entirely fair to exclude STL, but it’s not entirely fair to include STL either since we know our algorithm can be implemented in 1K LOC without any STL dependencies). 400 ms is something you notice when compiling your code, even if it’s just one file, and something that makes me less happy when working on the code - given many files like that, cumulative compilation performance can be bad. This is given the fact that our implementation is pretty spartan about the STL dependencies - we only use three algorithms/containers. Let’s see what happens when we stop using one of them.</p>



<p>The secret about the previous version we benchmarked is that it never existed in that form. While meshoptimizer initially used STL containers and algorithms, it never used <code>std::unordered_set</code> - that’s because based on prior experience I expected the performance to be insufficient for the kinds of algorithms I wanted to write, and had a custom replacement that was using quadratic probing in a large power of two sized array, which is similar to Google’s <code>dense_hash_set</code> design. It’s a kind of hash table I use and implement often in different codebases for different applications, so I’m very familiar with it. The implementation in <code>simplifier.cpp</code> is just 35 lines of code<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, so it’s easy to drop in and adapt for the use case at hand. Let’s see what happens when we use that instead.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>compiler/stl</th>
      <th>debug compile</th>
      <th>release compile</th>
      <th>debug run</th>
      <th>release run</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>gcc</td>
      <td>334 ms</td>
      <td>461 ms</td>
      <td>2054 ms</td>
      <td>460 ms</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>clang</td>
      <td>270 ms</td>
      <td>517 ms</td>
      <td>2152 ms</td>
      <td>452 ms</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>clang libc++</td>
      <td>314 ms</td>
      <td>609 ms</td>
      <td>1179 ms</td>
      <td>415 ms</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>msvc</td>
      <td>361 ms</td>
      <td>461 ms</td>
      <td>28337 ms</td>
      <td>380 ms</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>It looks like the extra 35 lines for a manual implementation of a better hash table were worth it. We’re seeing significant performance improvements across the board, in debug/release and both in terms of compile time and run time. The largest increase in runtime performance is on MSVC, we got 1.5x faster, and this is given the fact that hash table isn’t used as a core part of the algorithm - it’s only used to establish uniqueness relationship between individual vertices before the algorithm starts.</p>

<p>This highlights the poor fit of <code>std::unordered_set</code> to performance-critical workloads, especially ones that are insert-heavy. Unfortunately, this is not an implementation defect and thus is not possible to correct - the issue is that the standard requirements on unordered containers preclude more efficient implementations. Here’s to hoping that eventually we’ll get a better hash table in the standard.</p>



<p>At some point during development of the simplifier repeated profiling of various meshes showed that a lot of time is being spent in <code>std::sort</code>. Now, <code>std::sort</code> isn’t the fastest sorting algorithm, but it’s generally extremely competitive with custom implementations and it’s hard to beat without changing the problem around. In my case, sorting was used on an array of edge collapses, with the sort key being a floating point error value - so the natural instinct is to use a 3-pass radix sort, using 11, 11 and 10 bits of the key in each pass. However, there’s an interesting alternative available to us here - we can do radix sort in a single pass, using an 11 bit key<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>What happens is that we have a 32-bit non-negative floating point value; if we take the top 12 bits and ignore the topmost one (since that’s a sign bit and is always 0), we get 11 bits that represent 8 bits of exponent and 3 bits of mantissa, which essentially gives us a value of similar magnitude but a significant round-off error. If we sort using this value as a key, as a result the sorting sequence isn’t going to be perfectly ordered with respect to the full 32-bit key. However, in our case we need to sort to be able to process better edge collapses first based on a heuristic - and the heuristic is a gross approximation so the extra error our sorting introduces is not noticeable. This technique is surprisingly useful in other domains where you don’t necessarily need an exact order either. A benefit of a single-pass radix sort is that it’s faster (you only need to do one pass over the data instead of 3!) and simpler to implement than a full-blown radix sort, taking just 36 lines of code<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This time the gains in compilation times are somewhat more modest. We’ve removed <code>&lt;algorithm&gt;</code> header but it doesn’t seem so have had very significant benefits to compilation time - we’re still including <code>&lt;vector&gt;</code> and it’s possible that large STL headers are pulled by both. However, the effects on performance are very significant, especially on debug performance in libstdc++ (most likely <code>std::sort</code> is very slow in debug there) but the gains in release builds are also exciting. What is not obvious from this graph is that sorting got so much faster that it almost completely disappeared from the profiles compared to the other work - the entire algorithm runs “just” 1.35x faster, but the gains measured on just the sorting code are much larger, 117 ms -&gt; 10 ms in release builds.</p>



<p>One number that we haven’t moved substantially yet is the time it takes to run this code in debug using MSVC. While it’s natural to expect unoptimized builds to be slower than optimized, they have to be fast enough. Sometimes you want to debug your problem on a non-trivial input dataset. Sometimes you want to run the debug build with full checks through your tests to make sure they don’t trigger any bugs that could disappear in release. Sometimes you are trying to debug a different part of the program, but you still need to run the rest of it. Programmers creatively come up with many workarounds that make the problem less severe - you can make special builds that enable some optimizations but not all, you can use mixed optimization settings for different projects, you can use <code>#pragma optimize</code> to temporarily disable optimizations around offending parts of the code - but all of these seem like duct-tape. Let’s try to replace the only STL component we’re still using, …</p></div></div>

      <p>Emacs has a reputation for being borderline unusable out of the box, of being
bloated but somehow surprisingly bare.</p>
<p>This is largely a discoverability problem<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The solution
the Internet has settled on seems to be “Emacs distributions” like Doom,
Spacemacs or Prelude that glue together dozens (sometimes hundreds) of addons to
deliver a batteries included, finely tuned and user-friendly experience from
first launch. While it’s not for me, this does work
great&nbsp;<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, and many of these packages will probably make
their way into the default Emacs experience in due time.</p>
<p>But while modern features like built-in LSP support, faster syntax highlighting
(through tree-sitter) and ligature support are still being debated in the
development mailing list, the long running, slow moving train of Emacs has
picked up many interesting passengers.</p>
<p>Emacs as shipped does a lot more than meets the eye, and external package
functionality often partially replicates built in behavior.</p>
<p>Here is a list of useful features in emacs I use regularly that I don’t see
mentioned or recommended often online. Guidelines I used to populate this list:</p>
<ul>
<li>No packages, <strong>stock Emacs only</strong>.</li>
<li>No steep learning curves. <strong>Learn each feature in under two minutes or bust</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>No gimmicks</strong>. No doctor, tetris, snake, dunnet, zone or butterfly.</li>
<li><strong>Just the deltas</strong>. No commonly mentioned packages like flymake, doc-view,
outline-minor-mode or eww/w3m. Nothing that Emacs brings up automatically or a
nonspecific Google search gets you.</li>
<li>Assume a modern Emacs, 26.3+.</li>
</ul>
<p>The list is written in the language of Emacs’ conventions. If you’re new to
Emacs, here’s some extra cognitive load for you:</p>

<p>As is the annoying case with many things Emacs though, it provides all the
ingredients and lights the flame but leaves the cooking to you. Here’s a simple
recipe:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="emacs-lisp">(<span>defun</span> <span>pulse-line</span> (<span>&amp;rest</span> <span>_</span>)
      <span>"Pulse the current line."</span>
      (<span>pulse-momentary-highlight-one-line</span> (<span>point</span>)))

(<span>dolist</span> (<span>command</span> <span>'</span>(<span>scroll-up-command</span> <span>scroll-down-command</span>
                   <span>recenter-top-bottom</span> <span>other-window</span>))
  (<span>advice-add</span> <span>command</span> <span>:after</span> <span>#'</span><span>pulse-line</span>))
</code></pre></div><p>Modify as needed. There’s more than one external package
(<a href="https://github.com/Malabarba/beacon">beacon</a>) that does this and more, but
<code>pulse</code> is just fine.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="undo-in-region--c">Undo in region (<code>C-/</code>)</h2>
<p>Limit your undoing to the active region:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://karthinks.com/img/undo-in-region-demo.gif"> 
</figure>

<p>There’s nothing to set up or run here. This is the default behavior of undo in
Emacs.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="follow-mode--m-x-follow-mode">Follow mode (<code>M-x follow-mode</code>)</h2>
<p>Most monitors are much wider than they are tall. Most text files are much longer
than they are wide. That’s a problem.</p>
<p><code>follow-mode</code> shows a contiguous buffer paginated across multiple windows. The
cursor flows from one window to the next.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://karthinks.com/img/follow-mode-demo.gif"> 
</figure>

<hr>
<h2 id="selective-display--c-x">Selective display (<code>C-x $</code>)</h2>
<p>If you code with rigid indentation, you can get a quick overview of your
document with <code>set-selective-display</code>. No mucking around with folding,
<code>outline-</code> or <code>hs-minor-mode</code> regexps.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://karthinks.com/img/set-selective-display-demo.gif"> 
</figure>

<p>Call the command with the prefix argument set to the column to hide. Call
without a prefix argument to disable.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="pretty-symbols--m-x-prettify-symbols-mode">Pretty symbols (<code>M-x prettify-symbols-mode</code>)</h2>
<p>This one’s mainly for LaTeX users. Display unicode versions of math operators,
greek symbols and more. <code>M-x prettify-symbols-mode</code> in a TeX buffer.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://karthinks.com/img/prettify-symbols-test.png" alt="Figure 1: Before and after enabling prettify-symbols-mode"> <figcaption>
            <p>Figure 1: Before and after enabling <code>prettify-symbols-mode</code></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The equivalent in <code>org-mode</code> is <code>M-x org-toggle-pretty-entities</code>. Other major
modes will have to define the replacements explicitly to get this behavior.

<hr>
<h2 id="view-mode--m-x-view-mode">View mode (<code>M-x view-mode</code>)</h2>
<p>Provide pager-like keybindings. Makes navigating read-only buffers a breeze.
Move down and up with <code>SPC</code> and <code>delete</code> (backspace) or <code>S-SPC</code>, half a page
down and up with <code>d</code> and <code>u</code>, and isearch with <code>s</code>.</p>
<p>This is my preferred way to read code or documents as I can avoid chorded
commands. Note that <code>evil-mode</code> doesn’t help here either, since paging is bound
to <code>C-u/d/f/b</code>.</p>
<p><del>To that end I just hook this into <code>read-only-mode</code>.</del> Prolific emacser <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/jwhr6g/batteries%5Fincluded%5Fwith%5Femacs/gct12vp/">Omar
Antolin Camarena</a> points out a built-in way to use <code>view-mode</code> in all read-only
buffers, including ones you set read-only with <code>C-x C-q</code>:</p>
<p>This is my favorite feature of the bunch, considering how much time I spend in
Emacs reading things.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="cycle-spacing--m-spc">Cycle-spacing (<code>M-SPC</code>)</h2>
<p>The <code>cycle-spacing</code> command is more versatile than it appears. By default, it
cycles between deleting all whitespace around cursor but one, deleting all
whitespace and restoring whitespace. But with a negative argument, it deletes
all blank lines around the cursor. (Calling it with a negative argument is fast:
Hold down Meta and hit minus and space in sequence.)</p>
<p>Put together, it’s doing the job of (almost) three older commands:
<code>just-one-space</code>, <code>delete-horizontal-space</code> and
<code>delete-blank-lines</code><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> This opens up the
bindings <code>C-x C-o</code> and <code>M-\</code> for more useful functions.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="indirect-buffers--m-x-make-indirect-buffer">Indirect buffers (<code>M-x make-indirect-buffer</code>)</h2>
<p>One buffer. Two windows. Two states.</p>
<p>This one’s for outline/org users. Do you want to see an overview of your
document <em>and</em> the section you’re working on? <code>M-x make-indirect-buffer</code> or <code>M-x clone-indirect-buffer</code></p>
<p>Here I clone an org buffer and narrow the original to get a makeshift TOC:
<img src="https://karthinks.com/img/indirect-buffer-demo.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>At this point we’re a few lines of elisp away from writing a <code>toc-minor-mode</code>
for org files!</p>
<p>But the possibilities are much larger, because as the manual puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The text of the indirect buffer is always identical to the text of its base
buffer; changes made by editing either one are visible immediately in the other.
But in all other respects, the indirect buffer and its base buffer are
completely separate. They can have different names, different values of point,
different narrowing, different markers, different major modes, and different
local variables.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="html-fontify--m-x-htmlfontify-buffer">Html-fontify (<code>M-x htmlfontify-buffer</code>)</h2>
<p>Reproduce the look of your emacs buffer as a html file with CSS. This is either
extremely useful or useless to you!</p>
<p><a href="https://karthinks.com/share/htmlfontify-demo.html">Here</a> is the html-fontified version of the
source file of this write-up.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="dwim-commands--upcase-downcase-and-more">DWIM commands (upcase, downcase  and more<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>)</h2>
<p>Modern versions of Emacs provide Do-What-I-Mean versions of various editing
commands: They act on the region when the region is active, and on an
appropriate semantic unit otherwise. Replace <code>upcase-word</code> and <code>downcase-word</code>
with <code>upcase-dwim</code> and <code>downcase-dwim</code> respectively, and you can safely eject
the bindings for <code>upcase-region</code> and <code>downcase-region</code>.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="emacs-lisp">(<span>global-set-key</span> (<span>kbd</span> <span>"M-u"</span>) <span>'upcase-dwim</span>)
(<span>global-set-key</span> (<span>kbd</span> <span>"M-l"</span>) <span>'downcase-dwim</span>)
(<span>global-set-key</span> (<span>kbd</span> <span>"M-c"</span>) <span>'capitalize-dwim</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>DWIM is standard behavior for emacs commands even when it doesn’t say that in
the name. <code>count-words</code>, <code>query-replace</code>, the list goes on. Check to see if your
frequently used commands DWYM.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="unit-conversion-in-calc--m-x-calc">Unit conversion in calc (<code>M-x calc</code>)</h2>
<p>It’s <code>u c</code>. And <code>'</code> (quote) for algebraic entry: <img src="https://karthinks.com/img/calc-units-demo.gif" alt="">
<code>calc</code> does a lot more with units. You can simplify, define new unit conversions
and more. Hit <code>u ?</code> to see your options.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="symbolic-computation-in-calc--m-x-calc">Symbolic computation in calc (<code>M-x calc</code>)</h2>
<p>We’re skirting the “<strong>learn each feature in under two minutes or bust</strong>” rule with
this one, as it deserves its own write-up, or a perusal of the manual. The
general interaction paradigm is simple, though.</p>
<p>Let’s find a Taylor expansion of the integral of the error function:
<img src="https://karthinks.com/img/calc-symbolic-demo.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Access algebraic routines (root finding, symbolic manipulation) in calc under
the <code>a</code> prefix. Indefinite integration is <code>a i</code>, differentiation is <code>a d</code>,
solving algebraic equations is <code>a S</code> and so on. (Hit <code>a ?</code>)</p>
<hr>

<p>What it says on the tin. Move the buffer instead of the cursor when navigating.
Just press the scroll lock key or <code>M-x scroll-lock-mode</code>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="tabs--m-x-tab-bar-mode">Tabs (<code>M-x tab-bar-mode</code>)</h2>
<p>These are mentioned often, but rarely recommended. Most Emacs users find the
idea of tabs in Emacs to be redundant, but will happily recommend window
configuration registers, which provide similar functionality.</p>
<p>Tabs work great to separate projects, or work and email buffers. In principle
this is equivalent to popping up a new frame and letting the window manager
handle the separation, but on stacking window managers I find tabs to be much
preferable.</p>
<p>Since there’s never one way to do something in Emacs, a secondary
<code>tab-line-mode</code> is available that adds tabs to each window instead of frame.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="next-time">Next time:</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>icomplete</code> and <code>fido</code>: Incremental completion systems</li>
<li><code>completion-styles</code>: Supercharge completion in the minibuffer</li>
<li><code>re-builder</code> and <code>rx</code>: Visual regular expressions</li>
<li><code>orgtbl-mode</code>: Easy table formatting everywhere</li>
<li><code>strokes-mode</code>: Control emacs with mouse gestures</li>
</ul>
<p>… and more.</p>

				<div><p>Yesterday morning I had the privilege of being on a <a href="https://themarketingmeetup.com/blog/penny-ferguson-and-catherine-newman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://themarketingmeetup.com/blog/penny-ferguson-and-catherine-newman/">webinar</a> with Joe and Catherine talking about personal leadership and a definition that I think could do with maybe a little more explanation, even though is a much bigger subject.</p>

<p><em>Outstanding managers drive people to perform at the highest level they are capable of. It is very much about control.</em></p>
<p>Outstanding leaders inspire them to do it for themselves, and it is more about freedom.</p>
<p>Please recognise the first word of these sentences is the word ‘outstanding’. &nbsp;Both of these styles can be very successful – they are just different. &nbsp;The knack is being aware of which is appropriate to use and when.</p>
<h2><strong>Leadership throughout life</strong></h2>
<p>My most important leadership role in my life is that of a parent and I really didn’t understand anything about leadership until my children had grown up.</p>
<p>With what I now know, there is no question in my mind that I managed all of my six children when they were growing up and I bitterly regret not learning all of this much sooner.</p>
<p>I love then more than anything else in my world and I had a history of making some pretty stupid mistakes in my life which I never wanted them to make.</p>
<p>I did my best to sort out all of their problems, gave advice all the time, pointed out where there were risks and how to avoid them, told them what to do, when to do it and how to do it, and generally did everything possible for them, even making their beds!</p>
<p>Through loving them so much I was, in fact, disempowering them, educating them how not to think for themselves, I was inadvertently telling them they could not do anything without me plus they could never be better than I was yesterday. Big oops!</p>
<h3><em><strong>Let’s recognise where we are right now: ‘world unusual’.&nbsp;</strong></em></h3>
<p>We are probably in a position at work where we are having to make painful decisions, that we have no wish to make, and it’s going to affect people’s lives, and we care so much for each of these individuals.</p>
<p>Our temptation is to leap into telling people what to do, how to do it, try to convince them that all will be fine and take on all the responsibility for keeping them safe and motivated. &nbsp;All feelings to be applauded.</p>
<p>However, in these examples, how are we communicating?</p>
<p>It is all ‘let me tell you what I think…’, I’ve got a great suggestion…’ , ‘I think you’ve got it wrong…’.</p>
<p>This language is entirely management and we are in control. &nbsp;All my experience, with evidence coming out of my ears, is that this style of communicating is very typical for most of us and is almost entirely because we care and desperately want to help. &nbsp;For me, learning this at a late age, it was a serious shock to my system!</p>
<h3><em><strong>If you want to step into leadership then our communication style needs to shift considerably. Some examples could be:</strong></em></h3>
<ul>
<li>So what do you think?</li>
<li>I love that idea that you have just had</li>
<li>If you knew there is one thing you could do today to support your team what would it be?</li>
<li>If you had 50% more confidence what would you do?</li>
<li>If I wasn’t here what might you do?</li>
</ul>
<p>This is where all the focus is on helping the individual, or the team, think for themselves. &nbsp;It is about ‘you’ not ‘I’. &nbsp;It is them taking responsibility for how they choose to think and behave, it is empowering not disempowering and, above all, can inspire individuals to own more and more of their potential.</p>
<p>This is a critical aspect of leadership and the most exciting, amazing and ongoing journey of my life. &nbsp;It is giving every person the biggest gift you can give anyone, the opportunity to make their own choices and take responsibility for their own life.</p>
<p>So, this makes it pretty clear that you cannot look at management or leadership without looking at how you communicate – these are so closely linked together that it is inseparable and one of three key components of becoming a great leader.</p>
<p>How you choose to think and understanding responsibility at a much more profound level are the other two. A subject for another day!</p></div>

        <!-- <h1 class="post-title">Building a blog with Micro in Go</h1> -->

        <section>
            <p><em>This is a cross post from <a href="https://micro.mu.blog/">micro.mu/blog</a> on how to build a blog with Micro. 
We’ve been getting a lot of feedback on our series related to Netlify for the backend and what’s clear, 
people want to see more code. So here it is. Hope you enjoy!</em></p>

<p>This series will cover how to build a blog service using Micro. We’ll decompose a monolithic Blog into multiple services. 
In part one we’ll focus on building a Post service. It will be good way to learn how to build nontrivial applications with 
the <a href="https://micro.mu/reference#store">store</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/micro/dev/tree/master/model">model</a>.</p>

<p>The most important takeaway from this post will likely be the the usage of the key-value store for non-trivial usecases 
(such as querying blog posts by slug and listing them by reverse creation order).</p>

<h2 id="the-basics">The Basics</h2>

<p>Head to the <a href="https://micro.mu/getting-started">Getting Started Guide</a> if you haven’t used Micro before.</p>

<p>If you have let’s use that knowledge! As a reminder, we have to make sure <code>micro server</code> is running in an other terminal, 
and we are connected to it, ie</p>

<p>Running the micro server</p>



<p>Looking up our local environment</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>micro <span>env</span>
<span>*</span> <span>local      </span>127.0.0.1:8081         Local running micro server
  dev        proxy.m3o.dev          Cloud hosted development environment
  platform   proxy.m3o.com          Cloud hosted production environment
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can see the local environment picked. If not, we can issue <code>micro env set local</code> to remedy.</p>

<p>Now back to the <code>micro new</code> command:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>micro new posts
<span>$ </span><span>ls </span>posts
Dockerfile	Makefile	README.md	generate.go	go.mod		handler		main.go		proto
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Great! The best way to start a service is to define the proto. The generated default should be something similar to this:</p>

<p>In our post service, we want 3 methods:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>Save</code> for blog insert and update</li>
  <li><code>Query</code> for reading and listing</li>
  <li><code>Delete</code> for deletion</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s start with the post method.</p>



<p>Astute readers might notice that although we have defined a <code>Post</code> message type, we still redefine some of the fields as top level fields for the <code>SaveRequest</code> message type.
The main reason for this is that we don’t want our <a href="https://micro.mu/reference#dynamic-commands">dynamic commands</a>.</p>

<p>Ie. if we would embed a <code>Post post = 1</code> inside <code>SaveRequest</code>, we would call the posts service the following way:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>micro posts save <span>--post_title</span><span>=</span>Title <span>--post_content</span><span>=</span>Content
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>but we don’t want to keep repeating <code>post</code>, our preferred way is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>micro posts save <span>--title</span><span>=</span>Title <span>--content</span><span>=</span>Content
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To regenerate the proto, we have to issue the <code>make proto</code> command in the project root.</p>

<p>Now, the <code>main.go</code>:</p>



<p>After that’s done, let’s adjust the handler to match our proto! This snippet is a bit longer, so cover it piece by piece:</p>



<p>The above piece of code uses the <a href="https://github.com/micro/dev/tree/master/model">model package</a>. It sets up the indexes which will enable us to query the data and also tells model to maintain these indexes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The id index is needed to read by id</li>
  <li>The created index is needed so when we list posts the order of the posts will be descending based on the created field</li>
  <li>The slug index is needed to we can read posts by slug (ie. <code>myblog.com/post/awesome-post-url</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point <code>micro run .</code> in project root should deploy our post service. Let’s verify with <code>micro logs posts</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ micro logs posts
Starting [service] posts
Server [grpc] Listening on [::]:53031
Registry [service] Registering node: posts-b36361ae-f2ae-48b0-add5-a8d4797508be
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(The exact output might depend on the actual config format configuraton.)</p>

<h2 id="saving-posts">Saving posts</h2>

<p>Let’s make our service do something useful now: save a post.</p>



<p>After a <code>micro update .</code> in project root, we can start saving posts!</p>

<div><div><pre><code>micro posts save --id=1 --title="Post one" --content="First saved post"
micro posts save --id=2 --title="Post two" --content="Second saved post"
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="querying-posts">Querying posts</h2>

<p>Again, implementation starts with defining the protos:</p>



<p>A <code>make proto</code> issued in the command root should regenerate the Go proto files and we should be ready to define our new handler:</p>

<p>We want our query handler to enable querying by id, slug and also enable listing of posts:</p>



<p>As mentioned, the existing indexes can be used for querying too with the <code>ToQuery</code> method.</p>

<p>After doing a <code>micro update .</code> in the project root, we can now query the posts:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ micro posts query
{
	"posts": [
		{
			"id": "2",
			"title": "Post two",
			"slug": "post-two",
			"content": "Second saved post",
			"created": "1604423363"
		},
		{
			"id": "1",
			"title": "Post one",
			"slug": "post-one",
			"content": "First saved post",
			"created": "1604423297"
		}
	]
}

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Stellar! Now only <code>Delete</code> remains to be implemented to have a basic post service.</p>

<h2 id="deleting-posts">Deleting posts</h2>

<p>Since we have already defined <code>Delete</code> in our proto, we only have to implement the handler. It is rather simple:</p>



<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>This brings us to the end of the first post in the blogs tutorial series.
There are many more features we will add later, like saving and querying by tags, but this post already taught us enough to digest.
We will cover those aspect in later parts of this series.</p>

<p>The source code for this can be found <a href="https://github.com/micro/dev/tree/master/blog/v1-posts">here</a>.
Further versions will be in the same <code>blog</code> folder with different versions, ie <code>v2-posts</code> and once we have more services, <code>v2-tags</code>, <code>v2-comments</code>.
Folders with the same prefix will be meant to be deployed together, but more on this later.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><time>August 17, 2020</time></p><p>I have a confession to make. While I have been a professional web developer for over 6 years, I didn’t feel comfortable with JavaScript until a year and a half ago. I still don’t feel like I know a lot of things. There’s a lot that still confuses me. But I’ve grown a lot in my knowledge in the past year and a half. I wanted to share what I’ve learned.</p><p>My goal is to get more accessibility folks into the JavaScript community. The cryptic vocabulary for JavaScript concepts is intimidating for many folks (including myself). It’s why I didn’t become a JavaScript developer until I was 4.5 years into my career. Many experts say you should know the fundamentals well before learning frameworks. But where is that boundary? What is “knowing the fundamentals?” When do you know enough to jump into React?</p><p>I saw this tweet by <a href="https://twitter.com/EriPDev">Erika</a>, and it inspired a lot of the tone of this blog post.</p><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">React is just JS so you need to at least know of the fundamentals and major ES6 concepts. Don't need to be an expert but you need to know what you're looking at</p>— ✨Oobrikoob with a 'k'✨ (@EriPDev) <a href="https://twitter.com/EriPDev/status/1283039172840882178?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 14, 2020</a></blockquote><p>Something I’ve enjoyed about React is how much I’ve learned about JavaScript from jumping in. But at the same time, jumping in without as Erika says, “knowing what you’re looking at,” you may wind up confused. Below are some of the concepts helpful to me for knowing what I was looking at.</p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p><p>Before you go through this blog post, I highly recommend you take the CodeAcademy <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript">Intro to JavaScript</a> course (the free parts should be enough of an overview). I won’t be going in depth with concepts like “what is a variable?” These are all concepts I believe you should understand as well before reading this blog post.</p><p>If you don’t want to sign up for CodeAcademy (I get it, I hate signing up for new things too), review at least these concepts on MDN:</p><ul><li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var">Variables</a>: This includes the “see also” section on <code>let</code> and <code>const</code></li><li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions">Functions</a>: I’ll be going over Arrow functions in this post, so that’s not a prerequisite.</li><li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures">Data Types</a>: Don’t stress out too much about the vocabulary here. It can be overwhelming. But I’m going to use words like ‘string’ and ‘object’ in this blog post, so you should know what I mean by that.</li><li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object">Objects</a></li></ul><p>Now let’s get started 🤓</p><h2>Template Literals/Strings</h2><p>Pre ES6/ES2015, rendering JavaScript within a string used to be a HUGE pain. You had  to create strings and concatenate the strings and the variables together with a plus sign +.</p><p>Let’s say we have a function that renders a  short bio. We pass three arguments into the function. Those arguments will render within the bio.</p><p>Pre ES6 we had to create a bunch of different strings and concatenate them with variables.</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>shortBio</span><span>(</span><span>name<span>,</span> age<span>,</span> job</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>"Hi, I'm "</span> <span>+</span> name <span>+</span> <span>". I'm "</span> <span>+</span> age <span>+</span> <span>" years old and work as a "</span> <span>+</span> job <span>+</span> <span>"."</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>There are a few unideal things for me:</p><ol><li>There are 4 separate strings.</li><li>It’s hard for me to read. Having random spaces within the strings makes it a harder for me to visualize.</li><li>If you want this string to be multiple lines, it becomes a nightmare. You have to end the string at the end of the line, add a plus sign, and then restart a string on the next line. Take a look at this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/6247331">StackOverflow</a> reply to see how unwieldy it can be.</li></ol><p>In ES6, template strings emerged. To start a template string, you use a backtick ` and start writing the string. Then, we want to inject some other JavaScript into the string. Here we add a dollar sign and starting curly brace. When you finish writing JavaScript logic, you close the curly brace. This formatting results in more readable code.</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>shortBio</span><span>(</span><span>name<span>,</span> age<span>,</span> job</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span><span>`</span><span>Hi, I'm </span><span><span>${</span>name<span>}</span></span><span>. I'm </span><span><span>${</span>age<span>}</span></span><span> years old and work as a </span><span><span>${</span>job<span>}</span></span><span>.</span><span>`</span></span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>Source: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals">Template Literals - MDN Docs</a></p><h2>Using the spread operator</h2><p>First, what is the spread operator? The spread operator “allows an iterable such as an array expression or string to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected, or an object expression to be expanded in places where zero or more key-value pairs (for object literals) are expected.” (Source: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax">Spread Syntax - MDN Docs</a>)</p><p>I’m sorry, what? What does that even mean?</p><p>In my own words, we are taking every item in an array and “expanding” it where the items in the array would work, but not the array itself.  You can also use the spread operator for every letter in a string, but I rarely use it this way.</p><p>In the more technical sense, let’s take this object:</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> person <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
 name<span>:</span> <span>'Lindsey'</span><span>,</span>
 age<span>:</span> <span>30</span><span>,</span>
 jobTitle<span>:</span> <span>'Senior UI Engineer'</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>And let’s use the <code>shortBio</code> function from the previous section to render a bit about me.</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>shortBio</span><span>(</span><span>name<span>,</span> age<span>,</span> job</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span><span>`</span><span>Hi, I'm </span><span><span>${</span>name<span>}</span></span><span>. I'm </span><span><span>${</span>age<span>}</span></span><span> years old and work as a </span><span><span>${</span>job<span>}</span></span><span>.</span><span>`</span></span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>And make it into an array using the <code>Object.values()</code> method to make it an array of all those values. <code>Object.values()</code> takes the values of every property in an object and adds it to a new array <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/values">MDN Docs</a></p><div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> personArr <span>=</span> Object<span>.</span><span>values</span><span>(</span>person<span>)</span></code></pre></div><p>This method will return an array that looks like this</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>[</span><span>"Lindsey"</span><span>,</span> <span>30</span><span>,</span> <span>"Senior UI Engineer"</span><span>]</span></code></pre></div><p>Then I can use the spread syntax to iterate every item in the array as each parameter.</p><p>Which would be the same as</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>shortBio</span><span>(</span>person<span>.</span>name<span>,</span> person<span>.</span>age<span>,</span> person<span>.</span>jobTitle<span>)</span></code></pre></div><p>We can also use the spread syntax to make a copy of an object.</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> lindsey <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>...</span>person<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>If you want to play around with this example, I’ve created a <a href="https://codepen.io/littlekope0903/pen/dyMywYv?editors=1011">CodePen</a>.</p><p>So why is this important? In a React component, we have a <code>props</code> object that gets passed in a parent component.</p><p>Consider we have a Page with a <code>Layout</code> Component that renders a <code>Bio</code>. The Bio component takes on a <code>name</code>, <code>age</code>, and <code>jobTitle</code> prop. If we are in that parent component and have an object handy (like the <code>person</code> object), we can “spread” it into the component. In this example, we will be spreading these props into the <code>Bio</code> component:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>BioPage</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span>
 <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Layout</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
  </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Bio</span></span> <span><span>{</span><span>...</span><span>person</span><span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>
 </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Layout</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span>)</span></code></pre></div><p>This would be equivalent to this:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>BioPage</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span>
 <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Layout</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
  </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Bio</span></span> <span>name</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>person<span>.</span>name<span>}</span></span> <span>age</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>person<span>.</span>age<span>}</span></span> <span>jobTitle</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>person<span>.</span>jobTitle<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>
 </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Layout</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span>)</span></code></pre></div><p>You can read more about how this works in the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html#spread-attributes">React Docs</a>.</p><h2>Understanding Arrow functions</h2><p>When defining a function, I’ve found arrow functions are the norm in React. I’m not saying you’ll never see the function keyword. I still see the function keyword from time to time. I recommend getting used to seeing arrow functions and understanding what you’re seeing. It’ll help you improve understanding React code, particularly with callbacks within <code>Array.prototype.map()</code> and <code>Array.prototype.filter()</code>, which we will discuss a bit later.</p><p>I’m not going to go over all the intricacies of arrow functions in depth. There are plenty of JavaScript bloggers who will do a much better job at that than I would. You can start off at the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions">MDN Docs</a> to see some of the motivations for why this was created. But again, I want you to know what you’re looking at.</p><h3>The syntax:</h3><p>Arrow functions are anonymous functions that you can store in a variable (what I frequently do).</p><p>You have the parentheses, where you have some optional parameters, an arrow that’s an equal sign and then a greater than sign (=&gt;), and then some curly braces.</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>someVarFunction</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>The parameters take on many formats, depending on the number of parameters you have. Here’s the quick cheat sheet:</p><ol><li>0 or more than one parameter = yes you need parentheses</li><li>1 parameter = no parentheses needed</li></ol><div data-language="js"><pre><code>
<span>const</span> <span>function</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  
<span>}</span>


<span>const</span> <span>function2</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>param1<span>,</span> param2</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  
<span>}</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>Understanding that I won’t see any parentheses if there’s only one parameter alleviated so much of my confusion. It helped me understand what I saw when I saw callbacks in the <code>.map()</code> method.</p><p>The first way to look at an arrow function is if you have an explicit return. Consider the below example. We have curly braces, some logic happening where we reformat the data and store it in a variable, and then returning some JSX.</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>renderComponent</span> <span>=</span> <span>content</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
 <span>const</span> data <span>=</span> <span>formatData</span><span>(</span>content<span>)</span>

 <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span> <span>className</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>wrapper<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
   </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Component</span></span> <span><span>{</span><span>...</span><span>data</span><span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>
  </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
 <span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>There is one of key part to notice. In this function, we are doing MORE than returning the component. We are formatting some data with something we pass in, and then we are returning a component with that new data.</p><p>But what if you don’t need to format any data, and you’re only returning one line of JSX? You can do that in one line, remove the <code>return</code> keyword, and the curly braces! This formatting is an <strong>implicit return</strong>. JavaScript knows when you format it this way that all you’re doing is returning something.</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>ParentComponent</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Component</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This syntax is saying, “Hey, your only job here is to return this single line component.”</p><p>You don’t see that very often in React. How often do you have a component that only returns one thing that neatly fits into one line of code? What you’ll see more often is an implicit return without curly braces or the return keyword, but wrapped in parentheses because it’s returning multiple lines of code.</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>ParentComponent</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span>
 <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span> <span>className</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>wrapper<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
  </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Component</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>
 </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span>)</span></code></pre></div><p>This syntax says, “Hey, your only job here is to return multiple lines of JSX.”</p><p>Once I understood the differences between the formatting, it became a lot clearer what I was looking at when I was reading the code.</p><h2>Understanding Destructuring</h2><p>Destructuring is a more straightforward way to unpack arrays or objects into unique variables.</p><p>Consider the object from the previous example:</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> person <span>=</span> <span>{</span>

	  <p><strong>tl;dr</strong> - I co-authored an O’Reilly book with my colleagues <a href="https://twitter.com/lak_gcp" target="_blank">Lak</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/munnm/" target="_blank">Mike</a>! You can <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/machine-learning-design/9781098115777/" target="_blank">order it here</a> and 100% of the royalties go to <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/" target="_blank">Girls Who Code</a>. This post is about the writing process.</p>

<h3 id="deciding-to-write">Deciding to write</h3>

<p>Back in January of this year, Lak graciously reached out to me asking if I was interested in co-writing an O’Reilly book on machine learning. As I read the email, my reaction was almost an immediate no because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It sounded like something that would take a lot of time.</li>
  <li>With a quickly evolving field like ML, wouldn’t a book be obsolete before it hit the shelves?</li>
</ul>

<p>I let Lak’s request sit in my inbox for a few days even though I was sure I had made up my mind, because saying no to projects is much harder than saying yes. A few days later on a long car ride with my fiancé, I mentioned the book offer in passing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“You have an opportunity to write a book and you’re saying <em>no</em>?” he said, nearly pulling off the road.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I suppose I had considered this offer as more of a <strong>burden</strong>, but from his perspective it was an <strong>opportunity</strong>. Ok, he wouldn’t be the one writing it, but he has <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Building-Embedded-Linux-Systems-Techniques-dp-0596529686/dp/0596529686" target="_blank">written</a> an O’Reilly book before!</p>

<p>It would no doubt be hard, but it also provided a chance to learn a lot along the way and have a book at the end of it. With his advice in mind, I decided to learn more about the book before saying no. The plan for the book was to catalog a series of patterns, each of which would outline a common challenge in ML and provide some approaches for solving it. I was intrigued, but some doubts started to creep in as I read through the pattern ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I was very familiar with some, but much less so with others. Didn’t I need to have all this knowledge in my head before writing for this to work?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why me? Why was I qualified to do this? Objectively, I have created a lot of ML content over the years to educate app developers, data scientists, and customers. I’d like to think I’m a decent writer, but a book? That seemed like a different beast, and I wasn’t sure I was the best person for the job.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There can always be a million reasons not to do something, but I ultimately decided to ignore them all and give it a try.</p>

<h3 id="starting-with-an-idea">Starting with an idea</h3>

<p>This happened before I joined the project, so I asked Lak what he did before reaching out to O’Reilly with the idea for the book. Publishers get cold proposals all the time, so it helps if you can clearly communicate what the book will be about and show that you know what you will be writing about.</p>

<p>In our case, Lak wrote a couple of blog posts on machine learning design patterns (<a href="https://medium.com/swlh/ml-design-pattern-1-transform-9e82ccbc3209">Transform</a> and <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/ml-design-pattern-2-checkpoints-e6ca25a4c5fe">Checkpoints</a>) to gauge whether readers were interested in this idea. They were, but he realized that readers’ interest was very much in how to implement, adapt, and extend these patterns. He also did a talk on the topic at a couple of conferences and discovered that conference attendees were a bit different – they needed a clear explanation of the reason to use the pattern and a prescriptive approach to addressing the problem. In other words, readers who knew the pattern beforehand wanted a technical manual, while conference attendees (who were being introduced to the pattern for the first time) wanted to know why the pattern matters. This helped him write the next set of blog posts, where he started with a crisp problem statement, a canonical solution, and a couple of variations.</p>

<p>Once he had a good idea of how to communicate ML design patterns, Lak reached out to an O’Reilly editor with a short message:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have a <a href="https://link.medium.com/7BSgxXdts1">list</a> of about 20 machine learning design patterns that I want to write about. Do you think they would do well as a book? If so, I can see about finding a co-author who would be interested in expanding on these…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The editor replied that since O’Reilly has a solid franchise in design patterns, he was very interested. He was assigned an acquisitions editor who would work with us to craft the actual proposal. And that’s when Lak reached out to me to see if I was interested in co-authoring.</p>

<h3 id="building-an-outline">Building an outline</h3>

<p>I knew nothing about writing a book going into this, and my first question was: how will we split up the work? Will we alternate paragraphs, sections, chapters, words? I’m sure this varies for every book with multiple authors. We decided to split work by sections. In our case, each section was a design pattern and each chapter had 3-6 patterns. We started by making an outline, with an initial list of 20 patterns.</p>

<p>Chapters in our book are organized by different phases in a typical machine learning workflow. We first determined the topic for each chapter, and then came up with the patterns we wanted to be included in it. In the outline, each pattern had a 1-2 sentence description. It took a few iterations of adding and removing patterns and moving some between chapters before we had something we were happy with. We finished this process with a total of 30 patterns split across 6 chapters, with 2 additional chapters for an intro and conclusion. This brought us to the end of February.</p>

<h3 id="submitting-a-book-proposal">Submitting a book proposal</h3>

<p>The first step in the publishing process for many books is writing a proposal and submitting it to an acquisitions editor. Acquisitions editors are in charge of reviewing proposals, providing feedback, and deciding whether a proposal will move to the next stage in the approval process. They also work on overall content strategy, deciding which topics they want to cover. Sometimes people reach out to them cold, and other times these editors may proactively reach out to prospective authors.</p>

<p>The proposal (which includes the outline, but also comparisons with existing titles, and who the intended audience is) went through a few rounds of feedback (which is where I joined the process), including detailed technical feedback, before getting approved. The acquisitions editor focuses on acquiring new content, so once ours got approved we moved to the next step in the process which was working with a development editor. This person was our main point of contact throughout the writing process – more on that in the next section.</p>

<p>I recently had a great conversation with our acquisitions editor, where I learned a lot more about the publishing industry and how this all works. One thing from this conversation especially stood out: she mentioned she <em>rarely</em> receives a cold book proposal from a woman, and she gets many cold proposals each day. I’m sharing this data (with her permission) in hopes that it encourages more women with book ideas to just go for it. Reach out! You’ve got nothing to lose. If your proposal gets rejected, you’ll likely still get some feedback in the process.</p>

<h3 id="writing-time">Writing time</h3>

<p>I assumed we’d begin at the beginning, but we started by writing Chapter 2. Chapter 1 didn’t have any patterns – it was meant to be an overview of the entire book, explain our goals, and set the stage for the intended audience. Without anything written yet this would be hard to write, so we got right into patterns by starting with Chapter 2. Before sitting down to write this chapter, we took our short Chapter 2 outline and worked together to expand it. This is something we did before every chapter, with the goals of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ensuring the three of us had the same understanding of each pattern</li>
  <li>Agreeing on what should and shouldn’t be covered</li>
  <li>Splitting up the writing by pattern</li>
</ul>

<p>Early on in the outline process, we had decided each pattern should follow the same structure. If you’re reading the book, you’ll notice that every pattern is split into the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Problem</strong>: describes the ML challenge a pattern addresses</li>
  <li><strong>Solution</strong>: describes one approach to solving the problem, including code snippets and recommended tooling for solving the problem</li>
  <li><strong>Tradeoffs and Alternatives</strong>: extended discussion on the pattern, including tools not covered in the Solution section, potential gotchas, and related solutions</li>
</ul>

<p>Having a structure for each section was extremely useful in ensuring consistency throughout the book.</p>

<p>After outlining Chapter 2 in detail, I had two patterns assigned to me and it was finally time to write. I wish I could tell you this is the part where I sat down at my desk, closed the door, and let the insights flow onto the page. This is how I’d always imagined book writing went. For better or worse (and maybe because the outside world went into chaos while this was happening), my process went more like this:</p>

<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>My writing process:</p><p>* Write 2 sentences<br>* My glasses are splotchy, where are the lens wipes?<br>* Edit the last sentence I wrote<br>* Research the latest keyboards<br>* Write another 2 sentences<br>* Refill water, clean the counter<br>* Stare at my now perfect paragraph<br>* Open Twitter</p></div>— Sara Robinson (@SRobTweets) <a href="https://twitter.com/SRobTweets/status/1244312122613473281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 29, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p>It wasn’t a very efficient way to start, but it got the job done and over time my process improved. I also quickly debunked my initial question:</p>

<p><em>Didn’t I need to have all this knowledge in my head before writing for this to work?</em></p>

<p>Even if I did have experience implementing a particular pattern, I couldn’t write only what I already knew. I had to do a considerable amount of research before I started writing the bulk of each pattern to find out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What writing on this topic already existed?</li>
  <li>Are there any important research papers that cover this?</li>
  <li>What tools are available for solving this pattern?</li>
</ul>

<p>With all this research I started to have some doubts. If I was just collating information from various sources, was I providing anything useful? Then I thought about some of my favorite non-fiction books and realized most of them work by:</p>

<p><em>Presenting existing, relevant information + adding a unique angle</em></p>

<p>I’ve met with a lot of customers and seen production use of ML, and I’ve also built demos to help developers understand how to use different ML tools. Turns out I did have a unique angle! Before writing I did a lot of reading to make sure I fully understood the ins and outs of the pattern. Then I had enough information to write. I still wouldn’t say the words flowed at this point, but I did slowly get …</p></div></div>

They are so dense. I used to think academic papers were full of jargon until I read some technical patents.</p><h3 id="the-process">The Process</h3><p>When you visit <a href="https://www.spotifycodes.com/">Spotify codes</a> and input a Spotify URI, a “media reference” is created by Spotify. This media reference is 37 bits long and is the key that links a barcode to a given URI. The media reference may just be the hash of an incrementing index. After extracting a media reference from a barcode, you check with Spotify’s database (a look-up table) to determine what URI it corresponds to.

</code></pre></div><h3 id="forward-error-correction">Forward error correction</h3><p>Next <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code#Forward_error_correction">forward error correction</a> (FEC) is used to add some <strong>redundancy</strong> to the code. This makes the decoding process more reliable. Decoding Spotify codes involves going from analog (bar lengths) to digital (media reference), so it is a good candidate for this error correction.</p><blockquote><p>The fundamental principle of [error correction] is to add redundant bits in order to help the decoder to find out the true message that was encoded by the transmitter.</p></blockquote><p>A simple example of error correction would be to replicate each bit twice. So instead of sending <code>1</code>, you would send <code>111</code>. When that triplet is sent across a “noisy” communication channel, some of the bits could get flipped. But since there are 2 redundant bits, the receiver can guess what the value was meant to be:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Triplet received</th><th>Interpreted as</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>000</td><td>0 (error-free)</td></tr><tr><td>001</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>010</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>111</td><td>1 (error-free)</td></tr><tr><td>110</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>101</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>011</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The patents don’t specify what forward error correction schema Spotify uses, but they do say that they add 15 bits at this step. The code rate of an error correction scheme is the ratio of the information bits to the total encoded bit length. Spotify adds 15 bits to the 45 bit code, so the code rate is <code>45 / 60 = 0.75</code>. This code rate is high (close to 1) meaning it is fairly weak. It facilitates a limited amount of error correction, but that is okay. If you are sending a message to a deep space probe you want a very strong code. A Spotify code is pretty low risk: it’s easy to ping the server a few times if you decode the wrong media reference.</p><p>The total forward error corrected code is 60 bits long, which is the exact amount of information that can be encoded in the 20 octals (bar heights) in the Spotify barcode!</p><p>The patents do mention that Spotify uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_decoder">Viterbi algorithm</a> to decode the media reference from the forward error corrected code. I won’t go into it here, but that algorithm uses the redundant bits from the forward error correction to determine the best guess of the actual media reference.</p><h3 id="gray-code">Gray Code</h3><p>I really like this part of the Spotify codes.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code">Gray code</a> is an alternative way to represent a binary number. If you look closely at the following table, you will see that Gray code works by changing only one bit at a time.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Decimal</th><th>Binary</th><th>Gray</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>000</td><td>000</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>001</td><td>001</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>010</td><td>011</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>011</td><td>010</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>100</td><td>110</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>101</td><td>111</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>110</td><td>101</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>111</td><td>100</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Why does Spotify use Gray code? What is wrong with normal binary representation of the code?</p><p>The difference between 3 and 4 in Gray code is only 1 bit (<code>010 -&gt; 110</code>). In normal binary representation, that difference is 3 bits (<code>100 -&gt; 011</code>). When going from analog (the height of a given bar) to binary, using Gray codes reduces the number of bits that are “wrong” if we calculate the wrong height.</p><p>If the height of a bar is supposed to be 3, but we calculate that it is 3.51 and we round up to 4, the binary representation of that number in Gray code will only be off by one bit. <strong>This makes the forward error …</strong></p></div></article></div></div>

They replaced it with… something I was sure I had seen before.</p><figure id="w-node-3786e8b28af7-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51cf030355219306e8edf_revolout-logo-old-new.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The previous Revolut logo had a unique font, a recognizable color gradient, and it was slanted. If you were to put 100 financial or tech companies’ logos next to each other, the old logo would be easy to find at a glance.</p><p>If you put the new one in the same 100 logos pile, it would drown in the sea of sameness.</p><h2>Sans serif invasion</h2><p>There is a trend in logo design that started around 2017-2018. It’s as if many companies decided that being unique was a handicap and that it was better to be like everyone else. Or at least, that’s how it feels to me.</p><p>The trend started with fashion logos. Many iconic fashion companies ditched their recognizable logos and switched to a bland and very similar version of a sans serif font.</p><p>The technology sector followed soon after.</p><figure id="w-node-519323ea72d8-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51d96d2b8eae559c71d90_tech-fashion-logos-sans-serif.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>All the quirks, peculiarities, and idiosyncrasies of both tech and fashion logos were dropped and replaced with a simple sans serif font.</p><p>It looked like two huge industries decided to use the services of one designer, and not a particularly inventive one at that.</p><p>The tech industry is in slightly better shape because they didn’t go all in, and at least they kept the colors. With the colors, there’s at least <em>some </em>variability:</p><figure id="w-node-1efc3a7d060a-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51dc4daea171c45c758db_tech-logos-color.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Variability in new fashion logos, in full color:</p><figure id="w-node-b31dea70a84e-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51dd2ab19486dcee8bcea_fashion-logos-color.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Serif and sans serif—what’s the difference?</h3><p>First, what’s the difference between serif and sans serif fonts?</p><figure id="w-node-7e6a894d6cf3-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51e06556217fb8d809964_serif-sans-serif.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The small features on the ends of strokes in some fonts are known as ‘serifs’.</p><p>Fonts without those small features are called ‘sans serif’ (<em>‘sans’</em> means <em>‘without’</em> in French).</p><p>Sans serifs are missing a few of the typical anatomical features (serifs, spurs, swashes and other flourishes). Because of that, this typeface lacks the level of detail and design differentiation that serif typefaces can have.</p><p>While the simplicity of sans serif fonts makes them readable and versatile, it has its drawbacks. Without additional details and features, sans serif fonts have far fewer options for differentiation. While you can vary things like the height, weight, and slant, sans serif fonts simply have fewer features to work with than their more intricate fellow fonts.</p><p>This results in logos that look very similar. Gone are all the elaborate little details of the previous era.</p><p>When you add brands’ tendency to go black-and-white, you end up with a sea of logo sameness which is the opposite of what logos should be.</p><p>The purpose of a logo is to be instantly recognizable, different, memorable, and, if possible, to refer to the brand’s values. Blending into everyone else’s achieves none of these things.</p><h3>Sans serif history</h3><p>Sans serif lettering and fonts, first created in 1816, were popular for their clarity and legibility at a distance in advertising and display use when printed very large or small.</p><p>Because sans serif type was often used for headings and commercial printing, many early sans serif designs did not feature lowercase letters.</p><p>Simple sans serif capitals, without the use of lowercase, became very common in uses such as tombstones of the Victorian period in Britain.</p><p>Also, a significant reason for serif faces in the older days of imprecise letterpress and less consistent paper surface sizing was to compensate for ink spread and aberrations. Serifs on the fonts helped in cases where corners would otherwise fail to fully imprint.</p><h2>Possible reasons</h2><p>What are the possible reasons for this sans serif trend taking over? And why do hardly any of them matter?</p><h3>‘Modern utility’</h3><p>Branding specialists point to the practical benefits of what they call the ‘modern utility’ of sans serif typefaces. Cleaner and more legible, they are better suited to a variety of media and work particularly well online. The purity of these fonts allows the brands to be an empty vessel, ready to accommodate rapidly shifting trends.</p><p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> That may be true, but isn’t the whole value of a brand to <em>not</em> be an empty vessel? The big brands have worked decades for their identity and recognition, only to throw most of it away?</p><h3>Simplification</h3><p>Another reason cited by brand specialists is that it’s a natural step for brands to take as they grow from scrappy startups into established brands. The goals have shifted from making noise and standing out to being a trusted, dependable part of people’s everyday lives. That heartfelt personality and idiosyncrasy that defined a brand as they started out, and won over their early adopters, can be a limitation as they aim for broad appeal and bigger revenue.</p><p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> Simplification as a reason to blend in for broad appeal? I don’t buy it. Logos should be simple, yes, but they should be simple in a memorable way. Think more in terms of Nike swoosh (simple, memorable),&nbsp; and less in a one-size-fits-all sans serif font.</p><h3>Brands are more than logos now</h3><p>People at the head of these powerful brands know that they are not defined by their logo anymore but by the product or service they provide. They are strong thanks to what they allow <em>you</em> to do with them.</p><p>Before, logo designers would look for a ‘concept’ when designing a logo. That is not necessary anymore: <em>The brand is the concept</em>.</p><p>Their thinking goes that logos may look similar, but what they offer is completely different and effective, and that’s what ultimately counts for the consumer.</p><p>As some brands become words (or even better, verbs) in our daily language (to Google, to Uber, to Skype), they have a lesser need for a recognizable logo. Many of those brands now spend on designing custom typefaces instead of logos: a custom typeface becomes their recognizable voice on every platform or device.</p><p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> Some big brands may indeed have a lesser need for a very distinct logo but that doesn't mean that they should get rid of an important differentiator. You don’t see Nike replacing their swoosh logo with sans serif <strong>NIKE</strong> text. If you have something valuable that you <em>can</em> live without, it doesn’t mean that you <em>must</em>.</p><h3>Readability</h3><p>One of the main reasons for the sans serif logo trend is readability. Especially on mobile, but everywhere else as well: from huge billboards to tiny footer links at the bottom of mobile websites.</p><p>After all, that’s the very reason why sans serif fonts were invented: for better readability in advertising headlines.</p><p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> Readability is obviously important. Mobile too—it’s where everything happens nowadays. But this is becoming less of an issue with improvements in technologies like retina displays and 4k screens becoming popular.</p><figure id="w-node-38988d1753c7-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51e96e07b893538cbb00b_sans-serif-logos-on-iphone-11.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Here’s how a bunch of logos looks on my iPhone 11</figcaption></figure><p>If it’s easy to fit 30 decently looking logos on one-third of a phone screen, it should be trivial to make one logo, however quirky, look perfect on mobile.</p><p>Revolut seems to be torn here.

Don’t throw away what the brand has been working on for decades.</p><p>Otherwise, you may end up in a situation where you could slap any logo on any product and hardly anyone would notice a difference:</p><figure id="w-node-1f59c0278e26-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51fac8ae18b830d998184_sans-serif-bags.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>One of these bags is real.</figcaption></figure></div></div>]]>

<p>This week on The Weekly Digs: Is an “Eviction Tsumami” looming in 2021? The U.S. economy has only recovered half the 22 million jobs lost during 2020; meanwhile, stimulus checks and support for unemployed is drying up fast. On another note, the housing market in the U.S. continues to be red hot. This and more, below the fold.</p>

<p>If you never heard of <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a>, it is a very
handy general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder. Besides command-line, it is
also a popular Vim plugin. If you’re wondering, a fuzzy finder is a tool that
helps you find what you’re looking for without needing to write the full name.</p>
<p>As a Vim user, I am always obsessed with doing a thing in the fewer keystrokes
as possible. Having the ability to open a file in Vim quickly is super useful to
me, and you will see why soon.</p>
<p>But, did you know that this fuzzy finder - fzf, can do a lot more than you
thought? Oh yeah, the fuzzy search is just the tip of the iceberg here.
It is like wine; the more you leave it on your computer, the more flavor and
sweetness it accumulates from that command-line. Let’s dive in and find out how
you can increase your productivity with fzf inside Vim.</p>
<h2 id="starting-off"><a href="#starting-off" aria-label="starting off permalink"></a>Starting off</h2>
<p>To be able to do the things I am doing in this blog post, you will need a couple of
plugins. If you’re not using <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug">vim-plug</a>
for installing other Vim plugins, then you are missing out. Go ahead and set
that up, and you can add the following:</p>
<div data-language="vim"><pre><code>Plug <span>'junegunn/fzf'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>'do'</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span> <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> fzf#<span>install</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span> <span>}</span>
Plug <span>'junegunn/fzf.vim'</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then, install these plugins with <code>:PlugInstall</code> or use this shortcut I use:</p>
<div data-language="vim"><pre><code>
nnoremap <span>&lt;</span><span>silent</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;</span>leader<span>&gt;</span><span>1</span> <span>:</span><span>source</span> ~<span>/</span><span>.</span>vimrc \| <span>:</span>PlugInstall<span>&lt;</span>CR<span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can then press your leader key and number 1 to install and apply all the
changes in your <code>.vimrc</code>.</p>
<p>Now, to the coolest part!</p>
<h2 id="the-magic-finder"><a href="#the-magic-finder" aria-label="the magic finder permalink"></a>The magic finder</h2>
<p>Everything we need is installed, and we can get to the practical part. As we
said before, fzf is a fuzzy finder, a file selector if you want. Let’s try
out that feature right off. To get the file picker opened, type <code>:Files</code> in
a Vim session. You should get something like this:</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>

<p>What happened is fzf opened a small window at the bottom showing files in our
directory. If you look at the newly opened window, you will see the list of
files, and the <strong>preview</strong> of the currently selected file on the right
of the window. So you got your files on the left and their preview on the
right. Are you already impressed as I was? Cool, let’s move on.</p>
<p>If you don’t like the window, you can fine-tune easily with fzf customization
options. But if you want any fzf command in fullscreen, you can append <code>!</code> at
the end of the command. For example, let’s do <code>:Files!</code> and you should see the
following:</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="Open :Files! in fullscreen" title="Open :Files! in fullscreen" src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/71e5fe325ab9a32de02f08763196d067/fcda8/open-files-fullscreen.png" srcset="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/71e5fe325ab9a32de02f08763196d067/12f09/open-files-fullscreen.png 148w,

    </span></p>
<p>But, I don’t use <code>:Files</code> that often. As a matter of fact, I only use
<code>:GFiles</code> command by fzf. <code>:GFiles</code> will open a file picker for your Git files,
ignoring ones in the <code>.gitignore</code>. Using it is pretty neat in JavaScript
projects where <code>node_modules</code> files tend to kill the mood when running
<code>:Files</code>. Let us compare the same project with <code>:Files</code> and <code>:GFiles</code> commands:</p>
<p><span>

<p>
  Yuck! `node_modules` everywhere.
</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>

<p>
  Ah, that's better.
</p>
<p>Notice the difference? It feels like I just dropped a heavy backpack off my
back by not having those <code>node_modules/**</code> files popping up. Anyway, let’s see
this bad boy in action when searching for files to edit.</p>
<p><img src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/5a84a887e91f3aea28f8692bcc518fc0/gfiles-in-action.gif" alt=":GFiles in action GIF"></p>
<p>That’s it, and it is looking pretty good. Only thing I dislike about using <code>:GFiles</code> is
that it won’t include your new files unless you add them to the Git index with
<code>git add</code>. Also, I’d like some syntax highlighting to be there out of the box
when previewing files, but we will cover that in another blog post. In the
meantime, consider subscribing to the <a href="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/improving-vim-workflow-with-fzf/newsletter">newsletter</a> to get similar
posts like this.</p>
<p>To sum up, fzf is useful and quick as a flash when searching for files. And, as
Drake below says, resort to using <code>:GFiles</code> or try to configure <code>:Files</code> to
ignore certain files and paths.</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="Drake fzf choices - go with :GFiles instead of :Files" title="Drake fzf choices - go with :GFiles instead of :Files" src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/643d1c18c9fd8e42484fcaffaa4d99eb/41099/drake-no-files-yes-gfiles.jpg" srcset="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/643d1c18c9fd8e42484fcaffaa4d99eb/a80bd/drake-no-files-yes-gfiles.jpg 148w,

    </span></p>
<p>To make this super fast for you, you can create a shortcut. I open <code>:GFiles</code>
with CTRL + p. I got left with this in my muscle memory from the legendary
<a href="https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim">ctrlp</a> plugin. To have <code>:GFiles</code> wired
up, so it opens with CTRL + p, you can add the following to your <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>
<div data-language="vim"><pre><code>nnoremap <span>&lt;</span>C<span>-</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>GFiles<span>&lt;</span>Cr<span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="speed-search-your-project"><a href="#speed-search-your-project" aria-label="speed search your project permalink"></a>Speed search your project</h2>
<p>What blows my mind from time to time is other things you can do with fzf in
Vim. For example, you can use
<a href="https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher">The Silver Searcher</a>
or
<a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a> with fzf.
To search with The Silver Searcher, type <code>:Ag</code> and a term you want to
search. And, to search with ripgrep, type <code>:Rg</code> and the term. Of course, to
have these commands work, you need the respective libraries installed in your
environment.</p>
<p>I use <code>:Ag</code>, and it performs wonderfully. It is wired to CTRL + g for me,
so I access it quickly. To have this or a similar setup, add the following
to your <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>

<p>The shortcut above will open up the <code>:Ag</code> search windows at the bottom with the
preview of the file. I find it super helpful and quick when I need to search
for a word in a project. Let’s see <code>:Ag</code> in action.</p>
<p><img src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/0c1dc6a8efd411223955dd76a20783a6/ag-in-action.gif" alt=":Ag in action"></p>
<h2 id="buffed-up"><a href="#buffed-up" aria-label="buffed up permalink"></a>Buffed up</h2>
<p>You can search all your open buffers with fzf by typing <code>:Buffers</code>. I keep a
shortcut at my leader key (the Space key, BTW) + b. Like so:</p>
<div data-language="vim"><pre><code>nnoremap <span>&lt;</span><span>silent</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;</span>leader<span>&gt;</span><span>l</span> <span>:</span>Buffers<span>&lt;</span>CR<span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>With that command, you will get a buffers explorer where you can quickly switch
between open files. I hope that helps. Let’s see how it looks:</p>
<p><span>

<p>If you are a fan of drawing inside the terminal, then you are going to love this one.
Try typing <code>:Commits</code> if you are using the <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive">vim-fugitive</a> plugin.
The plugin by itself is a pretty awesome wrapper around Git, just if you
never want to leave the warmth of your Vim session. Anyways, if you type
<code>:Commits</code> you should get a tree of your project commits like so:</p>

<p>Pretty cool, huh? You can scroll up and down and checkout changes at each
commit. You can even enter the commit you are interested in and check out

<p>Vim ecosystem has a lot of plugins, and fzf is one great plugin. You can search
for files with <code>:GFiles</code> and <code>:Files</code>. If you want to do a text search, try using
<code>:Ag</code> or <code>:Rg</code>, which use The Silver Searcher and ripgrep, respectively. Tired of
slow switching between open buffers - try out <code>:Buffers</code>. Or, if you want some
nice commit information, do <code>:Commits</code>.</p>
<p>These are just a couple of commands and tricks fzf has, be sure to check out
their README for more information. Also, stay tuned for more posts like these

<p><img src="http://seenaburns.com/assets/posts/debugging-electron-memory-usage/activity-monitor-horror.png" alt="Electron memory usage"></p>

<p>This past week I was working on an image browser I’ve been building in Electron, namely trying to
figure out why it would hold onto a bunch of memory.</p>

<p>I use this browser for reference images – high res illustrations, renders or photographs – I’ve
collected. As you navigate directories, the browser loads all the images into a mosaic tile display.
And because this is local, it’s snappy.</p>

<p><img src="http://seenaburns.com/assets/posts/debugging-electron-memory-usage/image-browser-screenshot.jpg" alt="Image Browser Screenshot"></p>

<p>The problem is, when I would throw in a search that pulls up all the images, the RSS memory shoots
up: from a 300MB steady state to ~800MB-1GB. Navigating away doesn’t flush this memory. More notable
context: this application has very little state (UI state + list of current images), the images are
the only thing of relevance.</p>

<p>The cheap answer: it’s Electron. And I gave up a few times along the way: there are many layers of
huge technologies, doing their own optimizations and, not being familiar with any of them, makes it
difficult to reason about what’s happening.</p>


<p>The first thing I did: open the developer tools and try everything!</p>

<p><a href="http://seenaburns.com/assets/posts/debugging-electron-memory-usage/composite-dev-tools-full.png">
<img src="http://seenaburns.com/assets/posts/debugging-electron-memory-usage/composite-dev-tools.png" alt="Composite Dev Tools Summary">
</a></p>

<p>Click to enlarge</p>

<p>Things I’ve learned here:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Memory Patterns</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Memory doesn’t grow indefinitely with use - not a memory leak.</li>
      <li>The activity monitor shows the app holds onto memory, even when navigating way from
searches/directories with images.</li>
      <li>If I refresh with <code>cmd-R</code>, everything is flushed, including memory used.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Heap</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>The javascript heap is “only” 7MB, including what seems to be closures, compiled
code, and representations of DOM elements.</li>
      <li>Allocations shows the largest object types have barely a few megabytes</li>
      <li>Between loading a heavy directory, I see kilobytes of allocations, not megabytes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Layers have ~150MB? What’s up with that</li>
  <li>Site data is all empty, clearing does nothing</li>
  <li>Frames has reference to every image I’ve loaded so far?</li>
</ul>

<p>My hunch is it’s a caching issue or unreleased garbage. Navigating across pages retains the memory,
it grows as images load, but levels off. Given this is a loosely coded prototype, I’m skeptical I
haven’t been shooting myself in the foot without realizing it.</p>

<p>I spent a lot of time hunting dead ends, thinking it was me retaining references without realizing
it. For example: why don’t listeners drop when navigating away? Am I handling onclick functions
correctly? Maybe, because I’m throwing closures at every problem, I’m creating lots of compile code
junk. No luck varying my code however.</p>

<h2 id="processmemoryusage-forced-gc-globalgc">process.memoryUsage, forced gc (global.gc)</h2>
<p>Here I looked into trying to force a GC to see what was being retained.</p>

<p>This requires <code>--expose-gc</code> to be enabled, e.g. by running <code>electron --js-flags="--expose-gc"</code>, and
then I can add the following to the renderer:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>logBytes</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>],</span> <span>x</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>/</span> <span>(</span><span>1000.0</span><span>*</span><span>1000</span><span>),</span> <span>"MB"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>function</span> <span>getMemory</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>Object</span><span>.</span><span>entries</span><span>(</span><span>process</span><span>.</span><span>memoryUsage</span><span>()).</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>logBytes</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>setInterval</span><span>(</span><span>getMemory</span><span>,</span> <span>1000</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Showing</p>

<div><div><pre><code>rss       859.414528 MB
heapTotal  13.651968 MB
heapUsed    7.385920 MB
external  142.377168 MB
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is another view at the JS heap really, which we yet again see is relatively tiny. Nevertheless,
I tried a periodic forced garbage collection:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>gc</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>global</span><span>.</span><span>gc</span><span>()</span>
  <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"gc"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>setInterval</span><span>(</span><span>gc</span><span>,</span> <span>10000</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This dropped down the heap (in one attempt from 17MB to 10MB), but otherwise no effect. I think
between this, <code>process.memoryUsage()</code> and the allocations we can have a good sense the problem is
not the js heap, or unretained references.</p>

<h2 id="sessionclearcache">Session.clearCache</h2>
<p>I also found a suggestion from another user with image caching problems to use <code>clearCache</code>, which
lead me to running the following on the main process (after creating the window):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>remote</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'remote'</span><span>)</span>
<span>function</span> <span>clearCache</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>remote</span><span>.</span><span>getCurrentWindow</span><span>().</span><span>webContents</span><span>.</span><span>session</span><span>.</span><span>clearCache</span><span>(</span><span>function</span><span>(){</span>
    <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"Cache Cleared"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>})</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>setInterval</span><span>(</span><span>clearCache</span><span>,</span> <span>10000</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Which had zero effect. Likewise using <code>session.clearStorageData()</code> had no effect.</p>

<p>Looking at the documentation for
<a href="https://electronjs.org/docs/api/session">session</a> shows it looks it is a property of
<a href="https://electronjs.org/docs/api/web-contents">WebContents</a>, which renders and controls the
webpages. Even though that seems promising, <code>session</code> “Manage browser sessions, cookies, cache,
proxy settings, etc.”, which sounds much more like the context for web requests (like login session
in cookies?), and not rendering.</p>

<p>This is confirmed by the <a href="https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/atom/browser/api/atom_api_session.cc">electron source for
session</a>
which points to the <a href="https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/net/http/http_cache.h?dr=CSs&amp;l=59">chromium source for
HttpCache</a>, where the
caching logic follows <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234">RFC 7234</a>: HTTP/1.1 Request/Response
Caching.</p>

<p>I’m not totally sure this caching excludes images, but in my case, files are being read from disk,
so in retrospect, it makes sense I didn’t see a difference from calling these methods.</p>

<h2 id="external-memory">External Memory</h2>

<p>At this point, I wanted to know what was up with the 142MB of external memory from
<code>process.MemoryUsage()</code>. From the <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/process.html">nodejs documentation</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>heapTotal</strong> and <strong>heapUsed</strong> refer to V8’s memory usage. <strong>external</strong> refers to the memory usage
of C++ objects bound to JavaScript objects managed by V8.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps the open files, like images, were being buffered? Maybe this reference was held open because
of something in chromium, like those frames in the dev tools that had the full image.</p>

<p>I took at look at what options are available for memory under <code>node --v8-options</code>, and eventually
turned on <code>--trace_gc</code> and <code>--trace_gc_verbose</code> to get this log:</p>

<p>My impression here is <strong>used</strong> refers to currently live (not garbage), <strong>available</strong> is something
about available virtual memory address space, and <strong>committed</strong> is what has already been requested
of the address space.</p>

<p>The things that stick out to me here:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All spaces (mostly driven by old space) continues to grow (larger than my previous heap measures?)</li>
  <li>External memory jumps up and then back down</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus began the Googling. From a link I comment on a github issue (which I sadly cannot find anymore), I learned
RSS is a bad measure, allocators try not to  return memory back to the OS when possible (this makes
sense if requesting memory is so expensive). <a href="http://jayconrod.com/posts/55/a-tour-of-v8-garbage-collection">A tour of V8: Garbage
Collection</a> was helpful here. Amongst
many other things, it mentions V8 lazily sweeps:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All this memory doesn’t necessarily have to be freed up right away though, and delaying the
sweeping won’t really hurt anything. So rather than sweeping all pages at the same time, the
garbage collector sweeps pages on an as-needed basis until all pages have been swept.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I resigned to believing that these images get buffered in external memory, V8 freely takes as much
memory as the OS will let it even if it is for garbage, and then even when cleaning up garbage, it
does not release requested memory back to the OS.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> In hindsight, now that I know what was actually wrong, I think it’s fair to question these
very hand-wavy assumptions.</p>

<h2 id="reading-the-documentation">Reading the Documentation</h2>

<p>A few weeks passed and I came back to the problem, with this nagging feeling that I didn’t really
understand what was happening. After many failed attempts at trying to get
<a href="https://github.com/bnoordhuis/node-heapdump">node-heapdump</a> set up, I did another sweep of Googling
for similar problems, leading me to read various pages of the <a href="https://electronjs.org/docs/api">available Electron
APIs</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I dug into the on-disk storage to see if there was any disk cache that was getting pulled into
memory.</li>
  <li>For a brief moment, I thought <a href="https://electronjs.org/docs/api/native-image">NativeImage</a> might be
an optimization for my use case, instead of <code>file://</code> references.</li>
  <li>I …</li></ul></div></div>

After a search request in Google Play, users see only an app icon and title for most apps; they can see screenshots only after they go to the app page. However, if your app has a strong brand, users can see the first three screenshots or a video right away. The Google Play approach to popular apps copies the way how the App Store shows all apps in search results.<br></p></div> </div></div></div></div></div><div id="rec201774210" data-record-type="106" data-bg-color="#161818"><!-- T004 --><div><div> <div><div field="text"><p>An icon is the face of your app and brand. It's important<strong> not to overload it with small details </strong>and make it easily readable on a screen of any size. Also, it's a good idea to research your competitors and pick something different from them to stand out in a search request. For example, a painful amount of pdf reader apps mimic the Adobe Acrobat colour scheme: a white object on the red background. As a result, when someone searches "pdf viewer", they see an endless list of similar red-and-white icons.<br></p></div></div></div></div></div><div id="rec201774329" data-record-type="239" data-bg-color="#161818"><!-- T210 --><div><div><div> <div> <div field="descr"><p>Use large font size and elements</p></div> </div> <div><div field="text"><div data-customstyle="yes"><p>Regarding screenshots, the main rule is similar: all elements should be big enough so a user easily understands what an app is about. Remember that an extremely tiny number of users open full-size images, I doubt they amount even to 1%. Also, you can highlight the most important UI elements.</p><p>Another vital thing is <strong>phrases</strong>. First, you should use them. As I said earlier, users don't read descriptions so title and screenshots are their main sources of information about your app. Second, it's better to tell users how your app can help them instead of listing features. And again, make your visuals differ from competitors, especially in the App Store as users see both icons and screenshots there.</p></div></div> </div></div></div></div></div><div id="rec201774678" data-record-type="106" data-bg-color="#161818"><!-- T004 --><div><div> <div><div field="text"><div data-customstyle="yes"><p>Speaking of videos, they're tricky.

Videos play automatically in the App Store by default and should be clicked on to start playing in Google Play. The video preview takes the place of a first screenshot on the app page. I'd say only a preview for Google Play requires optimization: App Store users won't likely see it anyway. </p><p>For video previews, you can follow the same recommendations as for screenshots. There's one more addition for Google Play: keep in mind that a "play" button will hide the centre of a preview.

They can be accompanied by reviews where users describe what they like or don't like about your app. </p><p> It's recommended to keep the rating at least as high as <strong>4.5</strong>. This is a multi-step and ongoing process: you need to enhance your app, build your brand and connect with users both inside and outside the app. </p><p> Unlike text and graphics, you have much less control over ratings and reviews. But it's a great channel to receive feedback: you can analyse what irritates people, gather their feature requests and — most importantly — communicate with users, answering to their reviews. In result, your app rating can increase. </p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="rec201775586" data-record-type="239" data-bg-color="#161818"><!-- T210 --><div><div><div> <div> <div field="descr"><p>Negative reviews aren't a catastrophe — a user can change their opinion about your app</p></div> </div> <div><div field="text"><div data-customstyle="yes"><p>Now, most companies don't answer to reviews though it's one of few opportunities to persuade a user they need to change a negative rating. You can send a user a message that a bug was fixed, a feature added, or any other reason has disappeared. If you're lucky, they'll update their review and give your app a better rating. </p><p> Of course, there's a reason why most companies prefer communicating with users through customer support. App store messages are more cumbersome than emails and messengers we're so used to: for example, it's almost impossible to receive more information from a user that reported an issue. Some ASO platforms help to work with reviews but still don't eliminate all downsides. Perhaps, we'll see a more comfortable way to communicate in both the App Store and Google Play in the future. </p><p> Also, you can reset your app rating in the App Store, uploading a new app version. This feature isn't available in Google Play —instead, their rating algorithm is skewed towards more recent reviews. To add, Google Play has tools against review bombing: TikTok suffered a huge rating flop not so long ago, and moderators cleaned a sudden increase of bad reviews in a couple of days. </p><p> But before all that, you need to get a review. The App Store has in-app native forms, and Google Play works on introducing them as well. You can also use custom or <a href="https://firebase.googleblog.com/2018/08/introducing-firebase-in-app-messaging.html"><span>3rd party in-app platforms</span></a> to make these forms fit your app design. Keep in mind that app store guidelines prohibit asking a review in exchange for some kind of reward and redirecting bad reviews to customer support instead of a store. Another way to get a review is asking for them in social networks and real life. </p></div></div> </div></div></div></div></div><div id="rec201776501" data-record-type="3" data-bg-color="#161818"><!-- T107 --><div> <div itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemprop="image" content="https://static.tildacdn.com/tild3932-3261-4835-a166-336264623064/image_1.png"><meta itemprop="caption" content="in-app message example"> <p><img src="https://static.tildacdn.com/tild3932-3261-4835-a166-336264623064/-/empty/image_1.png" data-original="https://static.tildacdn.com/tild3932-3261-4835-a166-336264623064/image_1.png" imgfield="img" alt="in-app message example"> </p></div> </div></div><div id="rec201776718" data-record-type="106" data-bg-color="#161818"><!-- T004 --><div><div> <div><div field="text"><div data-customstyle="yes"><p>Ratings, reviews and graphics influence inorganic downloads too: when a user clicks an ad, they land on the app page.

November 18, 2020 | https://cakephp.blog/real-time-search-with-ajax-and-cakephp/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://cakephp.blog/real-time-search-with-ajax-and-cakephp/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div>

<p>As I type away at my 9 to 5 I get a request from an executive to create a “real-time search bar for the employees-dashboard”. A fairly typical request for a code monkey like myself and, at first glance, an easily solvable problem.</p>
<p>Several hours of caffeine fueled spaghetti code later, and several more hours cleaning said spaghetti code, I finally emerged with 2 things.</p>
<ol><li>A caffeine headache that put Freud’s cocaine hangovers to shame.</li><li>A working real-time search bar, which I will be demonstrating in the tutorial below.</li></ol>
<p>If you like your skull not to rattle with every heartbeat please do me a favor and let me show you how the wheel is made so you don’t spend any time trying to remake it. I’ll assume that already have a <a href="https://cakephp.blog/getting-started-in-cakephp/">CakePHP project running </a>and jump straight into setting up the application to <a href="https://cakephp.blog/ajax-notifications-in-cakephp/">work with AJAX</a>.</p>
<h2>Real-Time Search Setup</h2>
<p>In order for your application to accept AJAX requests, you’ll need to load the <code>RequestHandler</code> component in either your AppController or the controller you want to accept AJAX requests with.</p>
<p>AppController.php</p>
<pre><code lang="php">public function initialize()
{
    //...
    $this-&gt;loadComponent('RequestHandler');
}</code></pre>
<p>Now that our application can accept AJAX requests we’ll need to create a view cell. Baking a view cell is simple with cake’s command-line tool.</p>
<pre><code lang="bash">bin/cake bake cell Search</code></pre>
<p>This should create two files:</p>
<ol><li><code>src/View/Cell/SearchCell.php</code></li><li><code>src/Template/Cell/Search/display.ctp</code></li></ol>
<p>Now let’s create a view cell that will handle our searches.</p>
<h2>Real-Time Search View Cell</h2>
<p>Open the files we previously created in the command-line and you’ll see an empty <code>display.ctp</code> file and this:</p>
<p>SearchCell.php</p>
<pre><code lang="php">&lt;?php
namespace App\\View\\Cell;

use Cake\\View\\Cell;
use Cake\\Datasource\\Paginator;

class SearchCell extends Cell
{
    public function display()
    {
    }
}</code></pre>
<p><code>SearchCell.php</code> is a view cell. A view cell is a mini-controller that can invoke logic and render templates. Basically, a reusable controller meant for rendering views.</p>
<p>This will be the piece of logic to re-render our view every time we search. In order to make our real-time search, we may want to put some logic into it. In the display function of our view cell let’s put the following:</p>
<pre><code lang="php">//...
use Cake\\View\\Cell;
use Cake\\Datasource\\Paginator;
//...
function display($name) {				
	$this-&gt;loadModel('Employees');
  // Create a paginator
  $paginator = new Paginator();
  
  // Paginate the model
  $results = $paginator-&gt;paginate(
      $this-&gt;Employees-&gt;find('all'),
      $this-&gt;request-&gt;getQueryParams(),
       [
           'conditions' =&gt; ['Employees.name like' =&gt; $name . '%']
       ]
  );

  $paging = $paginator-&gt;getPagingParams() + (array)$this-&gt;request-&gt;getParam('paging');
  $this-&gt;request = $this-&gt;request-&gt;withParam('paging', $paging);

  $this-&gt;set('employees', $results);
}
//...</code></pre>
<p>That’s quite a big leap, let’s take a step back and look at what this actually does.</p>
<p>First we load the Employees model and create a paginator.</p>
<pre><code lang="php">$this-&gt;loadModel('Employees');
$paginator = new Paginator();</code></pre>
<p>Then we add our model to our paginator, pass the URL queries, and create a condition where we only show the employees who’s names are like the name passed into our view cell.</p>
<pre><code lang="php">$results = $paginator-&gt;paginate(
      $this-&gt;Employees-&gt;find('all'),
      $this-&gt;request-&gt;getQueryParams(),
       [
           'conditions' =&gt; ['Employees.name like' =&gt; $name . '%']
       ]
);
</code></pre>
<p>How do we actually see the view cell in action? All we have to do is create a template that displays the relevant results! In this case that’s the employee name and position.</p>
<pre><code lang="markup">&lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Position&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;?php foreach($employees as $employee): ?&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;?= $employee-&gt;name ?&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;?= $employee-&gt;position ?&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;?php endforeach; ?&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;?= $this-&gt;element('Layouts/pagination'); ?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Now every time we put <code>&lt;?= $this-&gt;cell('Search', [$name]); ?&gt;</code> in a view our view cell template will be rendered! For us that means every time we do an AJAX call we can update our table without messy calls, or view logic.</p>
<p>We have our view cell now let’s start searching in our main view!</p>
<h2>Real-Time Search Controller</h2>
<p>In our <code>EmployeesController.php</code>‘s index function we will need to do two things</p>
<ol><li>Handle the initial non-AJAX call.</li><li>Update the table when our AJAX search is used.</li></ol>
<p>Here’s what that looks like in full:</p>
<p>EmployeesController.php</p>
<pre><code lang="php">&lt;?php
namespace App\\Controller;

use Cake\\ORM\\Query;
use Cake\\Database\\Expression\\QueryExpression;
use Cake\\View\\CellTrait;
use Cake\\Datasource\\Paginator;

class EmployeesController extends AppController {
  use CellTrait;

  public function initialize() {
		parent::initialize();
    $this-&gt;loadComponent('Paginator');
  }

  public function index() {
		$name = $this-&gt;request-&gt;getQuery('name') ? $this-&gt;request-&gt;getQuery('name') : '';
    $query = $this-&gt;Employees
                  -&gt;find('all', [
										'conditions' =&gt; [
												'Employees.name LIKE' =&gt; '%'. $name .'%'
											]
									]);

    $employees = $this-&gt;paginate($query);

    if ($this-&gt;request-&gt;is('ajax')) {
      $name = $this-&gt;request-&gt;getQuery('name');
      $this-&gt;set(compact('name'));
			$this-&gt;render('index-search');
		}

    $this-&gt;set(compact([
      'name',
      'employees'
    ]));
  }

?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The first part is, hopefully, easy to understand. All we’re doing is checking if there is a <code>name</code> variable in the URL, finding all employees, and paginating them. In the middle, we check to see if we are dealing with an AJAX request. If so we get the <code>name</code> variable from our URL, set it as a view variable, and render a new template. Our <code>index-search</code> template is a call to the view cell with the included <code>name</code> view variable.</p>
<p>index_search.ctp</p>
<pre><code lang="php">&lt;?= $this-&gt;cell('Search', [$name]); ?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This allows us to quickly update the employees table with our view cell template.</p>
<p>For our <code>index.ctp</code> template file we’ll, finally, add the search bar and the AJAX call!</p>
<p>index.ctp</p>
<pre><code lang="markup">&lt;h1&gt;Employees&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;input type="text" class="form-control" id="employee-search" placeholder="Employee name" value="&lt;?= $name ?&gt;"&gt;      
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
  $( document ).ready(function() {
    $('#employee-search').keyup(function () {
      var thisHref = '/employees?name=' + $(this).val();
      if (!thisHref) {
        return false;
      }
      $('#pagination-container').fadeTo(300, 0);

      $('#pagination-container').load(thisHref, function() {
        $(this).fadeTo(200, 1);
      });
      return false;
    });
  });
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;div id="pagination-container" class="col-12"&gt;
  &lt;?= $this-&gt;cell('Search', [$name]); ?&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You can see that the AJAX call is simple! All we do is take the value from our search bar, call the jQuery <code>load</code> function, and add-in some fancy fade effects to make the search look nicer!</p>
<p>The jQuery <code>load</code> function takes the result from the given URL and replaces the inner HTML of the object.</p>

DoorDash defines Contribution Profit as gross profit minus sales and marketing costs, Doordash’s version of retention profit or their cut that is left over after they have spent on keeping customers. In the above graph we can see that after incurring a loss from their customers in year 1 in the 5-10% range, their customers actually produce a contribution profit in years 2, 3, 4. The big question, what is driving this? It’s an important indicator of long term success. For DoorDah it’s two things.</p><figure id="w-node-5b31e6116fee-ac95238f"><p><img alt="https___bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com_public_images_c80a9ee0-78a1-4663-a189-48e44600e0d7_637x353.png" src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fac0bd00b5e8b8e9995239c/5fb5181fe07b8927c6cba45a_https___bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com_public_images_c80a9ee0-78a1-4663-a189-48e44600e0d7_637x353.png"></p></figure><p>We talked about the contribution profit being gross revenue minus sales and marketing. From the above graph we can see that after year 1, the % of sales and marketing expenses that DoorDash spends on those customer cohorts drops 50-70%. The decrease in expense improves the unit economics of each customer to the point that in years 2 and beyond as we can see in the first chart, they are now profitable operating within the core business model, that is taking other operating expenses off the table. The second factor, increased order volume over time.</p><figure id="w-node-cddc66677cd2-ac95238f"><p><img alt="gov-by-cohort" src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fac0bd00b5e8b8e9995239c/5fb5181f3fbde031cdf33e43_gov-by-cohort.jpeg"></p></figure><p>This chart shows GOV or gross order volume grows year over year from the initial cohort year, this is DoorDash’s way of defining expansion revenue which is a key driver of solid unit economics in SaaS. Given that DoorDash earns fee’s on each transaction in their app, so as gross order volume goes up, so does their fee’s and revenue. If sales and marketing expenses drop in years 2+ and gross order volume increases this create a clear path to positive unit economics for DoorDash.</p><p>Now there are two unknowns here. DoorDash still operates at a loss, even with the cohort breakdown painting a path to positive unit economics, will other OpEX ever come into line that they can operate at a profit? TBD. But more importantly over the same period, what does customer churn look like? What does revenue retention look like for those customers that don’t increase their GOV, or is DoorDash masking the loss of GOV through customer churn by pushing expansion revenue from existing customer creating a false bottom. Eventually you will run out of ways to increase existing customer revenue and with high customer churn, you will hit a wall in terms of revenue growth and those positive contribution margins. Now that isn’t all doom and gloom for DoorDash, but if it is the case, it could limit their total potential market size which directly affects revenue and price of their shares.</p><p>Overall I have to applaud the DoorDash team on their S-1 👏. The cohort analysis is a great educational tool for founders and new startups of a financial model to build on, using sales and marketing expenses to drive customer acquisition at a loss and then through decreased expenses and expansion of revenue to have a healthy CAC payback and healthy profits from the customers life-time value. Too often recurring revenue or SaaS startups don’t take the time to look at segment or cohort &nbsp;level data which often times can uncover streams of strong unit economics and uncover strong growth opportunities.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

In the second post, I will share best practices that will help you create a comprehensive PRD.</p><p>Without further ado, let me answer the first question:</p><p><strong>What is a product requirements document (PRD)?</strong></p><p>A PRD describes in detail the capabilities of a product or a feature.

The emphasis is on '<em>precisely define.'</em> A precise definition of scope is critical for the PRD to do its job well: communicate to the engineers what they need to build.</li><li><strong>Get a higher level of clarity by reducing ambiguity.</strong> Until the PM creates the PRD, the product scope is high level and, sometimes, ambiguous.

That might be true in a few cases.

<article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Two days ago, macOS users experienced worrying hangs when opening applications not downloaded from the Mac App Store. Many users suspected hardware issues with their devices, but as they took to social media, they found it was a widespread problem. And it was no coincidence that it was happening so soon after the launch of macOS “Big Sur”.</p>

<p>Eventually, <a href="https://twitter.com/lapcatsoftware/status/1326990296412991489">a tweet by Jeff Johnson</a> pinpointed the underlying issue. Apple’s “OCSP Responder” service was overloaded, therefore macOS was unable to verify app developers’ cryptographic certificates.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cryptohack.org/assets/images/apple-tweet.png?style=centerme" alt="Jeff Johnson's tweet"></p>

<p>But why are OCSP Responders in the critical path of apps launching? This post will briefly discuss code signing, how Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) works, why it’s deeply flawed, and what are some better alternatives. Unlike other posts on this incident, I want to emphasise the practical crypto aspects (at a high level) and offer a balanced perspective.</p>

<h3 id="code-signing">Code Signing</h3>

<p>On their developer portal, Apple explain <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/code-signing/">the purpose of code signing</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Code signing your app assures users that it is from a known source and the app hasn’t been modified since it was last signed. Before your app can integrate app services, be installed on a device, or be submitted to the App Store, it must be signed with a certificate issued by Apple.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, if developers want their apps to be trusted on macOS, they must sign them using their own certificate keypair. Keychain is used to generate a unique “Developer ID” certificate, which includes a private key for the developer to use, and a public key for distribution. After Apple have signed the Developer ID certificate, the developer can use the private key to produce cryptographic signatures on their apps as part of their release process.</p>

<p>When you run an app, its signature is verified against the public key of the developer’s certificate. Then, the certificate itself is verified, by checking that it hasn’t expired yet (certificates are typically valid for 1 year), and that it’s ultimately signed by Apple’s root certificate. There may also be intermediate certificates as part of the chain up to the root certificate. A “chain of trust” has been created, because the developer ID certificate signed an app, an intermediate certificate signed the developer ID certificate, and Apple’s root certificate signed the intermediate certificate. Any Apple device can verify this chain of trust and therefore approve an app to run.</p>

<p>This is similar to the TLS Public Key Infrastructure used on the internet. But it’s also fundamentally different since Apple has total control over its own chain of trust. Other certificate authorities are not allowed to issue valid certificates for code signing as all certificates must chain back up to Apple.</p>

<p>If the verification process wasn’t successful, then users will see a scary dialogue which is difficult to bypass:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cryptohack.org/assets/images/apple-failed-verify.png?style=centerme" alt="Apple failed to verify popup"></p>

<h3 id="revocation">Revocation</h3>

<p>What happens when a developer is found to be breaching Apple’s rules, or loses control of their private key? A certificate authority needs to be able to instantly nullify bad certificates they’ve issued. If a certificate is being used maliciously, it’s not acceptable to wait days or months until it expires naturally, otherwise a leak of a high-profile private key would render the whole system useless.</p>

<p>This is where certificate revocation comes in. It’s an additional step in the signature verification process, which involves finding out from the certificate authority if a certificate is still valid.</p>

<p>Originally, at least on the web, this was done the simplest way you can imagine. The certificate authority would give you a Certificate Revocation List (CRL), containing serial numbers of all revoked certificates, and you could check the certificate you are currently verifying is not on the list. However, this approach stopped being used by web browsers since the list got longer and longer and failed to scale. Especially after terrifying exploits like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed">Heartbleed</a> demanded mass revocation of certificates.</p>

<p>Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is an alternative allowing real-time checking of certificates. Each certificate can include a baked-in “OCSP Responder”, a URL that you can query that will report whether the certificate has been revoked. In Apple’s case, that’s “ocsp.apple.com”. So now, in addition to verifying the cryptographic validity of the signature, each time you launch an app you’re performing a real-time check with Apple (subject to some caching) to ensure they still think the developer’s ID certificate is legitimate.</p>

<h3 id="ocsps-availability-problem">OCSP’s Availability Problem</h3>

<p>There’s a huge problem with OCSP: it makes an external service a single point of failure. What happens if the OCSP Responder is down or unreachable? Do we just refuse to verify the certificate (hard-fail)? Or do we pretend that the check was successful (soft-fail)?</p>

<p>Apple are forced to use the soft-fail behaviour, otherwise apps wouldn’t work when you’re offline. As it happens, all major browsers also implement the soft-fail behaviour, since OCSP Responders have traditionally been unreliable, and browsers want to keep displaying websites even if certificate authorities’ responders are temporarily down.</p>

<p>But soft-fail isn’t great, because it means that an attacker with network control can block requests to the responder, and the revocation check will be skipped. In fact, that was the hotfix widely shared on Twitter during this incident: blackhole traffic to “ocsp.apple.com” by adding a line to <em>/etc/hosts</em>. A lot of people won’t be removing that line anytime soon, since disabling OCSP doesn’t cause any noticeable problems.</p>

<h3 id="the-incident">The Incident</h3>

<p>If Apple’s OCSP check was built to soft-fail, then why did apps hang when the OCSP Responder was down? Probably because this was actually a different failure case: the OCSP Responder was not completely down, it was performing badly.</p>

<p>Due to the load added by millions of users worldwide upgrading to macOS “Big Sur”, Apple’s servers slowed to a crawl, and although they weren’t properly answering OCSP queries, they were working just enough that the soft-fail didn’t trigger.</p>

<h3 id="ocsps-privacy-problem">OCSP’s Privacy Problem</h3>

<p>In addition to OCSP’s availability problems, the protocol wasn’t initially designed with privacy in mind. A basic OCSP query involves an unencrypted HTTP request to the OCSP Responder with the serial number of the certificate. Therefore not only can the responder figure out what certificate you are interested in, but so can your ISP and anybody else intercepting packets. Apple could use this to build a timeline of which developers’ apps you are opening, as could third parties.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cryptohack.org/assets/images/apple-ocsp-wireshark.jpg?style=centerme" alt="OCSP packet in wireshark"></p>

<p>Adding encryption is possible, and there’s a better, more private version called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCSP_stapling">OCSP stapling</a>, but Apple is not using either of these things. In fact OSCP stapling wouldn’t make sense in this scenario, but it illustrates how OCSP needs improvements to not leak data by default.</p>

<h3 id="a-better-future">A Better Future</h3>

<p>This incident has started a lively debate in the software community, with one side proclaiming <a href="https://sneak.berlin/20201112/your-computer-isnt-yours/">“Your Computer Isn’t Yours”</a> and the other arguing that <a href="https://www.security-embedded.com/blog/2020/11/14/application-trust-is-hard-but-apple-does-it-well">“application trust is hard but Apple does it well”</a>. This post aims to show that whichever side you agree with, OCSP is a terrible way to manage certificate revocation, and will lead to more availability and privacy incidents in future. In my opinion, it was a poor engineering decision for Apple to make app launching dependent on OCSP. In the short term at least they have mitigated the damage by <a href="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/ocsp.html">increasing the time that responses are cached</a>.</p>

<p>Fortunately, a better revocation method is reaching maturity. CRLite is a way to shrink down lists of all revoked certificates to a reasonable size. <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/crlite-finally-a-fix-for-broken-revocation/">Scott Helme’s blog</a> gives a good summary of how CRLite uses Bloom Filters to make the Certificate Revocation List approach – which OCSP superseded – feasible again.</p>

<p>Theoretically, macOS devices could pull updates to this list periodically and do certificate revocation checking on the device itself, addressing the availability and privacy problems with OCSP. On the other hand, since the list of revoked Developer ID certificates is much smaller than the list of all revoked PKI certificates, it’s worth asking why Apple haven’t opted to use CRLs in the first place. Perhaps they don’t want to reveal any information about which certificates they’ve revoked.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Overall, the incident this week was a good time to reflect on the trust model that has been promoted by organisations like Apple and Microsoft. Malware has grown in sophistication and most people aren’t in a position to judge whether it’s safe to run particular binaries. Code signing seems like a neat way to leverage cryptography to determine whether or not to trust applications, and to at least associate apps with known developers. And revocation is a necessary part of maintaining that trust.</p>

<p>However, by adding several mundane failure modes to the verification process, OCSP spoils any cryptographic elegance the code signing and verifying process has. While OCSP is also widely used for TLS certificates on the internet, the large number of PKI certificate authorities and relaxed attitude of browsers means that failures are less catastrophic. Moreover, people are accustomed to seeing websites become unavailable from time to time, but they don’t expect the same from apps on their own devices. macOS users were alarmed at how their apps could become collateral damage for an infrastructure issue at Apple. Yet this was an inevitable outcome arising from the fact that certificate verification depends on external infrastructure, and no infrastructure is 100% reliable.</p>

<p>Scott Helme also has concerns about the power that Certificate Authorities gain when certification revocation actually works effectively. Even if you aren’t bothered about the potential for censorship, there will be occasional mistakes and these must be weighed against the security benefits. As one developer discovered when <a href="https://blog.charliemonroe.net/a-day-without-business/">Apple mistakenly revoked his certificate</a>, …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

Smart and effective product marketing is necessary.</p><p><img src="https://www.miracles.com.hk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/digital-product-dev-process-Miracle-Digital.jpg" alt="digital product dev process Miracle Digital - Digital product design is the&nbsp;core of Digital Transformation" title="Digital product design is the&nbsp;core of Digital Transformation"></p><h4><b>Step 1 –&nbsp; Research &amp; UX Testing</b></h4><p>The <a href="https://www.miracles.com.hk/web-design-hong-kong/user-experience/">User Experience</a> team will understand the problem that is going to be solved by market and target user research. This part of the project involves meetings with the client or product owners, researching the competitive landscape, performing business analysis and analyzing any data that can be provided by previous iterations analytics.</p><p>When it comes down to a digital product, like a <a href="https://www.miracles.com.hk/web-design-hong-kong/responsive-web-design/">website</a>, it is also important to understand the people using the product, why they are using it and the type of technology they are comfortable with, as this will help the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.miracles.com.hk/web-design-hong-kong/user-experience/">User Experience</a> team define the best answer to the problem’s question.</p><h4><b>Step 2 –&nbsp;</b><b>Prototyping</b></h4><p>Next, <a href="https://www.miracles.com.hk/web-design-hong-kong/user-experience/">User Experience</a> team is responsible for using the information discovered in step one to come up with the best solution to the problem discovered. Generally speaking, this second phase is marked with lots of sketches and initial concepts that can be quickly tested and iterated upon to drive towards the best answer to the problem. <a href="https://www.miracles.com.hk/2018/10/29/why-user-experience-design-is-important/">Wireframing, storyboarding, site-mapping, sketching and whiteboarding</a> are routine elements that make up this phase of the project. A clickable product prototype will deliver to client, product owners or target user group to test the usability of this product.</p><h4><b>Step 3 –&nbsp; Development</b></h4><p>The digital product creation process is the actual building of the application using code, also known as <a href="https://www.miracles.com.hk/web-design-hong-kong/web-development/">development.</a> Here the final designs that were crafted in step three are turned into front-end code (HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript) and hooked into back-end databases, CMS’s or APIs. Development is also when the actual interaction design is implemented, as well as any transition, effects or loading animations, giving the digital product some life and allowing it to be tested in terms of user delight.</p><h4><b>Step 4 –&nbsp; Testing &amp; QA</b></h4><p>Product software testing practice to test <a href="https://www.miracles.com.hk/app-design-hong-kong/">mobile</a> or <a href="https://www.miracles.com.hk/web-design-hong-kong/">web</a> applications for potential bugs. It’s a complete testing of applications before making live. A digital product needs to be checked completely from end-to-end before it goes live for end users.</p><p>By performing testing, the testing team can make sure that the <a href="https://www.miracles.com.hk/app-design-hong-kong/">mobile</a> or <a href="https://www.miracles.com.hk/web-design-hong-kong/">web</a> system is functioning properly and can be accepted by real-time users. The UI design and functionality are the captains of digital product testing.</p><h4><b>Step 5 – Deploying the Final Product</b></h4><p>The final development step of the process is deployment. Here, the final developed digital product is transitioned from its development environment to the live internet, where it can be accessed by the masses. Generally, this migration is taken care of via the modification of the Domain Name System (DNS), pointing URLs to their correct indexes. This phase can be completed with relative ease, however, a number of situations can arise when moving digital hosting and each deployment should factor in time to allow for bug fixes and code adjustments.</p><h4><b>Step 6 – Maintenance&nbsp;&amp; Optimization</b></h4><p>The final step, optimization, isn’t a typical phase of the digital product production process. This is because Optimization should take place throughout the project and takes a number of different forms. In the initial discovery phase, optimization takes the form of user surveys and interviews to test the assumptions the team is making while performing research. In the second and third steps, it takes the form of prototype user testing, allowing users to interact with wireframes and mockups to test concepts and workflow ideas. In development and deployment, optimization takes the form of quality assurance (QA) testing, making sure to note and quash bugs as they are discovered. Finally, optimization even takes the form of a project post-mortem, analyzing the overall project to see how elements of the process can be improved to provide solid digital solutions in the future.</p><h2>Digital Transformation Agency Miracle</h2><p>We are Digital Transformation Agency Miracle Hong Kong.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>Gu Zeyu’s financial situation hit rock bottom in March. Out of work and owed back pay, the 24-year-old was down to eating one meal a day and struggling to cover her utility bills. But even as she cut her spending to almost nothing, her costs were still overwhelming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gu had started borrowing money through Huabei, a popular virtual credit card and microlending service operated by Ant Group, the Chinese financial technology giant, while she was in college. She later signed up for Jiebei and Baitiao, two similar services. Over the next four years, her credit limit which started at around $750, was gradually raised by between $75 and $150 a month. Before she realized it, she had accumulated $4,500 (30,000 yuan) of debt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Now, it’s like I’m in a whirlpool,” Gu tells <em>Rest of World</em>. “I can only pay it back slowly, one small sum at a time, and after that, I will have no savings. So the whirlpool makes me keep borrowing more and more.”</p>



<p>Gu’s situation is far from unique. As the Chinese middle class has grown in step with the economy over the past decade, financial technology has allowed hundreds of millions of consumers to borrow money to fuel their spending. Several of these platforms integrate seamlessly into payment and e-commerce platforms, allowing debt to be accumulated almost invisibly. With these services buoying consumer spending, regulators have largely taken a hands-off approach, rarely intervening in the market. But, with the economy slowing down because of the novel coronavirus pandemic, they have become increasingly concerned that the microlending industry could now pose a real risk to the Chinese financial system, should borrowers like Gu start to default en masse.</p>



<p>“These platforms have been really good at democratizing access to financial products and services,” says Zennon Kapron, founder of fintech consultancy Kapronasia. “So on one side, it’s been really good. But on the flip side, it is kind of risky as well.”</p>



<p>In November, these concerns contributed to the 11th-hour suspension of what would have been the world’s largest stock market listing: the $37 billion IPO of Ant Group in Hong Kong and Shanghai.&nbsp;</p>



	




<p>Ant Group, which began as a payment service for the e-commerce platform Alibaba, was a pioneer in the Chinese microlending sector, launching Huabei in 2014 as a way to offer online shoppers access to credit, although it is far from the only player. Hundreds of fintech apps and services are available to Chinese consumers, typically allowing small-scale loans of a few hundred dollars that can be approved and paid in minutes.</p>



<p>Initially, the fintech companies lent their own money, but over the past few years, many have pivoted away from being direct providers of financial products and instead have become platforms for traditional banks and fund managers. Rather than issuing loans to consumers themselves, the fintechs act as brokers, using their own comprehensive internal data to assess a customer’s credit risk, then passing that information on to a bank, which underwrites the loan.</p>



<p>Ant’s IPO filings show that this business, which it calls CreditTech, grew 59% in the first six months of 2020 and now makes up nearly 40% of its total revenues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This arrangement gave banks access to customers who would previously have been uneconomical to service, customers access to bank loans, and the authorities some assurance that the stable and highly regulated banking sector was involved in the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It came as a surprise to some analysts — and fintech companies — when the Chinese government’s new draft fintech regulations, released in November, reversed course. The rules call for fintech companies to originate at least 30% of the loans that go through their platforms, which had previously been less than 5%. To meet that requirement and keep up its current rates of lending, Ant Group would need to find billions of dollars to hold as capital reserves. Its profit margins — the company made $2.6 billion in profit last year — would inevitably narrow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Several analysts and investors who spoke to <em>Rest of World</em> believe that the numbers revealed by Ant Group’s IPO filing woke regulators up to the extent to which the company has been able to profit from lending out other institutions’ money.</p>



<p>“What changed is that the prospectus highlighted the margins,” says Daniel Broby, director of the Centre for Financial Regulation and Innovation at Strathclyde University. “This is a really impressive company, and you look to see how much money it’s making … and how it’s not sharing the risk of credit issuance, someone, somewhere, clicked.”</p>



<p>There were other factors in the pulling of Ant’s IPO — not least, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3d2f174d-aa73-44fc-8c90-45c2a554e97b">an argument between the company’s high-profile founder, Jack Ma</a>, and the regulators. On October 24, at the Bund Summit, an eminent finance forum, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGzgpArH5AI">Ma publicly complained</a> that regulation would stifle innovation. Many analysts see a direct link between Ma’s implicit criticism of the government and state-backed banks — which he accused of having a “pawnshop mentality” — and the decision to halt the listing. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-president-xi-jinping-halted-jack-ma-ant-ipo-11605203556"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em> reported</a> that Chinese President Xi Jinping personally ordered the halt. However, the concerns over financial and social stability are also real.</p>

<p>According to Reuters, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/ant-group-ipo-suspension-regulators/how-billionaire-jack-ma-fell-to-earth-and-took-ants-mega-ipo-with-him-idUSKBN27L2GX">a state-compiled report on how Ant Group’s microlending products have encouraged poor people to build up debt</a> was also a factor in suspending the company’s IPO.</p>



<p>Alongside giants like Ant, there are hundreds of other companies — most of them small, and some of them unscrupulous. Some critics of the industry say that the legitimate lenders and the predatory ones feed off one another.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Because it doesn’t need to meet strict financial requirements, online microlending has evolved into more like a Ponzi scheme,” Shen Yan, an economics professor at Peking University’s National School of Development, tells <em>Rest of World</em>. “For some companies, the ‘better clients’ in their eyes are those who can’t stop borrowing money.”</p>



<p>Li Xiaodong, a 28-year-old in Shanghai, has fallen prey to these lenders. He took his first loan in 2015 from Ant Group’s MYbank lending product to pay rent and start an online store. The business failed, and to pay back the loans, he borrowed more. Today, he owes nearly $59,000 to 13 fintech companies, most backed by Chinese tech giants but some by small, shady businesses. When he was late with payments, some fintech companies publicly shamed him by bombarding Li and his friends, family, and colleagues with calls and text messages asking for money.</p>



<p>“Most people don’t bother to calculate the interest. They just see the advertisement and think, ‘Oh it doesn’t cost much.’” says Li. “People like me, who are bad with numbers, can never understand it.”</p>



<p>The same regulations that hit Ant will also target these smaller players. Under the proposed rules, if a company wants to provide microlending products in more than one of China’s provinces, it will need to have <a href="https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/6-522-0089?transitionType=Default&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)&amp;firstPage=true">registered capital</a> of more than $750 million. Currently, only five companies nationwide have met this threshold, including one owned by Ant Group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The rules will also force the remaining fintechs to be more prudent when lending, says Shen. “If they operate in a regulated way, they naturally won’t lend to those who shouldn’t be borrowing, because that is a risk, and a risk needs to be covered,” she says. “Your registered capital is here to offset the risks, meaning you will lose your own cash if the borrowers fail to pay you back.”</p>



<p>For those still in the grip of debt, news of stricter regulation was welcome, if a little too late. “The online lenders today have gone down the wrong path,” Li Xiaodong says. “They don’t care at all whether lending you the money is a good thing or bad thing for you. To have the state regulate, that would be good.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        
        <small>2020-11-18</small>
        <p>I’ve been mostly happy using a Mac since I got myself my first computer earned with programmer money. I believe it was a mid 2009 15" MacBook Pro. That was a computer I used at least until 2016 which I consider very decent usable life. At that point I had replaced the hard-drive with an SSD, upgraded the RAM and switched a battery that was worn out. I stopped using it when it just straight died some time in 2016.</p>
<h2 id="my-history-with-the-mac">My history with the Mac</h2>
<p>So what was that computer to me? It was an extremely well-built and solid-feeling piece of aluminium. A cool keyboard backlight. The magsafe charger and a bunch of USB ports. The keyboard and touchpad were best in class. The build quality was better than any laptop I had owned before. Partly because I had only bought the cheap ones before but also because they really were a step above at the time.</p>
<p>I got it primarily on recommendation from a friendly hacker who’s recommendations had never lead me wrong before. He spoke well of the underlying UNIX and the experience of using it. Fast, clean and visually pleasing. I think he mostly really liked the backlit keyboard, very hackerly. His recommendation held true, this computer was very good to me.</p>
<p>I’ve also been the admin on an Xserve server. That was wild. Neat UIs but buggy and finicky as all hell.</p>
<p>Since then I’ve used the second generation Macbook Air (I believe 2nd, first wedge version) at 11". That was a cool little machine and did what it did very nicely.</p>
<p>Hardware aside, MacOS in it’s earlier incarnations on these computers was always a snappy and competent experience. A polished surface which did a bunch of stuff under the hood that generally made it work better than the different Ubuntu desktop environments and various Windows versions I’ve had before. Things like Wifi and even Bluetooth felt good in a way they never had before.</p>
<p>A lot of it was the visual polish and the extremely snappy UI. But in total the experience was just great. Spotlight was glorious. I think my first upgrade was Snow Leopard which was generally a very good update as it focused on performance and stability.</p>
<p>As a developer’s machine it was fast enough, competent enough, got out of the way and the UNIX underpinnings meant I didn’t miss Linux at all. I’ve never been able to really connect with the equivalent powershell stuff in Windows. I guess I just like UNIX.</p>
<p>The only bad thing I can say about my early years of MacBook Pro usage was that the trackpad and the Magic Trackpad I got eventually are probably some of the biggest culprits in some of the RSI-style hand pain I’ve been dealing with. Trackpads are just murder on my hands and I worked loads off of that setup for a number of years. Took a while before I realized that it was trackpad-related.</p>
<p>Beyond that I’ve had some refurb Macs for my wife and assorted family, some 13" MBP for work at one point and then a 15" butterfly touchbar MBP for work. I think that was when I started to feel that Apple was diverging from my preferences in the MBP line.</p>
<h2 id="my-current-experience">My current experience</h2>
<p>That’s the same computer I have and work on now and it is.. fine? Maybe just OK. Not great. I’ve had some keys getting stuck but fixable with canned air. I don’t like the touchbar, it has been between useless and an actual hindrance. The TouchID power button is good though. I don’t like living in dongle-town though I mostly like USB C in the long run.</p>
<p>The reason it has been mostly fine for me is that I keep it on tray mounted on a VESA arm, dangling dongles like a technical octopus and I use external peripherals for input.</p>
<p>It gets really hot and loud and then it performs incredibly poorly. So I guess this is one of the throttliest generations. I think I had the “don’t charge it on the wrong side” problem as well. Some of the CPU shenanigans have calmed down as I installed the Turbo Boost Switcher tool to just disable the Turbo Boost, removing performance for peace and quiet.</p>
<p>As I’ve been using these devices it has become increasingly annoying to figure out how to install “unknown” apps. I need some non-discoverable terminal incantation to get the option to accept installing things that are unsigned. There’s always a new piece getting locked down. And while I think that’s often to the benefit of the average consumer, I’m not that. And I just get more annoyed.</p>
<p>I’ve been frustrated about the uninspiring performance delivered for the incredible brand markup that Apple charges. I don’t mind the computer being expensive if the experience is good and the hardware reasonable. The experience feels like it is slipping, especially for my needs and the hardware has just been getting less impressive to me.</p>
<h2 id="the-hardware">The hardware</h2>
<p>My gaming computer has a Ryzen. For a while I did my dev on that as we had just moved to our house and the office wasn’t finalized. Woof, aside from running Windows as a dev environment which I didn’t enjoy there was some serious upside on that machine.</p>
<p>On the Mac my options are very limited. I can’t get a Ryzen, I can’t get anything modern with Intel or meaningfully upgradable at all. The Mac Pro doesn’t count. It comes underspeced at hilarious prices. I like some of the design decisions but the price-point doesn’t make any kind of sense for me and what I do. I can’t buy an interesting Mac from a performance standpoint.</p>
<p>Or can I? Well, they just announced the M1 chip and ARM Macs are now a fact. I think I might get one at some point. For a travel laptop I don’t think the rest of the industry is ready to fight Apple. Battery life and good bang for buck power might actually keep a Mac in my life for that. But I feel like the general trend is away from what I want. Or I might just use my iPad Pro for that use-case.</p>
<p>I think the M1 will be quite impressive when the benchmarks roll in. I’m sure it will suit many people for real-world use-cases as well. However, from the first presentation on it and the first batch of Macs I don’t feel like the direction is for me. IO was heavily sacrificed. Upgradability is pretty much out the window. These things can be fine for a travel device for me where battery and weight are primary concerns. In that regard the new Air looks pretty good.</p>
<h2 id="the-software">The software</h2>
<p>Beyond that the coming OS, Big Sur, is taking MacOS in a direction I dislike. Catalina was quite messy and felt like it took steps toward walling off the Mac. Big Sur seems even more heavy-handed in that area and finally the M1 can push that even further if Apple feels like it. My trust is eroding on letting Apple set the tone for my computing life.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I think their approach to this transition is incredibly neat with Rosetta2 and how they are using the bytecode stuff with the App Store and whatnot. And the possibility to run iOS and iPad apps natively could be very useful. But none of this really moves the needle for me.</p>
<h2 id="so-whats-next">So what’s next?</h2>
<p>With my office in the garage as my primary work location I’m looking to transition to a desktop computer with lots of power. It will run Linux. Marking my first major return to desktop linux as a daily driver in a bundle of years. And it will run as light a desktop environment as I can stomach. I just wanted a stupid amount of performance to offset som of the UX niceties I know I will miss or have to customize  on my own.</p>
<p>I’m excited about exercising my development tools on a strong modern CPU rather than the throttled mess my current laptop offers. But I’m not thrilled about this move beyond the hardware aspect. I liked MacOS but I just don’t feel like Apple gives much of a care for the things I care about. And I feel like the software side on the Mac is slipping, consistently.</p>
<p>If they released an expandable Mac that wasn’t ridiculously expensive they would really make me think twice. But that feels unlikely.</p>
<p>So I’ll build myself a monstrous machine that can compensate in raw power for the potential lack of elegance and which offers unbounded flexibility rather than a poorly tended garden that someone keeps trying to wall in.</p>
<p>I’m not happy about it. I’ve generally enjoyed using my Macs. But when someone says “we’ll give you the full experience”, settling into that requires trust. And my trust that Apple and me are in alignment keeps fading.</p>
<p>Also, I’m developing a lot with heavily concurrent workloads. So I really look forward to exercising more cores. 2021, year of the Linux desktop (for me).</p>
<p>If you have thoughts, comments or a hell yeah you want to share about this topic or maybe you want me to cover some specific part of my transition here, let me know either via <a href="mailto:lars@underjord.io">lars@underjord.io</a> or on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/lawik">@lawik</a>. My first thoughts and my build might just show up first on my newsletter, so consider signing up for that below. It don’t track. Thanks for reading.</p>

To do that, starting out with a boilerplate/starter kit can save you tons of time. Here is a list of seven boilerplates that could help you build your SaaS faster.</p><hr><h3>Serverless SaaS</h3><p>The <a href="https://serverless.page/">Serverless SaaS</a> boilerplate is the perfect starting point for your next React app. It’s built with TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind, and Firebase. You can tap into user authentication, payments with Stripe, teams, and more with zero effort.</p><p>Going serverless is a great way of cutting costs because the pay-as-you-go pricing model means you can start free and only pay when your startup gets real traction. You also don’t have to worry about scaling issues. With Serverless platforms you are outsourcing a lot of responsibilities which allows you to move quicker.</p><p>That makes this starter kit great for solo developers and small teams who want to launch something quickly without spending money.</p><img alt="Serverless SaaS logo and slogan" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*7yHuIcpwIcUBkecK2LORMg.jpeg"><p>Source: <a href="https://serverless.page/">https://serverless.page/</a></p><hr><h3>Jumpstart</h3><p><a href="https://jumpstartrails.com/">Jumpstart</a> is a great starter kit for your next Ruby on Rails app. You can skip the boilerplate set up and build your Rails app faster. It handles all the stuff you need like a user authentication system and even background processing. It also has very good <a href="https://jumpstartrails.com/docs">documentation</a>. You can even try out a <em>lite</em> version that is available for free on <a href="https://github.com/excid3/jumpstart">Github</a>.</p><img alt="Jumpstart home page" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*8vcaD5txgZRmwqHrxMPvUQ.png"><p>Source: <a href="https://jumpstartrails.com/docs">https://jumpstartrails.com</a></p><hr><h3>Laravel Spark</h3><p><a href="https://spark.laravel.com/">Laravel Spark</a> is a Laravel package that is built by Taylor Otwell, the creator of Laravel. An amazing project to help you build your next great product with PHP. It provides a lot of scaffolding features so you don’t have to code everything yourself. It also has the features that every SaaS business needs, like (two-factor) authentication, subscription billing, and invoices.</p><img alt="Spark logo" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*OIiJ6wMYQE3XFx48b7NWvw.png"><p>Source: <a href="https://spark.laravel.com/">https://spark.laravel.com/</a></p><hr><h3>Gravity</h3><p>With Gravity, you can build a Node.js and React SaaS app at warp speed. It comes with a lot of features and pre-built components to get you up and running quickly. It even has a built-in user-onboarding flow feedback widget.</p><img alt="Gravity home page" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*2R71R0rWY_9N8I2wnrAfVA.png"><p>Source: <a href="https://usegravity.app/">https://usegravity.app</a></p><hr><h3>Sjabloon</h3><p><a href="https://www.getsjabloon.com/">Sjabloon</a> is a modern Ruby on Rails SaaS starter kit that also includes all the SaaS features like authentication and payments with Stripe, but also comes with a huge UI components library that is built with Tailwind, the rising CSS framework. This allows you to focus on your core product right from the start. Just like Jumpstart, it also has a lite version that is available for free on <a href="https://github.com/GetSjabloon/sjabloon-lite">Github</a>.</p><img alt="Sjabloon home page" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*cDQ56JMFLiPsqdiDPmjlkg.png"><p>Source: <a href="https://www.getsjabloon.com/">https://www.getsjabloon.com/</a></p><hr><p>React Milkshake</p><p><a href="https://www.reactmilkshake.com/">React Milkshake</a> is a basic React boilerplate to build high-performance apps faster. It does not come with as many features as the other boilerplates mentioned, but it does come with a code generator that generates components and <a href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a> code. If you are using Redux as a state management tool, using this boilerplate will save you a lot of time.</p><img alt="React Milkshake home page" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*GfuUSjr7h6tkB6YQZqWGEQ.png"><p>Source: <a href="https://www.reactmilkshake.com/">https://www.reactmilkshake.com</a></p><hr><h3>Wave</h3><p>Voyager is a popular Laravel Admin Package and <a href="https://wave.devdojo.com/">Wave</a> is a starter kit built on top of both Laravel and <a href="https://voyager.devdojo.com/">Voyager</a>.

            <div>
                <h3>Why I chose Electron.js for my side business</h3>
                <h4>So I can fry eggs on my MacBook Pro. Kidding ðŸ¥š ðŸ�³</h4>
                

                <p>With the current brouhaha about the Apple M1 chips and the recent <a href="https://www.sketch.com/blog/2020/10/26/part-of-your-world-why-we-re-proud-to-build-a-truly-native-mac-app/">love letter that Sketch wrote about macOS</a> it might seem like choosing Electron.js to develop your idea might be a badâ€¦ idea. But let me tell you why that might not be the case.</p>

                <p>There are several (very good) reasons why Electron.js was the right tech choice for my side business. But to start, hereâ€™s a tweet:</p>

                <p><a href="https://twitter.com/jamonholmgren/status/1105876480930734086?lang=en">
                    <img src="https://getloaf.io/blog/why-i-chose-electronjs/twitter.png">
                </a></p><p>Itâ€™s mostly a funny quip but thereâ€™s truth to it. If I chose to develop Loaf natively, I simply wouldnâ€™t have had the time, money or means to accomplish it. And now that Loaf has paying customers Iâ€™m glad I chose <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron.js.</a> Hereâ€™s why:</p>

                <h4>1. Money</h4>
                <p><a href="https://getloaf.io/">Loaf</a> is completely bootstrapped. Iâ€™m funding it out of my own wallet so I donâ€™t have the luxury of building a separate macOS app and separate Windows app.</p>

                <h4>2. CSS and layout â�¤ï¸�</h4>
                <p>What does CSS have to do with this? Iâ€™m a web designer and a UI designer. Iâ€™m very comfortable when writing CSS, but have very basic javascript skills. I have non-existent Objective-C/C#/Swift/.NET coding skills.</p>

                <p>Because CSS powers UI layout, it gives me close to ultimate flexibility. This is <b>the dream</b> as a UI designer. I donâ€™t need to ask a developer to make changes, I can do it myself! This means I can craft the best possible user experience. I fuss over every pixel and at the end of the day, the user wins.</p>

                <h4>3. It suits the product!</h4>
                <p>Loaf is an SVG icon editor. So thereâ€™s a natural fit there, the base canvas of an electron app is, essentially, good old HTML. I didn't need to build a rendering engine or do any translation stuff.</p>

                <h4>4. Finding engineers</h4>
                <p>When developing Loaf, I've worked alongside software engineers. The pool of engineers capable of web developement is simply larger than those who specialise in macOS and Windows application development. So finding a suitable partner will be easier for you.</p>

                <p>macOS has been my daily driver for the last 7+ years and I'd love to design macOS software one day. But in the world of business, you have to be practical.</p>

                <p>I wanted to share this in case you were holding out building something neat using Electron.js because it gets bagged out by the cool kids. There's nothing cooler than shipping a product that helps solve a problem for someone in the world.</p>

                <p>What do you think?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you haven’t yet heard, Rust is one of the most promising and <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted">most loved</a> programming languages out there.</p><p>First created at Mozilla, it has since been adopted by companies like Dropbox, Microsoft, Facebook, and others. Rust’s main benefit is that it enables C-like performance while still keeping the memory safety that we are used to when developing with languages like JavaScript and Python.</p><p>In this article, I will look at nine large companies that use Rust and delve into the reasons for their choice.</p><h2 id="9-rust-success-stories">9 Rust success stories</h2><h3 id="dropbox">Dropbox</h3><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/4b/4b69p1dn.dropbox_(1).jpg" alt="Dropbox uses Rust" loading="lazy"></p><p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> uses Rust for parts of its file synchronization engine. Since the engine is highly concurrent, writing, testing, and debugging it is hard. Therefore, the team chose to rewrite it in Rust. Rust’s static types and heavy compile-time checks give it an advantage over dynamically typed languages like Python when you need to tackle complex codebases and concurrent code.</p><blockquote>
<p>Rust has been a force multiplier for our team, and betting on Rust was one of the best decisions we made. More than performance, its ergonomics and focus on correctness has helped us tame sync’s complexity. We can encode complex invariants about our system in the type system and have the compiler check them for us. <a href="https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/rewriting-the-heart-of-our-sync-engine">(Source)</a></p>
</blockquote><p>Read more about Dropbox’s use of Rust <a href="https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/rewriting-the-heart-of-our-sync-engine">on their tech blog</a>.</p><h3 id="coursera">Coursera</h3><p><a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> uses Rust for their programming assignments feature where students need to write and run a computer program to solve a problem. The programs are run, tested, and graded inside Docker containers. For security reasons, the developer team needed to use a low-level language like Rust for some of the code, and they decided that Rust is more secure than C.</p><blockquote>
<p>Although C is the default low-level full-control programming language, these binaries have strict security and correctness requirements. We instead have chosen Rust, a modern native language from Mozilla. One of Rust’s common selling points is complete immunity to certain classes of security vulnerabilities thanks to its powerful type system, making it an excellent choice for security critical functions. <a href="https://medium.com/coursera-engineering/rust-docker-in-production-coursera-f7841d88e6ed">(Source)</a></p>
</blockquote><p>You can get more details on their use of Rust for programming assignments <a href="https://medium.com/coursera-engineering/rust-docker-in-production-coursera-f7841d88e6ed">on their blog</a>.</p><h3 id="figma">Figma</h3><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/ru/rucki4yw.figma_(1).jpg" alt="Figma uses Rust" loading="lazy"></p><p><a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> is a collaborative web-based design tool for vector graphics and interface prototyping. They chose to rewrite their multiplayer syncing engine in Rust (previously, it was in TypeScript) to improve performance since their server couldn’t keep up with user growth.</p><blockquote>
<p>We chose Rust for this rewrite because it combines best-in-class speed with low resource usage while still offering the safety of standard server languages. Low resource usage was particularly important to us because some of the performance issues with the old server were caused by the garbage collector. <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/rust-in-production-at-figma/">(Source)</a></p>
</blockquote><p>Find out more about Figma’s use of Rust <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/rust-in-production-at-figma/">on their blog</a>.</p><h3 id="npm">npm</h3><p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> is a package manager for JavaScript. Its engineering team chose to rewrite their main service in Rust because they saw that the service’s performance would soon be a bottleneck if user growth kept up. They rejected technologies such as C and C++ since they didn’t trust themselves to be able to handle memory management for a web-exposed service. Java was rejected since it would involve deploying JVM on their servers. 🙃</p><blockquote>
<p>The challenges that npm faces demand efficient and scalable solutions. When a service can be deploy-and-forget, that saves valuable operations time and lets them focus on other issues. npm employees also value having a helpful community around any technology they use. Rust fits all these criteria and is currently in use as part of npm’s stack. <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/static/pdfs/Rust-npm-Whitepaper.pdf">(Source)</a></p>
</blockquote><p>To learn more, read their <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/static/pdfs/Rust-npm-Whitepaper.pdf">case study</a> on Rust’s homepage.</p><h3 id="microsoft">Microsoft</h3><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/jg/jgiu0cqd.microsoft_(1).jpg" alt="Microsoft uses Rust" loading="lazy"></p><p>Microsoft has recently been experimenting with integrating Rust into its large C/C++ codebases.</p><p>The main argument for adopting Rust at Microsoft was the memory safety that Rust provides. For the last 12 years, around 70 percent of the CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) discovered at Microsoft have been connected with memory safety. Microsoft has tried various options to solve this issue, such as extensive developer training and static analysis tools. However, it seems like the only way out is to make these vulnerabilities impossible to do.</p><p>For more info on Rust at Microsoft, watch this talk:</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NQBVUjdkLAA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h3 id="cloudflare">Cloudflare</h3><p>Cloudflare uses Rust in their core edge logic and as a replacement for C, which is memory-unsafe.</p><p>Their <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare">GitHub</a> shows 18 open-source repositories that use Rust, and on their blog, they document using it for <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-we-made-firewall-rules/">Firewall Rules</a>, a very customizable firewall tool.</p><blockquote>
<p>With a mixed set of requirements of performance, memory safety, low memory use, and the capability to be part of other products that we’re working on like Spectrum, Rust stood out as the strongest option. <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/building-fast-interpreters-in-rust/">(Source)</a></p>
</blockquote><h3 id="facebook">Facebook</h3><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/lr/lrxvkela.facebook_(1).jpg" alt="Facebook uses Rust" loading="lazy"></p><p>Facebook used Rust to rewrite its source control backend, which was written in Python. They were looking for a compiled language to rewrite it in and were attracted to Rust because of its safety benefits. Since then, Rust has been adopted by the source control team. As the reasons for adoption, they mention the huge cost of bugs for Facebook and the ease of the compiler feedback loop, in contrast to static analysis and code reviews.</p><blockquote>
<p>Rust detects large classes of serious bugs at compile time. The cost of a bug at compile time is orders of magnitude less than in production.</p>

In addition, the company openly supports and sponsors the development of the language and its ecosystem.</p><p>Amazon also has open-sourced a service written entirely in Rust. <a href="https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/">Firecracker VMM</a> is a virtual machine monitor that was built for services like AWS Lambda and AWS Fargate.</p><h3 id="discord">Discord</h3><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/uz/uzwkicp6.discord_(1).jpg" alt="Discord uses Rust" loading="lazy"></p><p><a href="https://discord.com/">Discord </a>uses Rust in multiple places of their codebase, both on the client- and the server-side.</p><p>For example, the team used Rust and <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/introduction-to-elixir">Elixir</a> to scale to 11 million concurrent users<a href="https://blog.discord.com/using-rust-to-scale-elixir-for-11-million-concurrent-users-c6f19fc029d3"> through the use of Elixir NIFs</a> (Native Implemented Functions). In this case, Rust enabled them to speed up their existing Elixir codebase while keeping everything memory safe.</p><p>They have also rewritten their Read States service in Rust (originally in Go). While the Go version of the service was fast enough most of the time, it sometimes had large latency spikes due to Go’s memory model and garbage collector.</p><p>To solve that, Discord switched to Rust, which offers a unique memory allocation system that makes garbage collection unnecessary.</p><blockquote>
<p>Along with performance, Rust has many advantages for an engineering team. For example, its type safety and borrow checker make it very easy to refactor code as product requirements change or new learnings about the language are discovered. Also, the ecosystem and tooling are excellent and have a significant amount of momentum behind them. <a href="https://blog.discord.com/why-discord-is-switching-from-go-to-rust-a190bbca2b1f">(Source)</a></p>

Teams reach for it when they need extra performance but want to avoid memory issues associated with C.</p><p>But Rust has far more benefits: it makes lower-level programming more accessible, has excellent support for WASM, and is fantastic for concurrency. And I’m not even going to start to speak about the community. ❤️</p><p>In the future, expect Rust usage to increase as more and more companies discover how it can improve their codebases.</p><p>If you would like to learn more about Rust, I have compiled a quick introduction that you can check out <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/rust-guide">on our blog</a>.

November 18, 2020 | https://psyche.co/guides/use-mediation-techniques-to-overcome-the-muck-of-blame-and-anger | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://psyche.co/guides/use-mediation-techniques-to-overcome-the-muck-of-blame-and-anger">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="1"><span>Need to know</span></h2><div><p>Iâ€™m in a Zoom meeting, speaking to a screen full of black squares, trying to coax voices out of the void. The other callers are all members of an executive board, and theyâ€™re in turmoil over the strategic direction of their company. Several of them are no longer on speaking terms, and employees and shareholders have not been shielded from the drama. On a good day, these calls are tense, but more often than not theyâ€™re explosive. Only my camera is turned on, and I watch myself try to look optimistic.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m a mediator. I have helped people have difficult conversations for more than 20 years: in conflict zones and in living rooms, with leaders of corporations and foundations, and people in my own community. If youâ€™ve ever avoided or postponed a difficult conversation, youâ€™re not alone. Conflict avoidance is everywhere. At home and at work, we steer around conflict as prodigiously as we create it.</p>
<p>And yet conflict isnâ€™t inherently bad. It offers us information about how we could work with others more effectively, improve our relationships, and grow as individuals. Itâ€™s far worse to try to avoid it, because you just end up creating new conflict â€“ which ends up being more insidious and costly than the original issue.</p>
<p>When I help people have difficult conversations, weâ€™re always aiming for one of three outcomes: a solution, a plan or an understanding. A solution is a grand bargain, a resounding win, a comprehensive resolution expected to withstand the pressures of all unknown future challenges. With a mediator this can happen, but itâ€™s ambitious. We all have a tendency to hope for a dramatic and permanent solution, but this usually causes new problems by overburdening an already stressed relationship. A plan is more realistic, and is like a map for finding a solution. It leaves the precise terms of the resolution open-ended but provides a path forward. A plan reorganises the relationship with new boundaries, revised norms, and sets up shared expectations for how the trickiest parts will be navigated.</p>
<p>But the <em>most</em> realistic outcome, especially at the beginning, is to focus on reaching an understanding. An understanding is a new awareness of what the other person has experienced in the conflict; itâ€™s a mutual appreciation for one anotherâ€™s needs, fears and hopes. Reaching an understanding is feasible, provides great relief, and can lay a foundation for a plan, a solution and a new relationship.</p>
<p>For example, I recently helped a family to reach an understanding when the COVID-19 pandemic forced a college student to move back in with his parents. They were having difficulties renegotiating their relationships once they were suddenly living together again. Their renewed understanding led to a plan for new expectations and boundaries, which theyâ€™re currently using to navigate the uncertainties and discomfort of this period. I expect theyâ€™ll find their solution soon.</p>
<p>In my work as a mediator, Iâ€™ve learnt that successful conversations always involve what I call a â€˜gem statementâ€™. When two parties have listened long and hard to each other â€“ have made the heroic effort to listen curiously and empathically even when they disagree strenuously â€“ someone eventually unearths a glowing, priceless gem. It usually takes the form of a short, powerful statement, such as these two Iâ€™ve heard recently:</p>
<blockquote>Weâ€™ve kept on fighting in part because neither of us is willing to walk away from this friendship. Thatâ€™s something.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Even when we canâ€™t agree on Dadâ€™s medical care, Iâ€™ve never doubted your good intentions. I know you want the best for him.</blockquote>
<p>It happens almost every time. From the muck of blame and anger, someone lifts out a beacon. I then seize the opportunity and hold up the gleaming gem for all parties to see. It lights the way toward a new conversation revolving around compromise, solutions and goodwill.</p>
<p>In addition to gratitude for the person who dug out the gem, I have also felt impatience. Iâ€™ve wondered, <em>Why canâ€™t they say something like this earlier in the process? Or better yet, at the beginning?</em> Does the conversation need to naturally find its way to such a moment, or could we engineer it to happen much sooner? It seemed worthwhile to find out, so I developed a process to reduce the amount of time people spend digging in the muck. And Iâ€™ve found it works: when people find a gem earlier on, they experience less pain and more benefit from having their difficult conversation.</p>
<p>This Guide is to help you do this â€“ without a mediator. Mediators can be helpful during challenging times, but we donâ€™t actually resolve peoplesâ€™ conflicts. We create the conditions in which people feel heard and acknowledged, increasing the quality of their communication and problem-solving. When youâ€™re facing a tough conversation, itâ€™s not really the mediator you need â€“ itâ€™s the conditions weâ€™re good at creating and maintaining.</p>
<p>If you donâ€™t feel safe or if your situation involves illegal activity or any type of abuse, this Guide isnâ€™t right for you. In those instances, get help from a professional right away. There are also some situations that donâ€™t call for further conversation â€“ some relationships or difficulties are better left in the past, and you should trust your instinct about whether a conversation is the right step for you. But if you think talking could do some good, then this resource can help get you started.</p>
<p>Maybe you feel misunderstood or unappreciated at work. Or maybe youâ€™re caught in a recurring family pattern that causes pain and drives you <a href="https://psyche.co/guides/a-family-rift-is-locked-on-the-past-heres-how-to-move-forward" rel="noopener">away</a> from the people you love. If you feel hurt or angry when thinking of a difficult conversation you need to have, there is a good chance that the relationship is important to you. Whether itâ€™s a relationship within your family, at work or in your community, itâ€™s become this challenging because you have a vested interest, you care deeply or your future is somehow intertwined with the person you need to talk with.</p>
<p>If you feel the situation could improve if someone <em>really heard</em> what you have to say, thereâ€™s hope. If you feel ready to make an earnest effort to <em>really hear</em> someone in return, thereâ€™s even more than hope. Remember that your goal here is not to find a quick solution or plan straight away â€“ thatâ€™s tempting but unrealistic, and might backfire. Your goal is to understand each other.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="2"><span>What to do</span></h2><div><p><strong>1. Prepare for the conversation</strong></p>
<p>The first step is a thought experiment: think about the person with whom you need to talk, and allow yourself to imagine that you just finished having the best possible conversation with them. You were heard fully. Each of your concerns was addressed to your satisfaction. If an apology was appropriate, you received an excellent one. <em>Stay with this â€“ just imagine it!</em> Youâ€™ve reached an understanding that gives you confidence in the future of the relationship. <em>This is a challenging thought experiment, but youâ€™re almost thereâ€¦</em> You are relieved, you feel lighter, and even grateful to the person youâ€™ve been in conflict with.</p>
<p><strong>2. Dig out a gem</strong></p>
<p>What would you say to them in this moment? (Remember, in this exercise youâ€™ve been heard, youâ€™ve received an apology, and it went exceedingly well.) What would you say to your counterpart if all of that happened? Whatâ€™s â€˜underneathâ€™ the conflict? Whatâ€™s true when youâ€™re not consumed with negative feelings? Write down the first gem statement you think of. You can write others too, but usually the first one is the real deal.</p>
<p>Your statement should be an authentic expression of how youâ€™re feeling, but should also have significant meaning and positive impact for the other person. For example, two more gem statements I heard recently were: â€˜I can tell you care a lot about reaching our teamâ€™s goals, and I have a lot of respect for you<em>.</em>â€™ You can tell itâ€™s a gem when youâ€™re terribly tempted to tack on a grievance to the end of it. Like this: <em>I can tell you care a lot about reaching our teamâ€™s goals, </em><em><strong>but the way you go about it is causing great difficulty to everyone around you.</strong></em> If you find yourself doing this, leave out the second part. Youâ€™ll get to say it, just not here.</p>
<p><strong>3. Ask yourself if youâ€™re ready</strong></p>
<p>Are you willing to say the statement to them? We recoil from being generous and kind when we feel our counterpart doesnâ€™t deserve it. Moreover, making such statements can put us in an even more vulnerable position. If thatâ€™s the case, it might help to think of this another way. Uttering your gem statement is a temporary discomfort; the benefits youâ€™ll experience will be lasting and profound.</p>
<p>At this point, you should share this Guide with the other person. Even if you donâ€™t follow these steps closely or have the conversation right away, it will be helpful simply to both read the Guide and give thought to it. If you do proceed with a conversation, having this Guide in advance means that they will have undertaken this same process and unearthed a gem statement for you, which will likely mitigate your vulnerability and discomfort.</p>
<p><strong>4. Phone a friend</strong></p>
<p>Tell a friend who isnâ€™t involved in the conversation what youâ€™re going to do. The purpose is not to craft the gem statement together, and it isnâ€™t even to get their advice. Instead, say the four sentences below to your friend:</p><ul>
<li>The biggest emotion that Iâ€™m feeling toward the person I need to have a difficult conversation with isâ€¦</li>
<li>The biggest emotion that I expect the person is feeling toward me isâ€¦</li>
<li>The gem statement I will make to them isâ€¦</li>
<li>My hope for the conversation isâ€¦</li>
</ul><p>The fourth sentence â€“ identifying your hope for the conversation â€“ is a critical piece of your planning. Remember that the best initial outcome is achieving a new, shared understanding, rather than a comprehensive solution or a detailed plan. New understanding can bring you relief and allow space for forward movement, without expecting a miraculous resolution of all tension and …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

Analysis of the data indicates a vaccine efficacy rate of 95% (p&lt;0.0001) in participants without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (first primary objective) and also in participants with and without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (second primary objective), in each case measured from 28 days after the first dose, 7 days after the second dose. The first primary objective analysis is based on 170 cases of COVID-19, as specified in the study protocol, of which 162 cases of COVID-19 were observed in the placebo group versus 8 cases in the BNT162b2 group. Efficacy was consistent across age, gender, race and ethnicity demographics. The observed efficacy in adults over 65 years of age was over 94%.</p>  <p>There were 10 severe cases of COVID-19 observed in the trial, with nine of the cases occurring in the placebo group and one in the BNT162b2 vaccinated group. To date, the Data Monitoring Committee for the study has not reported any serious safety concerns related to the vaccine. A review of unblinded reactogenicity data from the final analysis which consisted of a randomized subset of at least 8,000 participants 18 years and older in the Phase 2/3 study demonstrates that the vaccine was well tolerated, with most solicited adverse events resolving shortly after vaccination. The only Grade 3 (severe) solicited adverse events greater than or equal to 2% in frequency after the first or second dose were fatigue at 3.8% and headache at 2.0% following dose 2. Consistent with earlier shared results, older adults tended to report fewer and milder solicited adverse events following vaccination. </p>  <p>In addition, the companies announced that the safety milestone required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) has been achieved. Pfizer and BioNTech plan to submit a request within days to the FDA for an EUA based on the totality of safety and efficacy data collected to date, as well as manufacturing data relating to the quality and consistency of the vaccine. These data also will be submitted to other regulatory agencies around the world.</p>  <p>“The study results mark an important step in this historic eight-month journey to bring forward a vaccine capable of helping to end this devastating pandemic. We continue to move at the speed of science to compile all the data collected thus far and share with regulators around the world,” said <strong>Dr. Albert Bourla, Pfizer Chairman and CEO</strong>. “With hundreds of thousands of people around the globe infected every day, we urgently need to get a safe and effective vaccine to the world.” </p>  <p>“We are grateful that the first global trial to reach the final efficacy analysis mark indicates that a high rate of protection against COVID-19 can be achieved very fast after the first 30 µg dose, underscoring the potential of BNT162 to provide early protection,” said <strong>Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech</strong>. “These achievements highlight the potential of mRNA as a new drug class. Our goal from the very beginning was to design and develop a vaccine that would generate rapid and potent protection against COVID-19 with a benign tolerability profile across all ages. We believe we have&nbsp;successfully accomplished this with our vaccine candidate BNT162b2 in all age groups studied so far and look forward to sharing further details with the regulatory authorities. I want to thank all the devoted women and men who contributed to this historically unprecedented achievement. We will continue to work with our partners and governments around the world to prepare for global distribution in 2020 and beyond.”</p>  <p>The Phase 3 clinical trial of BNT162b2 began on July 27 and has enrolled 43,661 participants to date, 41,135 of whom have received a second dose of the vaccine candidate as of November 13, 2020. Approximately 42% of global participants and 30% of U.S. participants have racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds, and 41% of global and 45% of U.S. participants are 56-85 years of age. A breakdown of the diversity of clinical trial participants can be found <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ad78-V3TIZpaI0hRxmiSbgkEJUyAXaiiyEL-ARI3BmSe5nBb577HWGg9iwQLkpFDr5Zut3MDUXtDp4gcUuk1TJMOdJQMV0I0rP8L9ghyxUs=" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a><u>&nbsp;</u>from approximately 150 clinical trials sites in United States, Germany, Turkey, South Africa, Brazil and Argentina. The trial will continue to collect efficacy and safety data in participants for an additional two years. </p>  <p>Based on current projections, the companies expect to produce globally up to 50 million vaccine doses in 2020 and up to 1.3 billion doses&nbsp;by the end of 2021. Four of Pfizer’s facilities are part of the manufacturing and supply chain; St. Louis, MO; Andover, MA; and Kalamazoo, MI in the U.S.; and Puurs in Belgium. BioNTech’s German sites will also be leveraged for global supply.</p>  <p>Pfizer is confident in its vast experience, expertise and existing cold-chain infrastructure to distribute the vaccine around the world. The companies have developed specially designed, temperature-controlled thermal shippers utilizing dry ice to maintain temperature conditions of -70°C±10°C. They can be used be as temporary storage units for 15 days by refilling with dry ice. Each shipper contains a GPS-enabled thermal sensor to track the location and temperature of each vaccine shipment across their pre-set routes leveraging Pfizer’s broad distribution network.</p>  <p>Pfizer and BioNTech plan to submit the efficacy and safety data from the study for peer-review in a scientific journal once analysis of the data is completed.</p>  <p><strong>About Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients’ Lives</strong><br>At Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

    <p>Have you played <a href="https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/">Quick, Draw!</a> yet? It’s basically Pictionary, played against a neural network, and it’s a lot of fun. Not long ago, Google released a <a href="https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset">dataset</a> of some of the millions of sketches people have drawn so far over 345 categories.</p>

<p>In this post, I’ll just be looking at sketches in the ‘flamingo’ category. You can browse a random sample <a href="https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data/flamingo">here</a>. Some of them are lovely.</p>

<p>Others, well…</p>

</figure>

<p>What if we want to automatically identify the jankiest flamingos in the dataset?</p>

<h2 id="sketch-rnn-as-probability-estimator">Sketch-RNN as probability estimator</h2>

<p>Along with the datasets, Google has released some <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta/tree/master/magenta/models/sketch_rnn#pre-trained-models">pre-trained models</a> that use the Sketch-RNN architecture described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03477">this paper</a>.</p>

<p>These models were trained to generate new sketches. For example:</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://colinmorris.github.io/assets/quickdraw/svgs/generated_flamingos.svg">
</figure>

<p>But we can also repurpose them to get some insight into existing human-generated sketches. As I talked about in an earlier post on <a href="http://colinmorris.github.io/blog/dreaming-rbms">character-level RBMs</a>, learning to generate new examples of X is basically the same as learning the probability distribution of X.</p>

<p>So in addition to sampling from the learned distribution to generate new sketches, we can take existing sketches, and ask the model how probable it thinks they are. It seems reasonable that the sketches the model assigns the lowest probabilities should be among the ‘worst’.</p>

<h2 id="good-flamingos">Good flamingos</h2>

<p>Before we roast Quickdraw’s least gifted flamingo-drawers, let’s look at some of the ‘best’ flamingo sketches - i.e. those assigned the highest probabilities:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://colinmorris.github.io/assets/quickdraw/svgs/flamingo_best.svg">
</figure>

<p>Audubon they ain’t, but these are at least mostly recognizable as flamingos. Because we’re ranking by probability, we should in some sense expect the most ‘typical’ sketches here, rather than the most beautiful.</p>

<h2 id="bad-flamingos">Bad flamingos</h2>

<p>To quote Tolstoy, <i>happy flamingos are all alike, but every garbage flamingo is garbage in its own way</i>.</p>

<p>We can broadly classify our worst birds into a few groups.</p>

<h3 id="well-intentioned-but-frankly-awful">Well-intentioned but frankly awful</h3>

<p>God bless these artists, they really tried.</p>



<p>You can check out some more examples <a href="https://colinmorris.github.io/assets/quickdraw/svgs/botflamingos_awful.svg">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="scribbles">Scribbles</h3>



<p>In most cases, the artist started out with something flamingo-like, then scratched it out in frustration. The Quickdraw dataset encodes sketches as a sequence of pen strokes, rather than just a grid of pixels, so we can actually reconstruct the history of sketches like this:</p>



<h3 id="cheating-attempts">Cheating attempts</h3>



<h3 id="wrong-category">Wrong category</h3>



<p>There are some cases where the artist was pretty clearly drawing a different Quickdraw category like ‘pineapple’, or ‘compass’. It’s not clear whether it was a glitch that landed these images in the flamingo dataset, or user error (maybe the players didn’t realize they ran out of time and were given a new category?).</p>

<h3 id="have-you-ever-even-seen-a-flamingo">Have you ever even seen a flamingo?</h3>



<p>More head-scratching examples <a href="https://colinmorris.github.io/assets/quickdraw/svgs/botflamingos_wtf.svg">here</a>. The ‘wrong category’ explanation doesn’t work for most of these, because they don’t look like any of Quickdraw’s other categories (for example, there are no categories for ‘beaver’, ‘sitar’, or ‘female skeleton doing aerobics’).</p>

<h3 id="graffiti">Graffiti</h3>

<figure>
    <img src="https://colinmorris.github.io/assets/quickdraw/svgs/graffiti_censored.svg">
</figure>

<p>Some scoundrels just treated Quickdraw like a bathroom wall. The uncensored version is <a href="https://colinmorris.github.io/assets/quickdraw/svgs/graffiti_uncensored.svg">here</a> (NSFW).</p>

<h3 id="the-unjustly-maligned">The unjustly maligned</h3>



<p>Most of what I found was garbage, but the three above are actually kind of gorgeous. Add some colour to #3 and it could be a New Yorker cover! What gives?</p>

<p>These are great drawings, and pretty recognizable as flamingos, but that doesn’t count for much. We’re not ranking by how clearly these images represent their subject (i.e. <code>P(category=flamingo | drawing)</code>), but rather how likely someone is to come up with this when asked to draw a flamingo (<code>P(drawing | category=flamingo)</code>).</p>

<p>Very few people would think to draw the legs and head, with the body out of frame, as #3 does. #1 uses unusually many short, disconnected lines, and #2 uses a unique stylized head shape.</p>

<figcaption>Left: Anonymous Quickdraw artist. Right: The American flamingo, illustrated by by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_James_Audubon">John Audubon</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The drawing above is another good example. Flamingos do bend their heads down low like that, but when asked to draw a flamingo, almost no-one thinks to pose it with its head below the horizon.</p>

<h2 id="is-this-useful">Is this useful?</h2>

<p>It totally could be!</p>

<p>Google described their dataset as being ‘individually moderated’, and you can scroll through the examples <a href="https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data/flamingo">here</a> for a long time before hitting any graffiti (and if you do find any, you can even click it to ‘flag as inappropriate’). It seems they’ve already done a pretty good job of filtering out most of the irrelevant/malicious sketches that were surely rampant in the raw data.</p>

<p>But this approach was able to easily identify a subset of sketches containing a high density of overlooked graffiti, scribbles, and irrelevant sketches. And it’s quite ‘cheap’, since it uses an existing model trained for a different purpose. If we wanted to go further, this would be a good place to start to get some labelled examples to bootstrap a graffiti classifier.</p>

<h2 id="appendix-measuring-probability">Appendix: Measuring probability</h2>

<p>(Warning: There are no more funny flamingo sketches ahead, just boring technical details.)</p>

<p>I’ve been talking about measuring the ‘probability’ a Sketch-RNN model assigns to each sketch, and ranking by those probabilities, but the truth is a little messier. There are a few complications we need to consider here.</p>

<h3 id="probability-vs-probability-density">Probability vs. probability density</h3>

<p>Sketch-RNN models the location of the pen as a continuous random variable. In this view, the probability of any stroke’s (x, y) position, and therefore of any sketch as a whole, is 0. So it makes more sense to talk about measuring the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function">probability density</a> of sketches. If A’s density is twice B’s, then A is in some sense ‘twice as likely’. (Both sketches still have probability zero, but we can measure a non-zero probability for the set of similar sketches in some tiny neighbourhood of equal size around A and B, and the probability near A will be twice as high).</p>

<h3 id="varying-lengths">Varying lengths</h3>

<p>Sketch-RNN outputs probabilities (/densities) per stroke. The natural way to get the probability (density) for a sketch as a whole would be to multiply the values for each stroke. (Densities can be multiplied together much like probabilities.)</p>

<p>However, the number of strokes per drawing in the dataset varies:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://colinmorris.github.io/assets/quickdraw/nstrokes.png">
    <figcaption>
        I couldn't find much information on how the dataset was preprocessed, but it seems pretty clear that this poor distribution has been violently amputated.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p><em>A priori</em>, we’d expect longer sketches to be less probable - every time we multiply probabilities, we get a smaller number. In language modeling, we’d control for this by measuring the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perplexity#Perplexity_per_word">perplexity per word</a> of a sentence or longer text. We can do something similar here, and measure the density per stroke.</p>

<p>(An interesting twist is that sorting by non-normalized densities, the sketches with the lowest <em>and</em> the highest values were biased toward having more strokes, which completely broke my intuition. The reason for this is that, unlike probabilities, densities can be greater than 1. If the strokes in a sketch mostly have densities greater than 1, then adding more strokes leads to a higher overall density. This doesn’t mean that strokes <code>S_1, S_2, S_3</code> are more likely than their prefix <code>S_1, S_2</code> (that’d be weird). It means that comparing the values of density functions with different dimensions is generally a bad idea.)</p>

<h3 id="what-i-actually-did">What I actually did</h3>

<p>I sorted on formula (9) in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.03477.pdf">this paper</a> - the reconstruction loss. This is basically the log density of the sketch (times the constant, <code>-1/N_max</code>). A minor deviation from (9): <code>L_p</code>, the loss with respect to pen state, is summed up to the number of strokes in the sketch,<code>N_s</code>, not the maximum strokes per sketch,<code>N_max</code>. (This is actually <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta/blob/v0.1.13/magenta/models/sketch_rnn/model.py#L298">a hidden feature of the code</a> when running in evaluation mode. I’m not sure whether the loss figures they reported e.g. in Table 1 include this tweak, but I’d be surprised if it makes much difference.)</p>

<p>The <a href="https://colinmorris.github.io/badflamingos">Bad Flamingos</a> page sorts by the loss function normalized by number of strokes. The examples on this page were mostly selected from the sketches with the worst unnormalized values. Qualitatively, both metrics gave pretty reasonable results with a high degree of overlap, but I ended up preferring the normalized version because its bottom N had a more representative distribution of lengths. The fact that unnormalized loss worked at all is basically a fluke and not something to rely on - if you rescaled the (x,y) values of pen positions to different units, it could drastically change the sort for unnormalized loss, but it wouldn’t affect <code>loss/nstrokes</code>.</p>

<p>All the code for this experiment is available <a href="https://github.com/colinmorris/sketch-rnn-experiments">here</a>.</p>

The matrix \(\mathbf{R}\) is constrained to approximate the inverse of \(\mathbf{W}\) with a reconstruction loss \(||\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{\hat{x}}||^2\). The likelihood of the data is efficiently optimized with respect to both \(\mathbf{W}\) and \(\mathbf{R}\) by approximating the gradient of the log Jacobian determinant with the learned inverse.</p><p title="Abstract">Efficient gradient computation of the Jacobian determinant term is a core problem of the normalizing flow framework. Thus, most proposed flow models either restrict to a function class with easy evaluation of the Jacobian determinant, or an efficient estimator thereof. However, these restrictions limit the performance of such density models, frequently requiring significant depth to reach desired performance levels. In this work, we propose <em>Self Normalizing Flows</em>, a flexible framework for training normalizing flows by replacing expensive terms in the gradient by learned approximate inverses at each layer. This reduces the computational complexity of each layerâ€™s exact update from \(\mathcal{O}(D^3)\) to \(\mathcal{O}(D^2)\), allowing for the training of flow architectures which were otherwise computationally infeasible, while also providing efficient sampling. We show experimentally that such models are remarkably stable and optimize to similar data likelihood values as their exact gradient counterparts, while surpassing the performance of their functionally constrained counterparts.</p><p title="Authors"><strong>T.

In this work, we focus on another relatively recent technique for learning models of complex probability distributions â€“ normalizing flows.</p><p>Normalizing flows are a powerful class of models which repeatedly apply simple invertible functions to transform basic probability distribtuions into complex target distributions. The primary goal of most work on normalizing flows is thus to develop new classes of functions which are simulatenously <em>invertible, efficient to train, &amp; maximally flexibile</em>. For a complete and insightful review of normalizing flows, and prior work in this direction, I highly recommend reading <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02762">Normalizing Flows for Probablistic Modeling and Inference (Papamakarios &amp; Nalisnick et al. 2019)</a>.</p><p>In this work, we take a simple alternative approach which achieves the above three desired properties without having to resort to restriced function classes as prior work has done. We propose a new general framework called <strong>Self Normalizing Flows</strong> for the construction and training of normalizing flows which are virtually unconstrained (maximally flexible) while also being incredibly simple to train. Our work takes inspiration from â€˜feedbackâ€™ connections observed in the biological cortex, and strives to simultaneously <em>learn the inverse</em> of each transformation performed in the flow.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Our key insight is that the normally <em>very expensive</em> gradient update required to train the forward transformation is approximately given by the parameters of the learned inverse<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> â€“ thereby entirely avoiding the \(\mathcal{O}(D^3)\) computational complexity normally required for data of dimension \(D\).</p><h2 id="background">Background</h2><p>Given an observed data point \(\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{D}\), it is assumed that \(\mathbf{x}\) is generated from an underlying (unknown) real vector \(\mathbf{z} \in \mathbb{R}^D\), through a â€˜generatingâ€™ transformation \(g(\mathbf{z}) = \mathbf{x}\). In the normalizing flow framework, we assume that \(g\) is invertible, and we denote the inverse as \(f\), such that \(f = g^{-1}\) and \(f(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{z}\). Typically, normalizing flows are composed of many of such functions, i.e. \(g(\mathbf{z}) = g_K(g_{k-1}(\dots g_2(g_1(\mathbf{z}))))\), however in this blog post we will describe flows composed of a single â€˜stepâ€™, since the proposed methods naturally extend to compositions.</p><p>The main idea behind normalizing flows is that since \(g\) is assumed to be a powerful transformation, we can transform from an <em>easy to work with</em> base distribution \(p_{\mathbf{Z}}\) (such as a Gaussian), to the true complex data distribution \(p_{\mathbf{X}}\), without having to know the data distribution directly. This transformation is achieved by the change of variables rule as follows:</p><p> $$ \begin{equation} \begin{split} p_{\mathbf{X}}(\mathbf{x}) &amp; = p_{\mathbf{Z}}(\mathbf{z}) \left|\frac{\partial \mathbf{z}}{\partial\mathbf{x}}\right|\\ \Rightarrow p^g_{\mathbf{X}}(\mathbf{x}) &amp; = p_{\mathbf{Z}}\left(g^{-1}(\mathbf{x})\right) \left|\mathbf{J}_{g^{-1}}\right| \\ \Rightarrow p^f_{\mathbf{X}}(\mathbf{x}) &amp; = p_{\mathbf{Z}}\big(f(\mathbf{x})\big) \left|\mathbf{J}_f\right|\\ \end{split} \end{equation} $$</p><div><p>Where \(\left| \mathbf{J}_f \right| = \left|\frac{\partial f(\mathbf{x})}{\partial\mathbf{x}}\right|\) is the absolute value of the determinant of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant">Jacobian</a> of the transformation between \(\mathbf{z}\) and \(\mathbf{x}\), evaluated at \(\mathbf{x}\). This term can intuitively be seen as accounting for the change of volume of the transformation between \(\mathbf{z}\) and \(\mathbf{x}\). In other words, it is the ratio of the size of an infinitesimally small volume around \(\mathbf{z}\) divided by the size of the corresponding transformed volume around \(\mathbf{x}\). We illustrate this simply with the following figure: </p><p> <img src="http://www.keller.org/assets/img/research/snf/cov_small.jpg" alt="change_of_variables" width="2121" height="969" loading="lazy"></p><p> We see then, if we parameterize a function \(f_{\theta}\) with a set of parameters \(\theta\), and pick a base distribution \(p_{\mathbf{Z}}\), we can use the above equation to maximize the probability of observed data \(\mathbf{x}\) under our induced distributions \(p_{\mathbf{X}}^f(\mathbf{x})\). </p><p> Although in theory this allows us to exactly maximize the parameters of our model to make it a <em>good</em> model of the true data distribution, in practice, having to compute the Jacobian determinant \(\left|\mathbf{J}_f\right|\) or even itâ€™s gradient \(\nabla_{\mathbf{J}_f} \left| \mathbf{J}_f \right| = \left(\mathbf{J}_f^{-1}\right)^T\) makes such an approach intractible for real data (both are \(\mathcal{O}(D^3)\) and consider even a small 256x256 image has over 65,000 dimensions).</p></div><h2 id="self-normalizing-flows">Self Normalizing Flows</h2><div><p>In this work, we take a different path than most normalizing flow literature, and instead of trying to simplify or approximate the computation of Jacobian determinant, we approximate its gradient. To do this, we leverage the inverse function theorem, which states that for invertible functions, the inverse of the Jacobian matrix is given by the Jacobian of the inverse function, i.e. \(\mathbf{J}_f^{-1} = \mathbf{J}_{f^{-1}}\). <em>Thus, if we are able approximate the inverse of \(f\), we have simultaneously achieved an approximation for the gradient required to train \(f\)</em>. In other words, if \(f^{-1} \approx g\), then \(\mathbf{J}_{f}^{-1} \approx \mathbf{J}_{g}\), and we have avoided computation of both the inverse and the Jacobian determinant.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p><p> Following this idea, we propose to define and parameterize <em>both</em> the forward and inverse functions \(f\) and \(g\) with parameters \(\theta\) and \(\gamma\) respectively. We then propose to constrain the parameterized inverse \(g\) to be approximately equal to the true inverse \(f^{-1}\) though a reconstruction loss. We can thus define our maximization objective as the mixture of the log-likelihoods induced by both models minus the reconstruction penalty constraint, i.e.:</p></div><p> $$\begin{equation} \begin{split} \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{x}) &amp; = \frac{1}{2} \log p^{f}_{\mathbf{X}}(\mathbf{x}) + \frac{1}{2} \log p^{g}_{\mathbf{X}}(\mathbf{x}) - \lambda ||g \left( f (\mathbf{x}) \right) - \mathbf{x} ||^2_2 \end{split} \end{equation}$$</p><p>We see that when \(f = g^{-1}\) exactly, this is equivalent to the traditional normalizing flow framework.</p><h2 id="examples">Examples</h2><h3 id="self-normalizing-fully-connected-layer">Self Normalizing Fully Connected Layer</h3><p>As a specific case of the above model, we consider a single fully connected layer, as exemplified in the figure at the top of this post. Let \(f(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{W} \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{z}\), and \(g(\mathbf{z}) = \mathbf{R} \mathbf{z}\), such that \(\mathbf{W}^{-1} \approx \mathbf{R}\). Taking the gradient of objective for this model, and approximating inverse matricies with their learned inverses, we get:</p><p> $$\begin{equation} \begin{split} \frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{W}} \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{x}) &amp; = \frac{1}{2} \underbrace{\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{W}} \log p_{\mathbf{Z}}(\mathbf{W} \mathbf{x}) + \mathbf{W}^{-T}\right)}_{\textstyle \approx \delta_{\mathbf{z}} \mathbf{x}^T + \mathbf{R}^T} \ - \frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{W}} \lambda \mathcal{E} \end{split} \end{equation}$$ $$\begin{equation} \begin{split} \frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{R}} \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{x}) &amp; = \frac{1}{2} \underbrace{\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{R}} \log p_{\mathbf{Z}}(\mathbf{R}^{-1} \mathbf{x}) - \mathbf{R}^{-T} \right)}_{\textstyle \approx - \delta_{\mathbf{x}} \mathbf{z}^T - \mathbf{W}^T}\ - \frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{R}} \lambda \mathcal{E} \\ \end{split} \end{equation}$$</p><p>where \(\mathcal{E}\) denotes the reconstruction error, \(\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{W}} \lambda \mathcal{E} = 2\lambda \mathbf{R}^T(\hat{\mathbf{x}} - \mathbf{x}) \mathbf{x}^T\), \(\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{R}} \lambda \mathcal{E} = 2\lambda (\hat{\mathbf{x}} - \mathbf{x})\mathbf{z}^T\), …</p></article></div>

    <p>Law to include the strongest fines among G7 for privacy laws</p> 
<p><strong>November 17, 2020</strong> – Ottawa, Ontario</p> 
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed how Canadians live, work, access information and connect with each other, making digital technology more important than ever. The Government of Canada is committed to ensuring that Canadians can interact in this digital space trusting that their personal information is safe and secure and that their privacy is respected.</p> 
<p>Today, the Honourable Navdeep Bains, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, introduced the proposed Digital Charter Implementation Act, 2020, which modernizes the framework for the protection of personal information in the private sector.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This legislation takes a number of important steps to ensure that Canadians will be protected by a modern and responsive law and that innovative businesses will benefit from clear rules, even as technology continues to evolve, including:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>increasing control and transparency when Canadians’ personal information is handled by companies;</li> 
 <li>giving Canadians the freedom to move their information from one organization to another in a secure manner;</li> 
 <li>ensuring that Canadians have the ability to demand that their information be destroyed;</li> 
 <li>providing the Privacy Commissioner with broad order-making powers, including the ability to force an organization to comply and the ability to order a company to stop collecting data or using personal information; and</li> 
 <li>ensuring the strongest fines among G7 privacy laws—with fines of up to 5% of revenue or $25 million, whichever is greater, for the most serious offences.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>The proposed Digital Charter Implementation Act, 2020 builds a foundation of trust and transparency between citizens, companies and government, while ensuring that innovators and businesses benefit from a modernized framework with clear rules.</p> 
<p>The proposed act is an initial step toward a comprehensive reform of Canada’s privacy framework. The Government of Canada is also proposing to modernize the <em>Privacy Act</em>, which applies to the federal public sector and which the Privacy Commissioner of Canada also oversees.&nbsp;<strong></strong></p>

	<p><i>November 18th 2020</i></p>

	<p>Six months ago, I set myself the goal of creating one tiny project each week.</p> 

	<p>My main aim was to get better at testing out all the ideas I had written down in my phone, but not actually done anything with.</p>

	<p>26 weeks later, and a quick glance of this website, you'll notice I've launched 6 things.</p>

	<p>Although I'm 20 projects short, it's not all bad. My projects are generating some passive income, I've gone from no online following, to a few hundred twitter followers, and I've had a great time building weird and wonderful internet things.</p>

	<p>In this post I'll give an update on how these projects are performing, and the pros and cons of launching micro-businesses.</p>

	<p>Let's rewind.</p>

	<h3>💡 <a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/projects/tiny_website" target="_blank">Tiny Website</a></h3>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Page views: <b>129,000</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Unique users: <b>58,000</b></i></li>
		<li><i>HN Upvotes: <b>348</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Cost: <b>£10.00</b></i></li>
	</ul>

	<p>Tiny Projects was born the day after my 25th birthday. Project #1 is this bare-bones tiny website that you're reading right now.</p>

	<p>When it launched, the only content on this website was a blog post, a guide on making tiny websites, and an update about my goals.</p>

	<p>Randomly, I decided to submit my blog post "Tiny websites are great" onto Hacker News. Over the next 24 hours it hit the top of the front page, bringing 25k users to this site in its first day. It was absolutely thrilling.</p>

	<p>As a double whammy, the guide I'd produced also hit the top of the learn programming sub-reddit with 1.3k upvotes.</p>

	<p>Somehow, I'd managed to hit a homerun with no idea what I was doing. Pageviews, followers and emails were flying in fast. Anyone who has produced a bit of viral content on the internet will know, the dopamine rush is insane.</p> 

	<h3>🌐 <a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/projects/silicon_valley_domain_names" target="_blank">Silicon Valley Domain names</a></h3>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Page views: <b>28,500</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Unique users: <b>25,500</b></i></li>
		<li><i>HN Upvotes: <b>410</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Cost: <b>£76.25</b></i></li>
	</ul>

	<p>Funnily enough, my second Tiny Project was the only one I actually completed in a week. Spurred on by the previous project, I was keen to replicate my success.</p>

	<p>I wanted to investigate domain names. Specifically, was it possible to buy a google.x domain name? It was an investigative piece with a bit of coding sprinkled in.</p>

	<p>Completing this project in a week was gruelling. My day-job was neglected, and I pulled some very long hours. However, 7 days later, I hit publish on my second blog post: "I bought netflix.soy".</p>

	<p>Again, I posted it on Hacker News. It became the most viral thing I've written.</p>

	<p>The Tiny Projects website received 28k page views, and the post got 410 upvotes. Hundreds of followers and emails again poured in.</p>

	<p>Writing two viral pieces back-to-back made me question what I was really doing. Somehow I'd  stumbled into writing click-baity blog posts for Hacker News instead of building tiny projects.</p>

	<p>6 months on, I still own all the domains I purchased for this project except the Facebook one. Damn you Zuck.</p>

	<h3>⚔️ <a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/projects/battle_royale" target="_blank">8-bit Battle Royale</a></h3>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Downloads: <b>25</b></i></li>
		<li><i>HN Upvotes: <b>3</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Revenue: <b>£0.00</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Cost: <b>£36.71</b></i></li>
	</ul>

	<p>For my third tiny project, I decided I wanted to make an online game.</p>

	<p>With minimal knowledge of Unity, I cobbled together a tiny battle royale game called "Wee Royale" in 2 weeks and launched it on Android.</p>

	<p>Posting this project write up on Hacker News got zero attention. I expected this, as it didn't really fit the usual HN content, but I was still disappointed. My brain had been jaded by the massive numbers of the first two posts.</p>

	<p>Wee Royale currently has 25 downloads on the Google Play Store. I'm actually not sure if the game still works though.</p>

	<p>Overall, Wee Royale was a flop, but it was hilarious to play it with my friends.</p>

	<h3>🛍️ <a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/projects/one_item_store" target="_blank">One Item Store</a></h3>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Page views: <b>1,500</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Stores: <b>1,400</b></i></li>
		<li><i>PH Upvotes: <b>83</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Revenue: <b>£1.63</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Cost: <b>£41.00</b></i></li>
	</ul>

	<p>With a minimalist design, and the tag line "just sell your stuff", One Item Store lets anyone create an online shop in minutes to sell their goods.</p>

	<p>After two weeks of building my micro e-commerce platform, I launched it on Product Hunt. At the end of the day I finished on the homepage with 83 upvotes.</p>

	<p>Today, people have created over 1400 stores, selling everything from t-shirts, to human beings. I've seen some very strange things.</p>

	<p>In total, £163.09 has flowed through One Item Store checkouts, mainly from a car dealership in Australia offering deals throughout the pandemic. I take a small 1% fee on every transaction, netting me a small fortune of £1.63.</p>

	<p>Although its not a significant amount, this was my first Tiny Projects internet money! The best thing is, One Item Store makes money without me having to do anything.</p>

	<p>One Item Store is a Tiny Project I'd like to continue building. My next step would be to add some better checkout designs, and make the website look a bit more legit.</p>

	<h3>📗 <a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/projects/snormal" target="_blank">Snormal</a></h3>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Page views: <b>2,000</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Users: <b>200</b></i></li>
		<li><i>PH Upvotes: <b>59</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Revenue: <b>£0.00</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Cost: <b>£10.00</b></i></li>
	</ul>

	<p>Snormal is a social network for everything that doesn't make it onto your Instagram highlight reel. A typical post on Snormal is something like: "Dude, I just ate a whole baguette in bed".</p>

	<p>I launched Snormal with zero intentions of making any money. It was a bit of a social experiment to see if people were becoming as jaded with social media as me.</p>

	<p>After 1 month of building, and an accidental Product Hunt launch, Snormal has gone on to gain 200 registered users, who have scrolled 4432 times on the discover feed.</p>

	<p>Its incredibly fun running a micro-social network.</p>

	<p>Two weeks after Snormal launched, I hadn't implemented comments on posts. When I finally added them, it felt godlike letting people finally talk to each other.</p>

	<p>Growth on Snormal slowly increasing. For some strange reason it has become popular in Portugal. Have a scroll now, and you'll see loads of statuses in Portugese.</p>

	<h3>💸 <a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/projects/earlyname" target="_blank">Earlyname</a></h3>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Page views: <b>10,000</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Subscribers: <b>1,500</b></i></li>
		<li><i>PH Upvotes: <b>274</b></i></li>
		<li><i>MRR: <b>$200.00</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Cost: <b>$108.20</b></i></li>
	</ul>

	<p>Earlyname helps you claim rare usernames (like @ben or @alice) on new, emerging social platforms. Currently it is generating $200/month.</p>

	<p>Running Earlyname is so much fun. I get to talk with founders, try out new products, do a bit of web scraping/automation, and find rare usernames for people.</p>

	<p>The only downside is that it requires my input every month to produce a new email. I'm anxious for the month I can't find any new social platforms.</p>

	<p>At present, Earlyname has 1500 subscribers on its email list, a number which thankfully seems to be growing naturally.</p>

	<p>Although its currently only at $200/mo, its cool to think Earlyname is generating $2k/year. My plan is to keep plugging away launching monthly newsletters and see how high that monthly revenue number can get.</p>

	<h3>👍 Positives of Tiny Projects</h3>

	<p>I believe there's a big advantage to this "micro-bet" approach of launching many tiny businesses, and then sticking with the ones that become successful.</p>

	<p>Firstly, it drastically reduces the risk of putting too much time into an idea that doesn't quite work. Even if you stumbled across a decent idea that did work, what if there's an amazing one just around the corner? It keeps you on your toes.</p>

	<p>Creating lots of tiny businesses also keeps things fun and interesting. This is probably the most important factor for me.</p>

	<p>Feeling obligued to keep building something that you've sunk hundreds of hours into but no longer enjoy sounds like my personal hell.</p>

	<p>With tiny projects, the stakes are so low, I can kill a project with no guilt and build something else, or just bounce between the projects I want to work on.</p>

	<h3>👎 Negatives of Tiny Projects</h3>

	<p>My original plan was to launch one tiny project each week, however I've realised this is an insane schedule. You can't build or document anything meaningful in this time.</p>

	<p>This schedule might be possible if I treated Tiny Projects full-time like a YouTuber. But, I don't think going all in on Micro-SaaS businesses would be very fun with the revenue they're currently generating.</p>

	<p>1-2 months is a more reasonable tiny project timeframe. It gives you enough time to build something with substance, and test the idea thoroughly.</p>

	<p>One major downside of launching lots of things is that you become way too happy to give up on a project when it doesn't show instant success.</p>

	<p>Perhaps if I spent more time on marketing, or slightly pivoted a project, I could see more success. Currently, I'm more inclined to just start something new.</p>

	<p>Maintaining lots of software can also become a bit of a burden. Once the domain name renewal date comes around, I'll have to make some decisions as to whether a project lives on for another year or not.</p>

	<h3>🔮 Conclusions &amp; The Future</h3>

	<p>I feel like I'm trying to learn the skill of generating better ideas, and rapidly building and launching them into a business.</p>

	<p>I try to think about this process like going for a run. The more runs I do, the faster and fitter I'll be. The more projects I launch, the better and more profitable they'll be.</p>

	<p>How often does someone build &amp; launch a business in their lifetime? I'm hoping that by doing this process over and over again, I'll discover some really interesting things.</p>
	
	<p>My main goal for the next six months of Tiny Projects is to learn how to get better at making money on the internet from my projects.</p>

	<p>A Product Hunt launch can easily get you a spike in traffic, but afterwards I really don't know what I'm doing. There's this whole other level afterwards called "sales &amp; marketing" that I want to master.</p>

	<p>Another goal is to also be more consistent with my writing. Hopefully, this ultimately means you'll be hearing a lot more things from me!</p>

	<p>It was nice to catch up.</p>

  <h2>Remote work is a once-in-a-generation chance for rebalancing the economy. Here is the problem, solution, and next steps for governments &amp; local bodies</h2>
  
  <p><img src="https://remote-tools-images.s3.amazonaws.com/Art_Of_Managing_Male_Final.png" width="100%" max-width="700px" alt="Remote work is our once-in-a-generation chance to rebalance the economy"></p><p>Last week, Deutsche bank came up with an absurd suggestion of having a <a target="_blank" href="https://remoteclan.com/s/klhjgx/deustche_bank_study_poses_question">5% privilege tax for those who work remotely</a>. Their argument: when people work from home, they use less of public infrastructure &amp; the entire ecosystem surrounding the office suffers. So the tax helps give a push to the economy. Not only is this a very narrow view of the impact of remote work at scale but it also completely ignores a large-scale economy problem that can be fixed with remote working. This is a once-in-a-generation chance of rebalancing the economy, so we have to act now else it's no use.</p><br>
<h2>Problem: Regional inequality = Overcrowded &amp; expensive metropolitan cities</h2>
<p>Post the industrial era, many technological &amp; economical forces have fuelled the rise of cities. Over the years, this has caused overcrowding of metropolitan cities. <a target="_blank" href="https://voxeu.org/article/return-regional-inequality-europe-1900-today">This study</a> of Europe from 1900 to today shows that 1980 was a point of inflection after which the migration to big cities &amp; the gap of regional inequality has only increased.</p>
<p>Governments have been trying hard to reduce this regional inequality e.g. financial incentives or lower taxes to attract big employers. But nothing has worked at scale to lure people away from a handful of cities.</p><br>
<h2>Solution: Large-scale migration from big cities to tier-2 cities &amp; towns, thanks to remote work</h2>
<p>The sudden remoteness situation due to Covid19 and its permanent impact on our way of working has opened up a new, rare possibility - people dispersing from a few overcrowded, expensive cities to tier-2 cities &amp; towns while retaining their good jobs.</p>
<p>The shift, when it happens, would also be a more organic one compared to governments persuading employers &amp; individuals to move away from cities. The great thing is that governments just need to act as catalysts in facilitating this transition which is already happening.</p><br>
<h2>This chance of rebalancing the economy is not to be wasted. Next steps for governments &amp; local bodies:</h2>
<p>As I said, the lure to move away from cities is already taken care of by the pandemic. Governments just need to make more the transition more easier &amp; lucrative.</p>
<p>Here's a few recommendations for local &amp; national policymakers of things that can be done in tier-2 cities &amp; towns:</p>
<p>1. Ensuring availability of fast broadband internet (we have written more about the necessity of this <a href="https://www.remote.tools/remote-work/remote-work-bill-of-rights" target="_blank">here</a>).<br>2. Setting up &amp; repairing basic public services (e.g. schools, transport, hospitals) which are preconditions for a good place to live &amp; raise a family.<br>3. Setting up co-working spaces &amp; mobile offices.<br>4. One-time incentive or bonus if people make the move from cities to towns.<br>5. Rubbishing claims of any kind of tax or pay cuts for working remotely (no-brainer, but just calling it out).</p>
<p>Local governments have instituted such programs in the past &amp; they can serve as great inspirations, e.g. <a target="_blank" href="https://tulsaremote.com/">Tulsa Remote</a>.</p>
<p>Regional inequality poses huge problems and we have got this one chance in many decades to actually fix it. Let's make sure we don't lose out on this one :)</p>

        <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><h2>Food stays fresh during the lockdown with remote cold storage monitoring.</h2>
<p>Due to the <a href="https://www.disruptive-technologies.com/blog/post-covid-confidence" target="_self">COVID-19 lock-down</a>, a global restaurant chain in the UK (ca. 100 locations) was facing a cold monitoring problem: How to monitor daily freezers as per <a href="https://www.food.gov.uk/topic/storage-refrigeration" target="_self">UK regulations</a> when employees are not on location?</p>
<p>The risk was to compromise more than <strong>£1.25 million </strong>in food stock, generating a financial and environmental disaster. Without a possibility to remotely monitor the temperature in each freezer and to act accordingly if necessary, the global chain would not have been able to ensure that the food stayed at a correct and safe temperature after reopening, leaving them no choice but to throw away their entire inventory.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2>A Sensor-Based Remote Monitoring Solution = A Quick Response to Extraordinary Circumstances</h2>
<p>In a few days, our customer needed a solution that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allowed them to remotely monitor the temperature in each of their 100 freezers all across the UK, in real-time, 24/7.</li>
<li>Offered the possibility to send alerts directly to the regional manager if any malfunctions were detected</li>
<li>They can install very easily and quickly, with no technical skills required</li>
</ul>
<p>Within three days, the Infogrid <a href="https://www.disruptive-technologies.com/smart-cold-storage" target="_self">cold storage solution powered by Disruptive Technologies</a> was implemented in all locations. Then, when needed, alerts allowed their staff to move food to a functioning freezer or to fix malfunctioning ones. As a result, ensuring the correct storage, more than <strong>£1.25 million in food inventory was saved</strong>. That amounts to <strong>cost savings of 4,462.04%.</strong></p>
<p>In addition, thanks to the 24/7 monitoring system (compared to the daily physical monitoring), eight freezers have been identified as not operating within the expected parameters and temperature incidents have been detected on five others.</p>

<blockquote><span><em>Crisis averted thanks to Infogrid. I was so impressed at the speed and ease at which we were able to install sensors across every site and start collecting data. Not only did it save £1.25m of food stock, but it also helped us to manage our sites remotely during lockdown, and automatically alerted us about multiple faults with our freezers." </em></span></blockquote>

<h2>Remote Cold Storage Monitoring Examples</h2>
<h3>#1 - Optimal Freezer Operation Example</h3>

<p><img src="https://www.disruptive-technologies.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/20200930%20-%20DT%20-%20TGI%20Fridays%20Case%20study-2.png" alt="good freezer operation example"></p>

<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Regular moves within the defrost cycle. </strong>The freezer moves consistently from 0.5-1.0°C, then has a regular (typically every 3 hours) defrost cycle where it warms and cools more than 5°C in more than 1 hour.</li>
<li><strong>The temperature stays within the threshold. </strong>The freezer stays within the alert parameters. During the defrosting cycle, temperatures may pop above the threshold for less than 1.5hrs, presenting no risk to food safety.</li>
</ol>
<h3>#2 - Outside Temperature Range Alert Example</h3>

<p><img src="https://www.disruptive-technologies.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/20200930%20-%20DT%20-%20TGI%20Fridays%20Case%20study-3.png" alt="outside temperature range alert example"></p>

<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Freezer breaches alert parameters. </strong>The freezer goes above -14°C for more than 1.5 hrs. An alert triggers, informing the company’s Regional Director that food may be at risk and to follow predetermined emergency freezer monitoring procedures. The freezer spends less than 4 hours outside the recommended parameters and then returns to its normal operation following the incident.</li>
</ol>
<h3>#3 - Poor Defrosting Cycle Example</h3>

<p><img src="https://www.disruptive-technologies.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/20200930%20-%20DT%20-%20TGI%20Fridays%20Case%20study.png" alt="freezer defrosting cycle example"></p>

<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Poor defrost cycle identified. </strong>The freezer’s normal running temperature was identified as acceptable at -18°C, but it’s defrosting cycle moved almost 45°C to +25°C in less than an hour, posing a significant risk to food safety. The food stock was moved from the freezer.</li>
<li><strong>Engineer called. </strong>An engineer visited the premises and repaired the freezer, which is now operating within normal limits.</li>
</ol>
<h3>#4 - Freezer Malfunction Example</h3>

<p><img src="https://www.disruptive-technologies.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/20200930%20-%20DT%20-%20TGI%20Fridays%20Case%20study-1.png" alt="freezer malfunction example"></p>

<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Broken freezer. </strong>On installation, the freezer’s temperature ranged from 0°C to +14°C, confirming that it was likely broken. The food stock was removed from the freezer and disposed of.</li>
<li><strong>Engineer called. </strong>An engineer visited the premises and repaired the freezer, which is now operating within normal limits.</li>

            <div>
                <p>GitLive 8.0 includes a new  <a href="#cherry-picking">cherry picking</a> feature, which allows you to seamlessly share code with your teammates. There are also a number of additional updates to this version that we hope you will find useful:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#cursor-position-indicators-while-collaborating">Cursor position indicators while collaborating</a> - Keep track of your teammate’s caret when editing together with cursor position indicators in the gutter.</li>
  <li><a href="#support-for-the-debugger-while-editing-together">Support for following when using the debugger</a> - The real time editing feature, cursor following, now works when using your IDEs debugging functionality.</li>
  <li><a href="#support-for-installation-free-github-integration-on-jetbrains-ides">Support for installation-free Github integration on JetBrains IDEs</a> - With any JetBrains IDE, you can now use GitLive without having to install the app on your GitHub organisation.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="cherry-picking">Cherry Picking</h4>
<p>Live diffs allow easy access to your teammates local changes relative to the remote state and were included as part of the <a href="https://blog.git.live/teamhub-1-5-now-available-with-live-diffs">1.5 release of GitLive</a>. To seamlessly apply your teammate changes to your own file, GitLive introduces Cherry Picking.</p>

<p>Click on your teammate’s working copy and select the Cherry Pick option. Once you accept the changes, you will have your teammate’s changes in your local copy.</p>

<h4 id="cursor-position-indicators-while-collaborating">Cursor position indicators while collaborating</h4>
<p>Since launching real-time editing in the <a href="https://blog.git.live/gitlive-6.0-Code-together-in-real-time">6.0 release of GitLive</a>, we’ve received valuable feedback on how to improve the experience of real-time collaboration further.
This is why we have introduced cursor position indicators in the gutter allowing you to conveniently track your teammates position in the file relative to yours. This comes in handy when working together in large files.</p>

<h4 id="support-for-the-debugger-while-editing-together">Support for the debugger while editing together</h4>
<p>GitLive’s real time editing feature, which allows you to follow a teammate’s cursor as they make changes, is now available while using the debugger. Hitting a breakpoint or selecting a different frame in the call stack will now cause followers to jump to the same line. Breakpoints in your code don’t have to lead to breakdowns in communication!</p>

<h4 id="support-for-installation-free-github-integration-on-jetbrains-ides">Support for installation-free GitHub integration on JetBrains IDEs</h4>
<p>Good news for Github users: You can now use GitLive in any Jetbrains IDE without having to install the GitLive App on your GitHub organisation. To do this, make sure your GitHub account is set up correctly in your IDE under <span><em>Settings -&gt; Version Control -&gt; GitHub</em></span>. After that, all you have to do is open a new or existing repository, sign in to GitLive and you should see the window below appear. Since installing an app on an organisation often requires checks and approvals, this gives you a way to skip these steps and get started with GitLive straight away!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p><br>At RedHunt Labs, we regularly perform various internet-wide studies under <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://redhuntlabs.com/blog/project-resonance-wave-0.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://redhuntlabs.com/blog/project-resonance-wave-0.html" target="_blank">Project Resonance</a></strong>, to keep up with ever-changing cyberspace as well as to enrich our product <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://redhuntlabs.com/nvadr" data-type="URL" data-id="https://redhuntlabs.com/nvadr" target="_blank"><strong>NVADR</strong></a>. This blog post is about one of our recent studies related to misconfigured CNAME records that can cause subdomain takeovers on a massive scale.</p>



<h3>Introduction to Subdomain Takeover</h3>



<p>DNS is the backbone of the internet. It is often called the internet’s phone book as it maps human-perceivable domain names to IP addresses that computers understand. Without DNS, there wouldn’t be online websites that can be remembered. There’s no google.com, twitter.com, or redhuntlabs.com, just a weird sequence of numbers.</p>



<p>A domain can be pointed to an IP address or another domain/host using DNS records such as A, CNAME, DNAME, etc. A domain/subdomain cannot be taken over, when both the DNS record and the resource it points to (IP or another domain), is under control. If the owner of the domain loses ownership of the resource the DNS record points to, the resource itself might become claimable.</p>



<p>Here are a few <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.hackerone.com/hacktivity" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.hackerone.com/hacktivity" target="_blank">HackerOne</a></strong> reports showing how attackers claimed the resources pointed by stale DNS records of famous companies. <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hackerone.com/hacktivity?querystring=subdomain%20takeover" target="_blank">Searching</a><a href="https://hackerone.com/hacktivity?querystring=subdomain%20takeover"> for it on HackerOne</a> </strong>gives 100+ such reports. Few reports show how attackers were able to exploit / bypass other web app functionalities with the help of this vulnerability.</p>







<h3>How does it work?</h3>



<p>Let’s say a developer wants to create a web app for his newly created organization. A decade ago, this process would be something similar to this: buy/lease an IP address, host your website on the server and point the DNS record to this IP. This process remained the same even if you wanted to host a static website or a landing page.</p>



<p>With the increase of Cloud and other SaaS services, now all the developer needs to do is use a service to host the website and point the DNS record to the resource. For example, at Heroku, such a domain/subdomain would take the form “<em>newproject.herokuapp.com”</em>. The developer will ultimately want the web app to appear to be hosted on a domain/subdomain (say, <em>app.neworg.com</em>) of his own organization’s domain. Therefore, he makes use of a CNAME record which is configured to forward all queries to his organization’s subdomain, i.e. <em>app.neworg.com</em>, to the cloud provider’s subdomain, <em>newproject.herokuapp.com</em>, where the web app is hosted.</p>

<p>Now the potential for a subdomain takeover occurs when the webpage hosted at the cloud provider is deleted but the DNS entry is retained. The attacker simply now re-registers the host at the cloud provider, adds the organization’s subdomain as an alias, and thus controls what content is hosted. Since the stale CNAME records originally have not been removed, <em>app.neworg.com </em>starts serving the attacker-controlled content.</p>



<p>In a similar way, another variant is known as “second-order subdomain takeovers” or more popularly, “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://edoverflow.com/2017/broken-link-hijacking/" target="_blank"><strong>broken-link hijacking</strong></a>” occurs when the potentially vulnerable subdomains are used to serve content on the target’s website but they do not necessarily belong to the target. This means that the resource is being served on the webpage, for example, via a blob of JavaScript, and the attacker can claim the subdomain from which the resource is being imported. Second-order takeovers usually have a lesser impact than the earlier, but still pose a significant threat from an organization’s perspective.</p>



<h3>What we did.</h3>



<p>Our motivation was to perform a survey and analyze the status quo of vulnerable domains/subdomains in the present cyberspace. We conducted an internet-wide survey consisting of approximately 220 million hosts collected by our thousands of bots collecting various kinds of asset information from all over the internet. A database was created which contained CNAME records and related fingerprints of several vulnerable platforms, many of which we ingeniously studied to see if they can be taken over (if added as a service) as well as picked some of them that are already known to be vulnerable.</p>



<p>An automation setup was designed to effectively perform the task of checking whether the domains/subdomains were vulnerable to takeover. </p>

<p>The entire setup consisted of mainly 3 components:</p>



<ul><li><strong>DNS Resolving</strong>: This component was mainly entitled to the task of mass resolving domains to their CNAME records by making DNS queries. It took input from the input-queue consisting of domains/subdomains and generated an output compatible with the HTTP component.</li><li><strong>HTTP Response Grabbing</strong>: The output from the DNS resolving entity was fed into this element, which did with the task of making mass HTTP queries to the domains and look for potential takeovers.</li><li><strong>Filtering &amp; Analysis</strong>: This component took the load of filtering out false positives from the results obtained through several layers before flagging a domain as vulnerable. This constituent also performed an analysis of the data obtained.</li></ul>



<p>The system was designed to intelligently detect possible takeovers while handling all kinds of exceptions and keeping in mind other complications of the HTTP protocol. The tool was also suited to follow the pattern of the database which was created. The flowchart below defines the overall logic around which the tool functioned:</p>

<p>Taking a deep dive at the statistics generated by our research, surprised us by the massive numbers. The first thing that came to our notice was the fact a total of 33 services that (unintentionally) allowed for potential subdomain takeovers, were identified. Interestingly, a large percent (62%) of vulnerable DNS records pointed to Shopify. This also indicates that most of the vulnerable domains belonged to the E-commerce industry, signifying that e-commerce still remains largely affected by security issues.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the other half of results, Unbounce (landing pages creator) ranked second highest in the vulnerable share consuming about 14% of vulnerable domains, followed by Heroku (9%), GitHub Pages (4%), Bigcartel (2%), Tumblr (1%), Webflow (1%) and Pantheon (1%). The remainder 20% of the shares consisted mostly of WordPress, Surge.sh, AWS, etc, with HelpJuice comprising the least of the shares (just 15 takeovers).</p>



<p>Diving deeper into the results obtained, our first and foremost observation was that amongst Alexa Top 1000 domains, we identified 139 possible takeovers. </p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Overall, we identified a total of 424,120 subdomains had misconfigured CNAME records, and were prone to take over across the internet. It simply means that organizations still have a huge number of assets (subdomains, in this case) which are untracked and hence potentially vulnerable to subdomain takeover. </p></blockquote></figure>

<p>A very significant pattern which we observed was that interestingly the most common vulnerable subdomain was&nbsp; <em>”www”</em>, which means most of the stale records pointed to the “home subdomain” of the sites. The next popular subdomain name was <em>“shop”</em>, followed by <em>“store”</em> and <em>“blog”</em>.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Since Chrome 69, Google has decided to strip the “www” and “m” subdomains from the URL displayed in the browser’s address bar. So if such a subdomain get compromised, for a normal user, it becomes quite difficult to figure out that it might be browsing attacker-controlled content.</p></blockquote></figure>







<p>Analyzing all the domains within our database, we also found ~200 non-functional <em>.gov</em> site subdomains prone to takeover. An extremely mind-boggling observation here was that one of the domains had implemented a wildcard CNAME record, and the service to which it was pointing was non-existent (i.e. claimable). <em>The security impact of such a case is beyond comprehension because a wildcard CNAME entry implies that *.site.tld will resolve, signifying that once the service has been taken over, not only the existing ones but non-existent subdomains of the site will also resolve to the attacker-controlled service.</em></p>



<p>We also observed that several (around ~1K) subdomains were <em>.edu</em> sites that were vulnerable to takeover. Unbounce and Pantheon were among the top popular vulnerable services within the <em>.edu</em> domains. The results included subdomains from a lot of prestigious universities. This also sheds some light on the kind of infrastructure that some of the top educational sites use.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the other hand, healthcare, wellness, and fitness sites too consumed a significant share of the vulnerable subdomains (around ~5K). In this case, Unbounce and Strikingly took the top places in vulnerable services. A worth noting point in this section is the diverse set of results that had been harvested, which ranged from sellers of pharmaceutical items to online consultancy services, from fitness centers to healthcare gear distributors, denoting that all of them were significantly affected by security issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The sports and gaming section too had around ~4K takeovers while the entertainment sector consumed a minor share (around 500). Similar to the health sector, this too affected a wide range of offerings, from several video game retailers to sport-specific training providers. The list is long and we can continue reading from our insights but we just decided to focus on the major ones for now.</p>



<h3>Implications of a takeover.</h3>



<p>Following an attacker’s perspective, such takeovers can be abused in several ways:</p>



<ul><li>Since a subdomain represents a part of the organization, a subdomain takeover can allow an attacker to serve malicious content or misguiding information and thus cause Brand Reputation loss, User Distrust and Negative PR.</li><li>It has <strong><a href="https://whitehatnepal.tumblr.com/post/149985438982/how-i-was-able-to-read-uber-logs-and-internal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously come to light</a></strong> that internal emails can be actively intercepted just by claiming a simple webhook of the third-party service (e.g. <em>Sendgrid</em>) which an application might be using for email marketing.&nbsp;</li><li>OAuth whitelisting of a vulnerable subdomain might be a cause of trouble, because an attacker can …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>In this series of articles, I will show full process of creating a UI design for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.amortizedcost.batchimageshrinker">Batch Image Shrinker</a> (<a href="market://details?id=net.amortizedcost.batchimageshrinker">Google play link</a>) mobile application which I did by myself. As a software developer always I've been thinking that UI design is not for me, that it's complex and requires some art skill or something.</p>
<p>It's a myth and I will try to debunk it.</p>
<p>I will show you that UI design is for everyone, you just need to know some basic technics and a couple of tricks.</p>
<p>It's not going to be easy, but I promise you it will be very interesting.</p>
<h2 id="dominatingcolor">Dominating color</h2>
<p>With the dominating presence of dark-mode, I noticed that for me it was easier to work with darker colors as baseline colors than with brighter ones, and since  I almost always use dark-mode of the applications, so I wanted to have something similar in my application. I was certain that I didn't want to use <a href="https://colornames.org/color/3b5998">Facebook blue</a> color and it's successors, so I had to find something more futuristic and brave than that. My choice fell on <code>#464d77</code> which is a very intense dark blue, almost purple color.</p>
<p><img src="http://amortizedcost.net/content/images/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-17-at-20.10.09.png" alt="Screenshot-2020-11-17-at-20.10.09"></p>
<p>Common advice here will be not to use pure black or white colors, which, as perfectly described in <a href="https://ianstormtaylor.com/design-tip-never-use-black/">the article</a>, hardly present in the real-world color pallet. <em>What a coincidence, I found <a href="https://lawsofux.com/aesthetic-usability-effect.html">a website</a> with a perfect example of dark background color and great content to read.</em></p>
<h2 id="colorpalette">Color palette</h2>
<p>Of cause, just one baseline color will not be enough to build a feature-rich application. You will need a couple of colors for different types of components like buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc. Another one or two colors will be needed for the text itself. Also,  some gradients for several states of a component, such as "active", "disabled", "pressed". So before creating an actual UI, we will need to have a rich pallet of colors to work with. In my case, I ended up with 6 colors in total which was more than enough to create a simple yet interesting UI.</p>
<p>This step is much easier than the previous one, because here we will be either reusing or generating new color pallets using the baseline color from the previous part.</p>
<p>The generator which I was using is <a href="https://coolors.co/palettes/popular/f9db6d">this</a>. Here you could either put the color hex into a search bar or simply choose the pallet from the <a href="https://coolors.co/a1e8af-94c595-747c92-372772-3a2449">hundreds</a> of pre-generated ones. If the color range is not enough for you, try to extend it with <a href="https://learnui.design/tools/data-color-picker.html#palette">another</a> good palette generator. Put on the left side the baseline color and select how many colors you will need.</p>
<p>Pro-tip, you can combine those tools to get even more combinations. As you can see here, I was using a baseline color on the right side and colors from <a href="https://coolors.co/464d77-36827f-f9db6d-f4eded-877666">the palette</a> as values for the right side of the generator:</p>
<p><img src="http://amortizedcost.net/content/images/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-16-at-23.50.31.png" alt="Screenshot-2020-11-16-at-23.50.31"><br>
<img src="http://amortizedcost.net/content/images/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-16-at-23.51.04.png" alt="Screenshot-2020-11-16-at-23.51.04"></p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with the results try to get back to choosing the baseline color and repeat the whole process again. Since we are learning it's ok to do multiple roundtrips until your gut feelings tell you that that is it.</p>
<p>Once we are done with the color schema we are good to go to we move to the next step - choosing fonts, which will be covered next time.</p>

	<p>PLEASE don't use FrontPage for modern web development! It's filled with security vulnerabilities and obsolete standards. The goal of this is not to convince you otherwise. The newest version came out almost two decades ago!</p>

<p>Microsoft FrontPage. The mere mention of that name is making most (if not all) of you seasoned web devs groan. "FrontPage was utter rubbish from dark ages of GeoCities" you say. "Everything it touched was ruined with horrific output and proprietary nonsense!" And yes, it was.</p>
<p>But... FrontPage as a concept. As a dream of what could have been, and a window into what <em>was</em>. Letting the typical home user at the time create websites, express creativity, and conquer the world by storm, all without being forced to learn HTML or CSS or JavaScript... In that regard, FrontPage couldn't be beat.</p>
<p>Let's talk about why Microsoft FrontPage was for a brief period of time the ultimate content creation tool of the Internet, and why it later fell from grace.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before we can talk about goodness and ugliness, we need to talk about carphones and business meetings. Because this was 1994, when the Internet was still really new. At that point in time most internet chatter occured on Usenet groups (think something like Reddit) or BBS systems (think something like <a href="https://invisibleup.com//articles/5/">old AOL</a>; example pictured below). If you needed buisness stuff, like stocks or the such, you had to log onto the BBS of whoever had what you needed. This was kind of a pain.</p>
<p><img alt="A picture of a BBS (tilde.town) as of today" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/BBS.png"></p>
<p>Enter Randy Forgaard and Charles H. Ferguson. Ferguson, renowned computer industry consultant, contacted MIT graduate Forgaard (over carphone, in case you were wondering) to discuss starting a new, internet-based company.</p>
<p>His idea was that many corporations such as the Dow Jones, Bloomberg, Apple, etc. were sinking millions into building their own, completely incompatible dial-in Internet services. Therefore, they should create a standardized, completely open server/client combo to replace all the independent efforts. This hopefully would reduce the cost of development for those corporations, and provide a market for growth by making buisnesses <em>want</em> to have an Interent presence.</p>
<p>The two decided to found their own company, Vermeer Technologies, Inc. A month later, still in the planning stages, they caught wind of the brand new World Wide Web out of CERN. It was decentralized, open, and even more robust than they were planning. It was just about perfect. The only issue was that it was rather a pain to make websites if you were just some lowly advertising manager or whoever. The web needed an authoring tool for websites.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage 1.0a, taken from WinWorldPC.com" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-1.0.png"></p>
<p>So, somehow, they managed to hire many professional coders for no salary whatsoever to work on FrontPage. (Early start-up culture, perhaps?) Evidently it worked, as FrontPage was released (only!) a week behind schedule on October of 1995. By then the World Wide Web was exploding, with a 20% increase in sites <em>per month</em>. FrontPage also managed to explode, receiving many awards and positive reviews. In fact, it was so good that Microsoft ended up buying them out. According to them, not only did it feel like a native Office application, it was perfect for their ongoing plan to become more internet centric.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage 97, taken from WinWorldPC.com" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-97.png"></p>
<p>FrontPage over the years got integrated into the Office suite and made a flagship product for Microsoft productivity products. By Office 2000, FrontPage had more Office integration than you should shake a stick at; nailing down the Office user interface and allowing imports and exports across the whole suite. There's... other stuff as well, but let's stay positive for now.</p>
<p>I'll be covering FrontPage 2002, as that's the version I own, and the one I have the most experience with.</p>
<h2>The Good</h2>
<p>The interface... is (in my opinion) one of the best interfaces for any program ever. No hyperbole. I think only the other Microsoft applications of the era like PowerPoint and Visio can top it. I can <em>see</em> why it won awards.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage's start screen with no webs open" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Start.png"></p>
<p>Like any other Microsoft Office XP program, there's the sidebar on the right with common tasks. What you'll probably want to do is, of course, make a new site.</p>
<p>FrontPage's equivalent to "projects" are called "Webs". These Webs contain the files (all your HTML, CSS, images, etc.) and preferences (such as which web server to sync up with or what compatibility settings to use) for that website.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage's template selector" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-NewWeb.png"></p>
<p>Start by selecting a new "Empty Web". Up pops a bunch of templates, including the "Empty Web" template. A bit odd, but sure.</p>
<p><img alt="The &quot;Personal Homepage&quot; template in action" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Template.png"></p>
<p>If you <em>were</em> to choose a template, it would give you a pre-populated fill-in-the-blanks site ready for your words and pictures. It takes some of the layout work and design originality out of it, but that <em>is</em> the purpose of a template after all. (Although, as a word of advice, <em>don't use these.</em> They're rather awfully designed from a web standards point of view. You can see it barely fitting in my window there. Imagine that on a smartphone.)</p>
<p><img src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-BlankWeb.png" alt="FrontPage open to a new blank web. Folder list and Views bar are visible."></p>
<p>Anyways, once you open your blank web, you get... nothing! (That's what you asked for, isn't it?) No worries. Really, if you think about it, it would be rather silly to start making a page off the bat. You see, FrontPage takes a <em>project oriented</em> approach to things. While you easily <em>could</em> just sit down and start banging stuff out, that's really not the way FrontPage wants you to go.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage Navigation editor with some pages created and linked up." src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-NavView.png"></p>
<p>Here's probably my favorite FrontPage feature: the Navigation editor. Here you create blank pages and link them together in a logical hierarchy. This closely resembles the process you'd usually take on paper when designing a website.</p>
<p><img alt="Navigation bar settings dialog" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Navbar.png"></p>
<p>With this hierarchy, you can automatically create a navigation bar in all your pages that are properly linked. If you decide to make a new top-level page, for instance, every page on your site will be updated to feature that page. (To replicate that feature on this site, I had to use some pretty tricky template scripting with my custom Flask server. I'd vastly prefer something like this.)</p>
<p>This feature is also nice because it forces you to <em>think about your site</em>. You can't just sit down like it's Microsoft Word and bang out some pages. You need a coherent plan. Before you can even start, you need to sit down with your client/team/self and ask "What do you want on your website?" To most people it's obvious that you need a website. Everybody has a website. What's significantly less obvious is <em>what</em> needs to be on the website. And FrontPage's web editor allows you to play around with hierarchies and layouts before commiting to anything.</p>
<p><img alt="PowerPoint Slide Sorter mode&quot;" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/PPT-SlideSorter.png"></p>
<p>One thing that's intersting is that Word, PowerPoint and Access all (vaguely) follow a similar model. Word has the Outline editor, PowerPoint has the Slide Sorter mode (pictured above, showing an interactive game I made when I was 11), and Access, being a typical database program, requires you to declare your tables before you can work on them.</p>
<p>What's even more interesting is that, with the exception of Access (which not many people used, mostly due to its cost and relative rarity), you were never <em>required</em> to have a plan before starting. Most people I've seen use Word just do straight typing, or perhaps work off another document with an outline. But the option was there! One could do their outline <em>in their document</em> and flesh out around that. Likewise with PowerPoint, as well.</p>
<p><img alt="Highlighted template include code" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-TemplateInclude.png"></p>
<p>Another common task in web design is defining a "template" page where you fill all your content into. For example, every page on this site you're reading on now has the same header and footer, and every article has the same sort of thumbnail image at the top. That was all scripted using template features.</p>
<p>FrontPage, being an Office product, supports templates. The implementation admittedly is <em>super</em> janky, but it's there. You can include pages within other pages just fine, it's just a little tricky to set up. (FYI, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint do templates too. It's one of their lesser-known features, IMHO.)</p>
<p><img alt="Report view window" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Reports.png"></p>
<p>Another really neat feature: reports. Like a compiler in an IDE, FrontPage produces warnings, errors, and statistics for your site. At a glance I can view all broken links, orphaned pages, oversized images, etc. This is a <em>fantastic</em> feature, something that modern web dev software just <em>doesn't</em> have.</p>
<p><img alt="Hyperlinks view window" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Links.png"></p>
<p>In the same vein as the Reports, you can see at a glance what links to what. It's a lot like the call chart in a software development IDE. I can see quickly every site linked from any page (shown here is <a href="https://invisibleup.com//articles/24/">the Sonic R color fix article</a>) and any subpages.</p>
<p><img alt="Tasks view, showing a task labeled &quot;Write FrontPage article&quot;" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Tasks.png"></p>
<p>Last feature, although this isn't nearly as useful in the year 2020. In the tasks view, you can put up a list of tasks that needs to be accomplished. Already that seems rather nice for keeping track of what you need to do. It's a lot like GitHub or GitLab's issue tracker, in a sense.</p>
<p>However, if you connect to a server with FrontPage Web Extensions (I'll get to that...), you can share this task list with other people. You can (again, like an issue tracker) put up a task to be done by someone else and work on a task that somebody else put up. It's a <em>very</em> nice feature for web development, but nowadays this is normally handled by source control providers like GitHub or GitLab.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage editing the Sonic R color mod article" src="https://invisibleup.com//articles/33/FP-Editor.png"></p>
<p>And, of course, there's the webpage editor. This works almost exactly like Microsoft Word, with some web-flavored spice. You type words and they appear in the page. You make those words blue, they're blue. <em>That said</em>, when you edit elements like that, it inserts an HTML 3.2 style <code>&lt;FONT&gt;</code> tag instead of trying to match it to a CSS rule. There's ways around this, but you have to be very diligent in doing so. This is mostly just due to FrontPage being a product of its time, though.</p>
<p>FrontPage is a program about planning, executing, and reviewing. Take the Navigation editor. You plan out the content of your site. You sketch up the layout. Then you reflect on if your layout matches your requirements. Or the Reports. Create content, check reports. Or the Tasks. Plan out what you need to do, do that, and then check if the task is complete. That, right …</p></article></div>

    <p><img src="https://janakiev.com/assets/jupyter_systemd_files/Activiteit_in_de_controle_kamer_in_de_Tap-Line_olie_terminal_nabij_Saida,_Bestanddeelnr_255-6308.jpg"></p>
  <p><span>10 Nov 2020</span></p><p>In this article you will see how to easily manage <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> Notebook and <a href="https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">JupyterLab</a> by using the <a href="https://janakiev.com/blog/jupyter-systemd/systemd.io">Systemd</a> tooling. This is useful when you want to have an instance running local or on your server that you can manage and monitor.</p>

<p>What is Systemd and why do we need it? Systemd is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Init">init</a> system in Linux used for system intialization and service management. This allows services configured for Systemd to manage and monitor them. This way, you can check if the service is still running, you can set it to automatically restart, you monitor the outputs of the service, and much more. To add Jupyter as a service we have to create a unit file. Let’s have a look how that works.</p>



<p>Systemd uses unit files as its primary way to manage and configure system resources. These files are in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file">INI</a> file format and are stored in <code>/etc/systemd/system</code>.</p>

<p>But before we start, we have to configure a password for Jupyter. Typically when running Jupyter, it would open a window in your browser with a generated token. In this case it will run in the background as a service and you would need to use a password. This can be done by generating hashed password and salt for use in notebook configuration with:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>python <span>-c</span> <span>"from IPython.lib.security import passwd; print(passwd('PASS'))"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Which should give you a hash like this one:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>sha1:137775e93d29:ba64d3b78e089f0f779167242ddb080a05c42a84
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For more information on security, have a read on <a href="https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/security.html">Security in the Jupyter notebook server</a>. Great, now let’s continue to create a file with the name <code>jupyter.service</code> with the following contents:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>[Unit]</span>
<span>Description</span><span>=</span><span>Jupyter Notebook</span>

<span>[Service]</span>
<span>Type</span><span>=</span><span>simple</span>
<span>PIDFile</span><span>=</span><span>/run/jupyter.pid</span>
<span>ExecStart</span><span>=</span><span>/home/user/anaconda3/bin/python -m jupyter-lab --notebook-dir=/home/user/notebooks --no-browser --NotebookApp.password='sha1:137775e93d29:ba64d3b78e089f0f779167242ddb080a05c42a84'</span>
<span>User</span><span>=</span><span>user</span>
<span>Group</span><span>=</span><span>user</span>
<span>Restart</span><span>=</span><span>always</span>
<span>RestartSec</span><span>=</span><span>10</span>

<span>[Install]</span>
<span>WantedBy</span><span>=</span><span>multi-user.target</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Each file has a few sections and each section like <code>[Unit]</code>, <code>[Service]</code>, and <code>[Install]</code> have various <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.directives.html">directives</a> that are used to configure a service. Most of them should already give a hint on what they are used for, but we will quickly go through some of them. To read more into detail how this works have a look at the tutorial <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-systemd-units-and-unit-files">Understanding Systemd Units and Unit Files</a>.</p>

<p>The most important one here is the <code>ExecStart=</code> directive, which specifies the command to be run. It is important to note, that only absolute paths should be used and that the <code>ExecStart=</code> directive has to be written in one line. In this case the unit files uses JupyterLab that is installed in the Anaconda base environment. If you use virtualenv instead, change the directive for <code>ExecStart=</code> to:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>ExecStart</span><span>=</span>/bin/bash <span>-f</span> <span>"source /home/user/notebooks/bin/activate; jupyter-lab --notebook-dir=/home/user/notebooks"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>PIDFile=</code> directive specifies where the process identification number is stored. Make sure to have your user and group in the <code>User=</code> and <code>Group=</code> directives. The <code>Restart=</code> directive specifies if the service should be restarted when the service exits, is killed or a timeout is reached. <code>RestartSec=</code> specifies how long it should wait until the service will be then restarted.  You can read more about the directives in the <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.directives.html">documentation</a>.</p>

<p>If you use more configuration and want to have it in a bash script instead, you can create a script like the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>
/home/nikolai/anaconda3/bin/jupyter-lab <span>\</span>
  <span>--notebook-dir</span><span>=</span>/home/user/notebooks <span>\</span>
  <span>--ip</span><span>=</span><span>'*'</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>--port</span><span>=</span>8888 <span>\</span>
  <span>--NotebookApp</span>.token<span>=</span><span>''</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>--NotebookApp</span>.password<span>=</span><span>'sha1:137...'</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>--no-browser</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, replace the previous <code>ExecStart</code> with <code>ExecStart=/path/to/script.sh</code> in the unit file. Also, make sure to make it executable with <code>chmod +x /path/to/script.sh</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, instead of using the argument <code>--notebook-dir</code>, you can specify the working directory by using the <code>WorkingDirectory=</code> directive.</p>



<p>First, move the unit file to <code>/etc/systemd/system/</code> with:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo mv </span>jupyter.service /etc/systemd/system/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, reload the systemd manager configuration with:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>systemctl daemon-reload
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, enable the service to start at boot with:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>systemctl <span>enable </span>jupyter
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To start the Jupyter service, you need to type:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>systemctl start jupyter
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To check its status, you can type:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>systemctl status jupyter
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, you can monitor the outputs of the service with <code>sudo journalctl -u jupyter -f</code>. To show the log messages since the last boot (<code>-b</code>) and without additional fields like timestamp and hostname (<code>-o cat</code>), type:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>journalctl <span>-u</span> jupyter <span>-b</span> <span>-o</span> <span>cat</span> <span>-f</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This should show you a similar output to the following output:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Started Jupyter Notebook.
[I 18:54:36.878 LabApp] JupyterLab extension loaded from /home/user/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/jupyterlab
[I 18:54:36.879 LabApp] JupyterLab application directory is /home/user/anaconda3/share/jupyter/lab
[I 18:54:36.880 LabApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /home/user/notebooks
[I 18:54:36.880 LabApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at:
[I 18:54:36.880 LabApp] http://0.0.0.0:8888/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This really useful if you need to have a look at what Jupyter logs out since some errors and logs are not visible within the notebooks. For more useful commands and arguments have a look at this <a href="https://janakiev.com/blog/systemd-cheatsheet/">Systemd cheatsheet</a>.</p>



<p>Now, you should be able to manage and monitor your Jupyter service with Systemd. To learn how to install and configure Jupyter on a server including SSL/TLS, have a look at my previous guide on <a href="https://janakiev.com/blog/jupyter-notebook-server/">Installing and Running Jupyter Notebooks on a Server</a>  Here are a few further resources when working with systemd:</p>

<p>Hi, folks!</p>
<p>Every single program allocates memory. Byte buffers are at the core of many essential libraries which power the services the modern internet is built upon. If you’re building such a library, or even just copying data between different files, chances are you’ll need to allocate a buffer.</p>
<p>In Java, <code>ByteBuffer</code> is the class that allows you to do so. Once you’ve decided to allocate a buffer, you’ll be presented with two methods <code>allocate()</code> and <code>allocateDirect()</code>. Which one to use? The answer is, as always, it depends. If there were no tradeoffs, there wouldn’t be two methods. In this article, I’ll explore some of these tradeoffs, demystify this behaviour, and I hope that the answer will be clear for you by the end of it.</p>

<h3 id="_two_buffers">Two buffers</h3>
<p>At first glance, the two methods <code>allocate()</code> and <code>allocateDirect()</code> are very simple. The <code>allocate()</code> allocates a buffer in the managed heap of the Java process, a part of this exact space which size is specified with the <code>Xmx</code> option. The <code>allocateDirect()</code> method allocates a buffer residing outside of the managed heap.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://serce.me/img/allocatedirect/server3.png" alt="server3"></span></p>
<p>This difference, however, creates a number of significant runtime implications, which I’m going to dive into here. But first, let me start by telling a debugging story where direct byte buffers were the murderer.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_the_story">The story</h3>
<p>Every story needs a protagonist. In this case, the protagonist was a Java application built on top of RSocket, a modern application protocol. Here’s the oversimplified version of the app which you can find on <a href="https://github.com/SerCeMan/allocatedirect/blob/master/src/main/java/me/serce/allocatedirect/Main.java">Github</a>. Let’s call this app an echo app. The echo code isn’t trying to do anything complicated, it is a simple echo service built with an awesome <a href="https://github.com/rsocket/rsocket-java">rsocket-java</a> library. All it does is spins up a client and a server, where the client sends messages, and the server echoes them back.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">var server = RSocketServer.create(echo) //...
var client = RSocketConnector.create() //...
while (true) {
  assert Objects.equals(client.send(), client.receive())
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div>

All measurements were taken on an EC2 AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/m5/">m5.large</a> instance. Unless specified otherwise, <em>Java 13</em> is used. The point of this article is not to show the numbers but rather demonstrate the techniques that you can use to debug your own application.

</div>
<p>The code is useless if it’s just sitting in the repo and doing nothing, so let’s clone the repo and start the app.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="bash">git clone https://github.com/SerCeMan/allocatedirect.git
cd allocatedirect &amp;&amp; ./start.sh</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The app starts, and you should see that the logs are flowing. As expected, now it’s processing a large number of messages. However, if the echo app was exposed to users, they would start noticing significant pauses every now and then. All Java developers know that the first thing to look at in the case of spurious pauses is GC.</p>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Note</p>
</td>
<td>
You can find GC logs of the app are stored in <code>/tmp/${gcname}</code>. The example logs for each run are also available in the <a href="https://github.com/SerCeMan/allocatedirect/tree/master/logs">repo</a>. In this article, gceasy.io was used for visualisation. It’s a great free online tool which supports the log format of multiple garbage collectors. Even though you can always visualise GC logs using a tool like gceasy, as we’ll see later, the raw logs often contain a lot more information than most of the tools can display.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Indeed, GC logs show that GC is to blame here. The application is running under G1, which is the default collector since JDK 9. There are multiple young GC pauses on the graph. Young GC is a stop-the-world pause in GC in G1. The application stops completely to perform a cleanup. For the echo server, the graph shows multiple young GC pauses that last for 100-130ms and occur every 10 seconds.</p>
<div>
<p>G1 GC</p>
<p><span><img src="https://serce.me/img/allocatedirect/g1before.png" alt="g1before"></span></p>
</div>
<p>Luckily for us, in the last few years, there has been an amazing development in the GC space. There are not just one but two new fully concurrent garbage collectors, <a href="https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/zgc/Main">ZGC</a> and <a href="https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/shenandoah/Main">Shenandoah</a>.</p>
<p>While I’ve had <a href="https://twitter.com/SerCeMan/status/1246676501925224449">great success</a> with ZGC before, Shenandoah has a great advantage of being much friendlier to application memory consumption. Many applications, especially simple JSON in, JSON out stateless services are not memory-constrained. Some application, on the other hand, especially the ones that process a large number of connections might be very sensitive to memory usage.</p>
<p>Even though the echo app only has a single client and a server in its current state, it could as well handle tens of thousands of connections. It’s time to enable Shenandoah, and run the echo app again.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="bash">./start.sh shen # starts with -XX:+UseShenandoahGC</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>After enabling Shenandoah, the GC logs start showing an interesting picture. There is definitely a huge improvement in the pause frequency. The pauses now only occur every minute or so. However, the pauses are still around 90ms long, which is far away from the desired sub-millisecond pauses.</p>
<div>
<p>Shenandoah GC</p>
<p><span><img src="https://serce.me/img/allocatedirect/shenandoah.png" alt="shenandoah"></span></p>
</div>
<p>Now that the symptoms are clear, and the problem is reproducible, it’s time to look at the cause. GC graphs don’t show much more information. Looking at the raw logs directly, on the other hand, reveals the cause which is clearly stated right on the pause line.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="log">...
[info][gc] GC(15) Pause Final Mark (process weakrefs) 86.167ms
...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Turns out, weak references are to blame. Put simply, weak references are a way to keep an object in memory until there is a demand for this memory. Large in-memory caches is a common use-case for weak references. If there is enough free heap, a weak reference cache entry can stay there. As soon as GC figures out that there is not enough memory, it’ll deallocate weak references. In most of the cases, this is a much better outcome than the application failing with an out of memory exception because of a cache.</p>
<p>A frantic search across the repository doesn’t show any usages of weak, soft or phantom references. Not even the search through the third party libraries can show anything. After staring at the metrics for a while, one of the graphs gives a clue! The long GC pauses correlate with a sudden drop in the number of direct byte buffers.</p>
<div>
<p>GC vs DirectByteBuffer count</p>
<p><span><img src="https://serce.me/img/allocatedirect/jmc-gc.png" alt="jmc gc"></span></p>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Note</p>
</td>
<td>
You can get a similar graph by running the echo app and connecting to the JMX port. For this screenshot, I used Java Mission Control (JMC). The <a href="https://github.com/SerCeMan/allocatedirect/blob/master/start.sh#L53">start.sh</a> script contains the options that you can enable to connect to an app with JMX remotely.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>At first, the correlation might not make any sense. Byte buffers are not weak references, are they? They are not weak references themselves. However, you might notice, that creating a new direct byte buffer gives you back a plain <code>ByteBuffer</code> interface which doesn’t have a <code>close</code> method or any other way of deallocating the buffer.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">ByteBuffer buf = ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(42);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The underlying buffer needs to go away once the last reference to this buffer goes away. The modern API for this in Java is <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/ref/Cleaner.html"><code>java.lang.ref.Cleaner</code></a>. As we can see, it’s exactly what <code>DirectByteBuffer</code> class uses to determine when the underlying buffer should be deallocated.</p>
<div>

<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">DirectByteBuffer(int cap) {
    // ...
    base = UNSAFE.allocateMemory(size); // malloc call
    UNSAFE.setMemory(base, size, (byte) 0);
    // ...
    cleaner = Cleaner.create(this, new Deallocator(base, size, cap));
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Yet, there are no usages of direct buffers in the code of the echo app either, so how could we find them? One way would be to search through the third party libraries using IntelliJ. The approach would work very well for the echo example but would completely fail for any real applications of a decent size. There are just way too many places where byte buffers are used. Looking at the graphs, one can notice that the number of created buffers per minute is huge, literally millions of them.</p>
<p>Instead of searching through the code to find all byte buffer references, it is easier to find the place at runtime. One way to find out where the majority of the buffers is created is to fire up the async profiler and profile the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/malloc.3.html"><code>malloc</code></a> calls which are used by direct buffers to allocate memory.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"># async profiler can be downloaded from https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler
./profiler.sh -d 30 -f /tmp/flamegraph.svg $(pgrep -f java) -e malloc</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>While running, the profiler managed to sample more than 500000 malloc calls which non-ambiguously show where all of the buffers were created from.</p>

<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Note</p>
</td>
<td>
The flame graph above visualises the code paths where most of the captured malloc calls occur. The wider the column is, the larger the number of times the code path appeared in the sample. This graph, as well as other flame graphs in this article, is clickable. You can read more on how to read flame graphs <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html">here</a>.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>As it turned out, there was a place in the code which was using direct buffers. With this rich knowledge of where exactly the direct buffer allocations occur, creating a fix is easy. All that’s needed is to make a one line change and to replace <code>allocateDirect</code> with <code>allocate</code> and send a <a href="https://github.com/rsocket/rsocket-java/pull/945">PR upstream</a>.</p>
<p>Running the same app on shenandoah after applying the single line change produces a completely different graph which pleases the eyes with sub-millisecond GC pauses.</p>
<div>
<p>Shenandoah GC</p>
<p><span><img src="https://serce.me/img/allocatedirect/shenandoah-heap.png" alt="shenandoah heap"></span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_the_costs">The costs</h3>
<p>The story revealed a dark side of direct byte buffers. If there is a dark side, there must be a bright side as well! There is. But before we look at the bright side, we need to explore a few more sides which also appeared to be grey.</p>
<div>
<h4 id="_allocations">Allocations</h4>
<p>Previously, we’ve observed implicit deallocations costs, so now it’s time to take a look at allocations. Could direct buffers be much cheaper to create? After all, going off-heap has been a performance trend for a while. A small benchmark can help to estimate the costs.</p>
<div>

<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">@Param({"128", "1024", "16384"})
int size;

@Benchmark
public ByteBuffer heap() {
 …</code></pre></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blog">
                    <h2>Battling with yourself</h2>
<p>I have been building a very simple project that should off taken me 2 weeks max to build, for nearly 2 months.</p>
<p>The main reason is that I don’t have a proper structure to build it. This is my first time doing SaaS, and it has been like torture figuring out databases, ways to display content from the database, javascript integration with Django, and storing data from user forms into a database.</p>
<p>Every time starting to work on this project has felt like torture because it meant that I had to trial and error and google every single problem I had.</p>
<p><img alt="how do I even google this" src="https://i.gyazo.com/e7e75a06fe315f3e4315e9ec5f0c3b5c.png"></p>
<h2>How I forced myself to keep going</h2>
<p>I have a daily task that I need to do, that involves pushing a commit each day. As long as I did one, the task is complete.</p>
<p>When I was making this website for the blog that you are reading, it was straightforward to do, and I had 5-6 <strong>big</strong> commits daily. As soon as I opened my code editor, I would know what to change and do and how to do it. I was working productively, and every day I improved something.</p>
<p>This project is different. I have no idea what I need to do, and there is no particular vision that I have for it. One thing I know is that it needs to be done and be out in the open as soon as possible. The problem is, I have to spend 5 hours getting a single foreign key field to display.</p>
<p>I had no idea how to deal with this hard project before I started going through the daily notes that I write from the time I was coding this blog. One thing was transparent. I was hating working on this blog at that time as well. I also couldn’t figure out things and had to spend too much time on things that seemed too easy to spend even 10 minutes on.</p>
<p>Huh? Why do I remember it differently then?</p>
<h2>Finished project</h2>
<p>Once you have submitted a ready product that is working steadily and is solving some other peoples problems you automatically start focusing on other things, things that are not the core functionality or the structure of your project, but the usability and the UI/UX.</p>
<p>The part after the main release is very different from the main building phase. It requires you to understand and tweak the project in the ways to improve already existing experience, not invent what this experience should be in the begging.</p>
<h2>What has solved all of my problems:</h2>
<p>Trello kanban board.</p>
<p>It might seem stupid that I didn’t create one earlier, but I have around 100 Trello boards that I am in already! I thought that I didn’t need another board that just tracked nothing and did nothing. I thought that I could store everything in my head and each time gets on with it.</p>
<p>How hard could it be? I need to display the button in changing light after a delay, and I don’t need to get a board just for that… Welp, I should have started it as soon as I created my project.</p>
<p>As soon as I put all of my ideas and projects into this board, I somehow had clarity on what I was going to do. It was as if I had a clear goal for the project, and I just needed to tweak things here and there.</p>
<p>I think that my underestimation of the hole Planning process as well as having a structure to what my app should do is what really forced me into a corner. You can’t have a clear image of the full project in your head. You need to draw or separate them into blocks to make sure that it makes sense.</p>
<p>I have really been fortunate to realise this at some point as I was very close to scraping the project fully due to things just not working. Guess some hard work pays off. </p>
<p>I think that this taught me a lot and in future, I won't make the same mistake (who am I kidding).</p>
<p>Like always:</p>
<p>Start now. Get perfect later.</p>

        <p>No one should really like job titles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They can limit an <em>executive</em>’s ability to seize opportunities outside their supposed responsibilities. Awarding one could possibly stunt a person’s desire to continue doing the work that got them there in the first place. Worst of all, their often inflated nature makes people who have special-sounding ones believe that status-signalling is meaningful.</p>
<p>And yet, if you want your work to be significantly better  -  it is time for you to take on another job title.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Writer.</strong></p>
<p>In my current position, my job title is ‘VP of Product’  -  but despite this fancy-sounding title, my professional responsibilities and passion simply make me a product designer. I work primarily on crafting pleasurable and meaningful experiences for people through disciplines such as interaction and usability design, motion design, and high-fidelity prototyping. But if I were to give the most credit to anything for enabling me to produce my best work: it would be the skills I practice when I give myself the title of ‘Writer’.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I write, I look at my work with the critical eye of a premier ballet teacher. <em>Stop attempting to say so much. Stop using so many unnecessary words. Stop trying to cram so many ideas into one sentence.</em> Writing freezes your ideas for refinement. You’re free to chop and eliminate. To cut down on saying things that don’t add much or that simply don’t need to be said. Its almost as though the simple act of putting words on paper detaches you entirely from your thinking. To meditate on your extensive ideas and prune them like a master bonsai craftsman: with precision and grace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I write, a desire for focus and simplicity stirs from within. I cut out well-worded paragraphs and rewrite entire articles. I refuse to settle with <em>impressive</em> as I demand <em>understandable</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This desire pays great dividends to my main profession.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don Norman, author of two of my favourite books: <a href="https://amzn.to/2G6vwv6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The Design of Everyday Things</em></a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/3316d6y" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Emotional Design</em></a>, states that one of the keys to a great design is <strong>Discoverability</strong>. This means that a product allows the user to immediately <em>discover what actions are possible</em> and <em>where and how to perform them</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a long time, my digital product designs were a combination of anything and everything that had played a significant role in other successful products I studied. This ultimately resulted in overwhelming interfaces. Designs that did too much at once. Screens that forced the user to slow down but only to consider <em>how clever this app was.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A simple and focused product makes the kind of discoverability that Don Norman talks about, easy. But when you’re trying to do everything, much like my clever designs attempted to do, it’s fairly difficult for your users to quickly discover the 1–2&nbsp;<em>important things</em> your product can do or help them achieve.</p>
<p>For your work to be world-class, it often just needs less. That’s true for my designs - and I only learnt that because it’s true for my writing. So add ‘Writer’ to your job title and do the work that goes along with being one. Write a lot. Edit more. Publish frequently. It’ll be hard and it will require many hard hours from you - but it will give anything you create the simplicity and focus that French mathematician Blaise Pascal wish he had, as he once professed: <em>“I’m sorry I wrote you such a long letter; I didn’t have time to write a short one.”</em></p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Don’t hesitate to say hello and so I can see your added job title on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/JustinCampbellP" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@justincampbellp</a></p>

<![CDATA[Cobalt – Lightweight Electron Alternative]]>

<br/>
November 18, 2020 | https://cobalt.foo/overview.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://cobalt.foo/overview.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="centerCol">
      <div id="content">
        <p>Cobalt is a lightweight HTML5/CSS/JS application container that is designed
to provide a rich application development environment with minimal resource
consumption (deployment size, RAM, CPU, GPU). At the same time, Cobalt enables
a rich, low-latency user experience across a wide variety of platforms and
devices.</p>

<h4 id="target-audiences">Target audiences</h4>

<p>Cobalt's documentation is written with two audiences in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Porters</strong> enable Cobalt to work on other platforms by using Starboard,
Cobalt's porting layer and OS abstraction, to implement the
platform-specific functionality that Cobalt uses. Each Starboard module
(memory, socket, thread, etc.) defines functions that must be implemented
for the porter's platform.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Developers</strong> want to build applications in familiar environments with
advanced debugging tools without having to worry about compatibility with
a highly fragmented set of browsers. At the same time, they want to have
full control over their codebase so that they can ship features for
constrained platforms, like TVs, on time and without technical risk.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="benefits-of-cobalt">Benefits of Cobalt</h2>

<p>Cobalt significantly reduces the cost of supporting a browser on non-standard
and resource-constrained platforms. In addition, since Cobalt operates at a
consolidated, versioned platform abstraction layer, its porting effort is
man-weeks, and subsequent rebases are near-free.</p>

<p>These are some other benefits that Cobalt provides:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>More platforms</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>  Cobalt does not require platforms to support JIT compilation and can
run on platforms that disallow execution of dynamically generated code.</li>
<li>  Cobalt is a single-process application and does not rely on the ability
to spawn multiple processes.</li>
<li>  Cobalt precompiles a set of shaders that are sufficient to express all
graphical effects, thereby accommodating platforms that cannot compile
shaders at runtime.</li>
<li>  Cobalt requires a compliant C++11 compiler, allowing it to reach
platforms with toolchains that don't support the newest C++17 features.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Small footprint</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>  Cobalt is optimized for memory. Its surface cache never exceeds a
predefined budget, and it never creates duplicate layers, reducing
the likelihood of out-of-memory crashes.</li>
<li>  Cobalt's small binary is designed to take up as little space as
possible. By supporting a subset of HTML5/CSS/JS, Cobalt's reduced
package size even allows bundling of CJK fonts on low-end devices.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Reduced input latency</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>  Cobalt produces consistent 60FPS animations by only supporting
animation of properties that don't affect layout, like <code>transform</code>,
and always running animations on a separate thread.</li>
<li>  Cobalt is optimized to run on single-core CPUs, resulting in better
input latency since the renderer and resource loader do not compete
with layout operations.</li>
<li>  On platforms that support GLES2, Cobalt avoids CPU painting by
performing almost all rendering operations on the GPU.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<h3 id="porters">Porters</h3>

<p>Porters should begin with the <a href="https://cobalt.foo/starboard/porting.html">porting guide</a>,
which explains how to use Starboard, Cobalt's porting layer, to customize the
platform-specific functionality that Cobalt uses. There are several reference
documents to help porters customize configuration files and to implement
module-specific functionality. The <a href="https://cobalt.foo/starboard/testing.html">Testing with
NPLB</a> document provides an overview of

Compliant Kubernetes is the first Open Source distribution of Kubernetes specifically designed to address HIPAA, GDPR, CCPA, PCI-DSS, SOC2 and ISO-27001 requirements and now gives individuals and enterprises a fully Open Source solution to address the growing privacy&nbsp; and regulatory demands facing every company delivering Cloud Native solutions.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Johan Tordsson, co-founder and CTO of Elastisys said: </span></p><blockquote><p><span>“I’m extremely proud of the great work done by the contributing engineers, coming together as a team to deliver Compliant Kubernetes. The work that has been done will dramatically simplify the implementation of critical compliance needs while preserving the benefit and agility of Kubernetes.”</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Compliant Kubernetes is much more than just Kubernetes. It is a combination of effective open source solutions from the cloud-native community developed to address the key security and access controls needed to meet regulatory compliances. These include:</span></p><ul><li><span>Dex</span><span>: a federated OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider, enabling authentication via, e.g., Active Directory, LDAP, and Google accounts. Dex-issued user identities are used for audit logging and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) purposes throughout Compliant Kubernetes;</span></li><li><span>Harbor (with Trivy)</span><span>: a private container image registry with vulnerability scanning capabilities, protecting against known threats;</span></li><li><span>Open Policy Agent</span><span>: a cloud-native policy enforcement software, which Compliant Kubernetes configures to automatically enforce controls from various regulations, protecting against misconfiguration errors; and</span></li><li><span>Falco</span><span>: a configurable intrusion detection system (IDS), protecting against unknown threats and hacking attempts.</span></li></ul><p><span>For platform and application observability, Compliant Kubernetes packages and configures:</span></p><ul><li><span>Fluentd, Elasticsearch, and Kibana</span><span>: the high-performance fluentd log forwarding agent ships application and audit logs to a highly secured Elasticsearch instance, powered by the fully open source Open Distro for Elasticsearch. Users can work with these logs via the Kibana interface;</span></li><li><span>Prometheus, Grafana, and AlertManager</span><span>: Compliant Kubernetes uses the community standard monitoring stack, in which Prometheus scrapes and stores metrics and Grafana lets operators create dashboards to monitor Key Performance Indicators (KPI). AlertManager enables operators to get notified via various integrations when KPIs indicate actionable events or application states.</span></li></ul><p><span>Compliant Kubernetes additionally packages networking security-related features, such as the Calico networking provider, NGINX as a high-performance traffic ingress controller, and automatic certificate management via cert-manager. Thus, Compliant Kubernetes is a platform built for regulatory compliance from the ground up. It allows users to meet their needs and easily manage their Kubernetes environment across any supported public cloud, private set of virtual machines (VMWare), or bare metal servers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>For customer convenience and peace of mind, Elastisys offers a managed service in public clouds under either US or EU jurisdiction. Tempus AB is a current user of Compliant Kubernetes via Elastisys’ managed services and says: </span></p><blockquote><p><span>“We handle very sensitive data. We decided on Elastisys Compliant Kubernetes as it doesn’t lock you into any cloud, is available under European jurisdiction, is built on best practice from the cloud native community and comes pre-configured for all our security and compliance needs, saving us a lot of effort.”&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Robert Winter, CEO of Elastisys emphasizes Elastsys’ commitment Open Source: </span></p><blockquote><p><span>“Elastisys started the CK8s project because we needed a completely compliant solution to run our Managed Services, but we know the greatest power of Open Source is building a community to share and grow the solution”. </span></p></blockquote><p><span>Robert continues: </span></p><blockquote><p><span>“We stand ready to help any interested party with our Managed Services and support of CK8s, but we also are excited to nurture a healthy and growing community of Open Source users and contributors.”&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote><h2>About Elastisys</h2><p><span>Elastisys develops and manages open source platforms for modern, container based application development.

November 18, 2020 | http://whiteboard.ping.se/SDR/IQ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://whiteboard.ping.se/SDR/IQ">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wikitext">
<p>This is a description of using I/Q Data (aka "analytic signal") representing a signal. Since the topic may be quite confusing, I've described the same thing here from different point of views. If you find the information somewhat redundant, it is because it is. Different views may appeal to different readers, and if something seems unclear, keep on reading and it may be more comprehensible later - hopefully.
</p>
<h2>Why I/Q Data?</h2>
<p>I/Q Data is a signal representation much more precise than just using a series of samples of the momentary amplitude of the signal. Have a look at the following signal below.
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/cosample.png" alt="Plain signal" title="Plain signal"></p>
<p>This is what you may be used to work with. So why I/Q Data - isn't this good enough?
</p>
<p>Not really. We have a few problems here.
</p>
<ul><li>First, it is impossible to determine the frequency of this signal. Sure, it looks simple enough, just look at the period length? True, but you have no clue if it's a positive or negative frequency since they both generate the same curve. I.e. cos(x) = cos(-x). This becomes a problem working with the signal. Mixing (multiplying) two signals and it'll cause multiple solutions due to the uncertainty of the sign: f1 âŠ— f2 equals f1 + f2 as well as f1 - f2.
</li><li>Second, it's hard to determine the power (peak amplitude, envelope) of the signal. Basically you can only see the peak amplitude here at 0Â°, 180Â°, 360Â° etc, and how do you know the power is the same everywhere else as well? And did you sample the signal exactly at its peak? You really don't know.
</li></ul><p>I/Q Data solves this. Instead of looking at the signal as a flat curve as above, look at it as a corkscrew (helix, spiral, coil spring) in three dimensions.
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/corkscrew.png" alt="Complex signal" title="Complex signal"></p>
<hr>
<p>Now if you look at this curve from the side, you'll actually get the same graph as the first one above. Your "real" signal actually is this 2D projection of this corkscrew signal. This is your "I" in I/Q data.
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/corkI.png" alt="Side view" title="Side view"></p>
<hr>
<p>Now have a look at the corkscrew from above. This looks quite similar, but as you see, it is out of phase 90Â°  starting at zero, not at one as the other. This this the Q part of your I/Q data.
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/corkQ.png" alt="Top view" title="Top view"></p>
<hr>
<p>Now looking at the corkscrew down the time axis you'll see it winds counter-clockwise. This means we know the frequency is positive. It could have wound clockwise as well, still generating the same I-signal (projection) but different Q-signal, representing a negative frequency.
</p>
<p>You also see that the radius of the corkscrew is constant at every sample, if small in I large in Q and vice versa. The radius is the peak amplitude of your signal. 
</p>
<p>The axes are of course 90Â°, so the radius must be equal to (IÂ²+QÂ²)<sup>1/2</sup>. This is the peak amplitude of your signal, and as you can see you know this for each and every sample.
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/corkT.png" alt="Viewed down time axis" title="Viewed down time axis"></p>
<h2>What is I/Q Data?</h2>
<p>AS you now understand, the I/Q Data Sample is the coordinates of your signal as seen down the time axis of the corkscrew.
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/onesample.png" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>You might object that your signal isn't a pure cosine function as the one we have shown here, and it might be very true. Still, every single sample of your signal can be described as such, i.e. with a peak amplitude times cosine of some phase angle.
</p>
<p>Every single point of your signal can be described as the function Aâ‹…cos(Ï•)
</p>
<p>Since you may freely chose any amplitude A and angle Ï• this must of course be true (as long as the signal is continuous). The value of Aâ‹…cos(Ï•) is the <strong>I</strong> component of the I/Q signal, i.e. your real signal. Note that this only describes your signal in one single point, i.e. one sample. Next sample gives you a new I and Q very likely resulting in another amplitude and/or phase angle, reflecting the modulation of the signal.
</p>
<h2>One sample I/Q Data</h2>
<p>Ok, lets take one sample of I/Q Data and see what it represents. This is also called a phase vector, or phasor.
</p>
<pre>I = 0.69
Q = 0.40
</pre>
<p>Lets draw this in the complex plane.
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/iqdraw1.png" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>Lets see what this tells us about our data point.
</p>
<ul><li>The momentary amplitude of our real signal is by definition <strong>I</strong>, i.e. 0.69
</li><li>Pythagoras tells us the amplitude A of the cosine wave is <code>(0.69Â²+0.40Â²)<sup>1/2</sup> = 0.8</code>
</li><li>Trigonometry tells us our angle is +30Â° into our cosine wave.
</li></ul><p>- <em>Hold it</em>, you say, <em>what cosine wave?</em>
</p>
<p>Well, I/Q actually assumes your real signal (<strong>I</strong>, that is) can be described as the
function <strong>I</strong> = Aâ‹…cos(Ï•)
</p>
<p>Since you are free to chose A and Ï• this must of course be true, as long the function is continuous. Remember we are looking at one single sample now, i.e. one point in time.
</p>
<p>So by using IQ Data we not only get the momentary values of our signal, but the function generating it as well. If we put above together we get:
</p>
<p>The real signal I = 0.8â‹…cos(30Â°)
</p>
<hr>
<ul><li>I/Q Data is the representation (data type) of this cosine function.
</li></ul><p>I/Q Data is the rectangular representation of the polar notation we used above. There is a unique transformation between the two, and the different notations have different properties calculating with them. The rectangular form of I/Q Data is chosen due to the ease of hardware implementations of the most common operations.
</p>
<p>I/Q Data consists of I and Q represented as two separate variables, a vector of length two, or more often, the complex number  I + Q<em>i</em>  (yes, I is the real part).
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/polrep.png" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>Note that the Amplitude above is the waves peak amplitude, not the momentary amplitude.
</p>
<ul><li>I is the current momentary amplitude of the signal (i.e. the Real signal)
</li><li>Q is the momentary amplitude of the signal phase shifted -90Â°.
</li></ul><p>For a simple function such as sine, the phase shift is what the signal was earlier in time, but for a signal with more than one sine component, Q reflects a -90Â° shift of the individual components, and not the composite signal as such. To convert a Real Signal to a I/Q Data Signal, discrete Fourier transformation is required (Hilberts transform).
</p>
<h2>Different ways of representing the same I/Q Data Sample</h2>
<p>There are at least three common ways to represent the I/Q Data Sample. Different representations gives you different pros and cons. Some are more easy to add, other are more easy to multiply etc. This may be important in the implementation, resulting in less complex hardware/software using the best representation.
</p>
<h3>The rectangular form</h3>
<p>The I/Q Data on the form Q and I is called "rectangular" (or "Cartesian") form as it can be viewed as positions in a coordinate system. I and Q are the x and y axis respectively. This is the most common representation you are used to. This form is most common due the ease of modulating/demodulating it in hardware. More about that later.
</p>
<ul><li>As a complex number: I + Q<em>i</em>
</li><li>As a vector [I,Q]
</li><li>Or just the two plain variables I and Q
</li></ul><h3>The polar form</h3>
<ul><li>Amplitude and angle
</li></ul><p>I = Amplitudeâ‹…cos(angle) <br>Q = Amplitudeâ‹…sin(angle)
</p>
<p>The Amplitude is the peak amplitude of the cos (and sin) function, and the angle is how far into the period from zero to 360Â° you are (or 0 to 2Ï€ if you prefers radians).
</p>
<h3>Eulers form</h3>
<p>Since cos(Ï•) + iâ‹…sin(Ï•) = e<sup>iÏ•</sup> we can write our IQ sample as
</p>
<p><span> Ae<sup>iÏ•</sup> </span>
</p>
<p>This might (not?) be the most intuitive representation of the sample. Ï• rotates the angle as seen in the polar representation, and A is of course the amplitude. Realizing this, Eulers identity becomes obvious. Because Ï• is the rotation of the vector in the complex plane, rotating it half a turn, 180Â° or Ï€ radians, results in a real part of -1 and no imaginary part, hence:
</p>
<p><span> e<sup>Ï€i</sup>+1 = 0 </span>
</p>
<p><em>"The student should find this to be immediately obvious,</em> <br><em>otherwise he'll never be a first rate mathematician"</em>
</p>
<p><em>-- Carl Friedrich Gauss </em>
</p>
<h2>Positive versus negative frequency</h2>
<p>It is now easy to see that using I/Q we can represent the signal frequency either as positive or negative. Have a look at the two I/Q signals red and blue below to the left and compare them with their corresponding real projections. It is as obvious they differ in signs in I/Q, as it's impossible to determine the signs using only the real signal component (neither the I nor the Q projection separately).
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/freqsign.gif" alt="Positive versus negative frequencies" title="Positive versus negative frequencies"></p>
<p><span>(sidenote: I've put them slightly out of phase compared to each other since else they wouldn't be possible to distinguish at all in the real representation to the right. Also, please note I'm here, quiet unconventional, using the x axis in the phasor for the imaginary <strong>Q</strong>)</span>
</p>
<p>The same signal (well, more or less) in a 3D representation.
</p>
<p>The <strong>I</strong> components (side view):
</p><p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/sign-i.png" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>The <strong>Q</strong> components (top view):
</p><p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/sign-q.png" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>The I/Q signals in 3D:
</p><p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/sign-3d.png" alt="" title=""></p>
<p><a name="twopriceone" id="twopriceone"></a>
As the Nyquistâ€“Shannon sampling theorem states you can only represent
frequencies up to <code>f/2</code> using a samplings rate of <code>f</code>. This is still true
using IQ Data, but since you now can represent negative frequencies
the signal spans <code>[-f/2..+f/2]</code> compared to <code>[0..+f/2]</code> using a â„�eal signal,
hence the range is in effect doubled. Using a
sampling rate of <code>f</code> and you now can represent a signal range of <code>f</code> as well.
Two to the price of one!
</p>
<h2>Mixing and multiplying signals</h2>
<p>Using real signals or IQ Signals gives different results when you multiply them. This is because using only the real component it's not possible to uniquely determine the phase angle of the signal, hence impossible to distinguish a positive frequency from a negative.
</p>
<p><span><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/mix-real.png" alt="Mixing 10 kHz with 3 kHz using real" title="Mixing 10 kHz with 3 kHz using real"></span></p>
<p>Multiplying two signals f1 and f2 in the real domain:
</p>
<p><span> Â±f1 âŠ— Â±f2 = (Â±)f1 Â± f2 </span>
</p>
<p><span><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/mix-iq.png" alt="Mixing 10 kHz with 3 kHz using I/Q" title="Mixing 10 kHz with 3 kHz using I/Q"></span></p>
<p>Using IQ Data the signs are now given, and the result is unambiguous:
</p>
<p><span> f1 âŠ— f2 = f1 + f2 </span>
</p>
<p><br>
A frequency spectrum in the real domain usually never show the negative side, since it always must be symmetric around zero due to the uncertainty of the sign of the frequency of the real signal -- hence the parentheses around the sign of <code>f1</code> in the first formula mixing the real signals. I've included the negative side here for illustrative purposes, despite of its redundancy.
</p>
<p>Multiplying two complex number is easiest understood in the polar representation. The amplitude is multiplied and the angle added.
</p>
<p><span> A<sub>1</sub>â‹…e<sup>iÏ•<sub>1</sub></sup>â‹…A<sub>2</sub> e<sup>iÏ•<sub>2</sub></sup> = A<sub>1</sub>A<sub>2</sub> e<sup>i(Ï•<sub>1</sub>+Ï•<sub>2</sub>)</sup> </span>
</p>
<p>Realizing the angle is added under multiplication makes it obvious that the frequencies are added as well.
</p>
<h3>And in time domain ...</h3>
<p>Now let us have a look at this in time domain. To make it easier (doable!) to calculate the DFT in our …</p></div></div>

		<p>It’s a multiplication of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.</p>
<p><code>x</code> is how much you are prepared, <code>y</code> is how lucky you are.</p>
<p>You are responsible for the <code>x</code> part of the equation, the <code>y</code> takes care of itself. If your preparation effort is zero, all the potential opportunities will be multiplied by zero and you will lose every one of them, no matter how big they were.</p>
<p>The more prepared you are, the more lucky you become. It’s not because you are lucky, rather because you can multiply small opportunities by big factors.</p>
<hr>
<p>This idea is inspired by Richard W. Hamming’s thoughts on luck, mentioned in his book, <a href="https://msjaber.com/books/the-art-of-doing-science-and-engineering-learning-to-learn/">The Art of Doing Science and Engineering</a>. He walks through all the coincidences that led him to his discoveries. Those coincidences have occured for many people – none of them were prepared, only Hamming was.</p>
<p>Could you have discovered what Hamming did if you were in his position? Yes, only if you were prepared.</p>

		<p><img src="https://t3mpl.n4no.com/content/image/5841gmvz8i7y8mycchzx.png" alt="Generate Website Admin Panel"></p>

<p>Creating admin panel for small website is an expensive thing. Each site has a different structure, and it needs different admin sections. This site has a news section, that doesn't. This site has a landing page with five texts, that site has only one image there. Familiar?</p>
<p>The popular choice to reduce a cost is use Wordpress. But Wordpress is dedicated to blog/news websites. Any deviation from the general purpose of Wordpress means a problem. Of course the market has many plugins and extensions to solve that. Unluckily joining together many elements are difficult and problematic.</p>
<p>So what to do? You may use T3MPL. T3MPL is the generic website editor and the static website generator in one. <strong>When you prepare a template, T3MPL automatically generates editor for your template.</strong></p>
<h4 id="🎹-template-contract">🎹 Template Contract</h4>
<p>Look at <strong>the template contract</strong> bellow. What is it? It is a definition of a data structure in your template. To define that it's needed to create a simple YAML file (template.yaml).</p>
<pre><code>dataContract:
  LANDING:
    sections:
      APP:
        properties:
          TITLE:
            type: (text)
            defaultValue: Hello World
          DESCRIPTION:
            type: (markdown)
            defaultFilePath: content/app-description.md
          PREVIEW:
            type: (image)
            defaultFilePath: assets/app-preview.jpg
            width: 1084
            height: 840
...</code></pre>
<h4 id="👓-template">👓 Template</h4>
<p>You can use that data directly in a template file. Templates are powered by <a href="https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js">handlebars</a>.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class="landing"&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;{{LANDING.APP.TITLE}}&lt;/h3&gt;

  {{{$markdown LANDING.APP.DESCRIPTION}}}

  &lt;img src="{{{$image LANDING.APP.PREVIEW}}}" alt="..." /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<h4 id="💥-generic-editor">💥 Generic Editor</h4>
<p>You have everything now. <strong>T3MPL automatically generates an editor for your template.</strong> You may edit your website with live preview now.</p>
<p><img src="https://t3mpl.n4no.com/content/image/xjwaxgk21nnqo5ton12x.png" width="270"></p>

<h4 id="🚀-publishing">🚀 Publishing</h4>
<p>When you finish editing, you may want to publish your website. You can do that in two ways.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Publish to .zip file</strong> - T3MPL generates your final website to .zip file. You should upload website files to your server. In this case, your server doesn't have special requirements like PHP or Ruby. Generated files should work on the most popular servers like Apache, Nginx and IIS.</li>
<li><strong>Use T3MPL Server</strong> - if you want to modify your website in a more professional way, you can use T3MPL Server. It requires Node.js on your server. The server allows you to modify your website directly from the editor. In this case, if you click the "publish" button, all changes will be published immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p>So you can use T3MPL according to how often you change your site.</p>
<p>If you have a template and a data you may also generate your website by T3MPL Cli.</p>
<h4 id="📣-summary">📣 Summary</h4>
<p>T3MPL provides a very simple concept, how to connect the data structure, the template and the editor. With T3MPL you don't care about the admin panel because T3MPL creates the admin panel when you create a website template. This saves time a lot. And money.</p>

Also, numerous efforts are devoted to implementing the technology into wearables: helmets, glasses, and contact lenses. Despite them, most people still use AR with the help of smartphones and tablets thanks to better performance, battery life and well, because people always have their smartphones at hand anyway.</p><p> Unfortunately or not, we aren't in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJg02ivYzSs">this phase of AR development</a> yet. </p><p> Nowadays, AR is mostly used in retail, education, and game development verticals. It's a great tool for adding interactivity, as well as showing your product from all possible angles. For example, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ikea-place/id1279244498">IKEA Place</a> shows you how their furniture would look in your room, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sketchar-learn-how-to-draw/id1221482822">SketchAR</a> helps you learn to draw, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-go/id1094591345">Pokemon GO</a> — I guess, everyone knows about Pokemon GO. It's the most renowned app that uses AR as the main feature, after all. </p><p> Depending on the type of trigger, AR can be marker-based, markerless, and location-based. This is a huge theme itself, so I'll focus on markerless AR frameworks in this article. They don't require an image, QR code or location data to work. </p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="rec205814304" data-record-type="239" data-bg-color="#161818"><!-- T210 --><div><div><div> <div> <div field="descr"><p>Most ARKit issues come from the decision to rely just on the device power to process AR. On the other hand, ARCore developed by Google relies on cloud services.</p></div> </div> <div><div field="text"><div data-customstyle="yes"><p>To implement AR functionality in apps, developers mostly use either native <a href="https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/">ARKit</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/ar">ARCore</a> or 3rd party frameworks like <a href="https://developer.vuforia.com/">Vuforia</a>. </p><p>ARKit is an SDK developed by Apple. They lead the way in the AR race at the moment, aim to drive technology adoption and regularly add new features that enhance the quality of the AR experience. For example, the latest iPad Pro even has a LiDAR scanner that is mostly used by self-driving cars to navigate the environment. And there are rumours that Apple plans to present AR glasses soon — a project that Google failed to accomplish. </p><p> Strong points of ARKit include stable tracking, peer-to-peer multiplayer, and realistic reflections. Also, it can hide virtual objects behind a real person, using People Occlusion feature, which helps to avoid breaking immersion. ARKit recognizes even surfaces painted in a single colour like walls or tables — with varying degrees of success. </p><p>As for disadvantages, ARKit is only available for iOS devices with A9 or later processors (A12 and A13 for ARKit 3.5), has difficulties with creating lighting and shadows, and can't occlude objects as it does with people. Moreover, it suffers from a common downside of all AR SDKs: if you try to place a virtual object on an enamelled surface, there's a huge chance it won't be recognised. Most ARKit issues come from the decision to rely just on the device power to process AR. </p><p> On the other hand, ARCore developed by Google relies on cloud services. It helps to achieve better mapping, lighting, occlusion and relocation — but for all of these things to work properly, you need a device from <a href="https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices">this list</a> and stable Internet connection. In comparison to ARKit, ARCore falls short on the stability of tracking and might require sensors' calibration due to a huge amount of discrepancies among Android devices. With <a href="https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/unity/quickstart-ios">ARCore SDK for Unity</a>, you can use this engine to create apps for both Android and iOS. </p><p>Vuforia provides even wider devices' support and can be used for the development of iOS, Android, and Universal Windows Platform apps. This framework was developed in 2010 and contributed to the decision of Apple and Google to create ARKit and ARCore. According to <a href="https://appfigures.com/top-sdks/ar_vr/all">AppFigures</a>, it's still the most popular SDK for AR apps. </p></div></div> </div></div></div></div></div><div id="rec205814306" data-record-type="3" data-bg-color="#161818"><!-- T107 --><div> <div itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemprop="image" content="https://static.tildacdn.com/tild3136-3264-4535-b433-386565343531/arcore-arkit-vuforia.png"><meta itemprop="caption" content="AppFigures AR frameworks comparison"> <p><img src="https://static.tildacdn.com/tild3136-3264-4535-b433-386565343531/-/empty/arcore-arkit-vuforia.png" data-original="https://static.tildacdn.com/tild3136-3264-4535-b433-386565343531/arcore-arkit-vuforia.png" imgfield="img" alt="AppFigures AR frameworks comparison"> </p></div> </div></div><div id="rec205814308" data-record-type="106" data-bg-color="#161818"><!-- T004 --><div><div> <div><div field="text"><div data-customstyle="yes"><p>Also, Vuforia can use either its own technologies and engine or ARKit/ARCore ones. Thus, even older devices that aren't supported by native SDKs and some AR smart glasses like HoloLens and MagicLeap can use this framework. While Vuforia includes unique features on top of main capabilities similar to native SDKs and has a version baked right into Unity, it's a paid solution and doesn't have the same amount of control over devices' hardware like Apple and Google. </p><p> And of course, all solutions are pretty heavy on the device battery. Markerless AR uses a camera, image recognition, orientation and direction sensors at once. </p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="rec205814314" data-record-type="106" data-bg-color="#161818"><!-- T004 --><div><div> <div><div field="text"><div data-customstyle="yes"><p><strong></strong><strong>Shopping </strong><br>The list of ways how AR (and, specifically, AR glasses) can make picking of products easier is incredibly long. For example, imagine a shopping trip to a supermarket with the help of an app that quickly identifies your favourite products on the shelf, compares prices and ingredients, tells you if it fits your diet plan or warns it can cause an allergy response. Or you can come to a dealership and easily compare how a car looks in different colours. </p><p>Also, online shopping will become easier when AR develops enough to get rid of current issues with body tracking. Most frameworks recognise only faces, and the virtual try-on is already used by companies like NYX Cosmetics and L'Oreal Paris to show their make-up products. However, right now there's no easily accessible way to check how clothes would look on you — but the technology is definitely on its way. </p><p> <strong>Augmented social media </strong><br>Instagram and Snapchat already compete in this field and even created their own frameworks, Spark AR and Lens Studio, to add filters, masks and 3D models to photos and videos. It's highly likely AR will be used in social media ads as well. For example, we can expect a virtual try-on feature right after seeing an ad: it should greatly drive the product sales, help influencers to market them, and decrease a chance you'll buy something online that doesn't fit you. </p><p> <strong>Navigation </strong><br>Google Maps introduced <a href="https://support.google.com/maps/thread/11554255?hl=en">Live View</a> last year. It's an AR mode that allows seeing both a traditional map and AR arrows pointing you in the right direction. It looks like a prototype and doesn't seem handy even during walking: personally, I'll be tired in ten minutes holding a phone in front of me. Regardless, it shows pretty well what visuals AR glasses can use to help us find a way somewhere. </p><p> <strong>Manufacturing and User manuals <br></strong>IKEA manuals are incredibly comprehensible but when AR shows you where and how to install it, it's even easier to assemble something. And if you ever felt anxious about numerous indicators in a car, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOMvl6-cP7o">apps like this</a> explain what they mean. Again, a smartphone isn't the best platform for such features — but it shows how we can augment the visual information and make a learning curve easier for customers and workers. </p><p>The list goes further as almost any field of human life relies on our ability to see and can benefit from AR. The actual usage might differ a lot from representation shown in the Marvel Cinematic Universe or sci-fi films but it can definitely be a serious competitor — or at least a great addition — to screens.</p><p>Are you interested in developing an AR project or add augmented reality features to your app?

Still, better late than never, and the event has become such a phenomenon I’m happy I did finish the challenge (or like DigitalOcean calls it – the celebration)! The event has a special place in my heart, as it did (in 2017, I think?) encourage me to contribute more to the community – not only by maintaining this blog but also by occasionally submitting a Pull Request or two to whatever repositories I’ve found useful in my work.<span data-ez-name="koskila_net-box-3"></span></p><p>This year, however, I was more on the fence than ever before. Last year, there had been some complaints about the spamminess of the event; that it encourages quantity over quality. No matter whether your PRs (Pull Request) are accepted or not, you’ll get your shirt. It’s actually easy just to spam a few readme.md updates and be done with it.<span data-ez-name="koskila_net-medrectangle-3"></span></p><p>But this year, the problem got completely out of control. Twitter became kind of crazy with plenty of users tweeting about the absolutely useless pull requests their repositories were bombarded with.</p><p>Examples to follow:</p><figure><figcaption>Source: https://twitter.com/ShivamJoker/status/1314783210836955142?s=19</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/shitoberfest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">#shitoberfest</a> started trending on Twitter.

            <!-- .entry-header -->


            <div>
                
<p>The heartbreak continues for those of us that relied on Sony’s websites to find and buy games or to research what was available. After <a href="https://delistedgames.com/sony-makes-it-official-playstation-3-psp-vita-removed-from-psn-website-between-october-21-and-26/">cutting out</a> older PlayStation content from the PlayStation Store over the past month, Sony’s eye has seemingly fallen on PlayStation.com and I find myself feeling gutted this morning. For those who didn’t use it regularly, PlayStation.com housed a gargantuan history of pages for North American PlayStation releases going all the way back to the original console from 1995. Up until this week you could easily find titles using the search box on the site but now anything before the PlayStation 4 returns a disappointing “<em>0 results found</em>“.</p>



<p>The older pages weren’t overflowing with info but they did offer some product details that I couldn’t easily find elsewhere. For newer games these pages also frequently retained links to the PlayStation Store which helped in my research. Even when they <em>were</em> on sale some games were just hard to find on the PlayStation Store while their PlayStation.com pages linked directly to them. Sometimes these pages were among the scant bits of evidence that I could find to confirm these games even existed digitally. Now, like with the changes to the PlayStation Store, all that’s gone too. Well, mostly gone.</p>



<p>Thankfully, like our “<a href="https://delistedgames.com/get-the-old-playstation-store-back-for-now/">old PS Store</a>” workaround, there’s still a way to search PlayStation.com but it might also eventually go away. Google’s “search within a site” function has been around for nearly a decade at this point but I’m sure lots of people don’t even know it exists. For our purposes just head to <em>the Google</em>, type ‘site:playstation.com’ and then whatever game you’re looking for. You can use Google’s other search operators to refine the results as well. Put it all together and it looks something like this: <strong>site:playstation.com “age of booty”</strong></p>



<p>You’ll get search results across the playstation.com domain including PlayStation Blog posts and PlayStation Store pages but look for the ones that specifically state ‘www.playstation.com’. In the case of Age of Booty the page gives us a description and even some screenshots as well as a ‘Buy Download’ link. Of course, the download page has been hidden by Sony’s recent changes to their sites but the URL remains accessible so you can check other territories or check it out using the “<a href="https://delistedgames.com/get-the-old-playstation-store-back-for-now/">old</a>” method. Yes, <a href="https://delistedgames.com/age-of-booty/">Age of Booty</a> is still delisted on PlayStation 3.</p>



<p>Maybe it was just a feature that only <strong><em>I</em></strong> benefited from but it’s really sad to see Sony ostensibly kill 25 years of PlayStation content on the web. It makes the nostalgia trip of Astro’s Playroom feel a little more hollow.</p>

            <p>Tough questions to ask your remote employer who gives you Cost Of Living based compensation and some thoughts on how remote compensation will work in the future</p>

Make sure she feels that way. <p>By the same token, as a remote worker, you shouldn’t let employers get away with paying you less just because you live in a cheaper city. “Equal pay for equal work” might be a dusty slogan, but it works for a reason. If with regard to compensation you accept being treated as a second-class worker based on location, you’re opening the door to being treated poorly on other matters as well.</p><p>- <a href="https://www.nityesh.com/books-read/#remote-office-not-required-by-david-heinemeier-hanson">Remote</a> by David Heinemeir Hanson and Jason Fried</p></blockquote><p>Almost all the knowledge jobs have become work-from-home in this sudden pandemic. Societies, companies, employees and job-seekers - all have been caught in this sudden shift in the way of working.</p><p>I am writing this for the new job-seekers. It's a tough market out there but you should still expect "equal pay for equal work" at whatever remote company you work for in the future.

Opening the doors to discrimination at work</h3><p>If you don't live in the highest wage city of the world, you might have a peer at the company who lives in a more expensive city than you. Are you ready to be treated as a second-class employee just because of the geography that you live in?</p><p><em>How will you know that all the lousy work doesn't get passed on to you because it is justified in terms of 'returns on investment'?</em></p><p>When your manager has the final say, isn't it possible that they distribute work so that a low-risk, low-impact project is assigned to you while your "more expensive" peers get assigned the high-risk, high impact one?</p><p><strong>HR at your COL company</strong><em>: "We have a policy that says we won't discriminate based on the employee's location."</em></p><p>That's all well and good but what about the silent bias.</p><p><em>How can you be sure that your extremely well-meaning manager wasn't thinking about it when they assign you a project that you don't like? Wouldn't they be making a wise decision that is justified in terms of returns of investment? Can you be sure that they won't?</em></p><h3 id="-2-differences-in-government-spending-across-countries">#2. Differences in Government spending across countries</h3><p>Public spending enables governments to produce and purchase goods and services, in order to fulfil their objectives – such as the provision of public goods or the redistribution of resources - like social protection, education and healthcare.</p><p>Recent data on public spending reveals substantial cross-country heterogeneity. Relative to low-income countries, government expenditure in high-income countries tends to be much larger (both in per capita terms, and as share of GDP), and it also tends to be more focused on social protection.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yes!

      <h2><a href="https://soffes.blog/homebrew-on-apple-silicon">Homebrew on Apple Silicon</a></h2>
      <p>Posted on <time datetime="2020-11-17T00:00:00Z">November 17, 2020</time></p>
    </header>
    <p>Today, my new 13-inch MacBook Pro arrived! I was super excited to get it out of the box and set it up. This thing is fast! I am already very impressed. When I started setting up my development environment, things started to get a little frustrating. Have no fear, it’s solvable!</p>

<p>The biggest issue for me was <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homebrew</a>. According to <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/7857" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this issue</a> “There won’t be any support for native ARM Homebrew installations for months to come.” No big deal though. <mark>Homebrew can work just fine with Rosetta 2</mark> and some things work natively.</p>

<h2>Using Rosetta 2</h2>

<p>Rosetta 2 is Apple’s translation later. This lets you run Intel things with a little overhead. In Terminal, you can run any process with Rosetta by prefixing it with <code>arch -x86_64</code>.</p>

<p>To get Homebrew working, let’s install it using Rosetta:</p>
<pre>$ arch -x86_64 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
</pre>
<p>This command is the standard installer from <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brew.sh</a> with the Rosetta prefix. This will setup Homebrew in <code>/usr/local</code>. Now whenever you want to interact with it, you can run <code>arch -x86_64 brew …</code>. Easy enough!</p>

<p>If you want to wait for official support for Apple Silicon, feel free to stop reading here.</p>

<h2>Multiple Homebrews</h2>

<p>Homebrew does sorta work on Apple Silicon. See <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/7857" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this issue</a> for the current status. OpenJDK and Go don’t work as of this writing and that blocks a lot of things. I was able to get Postgres, Redis, ImageMagick, rbenv, etc. all working natively though! To do this, you’ll need a second Homebrew.</p>

<p>Homebrew for Apple Silicon is expected to be installed in <code>/opt/homebrew</code> instead of the <code>/usr/local</code> you’re expecting. Let’s get that set up:</p>
<pre>$ sudo mkdir -p /opt/homebrew
$ sudo chown -R $(whoami):staff /opt/homebrew
$ cd /opt
$ curl -L https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/tarball/master | tar xz --strip 1 -C homebrew
</pre>
<p>This creates a new directory, setups the right permissions, and downloads Homebrew.</p>

<p>Be sure to add <code>/opt/homebrew/bin</code> to your <code>$PATH</code>!</p>

<p>Whichever <code>brew</code> is in your path first will run when you use <code>brew</code>. If it’s the <code>/usr/local</code> one, you’ll need to add the <code>arch -x86_64</code> prefix every time. Your best bet for using both is to alias one of them.</p>

<p>I made sure <code>/opt/homebrew/bin</code> was in my path <strong>before</strong> <code>/usr/local/bin</code>. Then I aliased the Intel <code>brew</code> to <code>ibrew</code> so it’s easier to select. Here’s what I added to my ZSH configuration:</p>
<pre>export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
alias ibrew='arch -x86_64 /usr/local/bin/brew'
</pre>
<p>Now you can easily run <code>brew</code> to get the native one or <code>ibrew</code> to get the Rosetta one. You could of course do this in the other order in your <code>$PATH</code> if you prefer and something like <code>abrew</code> (for Apple Silicon Homebrew) or whatever else.</p>

<p>If you install things in both Homebrews, the one that is first in your path will be used.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This is as of 2020-11-17. Things are surely going to change. Follow along in <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/7857" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this issue</a> for the latest from the Homebrew team.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2020-11-18:</strong> I realized both at the same time wasn’t working as I described. Updated the multi section.</p>

		<p>How can one recognize whether a product company has a chance to be truly successful, or well, it's doomed for a somewhat vegetative existence? If I had the decent answer to that problem, I'd probably be crazy rich already - so the fact is: <u>I don't</u>. But I think I can clearly recognize some symptoms indicating that the company's getting on <strong>a one-way highway to mediocrity</strong>.</p><p>The whole idea of the healthy, promising online platform is to <strong>(1)</strong> create something your customers want and <strong>(2)</strong> to keep the transactional cost (of adding &amp; operating yet another customer) as low as possible, preferably near-zero-ish. If you keep the 2nd condition met, the whole point is just (well, it's easier said than done, of course ...) to adjust all the knobs of your value proposition (the 1st condition) for your business to take off.</p><p>However, here's what happens in many companies: a salesperson enters the stage ...</p><blockquote>"There's an opportunity. The customer X wants a new summary view, a custom way of aggregating data, modified labels, and a dedicated sales report with XYZ format export option. That's a bit of work, but they indicate it's really important, so please estimate the effort needed - we'll add some margin on the top, charge the customer, and everyone will be happy."</blockquote><p>And everyone <u>should</u> be happy indeed, correct?</p><ol><li>we are the ones crafting the invoice, so we can assure that the income surpasses the estimated cost (effort)</li><li>we're addressing the need brought up directly by the customer - it's certainly an excellent way to maintain or even improve the relationship with that customer</li><li>we're keeping business running - turning effort into jingling coins</li></ol><p>Well, such a way of thinking can secure company's existence over the profitability line, but:</p><ul><li>such changes rarely (if so - by chance) contribute to the <strong>product vision</strong> - actually - quite the opposite, they have a significant chance to water it down; it's the customer who designs your platform (by expressing WHAT, not WHY) - do you remember what <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2017/10/19/on-building-a-faster-horse-design-thinking-for-disruption/">Henry Ford has said</a> about what would happen if he just followed what his customers wished for?</li><li>you may end up with a positive P&amp;L, but you're <strong>adding more liabilities</strong> (stuff to maintain) &amp; even if the cost of maintenance is covered in the calculation, you need to scale the organization for the sake of something only marginally beneficial (scaling is very expensive in non-tangible ways - communication, knowledge mgmt, etc.)</li><li>it's one of the surest ways to <strong>increase the complexity</strong> of your solution</li><li>such features and featurettes are <strong>harder to scrap</strong> (deprecate and decommission) later (the liability is "stronger")</li><li>and at last but not least - your key people <strong>waste time on horseshit</strong> that does not contribute to your org's mission, doesn't contribute to the competitive advantage, doesn't tackle critical problems and constraints - time is always the most critical resource: you are wasting it!</li></ul><hr><p>Why do the the companies fall into such traps? For two main reasons:</p><ol><li>because the organization is <strong>very sales-driven</strong> - the goal (most crucial KPI) is to bring revenue and worry later (about the cost/liabilities); such an organization doesn't have a strong product leadership and/or vision - this is purely project-oriented, not product-oriented thinking</li><li>because the organization's financial situation is unsafe and it looks for the low-hanging fruit - <u>implementing a requested feature is always easier</u> than evolutionary shaping a market-fit product; in the end - they <strong>sacrifice the product's coherent vision just to keep financial fluidity</strong>; or in other words - they put mere survival &amp; vegetation over plans &amp; ambitions - this is frequently a path of no return</li></ol><p>I'm not any platform business's owner, so you may find my suggestion naive and idealistic. Nevertheless, IMHO the answer should be to maintain the laser-sharp FOCUS. It's the only way if you want your product to succeed.</p><p>Keep your product portfolio small &amp; simple, your offering clear and self-explanatory. Ensure the identity of the product leaves no area for misinterpretation (it has to solve a particular, real-life problem!).</p><p>I realize that not doing what customer asks us to may seem counter-intuitive: you're rejecting easy money, you're denying opportunities, you're disappointing customers ... but service (project) and product companies require <strong>a drastically different way of thinking</strong>:</p><p>A typical <u>service company</u> ...</p><ul><li>... can afford thinking only about the direct project outcomes (fulfilling the goal set); complexity, maintenance, long-term consequences: these all are the purchaser's concerns</li><li>... is paid for ... conducting a service, not for how fruitful it turns out to be</li><li>...'s revenue is proportional to effort made (of course rates depend on specialties, seniority, risks, etc.)</li><li>... is a finite game business</li></ul><p>While a <u>product/platform company</u> ...</p><ul><li>... requires understanding (and careful planning) of the liabilities, commitments and maintenance efforts/costs - including which ones are fixed and which ones are variable</li><li>... should build its business upon of a replicable value proposition (create once, profit repeatedly)</li><li>... has virtually unlimited revenue potential (with a wide-enough target group and when addressing common-enough needs) - the income should NOT scale linearly with cost/effort</li><li>... is an infinite game business</li></ul>

It's flagship product is the extended chat service that aims to improve communication. The enhanced chat application with APIs for integrations with third party tools has seen immense success from startups with a handful of folk to enterprises like Blackberry, Bloomberg and VMWare adopting the communications tool at scale.</p><p>The messaging traffic going through this SaaS is incredibly large and the company has been able to keep it's<!-- --> <a href="https://slack.engineering/taking-php-seriously-cf7a60065329">PHP powered backend</a>&nbsp;chugging along fine under huge load reliably with<!-- --> <a href="https://stackshare.io/slack/slack">it's tech stack</a>. This is a critical area, because people will abandon a real time messaging plaform that is not… real time. Slack has done a good job scaling it's backend. Judging by popularity the team has excelled elsewhere as well.</p><p>A chat platform is only as good as it's client apps. In the contemporary working environment a number of devices are used on and off, and many people expect to be able to access Slack and other services from their desktops as well as mobile devices. Chats are increasingly being used as interfaces to other tools, as casual collaborative tasks like user generated content approvals are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DTe6pDCx1w&amp;feature=youtu.be">done through API driven chatbots</a>.</p><p>The corporate chat arena is competitive — both the delivery service and the apps need to be top notch.</p><h2>Mem's the word</h2><p>The mobile apps for Android and iOS devices&nbsp;are generally regarded to be of high quality and you rarely hear negative feedback from them. In the desktop things are different. The main issue is the memory use by the clients, something the company itself has paid attention to:</p><blockquote>However, these capabilities come at a cost: the desktop client can use a lot of memory. This memory footprint increases as the user signs into more teams, as each team runs in its own webview. More memory usage means worse performance, degrading our customer’s experience of Slack and their other applications.<br>-&nbsp;<a href="https://slack.engineering/reducing-slacks-memory-footprint-4480fec7e8eb">Reducing Slack’s memory footprint</a></blockquote><p>The Slack desktop application is created with standard web technologies, with some helpers like <a href="https://slack.engineering/typescript-at-slack-a81307fa288d">Electron and TypeScript</a>.

This is a valid option, but there is a simpler way to manage this. In fact, you're using the best available Slack client as we speak. It's called the web browser.</p><p>Browsers are able to run tens, hundreds, even<!-- --> <a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/story/17/07/22/0236233/the-new-firefox-and-ridiculous-numbers-of-tabs">thousands of tabs</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello and welcome to the fifth post in my series about learning Rust. In case you want to hit it from the start, <a href="https://levpaul.com/posts/rust-lesson-1/">here’s</a> a link to the first one! This entire series covers my journey from being a completely land-locked Gopher to becoming (hopefully) a hardened Rustacean, able to skitter the hazardous seabed of any application safely.</p><hr><p>I can’t believe we’re at post number five! It’s been a wonderful ride, and I’ve been blown away by the helpful feedback from the Rust community at large. Thank you to everyone for all of the warm help.</p><p>Whilst I’m still in my infancy with Rust, it’s getting harder and harder to hold the itch to learn more. Often I want nothing more than to open the Rust Book and truck on with learning, blog posts be darned! However, I’ve made my commitment to myself, you and the Book, so every night; write, I do.</p><p>I’ve decided to make this post a <em>triple</em>, so let’s begin where we left off!</p><h3 id="7-packages-and-crates-and-stuffhttpsdocrust-langorgbookch07-00-managing-growing-projects-with-packages-crates-and-moduleshtmlmanaging-growing-projects-with-packages-crates-and-modules">7. <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-00-managing-growing-projects-with-packages-crates-and-modules.html#managing-growing-projects-with-packages-crates-and-modules">Packages and Crates and Stuff</a></h3><p>Right off the bat, I think this chapter is very well-placed. Even though it took me the entire chapter <em>grok</em> crates, modules and packages; I don’t think it came a line too early or late. Bravo! The chapter introduced many new keywords, such as <code>use</code>, <code>pub</code>, <code>mod</code>, <code>super</code>, but you walk away feeling like you can actually use them properly.</p><h4 id="modules">Modules</h4><p>Modules are introduced leaning heavily on the analogy of a file system… Now given that modules, at the most granular level, can be defined as single files <em>with the module name</em>, I’m actually wondering how much of this <em>is an analogy</em> and how much of it is really what’s happening at the compiler level. I would grin so hard if the bit about <strong><code>use</code></strong> being <em>like</em> a symlink <em>was</em> actually just a thing that was happening somewhere in the build chain. I’m sure it’s not though… Right.</p><h4 id="privacy">Privacy</h4><p>I enjoyed how the authors talked about privacy through scope. It helped me link project structure ideas with programming rules. For some reason I always thought of privacy as logical rules applied to code after the fact, rather than just having or not having something within a certain scope. It’s a lot easier to think about the later way. All this being said, there was also an overarching “Restaurant” example which they tried to tie in with privacy - check this gem:</p><blockquote><p>The way privacy works in Rust is that all items (functions, methods, structs, enums, modules, and constants) are private by default. […] To continue with the restaurant metaphor, think of the privacy rules as being like the back office of a restaurant: what goes on in there is private to restaurant customers, but office managers can see and do everything in the restaurant in which they operate.</p></blockquote><p>… I think that metaphor died somewhere in the rafters above the restaurant, and the smell could be starting to affect the food. Sorry.</p><p>For those who don’t know, privacy in Go is defined by whether you capitalize the first letter of your func/struct/interface name. Whilst lean and consistent - I much prefer the Rust approach. Rust is private by default unless you plop a <code>pub</code> in front of it. The main irk I have with the Go way is that Go’s naming convention also tells you acronyms should be entirely uppercase. So what happens when you want a private struct called <code>jsonData</code>? Well you have to think of something else because calling it <code>JSONData</code> will make it publicly exported and <code>jsonData</code> is not idiomatic. It’s definitely but only a nit, however I’ve become (unreasonably?) irked by it on more than one occasion.</p><h5 id="clean-your-room">Clean your room!</h5><p>The lesson proved once again that the Rust compiler is helpful. Gentle warnings about my variables being unused really makes me feel cared for. Go isn’t like this. Go grabs you by your collar and pierces your eardrums with a shrewd screech. It won’t let you go either. Like a harpy, the tiny chipmunk won’t let up. Thank Crabby for small mercies is all I can say.</p><p>On a more serious note though, I like this choice by Rust - my preference for most things I’d code would be to enforce compiler errors for unused variables; but it should be a compiler option; which as far as I know - it is <strong>not</strong>, in Go. I’m going to guess you should be able to upgrade the Rust warnings to errors through compiler flags somehow.</p><h5 id="re-exporting-imports">Re-exporting Imports</h5><p>This <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-04-bringing-paths-into-scope-with-the-use-keyword.html#re-exporting-names-with-pub-use">feature</a> of Rust gives me mixed feelings. As I understand it, when you <code>use</code> a package, that package can then bring more packages into your scope? I mean it does make sense from a library user-experience perspective, but I can’t help but feel like there’s a bit of trust going on here, if not only taste-trust. It’s definitely nice to just <code>use</code> a crate once and have everything you need to interact with it.</p><p>There’s only one Rust project I’m really interested in right now - a Game engine and editor called <a href="https://github.com/mrDIMAS/rg3d">rg3d</a>. I checked that project’s source for re-exports and found some in the top level <a href="https://github.com/mrDIMAS/rg3d/blob/master/src/lib.rs"><code>lib.rs</code></a>. Basically it just imports its own submodules publicly. I have no idea if this is idiomatic but to my lay-eyes this use-case looks correct and just.</p><p>Rust has been giving me a strong Java vibe from its imports. The nested paths feature seems good - ugly but succinct. Maybe my editor or <code>rustfmt</code> will automatically manage this for me? I enjoy not needing to worry about imports 99% of the time in Go, thanks to <code>goimports</code>, so hopefully that trend will continue in Rust.</p><h5 id="prelude-to-nothing">Prelude to Nothing</h5><p>In previous posts I mentioned being wooed by wistful mentions of a <code>prelude</code> by the Book. Well this chapter mentioned it again, and more than wistfully. It drowned my unquenchable satiety with <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/index.html">this link</a>, which to my utmost sorrow, was not a chapter in the Book. Alas, I read it in spite the fact. Oh, but my heart was flattened like my toddler’s playdough on a Sunday morning, for I was to find <strong>the prelude</strong> means nothing more than the default set of imports for a program. Through the sobriety of hindsight, I do question what else I was expecting. Given Rust doesn’t have a runtime, it doesn’t need anything fancy. Oh well, at least the great prelude mystery is solved.</p><h3 id="8-common-collectionshttpsdocrust-langorgbookch08-00-common-collectionshtml"><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch08-00-common-collections.html">8. Common Collections</a></h3><p>I just want to take a moment to swoon over Rust’s type inference again.</p><p>*<em><strong>swoons</strong></em>*</p><p>It’s fantastic. This is all…</p><hr><p>Now for actual chapter 8; it’s fairly dense. Covered is a brief introduction of standard library’s collections, Vectors, HashMaps and finally a deep dive into Rust Strings. Let’s begin the blow-by-blow starting with this gem:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>v</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>vec</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>4</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>];</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>first</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>&amp;</span><span>v</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>];</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>v</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>6</span><span>);</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>println</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>"The first element is: {}"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>first</span><span>);</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Guess what won’t compile? Correct - the code above! What’s happening here is that <code>v</code> is mutable and <code>first</code> is immutable. If <code>v</code> needs to grow from something like a push; then this may end up moving the entire heap-allocated vector into another part of the heap. Had this to happen, then <code>first</code> would be a “dangling” ref to what <em>used</em> to be the first element of <code>v</code>.</p><p>Now what really tickles me is wondering about how that enforcement is encoded - what is <code>first</code> a reference to exactly? The Vec? No, my IDE tells me it’s an <code>&amp;i32</code> ref… But, somehow the compiler knows that <em>THAT</em> i32 ref is a child, or related to the Vec in the same scope. I
’d love to know more about how this works.</p><p>Perhaps not by major coincidence the Book offers up possibly the most perfect lead for such questions only paragraphs later… The Book introduces the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/vec.html">Rustinomicon</a>, telling us that we can peer into it to see details about how <code>vec</code> is made… At first, I was a little tense. Why does this reference-style-looking book have the Lovecraftian name? Only when I glimpsed the first line of its opening, did the ink droplets align:</p><h3 id="the-dark-arts-of-unsafe-rust"><code>The Dark Arts of Unsafe Rust</code></h3><p>…<em>followed by</em></p><p>THE KNOWLEDGE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF UNLEASHING INDESCRIBABLE HORRORS THAT SHATTER YOUR PSYCHE AND SET YOUR MIND ADRIFT IN THE UNKNOWABLY INFINITE COSMOS.</p><h4 id="okay-this-looks-awesome"><strong>OKAY THIS LOOKS AWESOME</strong>.</h4><p>Flipping back to the <code>vec</code> chapter of the Rustinomicon, I realised it’s not at all a boring appendix style libdoc for vectors - the god damn tomb is teaching you to write your <em>OWN</em> std::Vec from scratch!</p><p>Good God, this is made me bite my lip in awkward nuclear attraction. I had some plans in mind for what I wanted to write about after this series. Right now the thought of doing a mini-series through the nomcon is sounding mighty fine though.. <em>More to come on this later</em>, as I managed to pry myself away and back to the lesson at hand.</p><hr><p>Looking through the method list (by god the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html">doc pages</a> are ugly; hint - only use the sidebar to navigate, do not bother free-scrolling), <code>vec</code> REALLY has some cool funcs. <code>dedup</code>, <code>drain</code>, <code>retain</code> all look to do what you’d expect. I jaunted quickly through <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html"><code>std::iter:Iterator</code></a> too and found SO many nice to haves, such as <code>gt</code>, <code>is_sorted</code>, <code>map</code>, <code>fold</code>, <code>filter</code>…</p><p>Seriously, I know there’s a lot you wouldn’t need here - but I really do wish we had simple collections/traits outside of slices and maps in Go. And yes, before I get screamed at - <em>I know</em> you can write your own in <a href="https://gobyexample.com/collection-functions">a few lines</a>, but it’s not the same - especially when you start involving complex data types.

<p>Nixpkgs maintains the highest rating on <a href="https://repology.org/">Repology</a> for having the most packages &amp; which are up to date. Unfortunately even with the current ecosystem of packages, there will always be gaps, and for beginners in NixOS a common question is:</p>

<p><em>“I’ve download a binary and would like to run it on NixOS”</em></p>

<p><strong>Can we do better &amp; streamline running non-Nix software?</strong> 🤔</p>

<p>This was some of the questions posed by some Nix contributors and I wanted to capture the ideas put forward for others.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="a-brief-tour-of-linking">A brief tour of linking</h2>

<p>Without going into a ton of detail about how dynamic libraries are performed on Linux; a Linux binary - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format">ELF format</a> - contains information pertaining to the dynamic libraries necessary for the binary.</p>

<p>For instance, here is a non-NixOS Ruby installation.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>❯ readelf <span>-d</span> <span>$(</span>which ruby<span>)</span> | <span>grep </span>NEEDED
 0x0000000000000001 <span>(</span>NEEDED<span>)</span>             Shared library: <span>[</span>libruby-2.7.so.2.7]
 0x0000000000000001 <span>(</span>NEEDED<span>)</span>             Shared library: <span>[</span>libc.so.6]
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>It requires two dynamic libraries <em>libruby</em> &amp; <em>libc</em>. These libraries may themselves have other dependencies, so we can use <strong>ldd</strong> to recursively find the dependency closure.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>❯ ldd <span>$(</span>which ruby<span>)</span>
    linux-vdso.so.1 <span>(</span>0x00007ffed1705000<span>)</span>
    /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libnss_cache.so.2 <span>(</span>0x00007f3626cd0000<span>)</span>
    libruby-2.7.so.2.7 <span>=&gt;</span> /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libruby-2.7.so.2.7 <span>(</span>0x00007f3626960000<span>)</span>
    libc.so.6 <span>=&gt;</span> /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 <span>(</span>0x00007f362679b000<span>)</span>
    libpthread.so.0 <span>=&gt;</span> /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0 <span>(</span>0x00007f3626779000<span>)</span>
    librt.so.1 <span>=&gt;</span> /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/librt.so.1 <span>(</span>0x00007f362676e000<span>)</span>
    libgmp.so.10 <span>=&gt;</span> /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgmp.so.10 <span>(</span>0x00007f36266eb000<span>)</span>
    libdl.so.2 <span>=&gt;</span> /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 <span>(</span>0x00007f36266e3000<span>)</span>
    libcrypt.so.1 <span>=&gt;</span> /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcrypt.so.1 <span>(</span>0x00007f36266a8000<span>)</span>
    libm.so.6 <span>=&gt;</span> /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6 <span>(</span>0x00007f3626564000<span>)</span>
    /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 <span>(</span>0x00007f3626cde000<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can see here that <strong>ldd</strong> resolved the libraries to locations in my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard">Filesystem Hierarchy Standard</a>(FHS).</p>

<p>This is <em>not hermetic</em>, as the FHS is a global shared state across my machine.
This is the exact problem that Nix itself wants to address.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m on a Debian distro at the moment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nix addresses this generally by patching the ELF header to <em>fully specify</em> where the shared libraries can be found in the <em>/nix/store</em>; so that they are not resolved or searched on the FHS.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>❯ readelf -d $(which ruby) | grep RUNPATH
 0x000000000000001d (RUNPATH) Library runpath:
 [/nix/store/z5lira1853d97gbmv1qbdjjpkjn7ksj8-ruby-2.6.6/lib:
 /nix/store/8fcxqg8dmwlkjw2vgkgz607kr5jy552w-zlib-1.2.11/lib:
 /nix/store/kah5n342wz4i0s9lz9ka4bgz91xa2i94-glibc-2.32/lib]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This <em>patching</em> however relies on the Nix <em>stdenv</em> derivation builder and ultimately is what makes binaries in Nix work.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nix actually takes it a step further and patches the linker so that it does not even try to check the FHS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Binaries downloaded from the Internet are not patched. What can be done?</p>

<h2 id="interpreter">Interpreter</h2>

<p>A key insight into the bootstrapping of an ELF binary in Linux is the <em>interpreter</em>, whose presence is there to help satisfy any dynamic linkage.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look again at my non-Nix Ruby binary</p>

<div><div><pre><code>❯ readelf <span>-l</span> <span>$(</span>which ruby<span>)</span> | <span>grep </span>interpreter
      <span>[</span>Requesting program interpreter: /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2]
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nix built binaries use a <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/patchelf">patchelf</a> utility that not only sets the <em>RUNPATH</em> to pin libraries but also changes the interpreter to one in the <em>/nix/store</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is the interpreter’s goal to find the libraries listed in the ELF file either via the <em>RUNPATH</em>, <em>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</em> or the <em>FHS</em> well known directories.</p>

<p>⚠️ On NixOS <code>/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2</code> normally <strong>does not exist</strong> and as a result you will be greeted with an unfriendly <em>“bad ELF interpreter: No such file or directory”</em> error.</p>

<h2 id="nix-ld">nix-ld</h2>

<p>We have a binary that needs some shared libraries &amp; the bootstrapping process calls out to the interpreter set in the ELF header.</p>

<p>💡 Let’s put a <em>fake</em> interpreter on NixOS machines!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This idea works since the path of Linux <em>ld</em> is well known for each distribution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For instance, NixOS machines can place an entry at <em>/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2</em> for a custom binary that can help resolve dynamic libraries <strong>at runtime</strong> to libraries within the <em>/nix/store</em>.</p>

<p>This is in fact what <a href="https://github.com/Mic92">Mic92</a> has started with his project <a href="https://github.com/Mic92/nix-ld">nix-ld</a>.</p>

<p>How can our custom <em>ld</em> locate the necessary libraries though? This is where we can get really crazy. 🤪</p>

<p>We can use <a href="https://github.com/bennofs/nix-index">nix-index</a> – a files database for nixpkgs – to locate packages in Nix that provide the necessary library. 🤯</p>

<p>The packages can be realized on-demand onto the host and their <em>/nix/store</em> entry can then be included into the <em>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</em> environment variable set when handing off to the <em>real ld</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If gc-roots are set for the required libraries, this determination can then be cached for a given binary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fancier best-effort matching on picking packages that have the highest % of required symbols could also be done.</p>

<p>It seems kind of crazy that just picking random packages from the <em>nix-index</em> would ultimately let us run the binary; except that is how traditional software in Linux normally works! 😱</p>

<p>At worst it is providing the same experience users typically experience on non-NixOS distributions but giving a gentler onboarding for people as they see the Nix-light 😇</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-00c327a0e80805b65a15"><div><p>At the beginning of Alfred W. McCoy’s seminal work on the global heroin trade and the CIA, <em>The Politics of Heroin</em>, he gives us a simple formulation that’s useful for any study of illicit drugs and their trade: ‘Narcotics are not simply illegal and immoral,’ he writes. ‘They are the source of extraordinary profits and power.’ Part of the power of McCoy’s book is that he writes about his subject so thoughtfully, and eschews the sensationalism that characterizes too much writing about drugs and their traffic. ‘Simply put, narcotics are major global commodities that resist any attempt at localized suppression… As long as demand for drugs in the cities of the First World continues to grow, Third World producers will find a way to supply their markets.’</p><p>Nacho Carretero’s <em>Snow on The Atlantic, How Cocaine Came to Europe</em>, published in a translation by Thomas Bunstead in 2018 by Zed Books, is a contribution to telling the story of one of these global commodities: cocaine. It tells a tale of Galicia and its Costa Del Morte, that region in Spain sitting on top of Portugal with 930 deadly miles of coastline and an adventurous history of shipwrecks and pirates and smuggling. This book focuses on the colorful tale of how Galicia became the port for cocaine smuggling in Europe, largely through an alliance between the Medellín Cartel in Colombia and a homegrown smuggling culture and network of clans. It’s packed with characters and schemes and police operations, but one flaw is that it falls into their sensationalism too often (a <a href="https://www.antena3.com/series/farina/">popular television series</a> in Spain was based on the book), and its major failing is in not making much of an attempt to analyze the phenomenon more deeply. The details in the book, however, make great raw material for a more developed analysis down the line.</p><p>Here is a sketch of the story that Carretero tells: it begins in earnest after the Spanish Civil War, in that inter-border region between Spain and Portugal called the <em>Couto Mixto</em>. Carretero goes as far as to say the area is characterized by a ‘statelessness.’ Not so long ago, as recently as the nineteenth century, if you asked villagers in the area what country they were citizens of they couldn’t tell you. The Spanish Civil War defined these borders. And those borders made nations become as classes; the living standard in Portugal was high, while in Spanish Galicia much of the rural inhabitants lived in relative and real poverty. It was the difference, Carretero writes, ‘between one group of people who were starving, and another enjoying the spoils of African colonies.’ This was something I wish Carretero had expanded on: what was the licit economy in Galicia and why did its people live worse? On that he gives no real answer, though he does describe how some local fortunes were made from tungsten sold to the Third Reich during the Second World War.</p><p>Whatever the reasons for this poverty, the relative affluence of Portugal right across the border made Galicia a prime location for smuggling of all sorts of things. It was cigarettes which became the big money maker. Smugglers cut deals with the big guys like Reynolds &amp; Philip Morris in America to move excess production and faulty batches, dodging gargantuan amounts of taxes, and altering the flow of goods from up from Portugal to across the Atlantic. That route would define the traffic later when cocaine started coming from Colombia.&nbsp;</p><p>The law helped too. Until 1982 all you could get for smuggling was a caution. Before 1978 smuggling was only an economic offence. With the Customs Surveillance Service (SVA) enforcing the weak laws, smugglers rarely went to jail – at most they’d get a fine, and that would often be lost in the Minoan bureaucratic system of the new democratic state post-Franco.</p><p>Carretero describes a society where the lumpen ruled each class strata, not just a lumpen-proletariat but a lumpen-petty bourgeois and a lumpen bourgeoisie. ‘There was nothing abnormal about the sight of smugglers and <em>guardias</em> sharing a tumbler of wine over a game of dominos in the local tavern.’ He explains further that smugglers and police would often have agreements that let the smuggling pass unmolested, provided the police got their cut: ‘From the beginning, the relationship with the <em>Guardia Civil </em>was good. Those in the pay of the government were as hard up as everyone else, and it was almost always them who proposed the pacts.’</p><p>Police in on the take isn’t unprecedented or uncommon. More interesting are the connections Carretero details between the smugglers and the political class. When I mention smugglers, I’m referring not just to the later drug traffickers but also the ‘smoke lords’ who developed their expertise and reputation moving cigarettes. They provided the perfect resource for the cartels to exploit later when they saw the talent and culture that existed in Galicia. These mafia-like clans were generous contributors to all political parties in the region, particularly the institutional right-wing parties like the <em>People’s Alliance</em> (AP), which later became the <em>Partido Popular</em> (PP). That party had numerous links to the smugglers, from campaign contributions to friendships, to particularly salient connections through the Galician Chamber of Commerce, of which many smugglers and their associates were members at one time or another. That extended to the auxiliaries of the narcotics trade – lawyers like Pablo Vioque who defended the smugglers in their inevitable run-ins with the law.</p><div><p>How the shift to drug smuggling was made is murky. Someone bought hashish once from Africa and knew one of the <em>Capos</em>. Hashish smuggling quickly became cocaine.</p><p> However it happened, smugglers made the transition quickly. When the Medellín cartel spent some time in Galicia in exile they realized that there was an ideal infrastructure for them to use. They built this trade from the ready-made scaffolding of the tobacco trade. Clan bosses like Sito Miñanco took the speedboats they had running crates of smoke up and down the Arousa river and loaded them with blow.&nbsp;</p></div><p>The Medellín cartel had come to Galica because they were feeling some heat from the DEA in bringing drugs into the U.S. (never if it went at cross measures with the goals of the CIA, of course, as McCoy shows in his book), and they needed new markets. McCoy’s law of narcotics as commodities seeking to be sold held true. Europe in the 80s was the perfect logical next step. Not only did they have the skilled talent they needed, but the Galicians spoke their language. And the government tied its own hands to stop it thanks to their numerous corrupt connections.</p><p>This is the more interesting story that I wish the book had told, as well as delving deeper into the politics of the trade. Why did Galician politicians allow the smuggling culture to take hold? Carretero mentions that a factor in the government finally taking action was the support for interdiction of the trade by Socialist Party (PSOE) politicians, like Felipe González, who was Prime Minister of the country from 1982-1996. It was within this time period that the first blow against the smugglers came, with the ‘macro-indictment’ of 1984. This was the first coordinated strike against the whole of the smugglers and their network, rather than limited and ineffective isolated enforcement. Carretero credits the limited success of this action (nobody went down hard, though it did create a new state of affairs where the smugglers had to tread more cautiously and not so out in the open as they had before) to it having the support of a Virginio Fuentes. Fuentes was the socialist governor of Pontevedra, ‘one of the few in Galician politics to raise his voice against the smugglers.’ Carretero attributes this to Fuentes following the cue of González; he ‘sensed a potential vote-winner in taking a stand against smuggling.’</p><p>But Carretero also mentions a murkier story that would have merited closer scrutiny (or more realistically its own book). He relates an anecdote from Fernando Rodríguez Mondragón’s book <em>El hijo del ‘Ajedrecista’ </em>(The ‘Chess Player's’ Son). That chess player was Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela, who was the boss of the Cali cartel – the cartel that shipped the cocaine over the Atlantic to Galicia. Orejuela was in Spain following a crackdown in Colombia by the President Belisario Betancur on the narcos, but he had been scooped up in November of ‘84 in Spain along with an account book of his detailing millions of dollars in transactions for the cartel. The DEA wanted Orejuela extradited to America, but after two years of jockeying and negotiation, Orejuela and the Colombians were sent back to Colombia. They spent just months in prison before getting out, while in America they could have expected 10-15-year prison sentences.</p><p>Mondragón says in his book that the reason for these reduced sentences came to Spain on Pablo Escobar’s private jet. And there were twenty million of these reasons. $5 million went to Felipe González, ‘his negotiators said there was an election coming up and they needed the money.’ $10 million went to the <em>Audiencia Nacional</em>, ‘the High Court in Spain with jurisdiction over international crimes.’ Carretero doesn’t dig any deeper into these explosive allegations, wrapping up tersely that ‘these claims remain unsubstantiated.’ But having questions like these answered would go a long way in understanding how exactly the drug trade was tolerated by the Spanish government.&nbsp;</p><p>McCoy notes that ‘the CIA’s Cold War alliances with drug lords ... created enforcement-free zones closed to outside investigation.’ How this worked was simple, ‘the DEA deferred to the CIA during the Cold War whenever covert operations became intertwined in the drug trade…’ Its links to the Medellín cartel, which Pablo Escobar founded, are documented as well. ‘All major U.S. agencies,’ writes McCoy, ‘have gone on the record stating, with varying degrees of frankness, that the Medellín cartel used contra forces to smuggle cocaine into the …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><p>I find it challenging to keep commits consistent and perfectly segmented. My original reasoning was a lack of discipline on my end. But over time, I discovered that I am the majority. My new conclusion is it's not me. It's git's fault.</p><p>Human brains function in vastly different ways among the population. Some are logical; some are sensitive, and some are more organised than others. <del>Astrology can explain it all</del>. The two forms of thinking that are related to this topic is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergent_thinking">divergent thinking</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_thinking">convergent thinking</a>. If you are more of a divergent thinker, you might find ideas popping up in your head constantly (which is pretty annoying sometimes). That's because your brain works by association more. Input from the world, in the case of writing code, is mostly the existing codebase, combined with your past experiences with previous projects, which will generate ideas of how to solve your current tasks. And ideas will trigger more thoughts in a chaining fashion. That's why I often find myself ending up in a place that's nothing to do with the original task. And it's often too late when I realised that (i.e. progress has been made, but not finished). Sometimes there were multiple jumps. When I finish all the bits I started, that's when the biggest problem of the whole work comes in: writing a commit message. Here is an example of a very common commit message in my works.</p><pre><code>fix issue #45

- add [aaa] support
- improve ergonomics of API [bbb]
- refactor [ccc] to [ddd] so that it fits in the eco-system
- oh, package X just became multiple sub packages, we have an eco-system now</code></pre><div><h2>Solutions and Their Problems</h2><p>I have made numerous attempts to improve the situation. Most of the ideas are from "industry best practices".</p><div><h3>create branches for everything</h3><p>This idea came early. Branching makes sense when you work with other people because you are working in parallel. Merging code and resolve conflicts is worth the effort in that scenario. You get the cost back easily from the progress gain due to parallelisation of your work. But it falls apart when the scope is about you and your thoughts. Yes, you are generating more ideas then you physically can keep up with your code, but you are still single-threaded processor. Merging old branches is not a fun activity.</p></div><div><h3>commit often</h3><p>I mean like very often! It's always a good idea to follow the first principle in any engineering problems. Breaking things down into atomic pieces and commit frequently is a sound solution. You also have the benefit of being able to revert specific changes quickly since they are small(er) and (more) atomic. I tried this for a while. The trick is to build up a habit of recognising boundaries and commit without procrastination. In practice, though, I find myself, more often than I would like to, going back changing the git history just to align with the principle. Maybe I should just accept that nobody is perfect, it's okay to mess things up from time to time. But that really demotivate me to keep doing it. Also, I have to constantly be aware of the situation at hand. That's extra brain energy I don't want to waste during heavy works.</p></div></div><div><h2>My Current Solution</h2><p>It's not a solution per se; it's more of a compromise. (Well, isn't that the nature of life 😉?) Or you can say I don't have a solution yet, and I am getting by with it.</p><div><h3>breaking things down (or I try to)</h3><p>I try to break things down to manageable size and commit as soon as the progress is granular. Sometimes it might be an entirely different task I was set out to do because of my divergent thinking nature.</p></div><div><h3>keep track of everthing going on in my brain efficiently</h3><p>I use one <a href="https://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a> file (it's a plain text format for keeping notes and todo lists, you can use whatever works for you, even multiple apps) per project to document my thoughts, ideas, review them regularly, transform them into tasks, and document the progress. I try to keep the file with the repo, but sometimes I don't necessarily want to share my thought process with others, say a work-related repo, or an open-source one. Then it goes into my own knowledge base.</p></div><div><h3>be stingy about branching</h3><p>I know one of the biggest selling points of git is: branching is cheap. It depends on the reason for branching, as I described above. It is definitely not cheap in solo scenarios. So I only create branches when:</p><ul><li>It's the start of a new era. E.g. orgajs v1.0 -&gt; v2.0. The whole thing will be gutted and refactored to death and brought back to life stronger.</li><li>work with other people, of course.

<p>Shaarif Ansari got the call on 11 November at around 9 in the morning. On the phone was a police officer from Powai police station, in the suburbs of Mumbai. “Ansari please come to the police station,” said the officer. “We have received a complaint from your employer WhiteHat Jr. The company officials are here at the station already. We are waiting for you.”&nbsp;</p>


<p>Ansari was taken aback. It is not everyday that you have a police officer call you. Almost immediately he clarified that he did not work at WhiteHat Jr anymore. That he was fired by the company in the first week of September and had had no contact with them since, so what was all this about? The person was in no mood to explain or chat. He cut Ansari off, and asked him to turn up at the station immediately. Caught completely by surprise and with no idea about what was in store for him, Ansari said he was on his way.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>A quick summary of Postgres views, materialized views, and why you should use them.</p><h3>What is a View?</h3><p>A <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-createview.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">view</a> is a convenient shortcut to a query. Creating a view does not involve new tables or data. When run, an underlying query is executed, returning its results to the user.</p><h4>Basic Example</h4><p>Say we have the following tables from a database of a university:</p><p><strong>students</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>id</th><th>name</th><th>type</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Arun</td><td>undergraduate</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Zack</td><td>graduate</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Joy</td><td>graduate</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>courses</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>id</th><th>title</th><th>code</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Introduction to Postgres</td><td>PG101</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Authentication Theories</td><td>AUTH205</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Fundamentals of Supabase</td><td>SUP412</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>grades</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>id</th><th>student_id</th><th>course_id</th><th>result</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>B+</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>A+</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>A</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>A-</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>A</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>B-</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Creating a view consisting of all the three tables will look like this:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>create</span><span> </span><span>view</span><span> transcripts </span><span>as</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>select</span><span></span></p><p><span>        students</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        students</span><span>.</span><span>type</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        courses</span><span>.</span><span>title</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        courses</span><span>.</span><span>code</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        grades</span><span>.</span><span>result</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>from</span><span> grades</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>left</span><span> </span><span>join</span><span> students </span><span>where</span><span> grades</span><span>.</span><span>student_id </span><span>=</span><span> students</span><span>.</span><span>id</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>left</span><span> </span><span>join</span><span> courses </span><span>where</span><span> grades</span><span>.</span><span>course_id </span><span>=</span><span> courses</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>Once done, we can now access the underlying query with:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>select</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> transcripts</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>For additional parameters or options, refer <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-createview.html#:~:text=parameters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><h3>Why should we use Views?</h3><p>Views provide the several benefits:</p><ul><li>Simplicity</li><li>Consistency</li><li>Logical Organization</li><li>Security</li></ul><h4>Simplicity</h4><p>As a query becomes complex it becomes a hassle to call it. Especially when we run it at regularly. In the example above, instead of repeatedly running:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>select</span><span></span></p><p><span>    students</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    students</span><span>.</span><span>type</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    courses</span><span>.</span><span>title</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    courses</span><span>.</span><span>code</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    grades</span><span>.</span><span>result</span></p><p><span></span><span>from</span><span> grades</span></p><p><span></span><span>left</span><span> </span><span>join</span><span> students </span><span>where</span><span> grades</span><span>.</span><span>student_id </span><span>=</span><span> students</span><span>.</span><span>id</span></p><p><span></span><span>left</span><span> </span><span>join</span><span> courses </span><span>where</span><span> grades</span><span>.</span><span>course_id </span><span>=</span><span> courses</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>We can run this instead:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>select</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> transcripts</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>Additionally, a view behaves like a typical table. We can safely use it in table <code>JOIN</code>s or even create new views using existing views.</p><h4>Consistency</h4><p>Views ensure that the likelihood of mistakes decreases when repeatedly executing a query. In our example above, we may decide that we want to exclude the course <em>Introduction to Postgres</em>. The query would become:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>select</span><span></span></p><p><span>    students</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    students</span><span>.</span><span>type</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    courses</span><span>.</span><span>title</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    courses</span><span>.</span><span>code</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    grades</span><span>.</span><span>result</span></p><p><span></span><span>from</span><span> grades</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>left</span><span> </span><span>join</span><span> students </span><span>where</span><span> grades</span><span>.</span><span>student_id </span><span>=</span><span> students</span><span>.</span><span>id</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>left</span><span> </span><span>join</span><span> courses </span><span>where</span><span> grades</span><span>.</span><span>course_id </span><span>=</span><span> courses</span><span>.</span><span>id</span></p><p><span></span><span>where</span><span> courses</span><span>.</span><span>code </span><span>!=</span><span> </span><span>'PG101'</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>Without a view, we would need to go into every dependent query to add the new rule. This would increase in the likelihood of errors and inconsistencies, as well as introducing a lot of effort for a developer. With views, we can alter just the underlying query in the view <strong>transcripts</strong>. The change will be applied to all applications using this view.</p><h4>Logical Organization</h4><p>With views, we can give our query a name. This is extremely useful for teams working with the same database. Instead of guessing what a query is supposed to do, a well-named view can easily explain it. For example, by looking at the name of the view <strong>transcripts</strong>, we can infer that the underlying query might involve the <strong>students</strong>, <strong>courses</strong>, and <strong>grades</strong> tables.</p><h4>Security</h4><p>Views can restrict the amount and type of data presented to a user. Instead of allowing a user direct access to a set of tables, we provide them a view instead. We can prevent them from reading sensitive columns by excluding them from the underlying query.</p><h3>What is a Materialized View?</h3><p>A <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/rules-materializedviews.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">materialized view</a> is a form of view but with the added feature of physically storing the results. In subsequent reads of a materialized view, the time taken to return its results would be much faster than a conventional view. This is because the data is readily available for a materialized view while the conventional view executes the underlying query each time it is called.</p><h4>Basic Example</h4><p>Using our example above, a materialized view can be created like this:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>create</span><span> materialized </span><span>view</span><span> transcripts </span><span>as</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>select</span><span></span></p><p><span>        students</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        students</span><span>.</span><span>type</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        courses</span><span>.</span><span>title</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        courses</span><span>.</span><span>code</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        grades</span><span>.</span><span>result</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>from</span><span> grades</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>left</span><span> </span><span>join</span><span> students </span><span>where</span><span> grades</span><span>.</span><span>student_id </span><span>=</span><span> students</span><span>.</span><span>id</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>left</span><span> </span><span>join</span><span> courses </span><span>where</span><span> grades</span><span>.</span><span>course_id </span><span>=</span><span> courses</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>Reading from the materialized view is the same as a conventional view:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>select</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> transcripts</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>For additional parameters or options, refer <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-creatematerializedview.html#:~:text=parameters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><h4>Refreshing</h4><p>Unfortunately, there is a trade-off - data in materialized views are not always up to date. We need to refresh it regularly to prevent the data from becoming too stale. To do so:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>refresh materialized </span><span>view</span><span> transcripts</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>It's up to you how regularly refresh your materialized views, and it's probably different for each view depending on its use-case.</p><h3>Materialized views vs Conventional views</h3><p>Materialized views are useful when execution times for queries or views become unbearable or exceed the service level agreements of a business. These could likely occur in views or queries involving multiple tables and millions of rows. When using such a view, however, there should be tolerance towards data being outdated. Some use-cases for materialized views are internal dashboards and analytics.</p><p>Creating a materialized view is not a solution to inefficient queries. You should always seek to optimize a slow running query even if you are implementing a materialized view.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Postgres views and materialized views are a great way to organize and view results from commonly used queries. Although similar to one another, each has its purpose. Views simplify the process of running queries. Materialized views are usually faster at returning results, with the trade-off of having stale data.</p></section></div>]]>

<br>
<h3>The UNIX philosophy</h3>

<p>
In UNIX, there is (or used to be) a philosophy which, among other things, 
stipulates that a piece of software should do "one thing well". There is 
of course a long-running debate over not only what this really means, 
but also about whether certain programs - if any at all - still adhere 
to this, or ever did.
</p>

<p>
So, we're allegedly in the middle of a dangerous downward spiral of 
constant feature creep and a growing number of command parameters that 
will, eventually, lead to a Grand Unified Program that does everything
poorly (Depending on your personal preference and current mood, replace
the GUP with systemd, Emacs, Windows or Google Chrome as you see fit).
</p>

<p>
I for one find the concept of the UNIX philosophy of doing one thing 
well amicable. I also realize that it is a product of a time when 
computers still mostly passed around text files, and that those text 
files were considered preposterously huge if they exceeded a couple of 
megs in size. Heck, the modern GUI was still a research project at PARC 
when Doug McIlroy wrote the UNIX philosophy down in 1976.
</p>

<h3>Thinkin' 'bout philosophy</h3>
<p>
So, what does it mean to do one thing and do it well? Well, awk has been
a staple of any UNIX diet since the late 1970s. I think it's a lovely
little tool which I use even for rather mundane tasks. It's certainly
changed a bit over the years, but the core concept of the language
remains the same. Still, it's a complete programming language and
can do a lot more than a simple, single-purpose command.
</p>

<p>
The cut command is slightly newer, but like awk, it's a part of the 
POSIX standard. It can also hardly be considered to have suffered much 
feature creep: it's got a rather stringent set of parameters and really 
does just one thing, which is cutting a smaller piece of text out of a 
larger piece of text.
</p>

<p>
The question is of course, does the UNIX philosophy still hold up? Is it always
better to have one small program doing one thing well, as opposed to a
slightly bigger program doing many things? Let's examine this by performing
a simple task with two slightly different twists.
</p>

<h3>Task number one</h3>

<p>
Task number one was to print the second column of a three-column file with
10,000 rows, with a single space separating the columns. This task was
repeated 100 times.
</p>

<p>
<b>cut (GNU coreutils, 43224 bytes)</b>
</p>
<pre>cat cva_in1 | cut -d ' ' -f 2 &gt; /dev/null

real    0m0.297s
user    0m0.288s
sys     0m0.153s
</pre>

<p>
<b>awk (gawk, 658072 bytes)</b>
</p>
<pre>cat cva_in1 | awk '{print $2}' &gt; /dev/null

real    0m0.818s
user    0m0.754s
sys     0m0.232s
</pre>

<p>
<b>Python 3 (Python 3.6, 4526456 bytes + libraries)</b>
<br>
My go-to language for farting around with programming ideas, thus
included for reference. The below two lines of code were written to
a script through which the input was piped and, just as above,
redirected to /dev/null:
</p>
<pre>import sys
for l in sys.stdin: print(l.split()[1])

real    0m5.423s
user    0m4.753s
sys     0m0.873s
</pre>

<p>
As is clearly evident from this highly scientific performance test,
cut is by far the fastest tool for the job. I tried a few different
approaches with Python (such as opening the file from the script
instead of piping it), but they were all similarly slow.
</p>

<h3>Task number two</h3>

<p>
This time, things were spiced up by printing the fifth column in a file 
with unevenly-spaced columns, using the output from "ls -l". The file 
used for testing contained 2235 lines. This task was also repeated 100 
times. Since cut doesn't quite cope with this uneven spacing, we had to 
put the magic of the UNIX philosophy to work using pipes: this time, tr 
was involved as well, stripping away spaces to make each row 
understandable to cut.
</p>

<p>

Despite the extra pipe, it seems the UNIX philosophy comes out

<h3>A few notes</h3>
<p>
This is of course not an exhaustive test and proves little, if anything 
at all, about he UNIX philosophy. I just wanted to perform a simple test 
with a scenario that at least I have come across many different 
times in many different scripts and many different languages.
</p>

<p>
In a typical daily scenario, I would personally have picked awk for task 
two and saved myself a bit of typing and figuring. This would have made 
no significant impact on perceived performance, because I usually don't 
deal with very large files and in most cases, the time I spend with 
tools I'm less comfortable with far exceeds the time I then spend 
waiting for the script. Still: based on nothing but gut feeling, I 
actually expected awk to be faster or at least comparable for task two. 
So much for my gut.
</p>

<p>
For coping with more complex scenarios without resorting to a language 
proper, more pipes will have to be added and more command line utilities 
will have to be invoked if we want to keep on using tools compliant with 
the UNIX philosophy. This can likely lead to worse performance, but this 
test just goes to show (for the umpteenth time) that the tool we 
instinctively reach for to tackle a task might not be the right one.

<p>Why did it take so long, couple little nuggets here to chew on for fellow hashnoders.</p>
<h2 id="2014">2014</h2>
<p>Apple released Swift, thought it was cool and set out to build first apps. </p>
<p>I wanted to build games to build something fun so I created a couple different card games for the iPad and also a novel puzzler for iOS. </p>
<p>I had <strong>zero knowledge of marketing</strong>, didn't really think about <strong>WHY</strong> the large global markets would be interested in obscure Finnish card games and overall just did a real rookie job.</p>
<p>I was a decent coder, but I think that's pretty much where it started and ended.</p>
<h2 id="2015-2016">2015-2016</h2>
<p>Not too much activity, kept tinkering with a number of projects but didn't release new significant stuff. </p>
<p>Didn't count the non-published projects that were taken quite far but I'm sure there was many. </p>
<p>What can be learned here? <strong>You can't win if you don't play the game.</strong></p>
<h2 id="2017-2018">2017-2018</h2>
<p>This was the first time I started to see more traction. There were two reasons why this happened.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>I created a couple of games that already had audience (Klondike, Spider and Freecell Solitaire). Games that many people love and will always look to find for their new HW. <strong>In short, launching something with a pre-existing demand</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I started primarily focusing on the MacOS market. The iOS simple games market is incredible competitive. There are big studios there that pour in big bucks to make really refined experiences and make the games freemium. It's really hard in that environment to be discovered or sell your games for a few bucks. But in the Mac App Store this was possible. In other words, <strong>finding a market with less competition and easier discoverability</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Still didn't really spend that much time on indie hacking, community building, marketing in general or much else. Just built a few games, put 'em out there and tried to make sure most gamers would be happy with them.</p>
<h2 id="2019">2019</h2>
<p>Quite suddenly and unexpectedly my sales made a huge jump in Q4 2019. Without releasing anything new. What happened? </p>
<p>Apple released macOS Catalina that would not run 32-bit apps anymore. </p>
<p>This meant that <strong>they erased much of the competition</strong> for the card games and all of a sudden more people were looking for these games and had less options to choose from. One would rather excel due to their own great products, but everything counts, right?</p>
<p>At the same time I also knew that I really had to create more something totally different, was simply not interested to put too much effort into this genre anymore.</p>
<h2 id="2020">2020</h2>
<p>The year obviously went haywire from the start and under quarantine I had a chance to finalise and release an app into a totally new genre - productivity. </p>
<p>I created a pretty simple Mac utility  <a target="_blank" href="https://owlocr.com/">OwlOCR</a> and for the first time tried to release in a more sensible way. I published some posts in r/macapps and got phenomenal feedback that really helped improve the app. Super thankful to these early users.</p>
<p>I then launched PH and got a lot of downloads, but less direct feedback. At this point app was still free as I wanted to get some footprint first. </p>
<p>After a few months of totally free, I introduced a premium in-app tier to help with further development. Sales of this tier have been pretty steady and there hasn't been too much negative backlash, as I've kept most features free for all.</p>
<p>This was the first app where I put more effort into the webpage and release efforts, I think next ones should easier as I know a bit more again how to play it.</p>
<p>There's still waaaaayyyyy long way to go before this could be primary source of bread and butter, but the last year has given at least kind of a glimpse of that. </p>
<p>I'm afraid I might need to pivot away from the Mac App Store however, as it opens to iOS apps in the future. At that point I'm afraid it will become as convoluted with big player apps that the indies will be pushed to the sidelines.</p>

<section id="mc_embed_signup">

</section>
<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about writing lately. I recently <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/cto-writer">left a career as a startup CTO to write full-time</a>, so when people ask me things like, “Why should software engineers know how to write?” I have a lot of thoughts. Rather than write yet another listicle (<a href="https://www.thegraidenetwork.com/blog-all/2017/10/3/why-math-and-science-students-need-writing">1</a>, <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2019/03/02/the-importance-of-writing">2</a>, <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/why-developers-should-know-how-to-write-dc35aa9b71ab/">3</a>, <a href="https://www.tiny.cloud/blog/developer-blog-writing-social-networks/">4</a>), I am going to boil it down to one simple reason:</p>
<p><strong>You should write to increase your level of influence.</strong></p>
<h2 id="why-influence-matters">Why Influence Matters</h2>
<p>Whether you strive to be promoted within your organization or be fawned over by the coolest tech companies, the fastest path to success is making the right people aware of you. In one of the best essays of career advice for programmers, Patrick McKenzie points out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Most jobs are never available publicly, just like most worthwhile candidates are not available publicly. Information about the position travels at approximately the speed of beer, sometimes lubricated by email.” - <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/">Patrick McKenzie, Don’t Call Yourself a Programmer</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, just being the “best” programmer around isn’t going to get you talked about in a bar (and <a href="https://blog.newrelic.com/technology/good-computer-programmer-criteria/">it’s subjective anyway</a>). Ben McCormick points out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Once somebody hits a minimum threshold of technical skill to hold a job in the industry, about 80% of their ability to succeed in Software Development is determined by their communication and people skills, not their technical abilities.” - <a href="https://benmccormick.org/2019/03/02/the-importance-of-writing">Ben McCormick</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>My experience supports Patrick’s and Ben’s assertions, so now the question is, how can you become one of the people whose name comes up before a job is publicly available?</p>
<p><strong>The right people have to know you. You have to have the right kind of influence.</strong></p>
<h2 id="levels-of-writing-influence">Levels of Writing Influence</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“The difference between a tolerable programmer and a great programmer is not how many programming languages they know…It’s whether they can communicate their ideas. By persuading other people, they get leverage.” - <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/01/02/advice-for-computer-science-college-students/">Joel Spolsky</a>, Co-founder of StackOverflow</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you buy my assertion that influence is important in your career as a software developer, the next step is for me to convince you that writing will actually increase your influence. In fact, not all writing will work. The kind of writing you do will make a massive difference on the level and kind of influence you gain.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/KwA6AQe.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the different levels of influence you can achieve as a software developer and the kinds of writing you need to do to achieve them.</p>
<h3 id="1-willing-participant">1. Willing Participant</h3>
<p>Participants are not influential. They don’t realize it, but they have very little control over their career and are likely to go through a period of unemployment and grueling job interviews every time they need a new job. The only writing a Willing Participant will do is what’s required of them: they’ll respond to Slack messages and emails; they’ll dutifully enter their progress report every day; they might leave a sticky note on someone’s desk (or the digital equivalent) when they want to have a protracted discussion about an issue.</p>
<p>If this is you, don’t be discouraged. We all start our careers as Willing Participants. With <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/harness-2020-state-of-developer-satisfaction-report-shows-impact-of-coronavirus-on-software-development-301119564.html">most software engineering jobs staying remote for the foreseeable future</a>, the minimum level of writing ability is likely to increase, but just checking the box isn’t going to put your name on the tip of your next boss’ tongue.</p>
<h3 id="2-organizational-teacher">2. Organizational Teacher</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Every time you find yourself following the manual instead of writing the manual, you’re avoiding the anguish and giving in to the resistance.” - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00371V91S/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">Seth Godin, Linchpin</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most software engineers live in this zone. Organizational Teachers write documentation, technical specifications, style guides, testing criteria, bug reports, and internal knowledge base articles. While this gives you a little influence over how your team (and possibly some adjacent teams) does its job, it’s unlikely that anyone outside your company will hear about your work.</p>
<p>The good thing about being in this zone is that it’s a safe place to practice. Nobody’s going to berate you for your typos (at least, I hope not), and other stakeholders will review most of your writing before it’s made generally available.</p>
<p>The downside to being an Organizational Teacher is that it’s pretty much table stakes for senior engineers. You’re not going to stand out for it, and you probably won’t get your name attached to it (unless it’s buried in your commit history). Hone your writing skills as an Organizational Teacher, and once you feel more comfortable, move up the ladder.</p>
<h3 id="3-organizational-influencer">3. Organizational Influencer</h3>
<p>As you move into an (official or unofficial) leadership role, you’ll start to do more writing at the Organizational Influencer level. This writing includes setting hiring criteria, documenting tradeoffs between complex technical decisions, creating training materials, and setting budgets. These documents will be seen by people above and below your station and will help get you noticed for future promotions.</p>
<p>Many software developers assume that they <em>should not</em> attempt to contribute this kind of writing unless asked. This is incorrect.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re given a new project, you have a professional obligation to report shortcomings in the design. When you report these issues, don’t just write a Slack message, “This won’t work.” <a href="https://melsatar.blog/2017/09/23/trade-off-analysis-technique-make-the-decision-easier/">Document the tradeoffs</a> between the proposed solution and one that you’ve seen work elsewhere. Most people don’t do this because it’s hard, and that’s why they don’t have much influence.</p>
<p>Organizational Influencers are helping set the direction for at least a small part of the business, and they’ll end up doing more writing than those at the previous two levels. Software developers who make it to this level will be eligible for more internal promotions, interesting lateral moves, and a general increase in respect. Organizational Influencers will also start to gain the confidence to start writing externally.</p>
<h3 id="4-external-teacher">4. External Teacher</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Writing is hard. People spend their entire lives learning how to write effectively. It isn’t something you can fake. It isn’t something you can buy. You have to work at it.
That’s exactly why people who are afraid they can’t write should be blogging. It’s exercise.” - <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/fear-of-writing/">Jeff Atwood</a>, Co-founder of StackOverflow</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the prevalence of <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a> and <a href="http://dev.to/">Dev.to</a>, surprisingly few software engineers ever write publicly. External Teachers generally start by writing technical case studies, public documentation, and walkthroughs. This is where software developers can begin to publicly display their knowledge and build a personal brand.</p>
<p>I’ll put a big caveat here and say that writing a few tutorials will not immediately make employers hunt you down. I’ve written dozens of technical tutorials over the years, and only a couple of them led directly to an employment discussion (neither of which worked out). Writing publicly is the first step in building a reputation, but more importantly, it gives you a great resource to point to when an employer asks you about a specific technical experience you’ve had.</p>
<p>The hard part about becoming an External Teacher is that it’s scary, and you’re likely to suck at first. People <a href="https://medium.com/@cinzia.dubois/the-importance-of-doing-things-youre-bad-at-4fcdd4c2fb4b">naturally avoid doing things they’re bad at</a>, but doing scary things is an essential part of gaining influence.</p>
<p>If you overcome the fear of writing publicly and you start to tell people about your writing, you’ll probably be surprised by the encouragement you get. People will root for you when you do something they’re scared to do themselves.</p>
<h3 id="5-external-influencer">5. External Influencer</h3>
<p>So few people achieve the level of External Influencer that just attempting this sort of writing puts you in a tiny, standout class of people. Unlike the External Teacher, who sticks to irrefutable facts and rehashes of existing knowledge, the External Influencer has a strong point of view. They write from deep experience, and their writing influences the decisions that others make.</p>
<p>Some of the External Influencers you’ve probably heard of include <a href="https://martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler</a>, <a href="http://cleancoder.com/products">“Uncle” Bob Martin</a>, and <a href="https://domainlanguage.com/">Eric Evans</a>. When they write something, thousands of programmers listen, and their books have shaped decades of software architecture.</p>
<p>There are degrees to all the influence levels in this model. You don’t have to be Uncle Bob to be an External Influencer; you just need to start applying your technical experience to larger business challenges in a public forum. For example, Eric Evans created Domain-Driven Design to help businesses build better software by making it more closely resemble the underlying domain model. If you’ve spent years solving a particular set of problems, you probably have at least a few issues you could get on a soapbox about. These are likely your platform for becoming an External Influencer.</p>
<p>While it sounds great, acting like an External Influencer is even scarier than being an External Teacher. Not only does your writing have to be factually accurate and coherent, but you’re also opening your ideas to public criticism. Nobody likes to get slammed on the internet, but the upside can be huge if your work is well-received. Do you think Martin Fowler would ever have trouble getting a job if he decided to leave ThoughtWorks? I’m pretty sure he could (literally) write his own job description just about anywhere.</p>
<h2 id="write-above-your-level">Write Above Your Level</h2>
<p>By this point, I hope I’ve convinced you that influence is an important part of advancing your software development career and that writing can help you gain this influence. My final encouragement to engineers who want to become better writers is to push beyond your current level. It will be uncomfortable, but it’s also one of the best ways to take control of your career. <a href="https://twitter.com/karllhughes">Let me know if I can help</a>.</p>

<p>This is a small story about tracking down a production bug in a Rust
application. I don’t know if there’s any take away from this one for the reader,
but it felt interesting so I’m sharing it.</p>

<h2 id="a-bit-of-backstory">A bit of backstory</h2>

<p>In Avast, we have a Rust application called <a href="https://vorner.github.io/2019/05/19/rust-in-avast.html">urlite</a>. It serves as a backend to
some other applications, provides them a HTTP API. It’s in Rust because it is
latency critical. Latencies of most requests are under a millisecond.</p>

<p>It was written with <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/0.1.*"><code>tokio-0.1</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/hyper/0.12.*"><code>hyper-0.12</code></a> to deal with the HTTP. We
were quite late to update to newer versions, in part because it worked fine and
the amount of <code>async</code> code was single quite short function, so we didn’t have
much motivation. And in part because we use the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/spirit"><code>spirit</code></a> libraries for
configuration. It’s a library to take configuration and set up the internal
state of the program for it ‒ configuration contains the ports to listen to,
etc, and it manages spawning the HTTP server objects inside the program and can
even migrate from one set of ports to other at runtime.</p>

<p>But migrating <a href="https://crates.io/crates/spirit"><code>spirit</code></a> to newer <code>tokio</code> and <code>hyper</code> was a big task (because
the API surface is quite large, the library does a bit unusual things compared
to all the usual applications and the change between old and new <code>tokio</code> was
quite large).</p>

<p>Anyway, eventually I got permission to work on the migration of <a href="https://crates.io/crates/spirit"><code>spirit</code></a> as
part of my job. It took about a week to migrate both <a href="https://crates.io/crates/spirit"><code>spirit</code></a> and <a href="https://vorner.github.io/2019/05/19/rust-in-avast.html">urlite</a>. It
went through review, went through the automatic tests and we put it to the
staging environment for a while, watching the logs and graphs. Everything seemed
fine, so after few days of everything looking fine, we pushed the button and put
it to production.</p>

<h2 id="the-increased-latencies">The increased latencies</h2>

<p>As it goes in these kinds of stories, by now you’re expecting to see what went
wrong.</p>

<p>The thing is, our own metrics and graphs were fine. But the latency on the
downstream service querying us increased by 40ms. The deployment got reverted,
and we started to dig into where these latencies come from.</p>

<h2 id="it-was-acting-really-weird">It was acting really weird</h2>

<p>There were several very suspicious things about that.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Our own „internal“ latencies stayed the same. Our CPU usage also stayed the
same.</li>
  <li>The latency graph on the downstream side was flat 40ms <em>constant</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, if we introduced some performance regression in the query handling, we
would expect our CPU consumption to rise. We would also expect the latency graph
to be a bit spiky, not completely flat 40ms constant. It almost looked like
there was a 40ms <code>sleep</code> somewhere. But why would anyone put a 40ms sleep
anywhere?</p>

<p>I’ve looked through documentation and didn’t see anything obvious. I’ve tried
searching both our code and code of the dependencies for <code>40</code>, asked on Slack if
that <code>40ms</code> value was familiar to anyone. Nothing.</p>

<p>The working theory we started with was that there could be some kind of back-off
sleep on some kind of failure. Maybe <code>hyper</code> would be closing inactive
connections in the new version, forcing the application to reconnect (the graph
was for 99th percentile, so if we happened to close each 100th connection and
reconnection took this long…) and maybe try IPv6 first and we would be listening
on IPv4 only or… (in other words, we didn’t have a clear clue).</p>

<h2 id="the-benchmarks">The benchmarks</h2>

<p>My colleague started to investigate in a more thorough way than just throwing
ideas around on Slack. He run a <code>wrk</code> benchmark against the service. On his
machine, the latencies were fine. So he commandeered one of the stage nodes to
play with it and run the benchmark there. And every request had 40ms latency on
that machine. The previous version of <code>urlite</code> was fine, with under one
millisecond.</p>

<p><em>Something</em> was probably sleeping somewhere on the production servers, but not
on the development machine. There probably was some difference in the OS
settings, but definitely difference in the kernel version. The servers are
running some well-tried Linux distribution, so they have a lot older version,
while a developer is likely to run something much more on the edge.</p>

<h2 id="configuration-options">Configuration options</h2>

<p>The selling point of <a href="https://crates.io/crates/spirit"><code>spirit</code></a> is that most of the thing one can set in the
builders of various libraries and types now can be just put into a config file
without any recompilation. If we did configuration by hand, we would expose only
the things we thought would be useful, but with spirit, there’s everything. So,
naturally, tweaking some of the config knobs was the next step (because it was
easy to do).</p>

<p>It was discovered that turning the <code>http1-writev</code> option <em>off</em>, which
corresponds to
<a href="https://docs.rs/hyper/0.13.8/hyper/server/struct.Builder.html#method.http1_writev">this method</a>
in <code>hyper</code>, made the latencies go away.</p>

<p>We now had a solution, but I wasn’t happy about not understanding <em>why</em> that
helped, so I went to dig the rabbit hole and find the root cause. Turns out
there were several little things in just the constellation to make the problem
manifest.</p>

<h2 id="overriding-the-defaults-of-http1_writev">Overriding the defaults of <code>http1_writev</code></h2>

<p>The method controls the strategy in which way data are pushed into the socket.
With vectored writes enabled, it sends two separate buffers (one with headers,
the other with the body if it’s small enough) through a single <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/writev"><code>writev</code></a>
syscall.  If they are disabled, <code>hyper</code> copies all the bytes into a single
buffer and sends that as a whole.</p>

<p>It turns out that the method takes a <code>bool</code>, but there are actually 3 states.
The third (auto) is signalled by <em>not</em> calling the method and <code>spirit-hyper</code> was
calling it always, with the default to turn the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/writev"><code>writev</code></a> on. I don’t know if
leaving it on auto would make the bug go away, but I’ve fixed the problem in the
library anyway.</p>

<h2 id="splitting-vectored-writes">Splitting vectored writes</h2>

<p>Spirit wants to support a bit of configuration on top of what the underlying
libraries provide on their own. One of such things is limiting the number of
concurrently accepted connections on a single listening socket. Users don’t have
to take advantage of that (the types for the configuration can be composed
together to either contain that bit or not and the administrator may leave the
values for the limits unset in the configuration and then they won’t be
enforced).</p>

<p>Anyway, in case the support for the limits is opted in through using the type
with the configuration fields, the connections themselves are wrapped in a
<a href="https://docs.rs/spirit-tokio/0.7.*/spirit_tokio/net/limits/struct.Tracked.html"><code>Tracked</code></a>
type. The type tries to be mostly transparent for use and can be used inside
<code>hyper</code> (which is what the default configuration type alias in <code>spirit-hyper</code>
does), but tracks how many connections there are, to not accept more if it runs
out of the limit.</p>

<p>When implementing the bunch of traits for the wrapper, I’ve overlooked the
<a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/0.2.*/tokio/io/trait.AsyncWrite.html#method.poll_write_buf"><code>AsyncWrite::poll_write_buff</code></a>.
It is a provided method, which means it has a default implementation. It is the
one that abstracts the OS-level <code>writev</code>, it can write multiple buffers (the
<a href="https://docs.rs/bytes/0.5.*/bytes/buf/trait.Buf.html"><code>Buf</code></a> represents a
segmented buffer).</p>

<p>The default implementation simply delegates to multiple calls to the ordinary
write. Therefore, this omission combined with the default of enabling vectored
writes results in calling into the kernel twice, each time with a small buffer,
instead of once with two small buffers or once with a big buffer.</p>

<p>That was definitely something to get fixed, because if nothing else, syscalls
are expensive and calling more of them is not great. But I’ve finally felt like
I’m on the right path, because:</p>

<h2 id="nagles-algorithm">Nagle’s algorithm</h2>

<p>You probably know that TCP stream is built from packets going there and back.
Optimizing how to split the stream into the packets and when to send them is a
hard problem and the research in that area is still ongoing, because there are
many conflicting requirements. One wants to deliver the data with low latency,
utilize the whole bandwidth, but not overflow the capacity of the link (in which
case the latencies would go up or packets would get lost and would have to be
retransmitted), leave some bandwidth to other connections, etc.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagle%27s_algorithm">Nagle’s algorithm</a> is
one of the older tricks up in TCP’s sleeve. The network doesn’t like small
packets.  It is better to send as large packets as the link allows, because each
packet has certain overhead ‒ the headers that take some space, but also routers
spend computation power mostly based on number of packets and less on their
size. If you start sending a lot of tiny packets, the performance will suffer.
While the links are limited by the number of bytes that can pass through them,
routers are more limited by the number of packets. If a router declares to be
able to handle a gigabit connection, it actually means a gigabit <em>if you use
full-sized packets</em>, but will get to few megabits if you split the data into
tiny packets.</p>

<p>So it would be better to wait until the send buffer contains a packetfull of
data before sending anything. But we can’t do that, because we don’t <em>know</em>
there’ll ever be a full packet of data, or generating more data might wait for
the other side to answer. We would never send anything and wait forever and the
Internet would not work.</p>

<p>Instead, the algorithm is willing to send <em>one</em> undersized packet and then it
waits for an <code>ACK</code> from the other side until sending another undersized one. If
it gets a packetfull of data to send in the meantime, that’s great and it sends
it (it won’t get better by waiting longer), but it won’t ever have two
undersized ones somewhere in flight, therefore won’t kill the network’s
performance by them.</p>

<p>This works, it’ll make progress eventually because once the <code>ACK</code> comes and
all the data that accumulated until then is sent.</p>

<p>But it also slows things down. Like in our case. What happens if we do it using
single syscall, the whole HTTP response forms a single undersized packet (we
have really small answers) and gets sent, no matter if it’s submitted to the
kernel by one big or two small buffers.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if we split the submission into two syscalls, this is what
happens:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We write the first part (headers). The kernel sends them out as an undersized
packet.</li>
  <li>We write the second part (the body). But the kernel shelves them into the send
buffer and waits for sending them until it sees the <code>ACK</code>, because there’s one
undersized packet …</li></ul></section></div></div>

              <p>Here’s the reality, billions of credentials have been leaked or stolen and are now easily downloaded online by anyone. Many of these databases of identities include passwords in plain text, while others are one-way hashed. One-way hashing is better (we’ll get to why in a second), but it is only as secure as is mathematically feasible. Let’s take a look at one-way hashing algorithms and how computers handle them.</p>

<h2 id="hashing">Hashing</h2>

<p>A hash by definition is a function that can map data of an arbitrary size to data of a fixed size. SHA2 is a hashing algorithm that uses various bit-wise operations on any number of bytes to produce a fixed sized hash. For example, the SHA-256 algorithm produces a 256 bit result. The algorithm was designed specifically so that going from a hash back to the original bytes is infeasible. Developers use an SHA2 hash so that instead of storing a plain text password, they instead only store the hash. When a user is authenticated, the plain text password they type into the login form is hashed, and because the algorithm will always produce the same hash result given the same input, comparing this hash to the hash in the database tells us the password is correct.</p>

<h2 id="cracking-passwords">Cracking Passwords</h2>

<p>While one-way hashing means we aren’t storing plain text passwords, it is still possible to determine the original plain text password from a hash. Next, we’ll outline the two most common approaches of reversing a hash.</p>

<h3 id="lookup-tables">Lookup Tables</h3>

<p>The first is called a lookup table, or sometimes referred to as a rainbow table. This method builds a massive lookup table that maps hashes to plain text passwords. The table is built by simply hashing every possible password combination and storing it in some type of database or data-structure that allows for quick lookups.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of a lookup table for SHA2 hashed passwords:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sha2_hash                                                          password</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using a lookup table, all the attacker needs to know is the SHA2 hash of the password and they can see if it exists in the table. For example, let’s assume for a moment that Netflix stores your password using an SHA2 hash. If Netflix is breached, their user database is likely now available to anyone with a good internet connection and a torrent client. Even a mediocre hacker now only needs to lookup the SHA2 hash associated with your Netflix account to see if it exists in their lookup table. This will reveal nearly instantly what your plain text password is for Netflix. Now, this hacker can log in to your Netflix account and binge watch all four seasons of Fuller House (“how rude!”). And he can also try this password on Hulu and HBO Go to see if you used the same email address and password for those accounts as well.</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/salt.png" alt="Salt"></p>

<p>The best way to protect against this type of attack is to use what is called a <strong>salt</strong>. A salt is simply a bunch of random characters that you prepend to the password before it is hashed. Each password should have a different salt, which means that a lookup table is unlikely to have an entry for the combination of the salt and the password. This makes salts an ideal defense against lookup tables.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of a salt and the resulting combination of the password and the salt which is then hashed:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Bad, no salt. Very bland.</span>
<span>sha2</span><span>(</span><span>"password"</span><span>)</span> <span>// 6b3a55e0261b0304143f805a24924d0c1c44524821305f31d9277843b8a10f4e</span>

<span>// Better, add a salt.</span>
<span>salt</span> <span>=</span> <span>";L'-2!;+=#/5B)40/o-okOw8//3a"</span>
<span>toHash</span> <span>=</span> <span>";L'-2!;+=#/5B)40/o-okOw8//3apassword"</span>
<span>sha2</span><span>(</span><span>toHash</span><span>)</span> <span>// f534e6bf84a638112e07e69861927ab624c0217c0655e4d3be07659bcf6c1c07</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now that we have added the salt, the “password” that we actually generated the hash from was the String <code>;L'-2!;+=#/5B)40/o-okOw8//3apassword</code>. This String is long, complex and contains a lot of random characters. Therefore, it is nearly impossible that the hacker that created the lookup table would have generated the hash for the String <code>;L'-2!;+=#/5B)40/o-okOw8//3apassword</code>.</p>

<h3 id="brute-force">Brute Force</h3>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/hulk.png" alt="Brute Force"></p>

<p>The second method that attackers use to crack passwords is called brute force cracking. This means that the attacker writes a computer program that can generate all possible combinations of characters that can be used for a password and then computes the hash for each combination. This program can also take a salt if the password was hashed with a salt. The attacker then runs the program until it generates a hash that is the same as the hash from the database. Here’s a simple Java program for cracking passwords. We left out some detail to keep the code short (such as all the possible password characters), but you get the idea.</p>

<p>This program will generate all the possible passwords with lengths between 6 and 8 characters and then hash each one until it finds a match. This type of brute-force hacking takes time because of the number of possible combinations.</p>

<h2 id="password-complexity-vs-computational-power">Password complexity vs. computational power</h2>

<p>Let’s bust out our TI-85 calculators and see if we can figure out how long this program will take to run. For this example we will assume the passwords can only contain ASCII characters (uppercase, lowercase, digits, punctuation). This set is roughly 100 characters (this is rounded up to make the math easier to read). If we know that there are at least 6 characters and at most 8 characters in a password, then all the possible combinations can be represented by this expression:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>possiblePasswords = 100^8 + 100^7 + 100^6
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The result of this expression is equal to <code>10,101,000,000,000,000</code>. This is quite a large number, North of 10 quadrillion to be a little more precise, but what does it actually mean when it comes to our cracking program? This depends on the speed of the computer the cracking program is running on and how long it takes the computer to execute the SHA2 algorithm. The algorithm is the key component here because the rest of the program is extremely fast at creating the passwords.</p>

<p>Here’s where things get dicey. If you run a quick Google search for <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=fastest+bitcoin+rig">“fastest bitcoin rig”</a> you’ll see that these machines are rated in terms of the number of hashes they can perform per second. The bigger ones can be rated as high as <code>44 TH/s</code>. That means it can generate 44 tera-hashes per second or <code>44,000,000,000,000</code>.</p>

<p>Now, if we divide the total number of passwords by the number of hashes we can generate per second, we are left with the total time it takes a Bitcoin rig to generate the hashes for all possible passwords. In our example above, this equates to:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>bitcoinRig = 4.4e13
possiblePasswords = 100^8 + 100^7 + 100^6 = 1.0101e16

numberOfSeconds = possiblePasswords / bitcoinRig = ~230
numberOfMinutes = numberOfSeconds / 60 = ~4
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This means that using this example Bitcoin rig, we could generate all the hashes for a password between 6 and 8 characters in length in roughly 4 minutes. Feeling nervous yet? Let’s add one additional character and see long it takes to hash all possible passwords between 6 and 9 characters.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>bitcoinRig = 4.4e13
possiblePasswords = 100^9 + 100^8 + 100^7 + 100^6 = 1.010101E18

numberOfSeconds = possiblePasswords / bitcoinRig = 22,956
numberOfMinutes = numberOfSeconds / 60 = ~383
numberOfHours = numberOfMinutes / 60 = ~6
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>By adding one additional character to the potential length of the password we increased the total compute time from 4 minutes to 6 hours. This is nearing a 100x increase in computational time to use the brute force strategy. You probably can see where this is going. To defeat the brute force strategy, you simply need to make it improbable to calculate all possible password combinations.</p>

<p>Let’s get crazy and make a jump to 16 characters:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>bitcoinRig = 4.4e13
possiblePasswords = 100^16 + 100^15 ... 100^7 + 100^6 = 1e32

numberOfSeconds = possiblePasswords / bitcoinRig = 2.27e18
numberOfMinutes = numberOfSeconds / 60 = 3.78e16
numberOfHours = numberOfMinutes / 60 = 630,000,000,000,000 or 630 trillion
numberOfDays = numberOfHours / 24 = 26,250,000,000,000 or 26.25 trillion days
numberOfYears = numberOfDays / 365 = 71,917,808,219 or 71.9 billion years
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To boil down our results, if we take these expressions and simplify them, we can build an equation that solves for any length password.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>numberOfSeconds = 100^lengthOfPassword / computeSpeed
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This equation shows that as the password length increases, …</p></div></div>

As it tends to do, time continues to move on.  The project and code in
it eventually becomes legacy code (aka, someone else's problem to
maintain).
</p>

<p>
One day, the business drudges up that old automated cookie creation
idea and requests that it handles a new task - "instead of just cooking
peanut butter cookies, it'd be great if the cookie system could handle
oatmeal raisin as well!".
</p>

<p>
Hah!  You remember that old system, but you're onto newer and better
things.  This is a perfect task for the intern to sink their teeth
into - afterall, it's legacy and not high profile, it's been stable,
and it was so simple to implement the first time around.
</p>

<p>
The new set of requirements/recipe the intern works off of looks very
similar to the initial ones:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Step 1: Preheat oven to 325F, grease cookie sheet</li>
<li>Step 2: In bowl, stir oats, pumpkin puree and sugar until smooth.</li>
<li>Step 3: Beat in one egg white, then stir in baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.</li>
<li>Step 4: Roll dough into 1 inch balls and place 2 inches apart on the sheet.</li>
<li>Step 5: Bake for 8 minutes, cool for 5, enjoy!</li>

<p>
The code comes in, the peer reviews pass it as it meets the
requirements and nothing is obviously wrong.  Still, it has become a
bit harder to understand and you're left with a nagging feeling.

                <h2><b>Armory, Spinnaker, and Kubernetes</b></h2>
<p><span>We are excited to announce that Armory now provides a K8s-native continuous delivery experience from end-to-end, unlocking Kubernetes deployments in the enterprise at massive scale. As a cloud-native, multi-cloud CD platform, Spinnaker has always been a powerful tool for deploying to Kubernetes. In fact, AWS and Google engineering teams helped to build the </span><a href="https://www.armory.io/blog/deep-dive-into-clouddriver/"><span>Spinnaker Clouddrivers</span></a><span> for deploying to EKS and GKE, and Spinnaker powers more than </span><b>8 million monthly K8s deployments</b><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" data-src="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Image-2020-11-16-at-11.09.28-PM-768x410.png" alt="" width="631" height="337" src="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Image-2020-11-16-at-11.09.28-PM-768x410.png"></p>
<p><em>Monthly OSS Spinnaker deployments to K8s are up 5x since April.</em></p>
<p><span>Armory is enhancing Spinnaker by introducing a familiar Kubernetes workflow, eliminating context-switching and domain-specific languages, and helping Spinnaker scale deployments to thousands of Kubernetes clusters.</span></p>
<h2><b>Day 0: The Armory Operator</b></h2>
<p><span>The </span><a href="https://www.armory.io/blog/announcing-the-spinnaker-kubernetes-operator/"><span>Armory Operator</span></a><span> is a Kubernetes operator for implementing and managing Spinnaker, bringing a Kubernetes-native GitOps workflow to managing Spinnaker’s full lifecycle. With the Operator, you treat Spinnaker as simply another Kubernetes deployment, installing, managing, and upgrading it with familiar tools such as <code>kubectl</code> and <code>kustomize</code>. Install Spinnaker with just a few keystrokes, and upgrade your Spinnaker version simply by changing the version number in a config file and applying. Access to other Kubernetes features, such as Kubernetes Secrets, also comes enabled out of the box.</span></p>
<p><span>The Operator also unlocks the scalability and security of a GitOps workflow by defining all of your Spinnaker configs as code and centralizing them in a single Git repo. This enables collaborative code reviews on all config changes to ensure that Spinnaker is stable and secure. Pre-flight validation of all changes adds a further layer of safety. In the event of a bad update, built-in config version control allows for rapid rollbacks and auditability.</span></p>
<p><span>The Operator is available for both Armory and open source Spinnaker.</span></p>
<h2><b>Building your Deployment Pipelines: PaCRD</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.armory.io/docs/spinnaker-user-guides/pacrd/"><span>PaCRD</span></a><span> (a combination of “</span><a href="https://www.armory.io/armory-enterprise-spinnaker/pipelines-as-code-gitops/"><span>Pipelines as Code</span></a><span>” and “</span><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/"><span>Custom Resource Definition</span></a><span>”) is a Kubernetes controller that manages the lifecycle of Spinnaker applications and pipelines as objects within your K8s cluster. PaCRD extends Kubernetes functionality to support Spinnaker Application and Pipeline objects that can be observed for changes through a mature lifecycle management API.</span></p>
<p><span>With PaCRD you can:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Maintain your Spinnaker pipelines as code with the rest of your Kubernetes manifests.</span></li>
<li><span>Persist Pipeline and Application changes with confidence to your Spinnaker cluster.</span></li>
<li><span>Leverage existing tools <code>helm</code> and <code>kustomize</code> to template your pipelines across teams and projects.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Pipelines as Code is one of Armory’s most powerful features. It brings security and repeatability to your application deployments by enabling you to templatize and share pre-blessed pipelines that are up-to-date with your organizational best practices and security &amp; compliance policies. With PaCRD, we are providing another method for accessing those benefits, but with a K8s-native workflow and some additional Kubernetes functionality.</span></p>
<p><span>PaCRD is available as an early release feature with select </span><a href="https://www.armory.io/armory-design-partners/"><span>Armory Design Partners</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>Deployment to Production: The Armory Agent for Kubernetes&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><span>Spinnaker is the tool of choice for hundreds of the world’s leading enterprises to deploy to Kubernetes.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-e7b2ccadd106c01a49f9"><div><h3>The current limit of 99 accredited investors <strong>hurts capital formation</strong>, <strong>reduces investment opportunities</strong>, <strong>increases the risk to individual investors</strong> and <strong>decreases access to private capital markets for underrepresented groups</strong>.</h3><p>At TinySeed, we are in the process of <a href="https://tinyseed.com/latest/invest">raising the second fund</a> for our SaaS accelerator, and we’re often asked why we have such a high minimum investment. If an <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accreditedinvestor.asp">accredited investor</a> wants to put in $50,000, why would we turn them down?&nbsp;</p><p>It all comes down to SEC regulations, which limit funds like ours to a maximum of 99 accredited investors. In order to raise the amount of capital required to execute on <a href="https://tinyseed.com/thesis">our investment thesis</a>, we must enforce a (relatively) high minimum investment.&nbsp;</p><p>We didn’t write this article to complain about our situation, as <a href="https://tinyseed.com/invest">fundraising (even with this minimum in place) is going quite well</a>. But for us, this process has brought to light an unintended consequence of this 99 investor limit.</p><p>Over time, successful venture firms raise larger and larger funds, quickly running into the 99 investor limit, and forcing their investment minimum higher. <strong>These high minimums concentrate this wealth creation opportunity to super high net worth individuals and institutional investors, excluding accredited investors who cannot afford to write such a large check.</strong></p><p>The SEC enforces certain kinds of regulations to provide investor protections against fraud and abuse, which we salute. However, current regulations (and this 99 investor limit) prohibit the average accredited investor from accessing these markets in a meaningful way. This matters because the private markets are a significant driver of wealth creation.</p><p>We fully understand that the SEC needs to have some limit on the number of investors that can invest in a private fund. <strong>However, we believe that the current limit of 99 is the wrong approach.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>We started TinySeed because we wanted to give founders more options for capital to grow their companies, and we feel that as a fund, we can and should also call for change in how sophisticated investors are able to invest their money.<strong><em> </em></strong>Specifically, we believe that successful tech founders and operators should be able to invest into the field they understand best — early stage technology — instead of being limited to real estate or the public markets.</p><p>We believe funds like ours should be able admit up to 1999 accredited investors, assuming they are required to make reasonable efforts to verify that investors are accredited.</p><h3>As the current rules are enshrined in law, we’re exploring ways to bring this issue in front of Congress. <strong>If you are an emerging manager or stakeholder who would like to see the 99 investor limit raised, send us an email at </strong><a href="mailto:hello@tinyseed.com"><strong>hello@tinyseed.com</strong></a><strong>.</strong></h3><p><strong>Please help raise awareness of this issue:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The%20SEC%20limit%20of%2099%20investors%20on%20investment%20funds%20over%20%2410m%20has%20significant%20unintended%20consequences.%20Read%20about%20the%20issue%20and%20join%20TinySeed%20in%20support%20to%20change%20the%20law%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Ftinyseed.com%2Flatest%2F99-investor-problem%20">Share on Twitter</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyseed.com%2Flatest%2F99-investor-problem" target="_blank">Share on Facebook</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;source=TinySeed&amp;summary=The%20SEC%20limit%20of%2099%20investors%20on%20investment%20funds%20over%20%2410m%20has%20significant%20unintended%20consequences.%20Read%20about%20the%20issue%20and%20join%20TinySeed%20in%20support%20to%20change%20the%20law%3A%20&amp;title=&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyseed.com%2Flatest%2F99-investor-problem">Share on LinkedIn</a></p></li></ul><p>Fund regulations and SEC rules are fairly complicated; read on for our breakdown of what everything means below:<br></p><h2>Current SEC regulatory regime for private funds</h2><h3>3(c)(1) vs. 3(c)(7)</h3><p>The SEC’s regulatory regime currently provides 2 exemptions to the (burdensome and expensive) requirement for a venture fund like ours to be registered with the SEC: 3(c)(1) and 3(c)(7).</p><p>A 3(c)(1) fund may have no more than 99 Accredited Investors, while a 3(c)(7) fund can have up to 1999 investors, but these must all be “Qualified Purchasers”. The qualified purchaser, or QP, definition is a significant increase in the required net worth compared to accredited investors.</p><h3>Why can’t investors pool their money and create a single entity to invest?</h3><p>The SEC stipulates that accredited investors cannot pool their money and create a single entity (for example through an SPV) to invest in the fund – the SEC will “look through” this entity and count the number of investors there as long as the entity was created for the purpose of making a specific investment.&nbsp;</p><h3>Why can’t we create parallel funds?</h3><p>Another often suggested option, to run several parallel funds that co-invest, is also forbidden, as the SEC will count as a single fund, any set of funds that a reasonable investor would deem to be identical.</p><h3>One burdensome option: The “QP sleeve”</h3><p>The only exception to the above is what’s sometimes referred to as a “QP sleeve”. A 3(c)(1) fund may operate in parallel with a separate 3(c)(7) fund. This does add significant overheads, but frees up some slots for accredited investors by moving the qualified purchasers into the 3(c)(7) (of which there can be 1999).</p><h3>The recent JOBS act</h3><p>A more recent change was introduced with the JOBS act, which expanded the ability of fund managers to promote their offerings publicly, with the trade-off that doing so would tighten the requirement to verify that all investors were in fact accredited investors (a 506c offering). We think these changes are laudable, as they increase awareness of specific offerings among accredited investors while also adding further, appropriate, protections.</p><h2>Recent regulatory efforts to expand investment opportunities, harmonize regulations with other jurisdictions and further capital formation</h2><p>&nbsp;The SEC very recently issued updated accredited investor definitions: </p><blockquote><p>For the first time, individuals will be permitted to participate in our private capital markets not only based on their income or net worth, but also based on established, <strong><em>clear measures of financial sophistication</em></strong>.</p></blockquote><p>(Emphasis ours.)</p><p>We salute this change, and even though we think the SEC has further to go in terms of widening the definition of accredited investors, it’s a great first step. This change is well inline with the SECs ongoing efforts to “simplify, harmonize, and improve the exempt offering framework, thereby expanding investment opportunities while maintaining appropriate investor protections and promoting capital formation.”</p><p><strong>&nbsp;However, we believe that the current limit of 99 accredited investors per 3(c)(1) fund runs counter to these efforts.</strong></p><h2>The many downsides of the 99 accredited investor limit</h2><p>The current limit of 99 accredited investors <strong>hurts capital formation</strong>, <strong>reduces investment opportunities</strong>,&nbsp; <strong>increases the risk to individual investors</strong> and <strong>decreases access to private capital markets for underrepresented groups</strong>.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>A fund manager can accept smaller checks from wealthier individuals, as the higher QP limit in the sleeve means that there is effectively no minimum amount required of those individuals. </p></li><li><p>Conversely, and perversely, a fund manager looking to raise a more substantial fund is forced to ask for larger checks from the less wealthy investor, or keep that investor out of the fund entirely.</p></li></ul><p><strong>This is far from ideal and, in our experience, excludes sophisticated investors from being allowed to invest in funds like ours. </strong>In some cases these excluded investors have a deep understanding of the industry being invested into, and perhaps with atypical backgrounds as far as fund investors go. <strong>We do not believe those kinds of investors should be effectively excluded from making these kinds of investments.</strong></p><p>Instead what happens is that as funds grow from very small (sub $10m) they are forced to seek capital from larger, institutional investors like Fund of Funds, Endowments and various Family Offices.</p><p><strong>While these more institutional LPs are a fine source of capital, it’s undoubtedly true that they are more risk averse and in general prone to relying on a proven track record for the managers they back.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A great example of this is the University of Texas’ (laudable) Emerging Managers Program. This is a program setup explicitly to support new (aka emerging) managers, though the criteria for selection includes:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Attributable track record within target strategy</p></li><li><p>Investment teams with history of working together</p></li><li><p>Principals known in the investment community and are positively referenceable</p></li></ul><p><strong>Clearly, such terms favor managers that “emerge” from existing funds.</strong> This means that the type of general partners that more easily get backing from these kinds of investors are of the same mold as GPs that already exist.<strong> New and diverse GPs with novel ways to invest are effectively locked into staying small or violating SEC rules.</strong></p><h2>Proposed solution: <br><strong>Allow as many Accredited Investors as Qualified Purchasers.</strong></h2><p>The oversight of private funds is light by definition, so we fully understand why the SEC imposes a limit on the number of investors. Without a limit, a fraudulent fund could become a significant issue if tens or hundreds of thousands of investors could invest.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>However, we feel the unintended consequences of concentrating wealth creation to only super high net worth individuals or institutional investors with the 99 Accredited Investors limit is not the right trade-off in this regard.</strong> We propose that private funds relying on the 3(c)(1) exemption should be allowed to admit up to 1999 accredited investors, assuming they are required to make reasonable efforts to verify that investors are in fact accredited (something that is already a requirement for a 506c offering.)</p><h3><strong>If you are an emerging manager or stakeholder who would like to see the 99 investor limit raised, send us an email at </strong><a href="mailto:hello@tinyseed.com"><strong>hello@tinyseed.com</strong></a><strong>.</strong></h3><p><strong>Please help raise awareness of this issue:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The%20SEC%20limit%20of%2099%20investors%20on%20investment%20funds%20over%20%2410m%20has%20significant%20unintended%20consequences.%20Read%20about%20the%20issue%20and%20join%20TinySeed%20in%20support%20to%20change%20the%20law%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Ftinyseed.com%2Flatest%2F99-investor-problem%20" target="_blank">Share on Twitter</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyseed.com%2Flatest%2F99-investor-problem" target="_blank">Share on Facebook</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;source=TinySeed&amp;summary=The%20SEC%20limit%20of%2099%20investors%20on%20investment%20funds%20over%20%2410m%20has%20significant%20unintended%20consequences.%20Read%20about%20the%20issue%20and%20join%20TinySeed%20in%20support%20to%20change%20the%20law%3A%20&amp;title=&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyseed.com%2Flatest%2F99-investor-problem" target="_blank">Share on LinkedIn</a></p></li></ul></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Are you considering using containers? Do you care about network latency? If so, read on.</p>
<p>Kubernetes is an open-source container platform. It creates a cluster made out of a set of infrastructures. To accomplish things like load balancing and container-to-container communication, Kubernetes relies on both a network overlay inside the cluster and a proxy process called the kube-proxy that runs on each node in the cluster. This post will describe two ways you can have ultra-low latency for containers: physical servers and Kubernetes's new IPTables-based proxy mode.</p>
<h2>Item #1 - Consider Using Physical Servers Rather than Virtual Machines</h2>
<p>Physical servers don't have the hypervisor overhead layer that is common to virtual machines (VMs). As such, running containers directly on Bare Metal (physical servers) should offer you faster performance. But how much of a difference? As it turns out, there is quite a bit of difference.</p>
<p>Here at CenturyLink Cloud, we offer Kubernetes clusters on both VMs and <a href="https://www.ctl.io/bare-metal/">Bare Metal</a> servers. To test network latency, we used the open-source netperf testing utlity that the Kubernetes community <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/tree/master/netperf-tester">wrapped up</a> in order to make it easily deployable to a Kubernetes cluster. The test has a client process running inside a Docker container on one host in the cluster, and a server process running inside a Docker container on a different host in the cluster. When comparing VMs to our smallest physical servers (the 4-core option) located in our VA1 data center <strong>we saw a 3x improvement in network latency</strong>. Now, we would like to share how we did these tests and the detailed test results.</p>
<h2>Kubernetes Cluster Creation</h2>
<p>Using the tool <a href="https://www.ctl.io/knowledge-base/container-services/getting-started-with-kubernetes/">found here</a>, we created two Kubernetes clusters on top of the CenturyLink Cloud infrastructure. One cluster was made up of four Bare Metal servers and the other cluster was made up of four VMs.</p>
<p><strong>Commands to Create the Two Clusters</strong></p>
<pre><code>./kube-up.sh -c=k8s-baremetal1 -d=VA1 -m=4 -t=bareMetal
./kube-up.sh -c=k8s-vm1 -d=VA1 -m=4 -t=standard -mem=8 -cpu=4

# Drink coffee and wait around about 15 minutes...
</code></pre><h2>Run the Network Tests</h2>
<p>Next, we needed to perform the network tests. To build the netperf Golang tool, we ran:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/
cd contrib/netperf-tester
godep go build
</code></pre><p>To run the network testing tool, we ran the following test against each cluster.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This tool uses the kubectl CLI tool to communicate to the Kubernetes cluster in order to run the tests. We ran this command twice, once against each Kubernetes cluster.</p>
<pre><code>./netperf-tester -number 1000
</code></pre><h2>Test Results</h2>
<p>A snippet from the test results looks like this:</p>
<p><strong>Bare Metal Servers</strong>
<img src="https://www.ctl.io/developers/assets/images/blog/kubernetes-physical-servers.png" alt="Physical Servers"></p>
<p><strong>Virtual Machines</strong>
<img src="https://www.ctl.io/developers/assets/images/blog/kubernetes-vm-numbers.png" alt="Virtual Machines"></p>
<h2>Physical vs VMs - Network Latency Histogram</h2>
<p>We then took the full results (1000 measurements on each platform) and created a histogram chart similar to the one above. The results are pretty impressive, around a 3x improvement. Also, you will notice that the jitter (standard deviation) seen in the physical server results is much smaller.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.ctl.io/developers/assets/images/blog/kubernetes-mean-latency.png" alt="Mean Latency"></p>
<p>As you can see, running Kubernetes and containers on the physical machines provides much lower latency than running Kubernetes on virtual machines. If you are running containers, and network latency is important to you, you may want to consider <a href="https://www.ctl.io/bare-metal/">Bare Metal Servers</a> as an option.</p>
<h2>Item #2 - Use Kube-proxy IPTables Mode.</h2>
<p>Regardless of the hardware you choose to run your cluster on, the Kubernetes community has made substantial progress on building out networking services that are both scalable and highly performance-oriented. One recent improvement from the open source community is the re-basing of the kube-proxy process to use IPTables on the host to perform various load-balancing, proxy, and NAT functions. As seen in the diagram below, this change decreased latency as measured by the open-source network testing tool netperf. Latency (measured in microseconds) seen by the older method (called userspace) can be seen in red while the latency of the newer method (called IPTables) can be seen in blue.</p>

For the source information, <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/12682">click here</a>.</p>
<p>Nice work Kubernetes community! If you are a Kubernetes user, nothing is required of you as new Kubernetes clusters now come with IPTables proxy mode enabled by default. If you are running an older version of Kubernetes, consider upgrading.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>If you care about ultra low latency networking for containers, consider using physical machines. If you don't care about this, you might want to consider using virtual machines to run your containers as you can scale more incrementally.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading,
Chris Kleban</p>

<p>In most major code bases, it’s common to have objects with lots of Boolean flags indicating what state they’re in. E.g. is an enemy targeting the player or not? Is it trying to flee or not? If you have a set of mutually exclusive flags an enum can be used instead, but this is often not possible, and doesn’t change much in terms of the downsides.</p>

<p>In my opinion these are code smells. Smells don’t <em>necessarily</em> indicate actual issues, just patterns that are likely to be used incorrectly and thus warrants extra care.</p>

<p>In many cases if you think about how to avoid flags you’re forced change the code in ways that result in clearer code (specifically several simple functions rather than one general function that checks a dozen flags), as well as improved performance due to fewer branches and cache misses. Let me stress that the main gain here is the improved code quality, so don’t be fooled into thinking this is some kind of optimization – better performance is a happy side effect. And yes, there are cases where flags are the clearer option as well (see below).</p>

<h2 id="an-example">An example</h2>

<p>For a somewhat contrived example, consider a game rendering system. Each object in the world has some rendering state associated with it, this would be things like what meshes and materials to use, but also various flags determining how it’s to be rendered.</p>

<p>Let’s say we have a flag called isDynamic, which tells us if the object can move or if it’s static. We can change the flag throughout the life of the object, but when it’s set to false we assume it’s going to be static for some time (so we pay some up-front cost to pre-calculate some acceleration structures that pay off during actual rendering).</p>

<p>Sometimes you want to temporarily toggle rendering for an object so we check this in the renderer as well by adding an isVisible flag.</p>

<p>In addition, the object as a whole may have an isEnabled flag which lets us disable the whole object (physics, animation, rendering all ignore it when it’s not enabled).</p>

<p>Ok, so far we have three flags which means we have 23 = 8 possible combinations of flags, but do we really have eight separate <em>legal</em> states? No! E.g. an object which is not enabled can’t be visible. You could also argue that an object which is disabled or invisible is _neither _dynamic nor static. So we have significantly more <em>possible</em> states than <em>legal</em> states, and it’s very easy to accidentally end up in an illegal state by forgetting to check a flag in one of the many branches throughout the renderer (e.g. perhaps you go down the “isDynamic” branch somewhere for an object which is invisible, thus getting yourself into an inconsistent state). As you add more flags the set of possible states explodes, and it’s common for the interdependencies to be complex and easy to mess up in all the places you have to check.</p>

<h2 id="an-alternative">An alternative</h2>

<p>Instead of storing all these flags, take a step back and think about what the point of each flag is. The isDynamic flag is there to distinguish between dynamic and static objects. A different way of doing this is for the renderer to simply keep an array of dynamic objects and an array of static objects.</p>

<p>The isVisible flag is different. It means the object should be in <em>neither</em> the dynamic or static array. For the whole-object enabled flag we can do something similar, but for each sub-system.</p>

<p>The exact way you avoid any given flag will differ depending on what the purpose of the flag is, but you can usually find a way to avoid it._
        _</p>

<p>So that’s the point of all this? Well the main benefit is that all the code spread out through the renderer can now be simpler. Instead of checking flags for a complicated set of legal states all over the code, we just have completely separate functions for each kind of state. E.g. there’s one method to go through all the static objects and render them, another to go through all the dynamic ones. These functions may call into shared helper functions here and there (to avoid duplication), but if you want to know how dynamic objects get rendered there’s a single place to start reading, and it will be easier to understand because the code is handling fewer cases.</p>

<p>The complexity isn’t entirely gone, it’s just moved. It’s now in methods like “SetVisible”, “SetDynamic” and so on. This is far better, since the complexity is now <em>localized</em>, making it easier to ensure correctness.</p>

<p>A brief note on performance: As we’re now separating things into different arrays to keep the logic clearer, you can often also split the data up across different arrays, which improves the cache locality for the functions that deal with that particular part of the state. For example, objects may use different data if they’re static or dynamic so if you can avoiding have to “step over” the static data in the dynamic code-path that’s going to save lots of cache misses.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-checking-which-state-an-object-is-in">What about checking which state an object is in?</h2>

<p>If you use the proposed scheme most code never actually have to check any per-object flags, because the data already comes pre-sorted to the “processing” code (and is kept sorted by the state transition code). However, there are exceptions. Sometimes you really do want to check what state a specific object is in. This means doing an array lookup for each of the different arrays to see if the object is there.</p>

<p>To make this fast, you could store the index for each array in the object, which gives you fast lookups. This does means you’re still storing state-related information in the object itself (one index per array), but it can be <em>private</em> information so you still get the other benefits - the renderer still doesn’t have to check flags.</p>

<p>Another option is to make sure each object uses the <em>same</em> index in all the arrays it’s in. You generate a unique ID for each object, and use this as the location for the object in all arrays. The obvious way to do this is to allocate MAX_OBJECT_COUNT-sized arrays for all possible states, but that can of course be wasteful (and costly - gaps in the array cost cache misses when traversing). A better way is to use a “sparse array”, which only stores objects that are actually in the array, but still allows O(1) lookup. A hash table is a reasonable backing-store for this, but you can do better if you let your IDs be unique ints with uniform distribution (no need to actually hash anything, use the ID as-is in a <a href="http://sebastiansylvan.com/2013/05/08/robin-hood-hashing-should-be-your-default-hash-table-implementation/">Robin-hood style</a> hash table).</p>

<h2 id="when-not-to-use-this">When not to use this</h2>

<p>I said above that flags are a code smell, not code bugs! There’s plenty of cases where using flags is entirely appropriate. E.g. if you set flags multiple times per frame then the increased cost of moving it between different arrays all the time is likely a bad idea. Also, if you use the sparse array idea above checking a flag is a lot more expensive so if you do this frequently you should probably at least cache the result of this lookup in a flag. Another scenario is if you only have one of something, there’s really no reason to have multiple arrays in that case, since most arrays will be empty. Also, sometimes the added cognitive overhead of multiple arrays just isn’t worth it if the code is trivial. Last but not least, sometimes it’s just damn difficult to figure out how to avoid a flag and spending too much effort jumping through hoops to satisfy some rule of thumb is just dogmatic.</p>

<p>Even if you go with the suggested approach above, you may still need an actual flag to handle the state transitions appropriately. E.g. if you make an object visible after it’s been invisible you probably need to know if you should add it to the dynamic or static array now that it’s visible. The point isn’t to have no flags at all (despite the title), it’s to move the resulting complexity to the code that actually deals with the _state transition_s, instead of spreading (and duplicating) that same complexity all over the code.</p>

<h2 id="more-resources">More resources</h2>

<p>If this approach appeals to you, you really should look into data-oriented design. I’m a fan of this approach (first and foremost consider the data, and how it gets processed, don’t obsess over object identity), but I would advocate moderation. There are often benefits to having some of the state <em>with</em> the object, instead of having everything be implicit based on what component arrays it’s in (in terms of readability, and sometimes even performance). Resist the temptation to be an extremist about this, that’s really no different than the programmer who uses design patterns every chance they get.</p>

<p>A few months back I was in an hotel room at 4 am in the morning when the thermostat inexplicably decided to heat my room to 90 degrees Fahrenheit. That woke me up, and since I had nothing to do for a few hours I decided to write a Sudoku solver (because everyone has to write one).</p>

<p>I hadn’t thought about it since then, until I ran across <a href="https://abhinavsarkar.net/posts/fast-sudoku-solver-in-haskell-3/">this post</a> on reddit and decided to run the same puzzles through my solver and see how it did.</p>

<p><strong>The upshot is that I can do all 49151 puzzles from the post above in about 650ms</strong>. For comparison, the Haskell solution referenced above does it in about 35s. We’re using different machines etc. so it’s not the most scientific comparison in the world (but I doubt my PC is 50x faster), and I don’t really know how much of this is C vs Haskell speed and how much of it is my implementation choices so I’m really not trying to rag on their solution or Haskell (in fact, you should read the posts, they’re  well written and I enjoyed reading Haskell again after many years!).</p>

<p>Anyway, since my solution is slightly different, and I haven’t blogged in a long time, this seemed worth writing up.</p>

<p>Before I wrote any code I went to Peter Norvig’s <a href="http://norvig.com/sudoku.html">Sudoko post</a> just because I remember reading it a few years ago and it seemed like a good place to refresh my memory of the Sudoku rules, and some of the terminology. I didn’t follow along with his solution, so ended up with a slightly different way of doing it, but if the method names and terminology seems similar, that’s why.</p>

<h2 id="performance-from-the-start">Performance from the start</h2>

<p>One of the things I wanted to do when playing around with this was to make sure things were written to be fast (the way you write code when working on games, or other performance sensitive code).</p>

<p>One of my pet peeves is the “Premature optimization is the root of all evil”-crowd, where it almost seems as if people write intentionally slow code because giving <em>any</em> consideration to performance while writing the code is “evil”. This is a gross mischaracterization of what Knuth actually said, and it is certainly not how you write fast systems. For fast systems, you have to consider performance up front and throughout - that doesn’t mean you optimize every line of code with a profiler right away, just that you write it with reasonable performance choices.</p>

<h2 id="the-code">The code</h2>

<p>I knew that this was going to involve a lot of brute force searching and copying of the board state, which meant I wanted to keep it simple and without allocations or other overhead (which isn’t needed for this solution). The main data structure looks like this:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>First, I have a 9x9 grid of squares, each one contains a 9-bit bitmask of possible digits that this square can contain (thus they are initialized to 9 ones, or <code>0x1FF</code>). I use a <code>uint16_t</code> because it’s the smallest type that fits 9 bits, the top 7 bits are unused). Some other solutions start off by using some abstract “set” data structure, which IMO seems like overkill. It seems fair to assume that most programmers will know (or can learn) how one might use a bit field to represent small sets, but it wouldn’t be hard to wrap that <code>uint16_t</code> in a struct with some set operations on it.</p>

<p>This is the main board state and once each of these bit masks have only one bit set, we are done and have a solution. Note that I assume all digits are zero-based for convenience (i.e. I subtract one when loading, and add one when printing).</p>

<p>Next, and here’s where my solution is a bit different from others I’ve seen, I maintain a “reverse index” for each digit. So for each digit in each “unit” (row, column or 3x3 block), it maintains a bit mask of where that digit is still a possibility. Initially each digit is possible in every location of the unit, so they too are initialized to <code>0x1FF</code>. Having this reverse index means I don’t have to search through all of the “peers” (i.e. squares in the same row, column or block) in order to elimiate a digit - I can directly find which squares need it eliminated. It also means I can easily figure out when a given digit only has one remaining possible location (see further below).</p>

<p>In order to copy this board state, a simple memcpy will do. There are no allocations, and this will all live on the stack during the search.</p>

<p>In a few places below I need to loop over all the set bits in one of these bit masks, so I have this simple macro for that.</p>
<div><div>

</div>
</div>
<p><code>_BitScanForward</code> just gives you the index of the least significant set bit (on MSVC, other compilers have similar intrinsics), and the magic bit fiddling clears the first set bit. Then it runs the loop <code>body</code> with the variable <code>bit_index</code> set to the index of the bit.</p>

<p>The meat of the algorithm is the <code>eliminate</code> method. It takes a location and a set of digits to eliminate and also propagates the contraints flowing from that elimination.</p>

<p>We also have to update the “reverse index”. To do this we loop through all the bits that we’re eliminating, and for each one we clear out the current coordinate in its bitmasks.</p>

<p>One slightly interesting thing to note here is that I’m intentionally keeping things very simple in terms of abstraction and complexity. I don’t make any attempt to abstract over the “units” or anything like that. Why? Because we only have three kinds of units, not twenty, so it really doesn’t buy you much. Yes, I’m kinda repeating myself three times here (and I will again below), but in return you get code that has fewer layers of abstractions for people to internalize and understand.</p>

<p>Plus, as I mentioned above I wanted to write this with performance in mind from the start. That means not introducing abstractions in the inner loop in order to avoid minor duplication. If two choices are approximately of equal value (each has pros an cons) and one of them is <em>likely</em> to be faster, then pick the likely-to-be-faster one. You still need to measure at some point to see if you were right, but you can often make decent guesses too. So let’s hold off on adding in abstractions until they buy us <em>a lot</em> more in terms of readability.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the code. At this stage the board state is updated with the elimination, and now we have to handle the consequences of the elimination.</p>

Scientists from the University of Houston and the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center have reported in <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-020-19678-w&amp;t=ZDc0MTkyOTdhYzNhMmMzM2FjZTQ4Y2I4YTAxNmI5NWM3YjhkZmJiZixOdXdPN2NXZA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F635077857917452288%2Fimaging-tech-25-nanometers-particles&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1605961727"><i>Nature Communications</i></a> a new optical imaging technology for nanoscale objects, relying upon unscattered light to detect nanoparticles as small as 25 nanometers in diameter.&nbsp;</p><p>The technology, known as PANORAMA, uses a glass slide covered with gold nanodiscs, allowing scientists to monitor changes in the transmission of light and determine the target’s characteristics.</p><p>PANORAMA takes its name from Plasmonic Nano-aperture Label-free Imaging (PlAsmonic NanO-apeRture lAbel-free iMAging), signifying the key characteristics of the technology. PANORAMA can be used to detect, count and determine the size of individual dielectric nanoparticles.</p><p>Wei-Chuan Shih, professor of electrical and computer engineering at UH and corresponding author for the paper, said the smallest transparent object a standard microscope can image is between 100 nanometers and 200 nanometers. &nbsp;That’s mainly because – in addition to being so small – they don’t reflect, absorb or “scatter” enough light, which could allow imaging systems to detect their presence.</p><p>Labeling is another commonly used technique; it requires researchers to know something about the particle they are studying – that a virus has a spike protein, for example – and engineer a way to tag that feature with fluorescent dye or some other method in order to more easily detect the particle.</p><p>“Otherwise, it will appear as invisible as a tiny dust particle under the microscope, because it’s too small to detect,” Shih said.</p><p>Another drawback? Labeling is only useful if researchers already know at least something about the particle they want to study.</p><p>“With PANORAMA, you don’t have to do the labeling,” Shih said. “You can view it directly because PANORAMA does not rely on detecting the scattered light from the nanoparticle.”</p><p>Instead, the system allows observers to detect a transparent target as small as 25 nanometers by monitoring light transmission through the gold nanodisc-covered glass slide. By monitoring changes in the light, they are able to detect the nearby nanoparticles. The optical imaging system is a standard bright-field microscope commonly found in any lab. There is no need for lasers or interferometers which are required in many other label-free imaging technologies.</p><p>“The size limit has not been reached, according to the data. We stopped at 25 nm nanoparticles simply because that is the smallest polystyrene nanoparticle on the market,” Shih said.</p><p>In addition to Shih, researchers involved in the project include Ph.D. students Nareg Ohannesian and Ibrahim Misbah, both with UH, and Dr. Steven H. Lin with the Department of Radiation Oncology at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center.</p><p>–</p><p><i>Header image:&nbsp;Scientists have reported a new optical imaging technology, using a glass side covered with gold nanodiscs that allows them to monitor changes in the transmission of light and determine the characteristics of nanoparticles as small as 25 nanometers in diameter.

<hr>



<p>Today, we’re excited to announce that Tecton is becoming a core contributor to the <a href="http://feast.dev/">Feast</a> open source feature store, and that Willem Pienaar, creator of Feast, is joining the Tecton team. In other words, we’re strong believers in the Feast project and are investing meaningful resources into its success. We share a joint vision with Willem: enable every organization to operationalize ML at scale by allowing teams to build and deploy features quickly and reliably.</p>



<p>If you’ve been following Tecton, you know that we’re also building our own commercial feature store that’s currently in early access and soon-to-become Generally Available. And this naturally raises a few questions: why invest in two feature stores, and what does this mean for both Feast and the Tecton feature store?</p>







<h2>Making Feature Stores Accessible to Every Organization</h2>



<p>We believe that feature stores are an essential part of the modern ML stack because they solve the hardest problem of productionizing operational ML: getting fresh feature data reliably computed and served into production. As discussed in <a href="https://www.tecton.ai/blog/what-is-a-feature-store/">“What is a Feature Store?”</a>, a feature store solves this problem by managing feature transformation pipelines, storing features, and serving features in production. The Tecton founding team saw the need for a feature store at Uber where we built the Michelangelo project. Similarly, other technology companies like Gojek also realized the importance of feature stores, leading to the development of Feast.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, feature stores have up to now been accessible only to the largest, most sophisticated technology companies that have the skills and resources to build their own infrastructure.</p>



<p>For the rest of the industry, this technology has remained mostly out of reach. Building your own feature store requires dedicated teams of highly skilled engineers and multiple years of development time. Our objective is to change this, and to put feature stores in reach of every organization, regardless of their ML maturity and available commercial resources.</p>







<h2>Freedom to Choose Between Open Source and Commercial Software</h2>



<p>We have seen strong demand for teams to enter the early access program we introduced earlier this year. We’ve partnered with customers ranging from small growth-stage startups to large Fortune 50 companies, across North America and Europe. We now have customers like <a href="https://2b838p24nks2163of0383y6z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Atlassian-Case-Study-201006.pdf">Atlassian</a> running at production scale on the Tecton enterprise feature store.</p>



<p>Along the way, we’ve learned that user needs vary significantly based on their level of maturity, size, and resources. Cloud services are preferred by larger teams that are operationalizing ML at scale and need to move fast, offload the burden of managing and updating software, and have guaranteed service levels with enterprise support. On the other hand, open source is highly valued by small ML teams that are just starting out and want to get their hands dirty, and by large organizations that need to customize the software to their specific needs and have the resources and skills to self-manage their ML infrastructure.</p>



<p>Our objective at Tecton is to solve the data problem for Operational ML for all organizations. The Tecton enterprise feature store is only available as a managed cloud service, leaving a gap for organizations that need open source software today. To close the gap, we decided to put significant resources behind Feast. Partnering with the Feast project, our plan is to leverage our existing development efforts in and learnings from Tecton to help make Feast the best open source feature store, both for small teams just starting out and for larger teams that need the flexibility of open source. As strong allies, we’re going to advance the state of the art for feature stores and enable their adoption across the industry.</p>







<h2>Feast: The Leading Open Source Feature Store</h2>



<p>Feast was developed jointly by Gojek and Google Cloud, and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/introducing-feast-an-open-source-feature-store-for-machine-learning">first announced</a> about two years ago. Since its initial release in 2019, Feast has grown rapidly, with multiple companies, including Microsoft, Agoda, Farfetch, Postmates and Zulily adopting and/or contributing to the project. Today, the project has more than 1,100 GitHub stars and has been adopted as a <a href="https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/feature-store/">component in Kubeflow</a>.</p>



<p>Willem and the Feast contributors have a clear <a href="https://blog.feast.dev/post/a-state-of-feast">vision</a> of where they want to take the project, and that vision is very well aligned with Tecton’s vision.</p>



<p>Feast will remain a completely independent project, <a href="https://lfaidata.foundation/blog/2020/11/10/feast-joins-lf-ai-data-as-new-incubation-project/">managed by the LF AI &amp; Data Foundation</a>. Willem will continue to be fully committed to Feast, and an official maintainer of the project. And of course, Feast continues to welcome new users and contributors.

<h2>Feast and Tecton: Deployment and Support</h2>



<p>Tecton and Feast’s differences are most notable on how they’re deployed and managed: Feast is fully open source and self-managed. Tecton is a fully-managed cloud service and can be deployed into a company’s private VPC, or into a Tecton-provided single-tenant SaaS environment. While Feast got started on GCP and Tecton got started on AWS, both will support GCP, AWS and Azure in 2021.</p>

<h2>Feast and Tecton: Capabilities</h2>



<p>Tecton and Feast have independent roots and were started by different companies. Tecton’s capability set is largely a superset of Feast’s, with a strong focus on fully-fledged transformation support and enterprise capabilities:</p>

<p>Beyond Feast’s capabilities, Tecton’s proprietary capabilities are going to focus on data governance, advanced collaboration and operational excellence.</p>

<h2>Offering a seamless migration between Tecton and Feast</h2>



<p>Often, the preferences between using a managed enterprise offering and a self-managed open source project change over time. An enterprise using Tecton’s managed offering may eventually require greater customizability and prefer to switch to a custom fork of Feast. Similarly, a small team that got started with Feast may eventually desire the enterprise capability and managed service of Tecton. To simplify transitions, Tecton is committed to providing a simple migration path between both projects. This migration path will eventually be enabled via:</p>



<ul><li><strong><strong>Feature Serving API Parity:</strong></strong> The feature serving APIs will be identical, allowing customers to switch between both feature stores without having to modify the feature store clients. Model training notebooks and prediction services running in production can remain largely unchanged as long as the client points at the new Feature Store backend.</li><li><strong><strong>Feature Definition Parity: </strong></strong>Tecton’s feature definition DSL will be a superset of Feast’s DSL. As a result, Feast feature definitions can seamlessly be applied to a Tecton deployment.</li><li><strong><strong>Feature Store Parity: </strong></strong>Tecton and Feast will support the same offline and online feature storage technologies (e.g. S3, Delta, DynamoDB, Redis etc.) and understand the same storage contract. As a result, no physical data will need to be migrated as customers choose to migrate between both projects.</li></ul>
